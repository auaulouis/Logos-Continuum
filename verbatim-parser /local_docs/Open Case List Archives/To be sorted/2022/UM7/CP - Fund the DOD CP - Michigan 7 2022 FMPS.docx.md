BUILD BACK BETTER?

Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell used to say, "Show me your
budget and I'll tell you your strategy." The Biden administration ' s
ability to produce a budget that funds its expansive strategy is a test
of its seriousness ---and it has been found wanting again. Congress had
to step in after Biden's first attempt last year, and his newly released
budget asks for \$773 billion, which doesn't even keep pace with
inflation.

Congress, by contrast, seems poised to raise the Defense Department' s
budget significantly. Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from
Washington and chair of the House Armed Services Committee, has said
that "the [Russian inva**sion of** Ukraine]{.underline} fundamentally
[altered]{.underline} what [our national security posture
and]{.underline} [what]{.underline} our defense [posture needs to
be]{.underline}." A [**strategy** that **accounts for**]{.underline}
Russian **[aggression]{.underline}** [in Europe will **necessitate**
more forces and **different**]{.underline} kinds of
**[weaponry]{.underline}** than one solely focused on China. The
[Pentagon]{.underline}'s own [accounting of]{.underline} its
[unfunded]{.underline} [needs]{.underline} from the last budget [amounts
to \$22 billion]{.underline}. [Addressing]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} deficit [would be a good place to start]{.underline}.

Restoring U.S. naval capabilities, which have stagnated in recent
decades, should be another major priority as the United States moves to
confront China. To start, policymakers should take up the Pentagon's
plan for a 500- ship navy and begin developing the industrial base
needed to build it. The Pacific is predominantly a maritime theater, and
Beijing's fleet now surpasses what Washington has to defend its
commitments in the region. Investing in shipbuilding could also provide
some much-needed substance to the Biden administration's concept of " a
foreign policy for the middle class " by creating more jobs at home.
Analysts estimate the cost of attaining a 500-ship navy at \$34 billion
per year for 30 years, totaling over \$1 trillion. Making this
investment will also result in a valuable expansion of the defense
industrial base---the companies that build U.S. weapons and military
systems.

The United States needs to expand the U.S. military to match
Washington's existing claims. The current [U.S. military is sized to
fight]{.underline} **[only a single war]{.underline}**, as the conflicts
in Iraq and Afghanistan revealed. [Aligning strategy]{.underline} [with
reality]{.underline} [should]{.underline} therefore [be the focus
of]{.underline} the [defense planning process from start to
finish]{.underline}. The [price]{.underline} tag [will be
high:]{.underline} personnel costs for the current force comprise about
25 percent of the Defense Department' s base budget. [A force **capable
of fighting two wars** would need]{.underline} roughly
**[double]{.underline}** the **[current]{.underline} [number
of]{.underline}** 1.3 million **[service members]{.underline}**, at a
cost of about \$160 billion per year.

The Defense Department also needs to adequately fund the construction
and maintenance of military facilities and equipment, as the Pentagon
tends to underfund or defer these problems when budgets are tight. The
current figure for the maintenance and construction backlog is in the
neighborhood of \$140 billion. These delays have real consequences,
including reducing the availability of important equipment and
facilities. Navy dry docks, for instance, are more than 100 years old
and in short supply (only one can hold a Ford-class aircraft carrier).
As a result, U.S. shipyards are limited in how well they can service the
fleet. U.S. forces are already too small for the existing strategy;
Washington only limits them further by underfunding such logistical
operations.

Finally, [policymakers **need to reckon with**]{.underline} the
[**impending** wave of]{.underline} decisions about the
[**modernization** of existing weapons systems]{.underline}. The
majority of [conventional and nuclear weapons systems]{.underline} are
[approaching]{.underline} the [end of their]{.underline} [service
lives]{.underline}, even with extension programs that stretched their
use well beyond their original retirement date. Many **[old systems
are]{.underline}** also **[bumping up against technological]{.underline}
[upgrades]{.underline}** designed [**to keep** them **functional and
interoperable**]{.underline} with newer platforms. In 2016, defense
analyst Todd Harrison estimated the total [cost of **developing new
systems**]{.underline} to replace the old ones [at \$**130 billion
across five years**]{.underline}. That number has only ballooned since
then.

#### Funding solves\-\--invest for a tech surprise!

**Sayler 22** (Kelley M. Sayler, Analyst in Advanced Technology and
Global Security, 4-6-2022, "Emerging Military Technologies: Background
and Issues for Congress", Congressional Research Service, accessed

**[Funding]{.underline}** Considerations

A number of [**emerging** military **technologies**]{.underline},
including hypersonic weapons and directed energy weapons, have
[experienced fluctuations in funding]{.underline} over the years.
According to a U.S. government interagency task force on the defense
industrial base, such "**[fluctuations challenge]{.underline}** the
[viability of **suppliers**]{.underline} within the industrial base by
[**diminishing** their ability to hire and retain a **skilled
workforce**]{.underline}, \[[achieve\] **production**]{.underline}
**[efficiencies]{.underline}**, and in some cases, \[stay\] in
business." 174 Other analysts have noted that such fluctuations are
[often due to]{.underline} unavoidable [tradeoffs between technology
investment priorities]{.underline} or to questions about a given
technology's feasibility or maturity.175

Some analysts have suggested that, [given the potential for
technological surprise, **funding**]{.underline} for overall research
and development **[is inadequate]{.underline}**. Summarizing such views,
[technology expert Martijn Rasser]{.underline} notes that [reducing
overall]{.underline} research and [development]{.underline} in order to
enable "big bets" or heavy investments in a particular technology or
technologies, [can be]{.underline} a [risky]{.underline} approach
[because "we just don't know where]{.underline} the [next breakthroughs
will come from]{.underline}." 176

#### Funding solves\-\--ai specific ☺ 

\-\--upon reflection, not the vibe

4-9-2021, "Artificial Intelligence Key to Maintaining Military, Economic
Advantages, Leaders Say", U.S. Department of Defense, accessed

[Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael S. Groen]{.underline}, [director
of]{.underline} the [Joint Artificial Intelligence Center]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [Robert O. Work]{.underline}, [vice chair of
the]{.underline} [NSCAI]{.underline}, [spoke]{.underline} to reporters
[at the Pentagon]{.underline}.

Work provided an overview of the report:

The [United States]{.underline} [does not have]{.underline} a strategy,
organizational structure and [resources to win]{.underline} the
[competition with China for effective]{.underline} [implementation of
AI]{.underline}, he said.

\"So the first thing is we have got to do is to take this competition
seriously, and we need to win it.\"

[To win, AI must receive]{.underline} the [necessary
funding]{.underline}, at least [3.4% of the DOD budget]{.underline}.
Those [funds should]{.underline} then [be channeled into]{.underline}
[priority areas as recommended by a]{.underline} steering
[committee]{.underline} consisting of the deputy defense secretary, the
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the principal director of
national intelligence, he said, noting that a good first step was having
the JAIC report directly to the deputy defense secretary.

That steering [committee would]{.underline} also [remove]{.underline}
any [bureaucratic obstacles]{.underline} [and]{.underline} would
[oversee]{.underline} the [development of a technology]{.underline}
[annex]{.underline} to the [National Defense
Strategy](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/National-Defense-Strategy/),
Work said. 

Also the [department should set AI readiness performance goals
by]{.underline} the [end of]{.underline} this [fiscal year]{.underline},
with an eye toward AI-ready implementation by 2025, he said.

Work noted that the U.S. is still the world leader in AI, but China is
structured to rapidly advance with its strong government support to
academia, the private sector and People\'s Liberation Army.

Identifying the right talent for AI, ensuring AI is used in an ethically
responsible manner and forming international partnerships are other
ingredients for successful AI implementation, Work said.

Groen said the [department agrees with the report]{.underline} and is
already implementing about 100 of recommendations that were given. Other
recommendations would be included in feasibility studies.

\"AI as a core tenet of defense modernization,\" Groen said. [AI efforts
will be fundamental to achieving quality networks]{.underline} and data
services [in a secure manner]{.underline}.

\"We\'ve created positive momentum for AI, and we continue to build on
that now. But now comes the real critical test in any transformation.
The hardest part is institutional change and change management of the
workforce and practices and processes that drive a business. This step
will not be easy, even within the Department of Defense, but it\'s
foundational to our competitive success, our accountability and our
affordability,\" he said. \"We have a generational opportunity here for
AI to be our future. We must act now. We need to start putting these
pieces into place now.\"

AI isn\'t just important for the DOD\'s warfighting capabilities, it
will also be a powerful driver of the American economy, Groen said.

#### Only funding solves modernization

While Pentagon leaders are busy [rejecting proposed additional funds
from
Congress](https://insidedefense.com/daily-news/hicks-wants-congress-avoid-budget-boosts-diverge-dods-plans) to
meet ongoing requirements, politicians are dusting off their pocket
constitutions to remind them [who gets the last
word](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/) on
appropriations.

Since release of the fiscal year (FY) 2023 defense budget request,
rising inflation has remained front and center for Congress. [Department
of Defense (DoD) leaders were
unclear](https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-rogers-press-biden-administration-to-clarify-effects-of-inflation-on-pentagon-budget) under
questioning about what their inflation estimates for 2022, 2023, and the
five-year projections are. Even without exact forecasts, it was and is
clear that the White
House's [[budget](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/is-joe-bidens-new-us-navy-budget-illegal/) of
\$773 billion for the US military does not provide the
growth]{.underline} above inflation necessary [to simultaneously keep
pace with rising personnel costs, [modernization
priorities](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/03/ngad-the-6th-generation-stealth-fighter-that-could-change-everything/),
and general warfighting readiness]{.underline}.

With the request now in Congress's hands, the question is, [how
much](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/why-joe-bidens-defense-budget-is-russia-and-chinas-dream-come-true/) does
the Pentagon actually need?

The answer: around \$846 billion for 2023.

A more [realistic defense topline accounts for [genuine
inflation](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/04/inflation-new-sequestration/363879/)]{.underline},
[fully resources]{.underline} the [Unfunded
Priorities](https://rollcall.com/2022/04/18/new-requests-bring-militarys-unfunded-priorities-above-21-billion/) of
the [armed forces and combatant commands, and
provides]{.underline} [three percent [real
growth]{.underline}](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf)[ to
meet rising security challenges]{.underline} and put a down payment on
the national defense strategy.

Let's do the math.

In [a
response](https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/0502.22dodresponsetoinhoferogersinflationletter.pdf) to
Senate and House Armed Services Committee Ranking Members Sen. Jim
Inhofe (R-OK) and Rep. Mike Rogers' (R-AL) inquiry for transparency
about inflation estimates, defense comptroller Mike McCord and the
service secretaries responded. They stated that the
[Defense]{.underline} [Department prefers to use]{.underline} the Gross
Domestic Product chain-type price index ([GDP-PI) for budget
building]{.underline}, which they estimated to be 3.9 percent. While
[most Americans are likely familiar with]{.underline} the Consumer Price
Index ([CPI]{.underline}) inflation rate, defense officials stated that
it is "less useful for DoD since it measures changes in prices for
consumer goods for a market basket of consumer goods and services."
Ironic, given that troops, their families and even the Pentagon itself
are consumers buying various goods and services.

Both price indexes have increased radically over the past fiscal year,
with the most recent estimates hitting [8.0 percent for
GDP-PI](https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/gdp-price-index) and [8.3
percent for CPI](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm).
[Secretary of Defense]{.underline} Lloyd Austin [requested]{.underline}
and the White House allowed an [additional [\$20
billion](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3012264/dod-uses-chain-weighted-consumer-price-index-to-account-for-inflation/) to
account for high inflation in 2023]{.underline}. The "extra" sums
[account for the \$18 billion difference between 2.2 percent inflation
that the Pentagon typically projects and the 3.9 percent assumed in this
budget]{.underline}. But [what about the open wound between 3.9
percent]{.underline} and [[the very real---and growing---inflation rates
today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/11/inflation-biden-wishful-thinking/) that
leave the defense budget bleeding out?]{.underline}

Since defense officials claim the GDP-PI "reflects the types of
purchases the Department makes---large end items and contracted
services," Congress may use GDP-PI---but with a more accurate and
realistic estimate. The [GDP-PI Q2-2021 to Q1-2022 inflation
average](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&1921=survey&1903=11#reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&1921=survey&1903=11) is
6.8 percent. If there is any signal as to how far off-base the
administration's 3.9 percent estimate was, it is that the GDP-PI index
has not been below 4.3 percent since 2020.

The 6.8% average estimate includes anywhere from five to 8 percent
inflation over the four quarters, and still anticipates a gradual relief
from today's pressure over the next fiscal year. It is generously low,
too, compared to "itemized" inflation rates for products like gasoline,
which sits at [44 percent as of May 11,
2022](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), especially when
taking into consideration that the military is one of the world's
largest gasoline and fuel users.

The deflated \$773 billion defense budget request---meaning stripped of
the 3.9 percent inflation adjustment so there is not inflation "double
dipping"---is \$743 billion. Adding the more reasonable 6.8 percent
inflation calculation to the deflated budget brings defense funding
needs to \$793 billion for next year.

However, defense officials said themselves that GDP-PI reflects "large
end items," while CPI is more accurate for average consumer goods.
Troops and their families don't live in supply chain vacuums as some
weapons systems might with long lead purchases and select prices locked
in years ago. This means uniformed personnel are confronting 9.4 percent
inflation on food at home, 13.7 percent on housing energy, 5 percent on
shelter, and the 44 percent previously mentioned on gas, just like the
rest of us. So rather than using GDP-PI for Military Personnel costs
(which include salaries and healthcare) that would restrict their buying
power for daily life purchases, CPI would be more appropriate. Using a
more honest 7.46 percent CPI estimate (the FY22 average so far) for
military personnel raises the topline to \$794.5 billion needed next
year.

In addition to supplying inflation-adjusted requested funds, [Congress
will want]{.underline} to consider adding back the many [programs that
did not make it into the president's defense budget
request.]{.underline} Each year the armed forces and combatant commands
submit Unfunded Priorities Lists (UPLs) that identify programs and
mission requirements "[intended to support strategic
objectives](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11964.pdf)" that the White
House chooses not to include. In other words, what the military needs
and would spend money on to meet ongoing requirements if they received
additional appropriations. For FY 2023, these requests total about
\$27.2 billion and by all accounts are for necessary requirements and
not superfluous nice-to-have extras.

[With]{.underline} the US [military advantages gradually eroding in
light of [China's military
expansion](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/05/chinas-j-20-stealth-fighter-an-f-35-killer-or-paper-tiger/) and
rapid innovation]{.underline}, [the United States cannot accept
declining combat power at a time of heightened]{.underline} risk to buy
the promise [of future technologies]{.underline}. Fully resourcing the
services' unfunded priorities brings the total needed defense budget for
2023 to \$821.6 billion.

While the budget increases with the above inflation and unfunded
adjustments, it still does not grow. A defense budget of \$821.6 billion
in 2023 provides zero real growth; meanwhile military
missions---and [bills for those
missions](https://insidedefense.com/daily-news/dod-details-3b-proposal-deal-climate-change)---continue
to expand under this administration.

[To enable]{.underline} the military to tackle its [modernization
priorities]{.underline} and sustain conventional deterrence over the
medium-term, [[real budget growth is
necessary]{.underline}](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf).
[Military leaders]{.underline} have [[long called for three to five
percent annual real
growth](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2017/06/13/dod-needs-3-5-percent-annual-growth-through-2023-top-officials-say/) to
invest smartly in the]{.underline} defense strategy. The topline
recommended in this analysis is the minimum to "maintain America's
military capabilities" at 3 percent real growth, totaling \$846.3
billion for the next fiscal year.

[Funding the military]{.underline} is neither an easy nor inexpensive
undertaking, but the security of American citizens and the safeguarding
of our national interests demand that Congress do so adequately. The
president's 2023 defense budget request failed to tackle inflation,
provide for any modest real growth above inflation, or meet [the full
needs of the armed forces]{.underline}. \$846 billion in FY 2023 is a
more realistic down payment on matching defense investments against
national security threats and should be the starting point as Congress
builds a more accurate defense budget.

#### Funding's key to readiness 

**Eaglen 5/23** (Mackenzie Eaglen, senior fellow at the American
Enterprise and former on the congressionally mandated National Defense
Strategy Commission, 5-23-2022, "The US defense budget's latest casualty

America's military leaders state time and again that China's forcible
assault on Taiwan, and therefore our response to it, is a near-term
challenge . Given the lengthy time to plan,
program, [build](https://cimsec.org/20-years-of-naval-trends-guarantee-a-fy23-shipbuilding-plan-failure/) and
field credible combat power, [a 2027
problem](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/asia/us-pacific-commander-china-threat-intl-hnk-ml/index.html) is
really one of today. Alarm bells should be ringing in Congress as the
president's latest defense budget cuts readiness.

Given that [ongoing support for Ukraine]{.underline} is
[straining]{.underline} some key U.S. [military supplies and
munitions]{.underline}, everyone should be concerned the China fight
would [demand even
more](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf) and
faster. As this Pentagon team is [plagued with "next
war-itis"](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/05/four-lessons-should-upend-pentagons-five-year-strategy/366695/) by [overly
biasing research and development
dollars](https://www.aei.org/foreign-and-defense-policy/defense-budget-masquerades-as-generous-while-shrinking-the-armed-forces/) to
prepare for future wars over [purchasing from hot production lines
today](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/03/10/the-pentagon-must-pay-for-competition/),
the result is the erosion of our few remaining competitive advantages.

For fiscal 2023, the administration requested \$119.4 billion in
readiness compared to the fiscal 2022 request of \$109 billion. The
[9.84% increase is a decrease in real terms]{.underline}. To simply
match 2019 (pre-pandemic) purchasing power under the 2.2% inflationary
estimates that the Pentagon and White House are using to tout a "record"
budget, the military would need to invest \$133.84 billion. That still
would only be a flat budget under today's inflation.

[The Army, Navy and Air Force]{.underline} are [confronting a \$26
billion gap between what]{.underline} the [budget]{.underline} request
[provides them once adjusted for inflation and the levels of funding
they would need to maintain buying power at 2019 levels.]{.underline}

In 2013, similar across-the-board cuts came in the form of
sequestration, or a self-imposed spending freeze that disproportionately
harmed the military due to inaction by politicians on debt reduction.
Uniformed [leaders **[described the abrupt
cuts](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/694480/sequestration-poses-biggest-threat-to-readiness-military-leaders-say/) as
the "biggest challenge to the military's readiness**]{.underline}**.**"
The [result is]{.underline} not "tough but necessary choices," but
rather destructive
early [decommissionings](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2022/04/04/us-navy-reveals-ships-facing-potential-decommissioning-next-year/) and [retirements](https://www.aei.org/foreign-and-defense-policy/1008625364/),
along with [extended
deployments](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2021/07/18/eisenhower-returns-to-norfolk-after-double-pump-deployment/) and [unsafe
work
environments](https://www.businessinsider.com/american-military-bases-are-slowly-falling-apart-2021-8) for
tro[ops]{.underline}.

The [administration]{.underline} is shooting itself in the foot by [not
sustaining the readiness of]{.underline} the very [systems they seek to
modernize]{.underline}. By overusing systems and facilities without
adequate maintenance, they [won't be prepared for modernization
upgrades]{.underline} once they become available. In other words,
**[lack of sustainment delays innovation implementation]{.underline}**.

For example, the latest budget request only funds weapon systems
sustainment for the Air Force at 85% of requirements. Over the past four
years, weapon sustainment dollars have fallen and been unable to match
2019 levels.

(American Enterprise Institute)

To advance future capabilities that provide for long-term readiness, the
[armed services need well-trained, knowledgeable warfighters who **have
the capacity to integrate modernized systems into sustained
arsenals**]{.underline}. Instead, the budget's reductions come at a
point when the operational tempo of the force continues to increase as
capacity investments are falling.

The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office [clearly stated in a
report just last year](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-279.pdf) that
"[nearly 2 decades of conflict has degraded military
readiness]{.underline} at a time [when]{.underline} the [National
Defense Strategy calls for preparedness for great-power
competition]{.underline}." The administration [offers an
NDS](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/28/2002964702/-1/-1/1/NDS-FACT-SHEET.PDF) that
maintains this call while producing a budget that further degrades U.S.
armed forces by ignoring the realities Pentagon leadership seems
to [acknowledge](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2845661/china-remains-pacing-challenge-for-us-pentagon-press-secretary-says/):
U.S. competition with China.

At the same time, as readiness and sustainment are tanking, [Pentagon
reports](https://www.defensenews.com/news/pentagon-congress/2021/11/03/chinas-march-toward-a-world-class-military-and-how-it-threatens-taiwan/) that
assess [the People's Liberation Army's and Navy's
strengths](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2022/05/16/satellite-photos-show-possible-new-chinese-nuclear-submarine-able-to-launch-cruise-missiles/) have
confirmed China developed and holds the world's largest naval force,
many of the most advanced missile systems, and more troops than the U.S.
in order to harness them.

Considering we are crushed by ship and troop count, the remaining
American advantage to Chinese defense forces is the credibility and
capability of our service members and their weapons systems. American
warfighters are the most well-trained and battle-tested individuals on
the globe. For Air Force pilots alone, U.S. forces averaged 2.5 times
the number of flight training hours per year than their Chinese
counterparts. Unfortunately, the Biden administration's budget proposal
fails to fully consider this advantage.

Declining readiness means decreased training. To hone in on the Air
Force pilot advantage specifically, this ratio is rapidly leveling.
Required flight training hours --- which keep airmen prepared and ready
for battle --- have continuously declined over the past five fiscal
years. In FY19, the Air Force averaged 1.45 million hours of in-flight
training in their respective aircraft; today, training is nearly 25%
less, with 1.12 million hours requested in President Joe Biden's FY23
request. This request slashes 24,000 hours in just one year.

(American Enterprise Institute)

Two years ago, [then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper
said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2384489/secretary-esper-discusses-readiness-and-modernization-at-the-heritage-foundation/):
"The bottom line is that each part of the readiness life cycle is vital
to preparing and enabling our men and women in uniform to successfully
execute their mission. The question we must answer is this: if called
upon to fight tonight, are we ready?" His answer in 2020 was "yes."
Under proposed FY23 readiness levels, which fail to stem the downward
trend, the answer could soon become "no."

So what does Congress need to do to change the tide? [Invest \$142.4
billion in readiness for FY23]{.underline} --- a figure that [adjusts
for realistic inflation rates and adds 3% real growth]{.underline} that
would allow the services to make small steps toward resurging readiness
levels. Targeted investments should include pursuing restored Air Force
flight training and the maintenance of the aircraft themselves, reducing
the growing forward-fleet operations tempo in order to sustain readiness

#### More funds for ai and cyber PLEASE!

Since Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, the United States,
and other nations, have been helping the Ukrainians resist by sending
them billions of dollars of military equipment. 

I have supported these efforts and am open to sending even more. While
we as a country have stood up and led on this issue, I feel in many
respects, since the end of the Cold War, we've gone adrift. This current
crisis in Europe has shed an even bigger light on our own military
shortcomings. 

[We are woefully unprepared to take on **China and Russia**]{.underline}
head-to-head. [Both]{.underline} have been [heavily **investing in new
technologies and** capabilities]{.underline} to achieve their particular
goals. While Russia is struggling in Ukraine, they still have a massive
stockpile of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons and advanced
delivery systems.  Meanwhile, here [in America we have]{.underline} just
[been]{.underline} pushing the status quo and [trying to play
catchup]{.underline}, [i.e. hypersonic weapons]{.underline}. 

While I certainly hope we never have to become involved in a war with
either, [military war games show us performing
badly](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-apparently-gets-its-ass-handed-to-it-in-war-games-2019-3),
and in some scenarios, downright losing. 

It doesn't help that America showed weakness with [President
Obama's ](https://thehill.com/people/barack-obama/)"red line" in Syria,
offered no significant push-back to Russia's annexation of Crimea, and
President [Biden ](https://thehill.com/people/biden/)hastily evacuated
Afghanistan in a humiliating fashion. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping were
watching closely.   

We have time to correct these shortcomings, but it's later than we
think. 

As a member of the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, I am
[**calling for a dramatic** increase in our **defense**
budget]{.underline}. It's time. Our [current spending is just over [3
percent of our Gross Domestic
Product](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217581/outlays-for-defense-and-forecast-in-the-us-as-a-percentage-of-the-gdp/#:~:text=The%20statistic%20represents%20the%20U.S.,percent%20of%20the%20U.S.%20GDP.)]{.underline}. Our
current spending of almost eight hundred billion a year on defense is
[not even close to meet]{.underline} the [challenges]{.underline} we
have coming at us [from China and Russia, North Korea and
Iran. ]{.underline}

Since the end of the Cold War, we have averaged around 4.4 percent of
our GDP on defense spending. During the Cold War, it was closer to 8
percent.   

I believe we are facing even greater challenges now than during the Cold
War.  This [difference between our current 3 percent of GDP and our
average of 4.4 percent of GDP is]{.underline} what I call our "[Security
Gap]{.underline}."   

This "[**Security Gap**" is keeping us from maintaining our leadership
role]{.underline}. This "Security Gap" is [**keeping us from**
**staying** at least a **generation ahead of** our **foes in**
**technology**]{.underline}, let alone keep up with them. 

This "Security Gap" is keeping us from paying our men and women in
uniform wages that compete better with the private sector.   

This "[Security Gap" is **keeping us from modernizing**]{.underline} our
nuclear [forces]{.underline}. It is keeping us from building the naval
resources we need to stay ahead of China. [It is keeping us from
accelerating our missile defense technologies, and from accelerating our
offensive and defensive capacities in cyberwarfare.   ]{.underline}

Peace through Strength should once again be our focus. More than 100
years ago [Theodore
Roosevelt ](https://thehill.com/people/theodore-roosevelt/)understood
this when he said speak softly but carry a big stick. [We must ensure
that our military is the most powerful and most capable on the planet by
**leveraging our technological capabilities**. ]{.underline}

We [must]{.underline} not only [fund]{.underline} and accelerate
development of new technologies such as hypersonics, [advanced lasers,
advanced missile defenses, smarter drones, etc]{.underline}., we must
also increase our production of conventional weapons. At the end of the
Cold War, we had \$21 billion worth of weapons in our inventory. Today,
that amount is down below one billion. We already have shortfalls in key
conventional systems needed for Ukraine, and we are at [least a year
behind in fulfilling weapons deliveries to
Taiwan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/05/03/taiwan-ukraine-howitzers-paladins-weapons/). 

The [United States must **work towards**]{.underline} the [**domination
of**]{.underline} warfighting domains such as space, **[cyber and
artificial intelligence]{.underline}**. This includes fully funding
Space Command and making sure we dominate in space. Space Command and
Space Force are some of the greatest ways for us to achieve new levels
of superiority over the Chinese and Russians. 

[We]{.underline} also [have not spent nearly enough money on U.S.
**Cyber** Command]{.underline}. Their [main mission has been to counter
cyber threats to the homeland. But their **capabilities** to launch
offensive operations have been **woefully
underfunded**]{.underline}. Our [cyber capabilities must remain the most
robust in the world with]{.underline} a myriad of [options for our cyber
commanders to deal with any threat, anywhere. ]{.underline}

We must also begin to strengthen our old alliances like NATO and to
continue to make new ones in Southeast Asia. China is working
relentlessly to build new alliances around the world, in particular the
continent of Africa.  The Chinese have [invested billions of dollars in
infrastructure in African
nations](https://qz.com/africa/2125769/china-has-invested-23-billion-in-africas-infrastructure/). 

If America creates leadership vacuums, the Chinese will be more than
happy to fill them.   

As long as I'm in Congress I will be fighting to ensure America has the
military might to thwart any and all attempts to weaken this great
nation. 

We are talking about a significant, but necessary amount of money. I
envision by 2026 our defense budget should be closer to \$1.1 trillion,
instead of the current presidential request for \$773 billion.   

In the past, when our nation has come under attack, whether it was Sept.
11 or Pearl Harbor, we have all immediately rallied to stand up and
defend this nation.  But on both occasions, we found ourselves ill
prepared, which left us vulnerable to attack in the first place. 

In the 1970 film about the Pearl Harbor attack called "Tora Tora Tora,"
one of the Japanese generals, in referring to the United States, is
depicted as saying, "I'm afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant." 

Well, 80 years later, the world has become far too dangerous for us to
ever be caught sleeping again.

### Solves - Modernization

#### Only funding solves modernization

While Pentagon leaders are busy [rejecting proposed additional funds
from
Congress](https://insidedefense.com/daily-news/hicks-wants-congress-avoid-budget-boosts-diverge-dods-plans) to
meet ongoing requirements, politicians are dusting off their pocket
constitutions to remind them [who gets the last
word](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/) on
appropriations.

Since release of the fiscal year (FY) 2023 defense budget request,
rising inflation has remained front and center for Congress. [Department
of Defense (DoD) leaders were
unclear](https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/inhofe-rogers-press-biden-administration-to-clarify-effects-of-inflation-on-pentagon-budget) under
questioning about what their inflation estimates for 2022, 2023, and the
five-year projections are. Even without exact forecasts, it was and is
clear that the White
House's [[**budget**](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/is-joe-bidens-new-us-navy-budget-illegal/) of
\$773 billion for the US military **does not provide the
growth**]{.underline} above inflation necessary [**to** simultaneously
**keep pace with rising personnel costs, [modernization
priorities](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/03/ngad-the-6th-generation-stealth-fighter-that-could-change-everything/),
and** general warfighting **readiness**]{.underline}.

With the request now in Congress's hands, the question is, [how
much](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/why-joe-bidens-defense-budget-is-russia-and-chinas-dream-come-true/) does
the Pentagon actually need?

The answer: around \$846 billion for 2023.

A more [**realistic defense** topline accounts for [genuine
inflation](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/04/inflation-new-sequestration/363879/)]{.underline},
[fully resources]{.underline} the [Unfunded
Priorities](https://rollcall.com/2022/04/18/new-requests-bring-militarys-unfunded-priorities-above-21-billion/) of
the [armed forces and combatant commands, and
provides]{.underline} [three percent [real
**growth**]{.underline}](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf)[ **to
meet rising** security **challenges**]{.underline} and put a down
payment on the national defense strategy.

Let's do the math.

In [a
response](https://www.inhofe.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/0502.22dodresponsetoinhoferogersinflationletter.pdf) to
Senate and House Armed Services Committee Ranking Members Sen. Jim
Inhofe (R-OK) and Rep. Mike Rogers' (R-AL) inquiry for transparency
about inflation estimates, defense comptroller Mike McCord and the
service secretaries responded. They stated that the
[Defense]{.underline} [Department prefers to use]{.underline} the Gross
Domestic Product chain-type price index ([GDP-PI) for budget
building]{.underline}, which they estimated to be 3.9 percent. While
[most Americans are likely familiar with]{.underline} the Consumer Price
Index ([CPI]{.underline}) inflation rate, defense officials stated that
it is "less useful for DoD since it measures changes in prices for
consumer goods for a market basket of consumer goods and services."
Ironic, given that troops, their families and even the Pentagon itself
are consumers buying various goods and services.

Both price indexes have increased radically over the past fiscal year,
with the most recent estimates hitting [8.0 percent for
GDP-PI](https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/gdp-price-index) and [8.3
percent for CPI](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm).
[Secretary of Defense]{.underline} Lloyd Austin [requested]{.underline}
and the White House allowed an [additional [\$20
billion](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3012264/dod-uses-chain-weighted-consumer-price-index-to-account-for-inflation/) to
account for high inflation in 2023]{.underline}. The "extra" sums
[account for the \$18 billion difference between 2.2 percent inflation
that the Pentagon typically projects and the 3.9 percent assumed in this
budget]{.underline}. But [what about the open wound between 3.9
percent]{.underline} and [[the very real---and growing---inflation rates
today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/11/inflation-biden-wishful-thinking/) that
leave the defense budget bleeding out?]{.underline}

Since defense officials claim the GDP-PI "reflects the types of
purchases the Department makes---large end items and contracted
services," Congress may use GDP-PI---but with a more accurate and
realistic estimate. The [GDP-PI Q2-2021 to Q1-2022 inflation
average](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&1921=survey&1903=11#reqid=19&step=3&isuri=1&1921=survey&1903=11) is
6.8 percent. If there is any signal as to how far off-base the
administration's 3.9 percent estimate was, it is that the GDP-PI index
has not been below 4.3 percent since 2020.

The 6.8% average estimate includes anywhere from five to 8 percent
inflation over the four quarters, and still anticipates a gradual relief
from today's pressure over the next fiscal year. It is generously low,
too, compared to "itemized" inflation rates for products like gasoline,
which sits at [44 percent as of May 11,
2022](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm), especially when
taking into consideration that the military is one of the world's
largest gasoline and fuel users.

The deflated \$773 billion defense budget request---meaning stripped of
the 3.9 percent inflation adjustment so there is not inflation "double
dipping"---is \$743 billion. Adding the more reasonable 6.8 percent
inflation calculation to the deflated budget brings defense funding
needs to \$793 billion for next year.

However, defense officials said themselves that GDP-PI reflects "large
end items," while CPI is more accurate for average consumer goods.
Troops and their families don't live in supply chain vacuums as some
weapons systems might with long lead purchases and select prices locked
in years ago. This means uniformed personnel are confronting 9.4 percent
inflation on food at home, 13.7 percent on housing energy, 5 percent on
shelter, and the 44 percent previously mentioned on gas, just like the
rest of us. So rather than using GDP-PI for Military Personnel costs
(which include salaries and healthcare) that would restrict their buying
power for daily life purchases, CPI would be more appropriate. Using a
more honest 7.46 percent CPI estimate (the FY22 average so far) for
military personnel raises the topline to \$794.5 billion needed next
year.

In addition to supplying inflation-adjusted requested funds, [Congress
will want]{.underline} to consider adding back the many [programs that
did not make it into the president's defense budget
request.]{.underline} Each year the armed forces and combatant commands
submit Unfunded Priorities Lists (UPLs) that identify programs and
mission requirements "[intended to support strategic
objectives](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11964.pdf)" that the White
House chooses not to include. In other words, what the military needs
and would spend money on to meet ongoing requirements if they received
additional appropriations. For FY 2023, these requests total about
\$27.2 billion and by all accounts are for necessary requirements and
not superfluous nice-to-have extras.

[With]{.underline} the US [**military advantages gradually eroding** in
light of [China's military
expansion](https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/05/chinas-j-20-stealth-fighter-an-f-35-killer-or-paper-tiger/) and
rapid innovation]{.underline}, [the **United States cannot accept
declining** combat **power** at a time of **heightened**]{.underline}
risk to buy the promise **[of future technologies]{.underline}**. Fully
resourcing the services' unfunded priorities brings the total needed
defense budget for 2023 to \$821.6 billion.

While the budget increases with the above inflation and unfunded
adjustments, it still does not grow. A defense budget of \$821.6 billion
in 2023 provides zero real growth; meanwhile military
missions---and [bills for those
missions](https://insidedefense.com/daily-news/dod-details-3b-proposal-deal-climate-change)---continue
to expand under this administration.

**[To enable]{.underline}** the military to tackle its
[**modernization** priorities]{.underline} and sustain conventional
deterrence over the medium-term, **[[real budget growth is
necessary]{.underline}](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-11/providing-for-the-common-defense.pdf).**
[Military leaders]{.underline} have [[long called for three to five
percent annual real
growth](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2017/06/13/dod-needs-3-5-percent-annual-growth-through-2023-top-officials-say/) to
invest smartly in the]{.underline} defense strategy. The topline
recommended in this analysis is the minimum to "maintain America's
military capabilities" at 3 percent real growth, totaling \$846.3
billion for the next fiscal year.

**[Funding the military]{.underline}** is neither an easy nor
inexpensive undertaking, but the security of American citizens and the
safeguarding of our national interests demand that Congress do so
adequately. The president's 2023 defense budget request failed to tackle
inflation, provide for any modest real growth above inflation, or meet
[the full needs of the armed forces]{.underline}. \$846 billion in FY
2023 is a more realistic down payment on matching defense investments
against national security threats and should be the starting point as
Congress builds a more accurate defense budget.

### Solves -- Emerging Tech

#### Funding solves\-\--invest for a tech surprise!

**Sayler 22** (Kelley M. Sayler, Analyst in Advanced Technology and
Global Security, 4-6-2022, "Emerging Military Technologies: Background
and Issues for Congress", Congressional Research Service, accessed
6-22-2022, <https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R46458.pdf> )//kpt

**[Funding]{.underline}** Considerations

A number of [**emerging** military **technologies**]{.underline},
including hypersonic weapons and directed energy weapons, have
[experienced fluctuations in funding]{.underline} over the years.
According to a U.S. government interagency task force on the defense
industrial base, such "**[fluctuations challenge]{.underline}** the
[viability of **suppliers**]{.underline} within the industrial base by
[**diminishing** their ability to hire and retain a **skilled
workforce**]{.underline}, \[[achieve\] **production**]{.underline}
**[efficiencies]{.underline}**, and in some cases, \[stay\] in
business." 174 Other analysts have noted that such fluctuations are
[often due to]{.underline} unavoidable [tradeoffs between technology
investment priorities]{.underline} or to questions about a given
technology's feasibility or maturity.175

Some analysts have suggested that, [given the potential for
technological surprise, **funding**]{.underline} for overall research
and development **[is inadequate]{.underline}**. Summarizing such views,
[technology expert Martijn Rasser]{.underline} notes that [reducing
overall]{.underline} research and [development]{.underline} in order to
enable "big bets" or heavy investments in a particular technology or
technologies, [can be]{.underline} a [risky]{.underline} approach
[because "we just don't know where]{.underline} the [next breakthroughs
will come from]{.underline}." 176

### Solves - AI

[Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Michael S. Groen]{.underline}, [director
of]{.underline} the [Joint Artificial Intelligence Center]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [Robert O. Work]{.underline}, [vice chair of
the]{.underline} [NSCAI]{.underline}, [spoke]{.underline} to reporters
[at the Pentagon]{.underline}.

Work provided an overview of the report:

The [United States]{.underline} [does not have]{.underline} a strategy,
organizational structure and [resources to win]{.underline} the
[competition with China for effective]{.underline} [implementation of
AI]{.underline}, he said.

\"So the first thing is we have got to do is to take this competition
seriously, and we need to win it.\"

[To win, AI must receive]{.underline} the [necessary
funding]{.underline}, at least [3.4% of the DOD budget]{.underline}.
Those [funds should]{.underline} then [be channeled into]{.underline}
[priority areas as recommended by a]{.underline} steering
[committee]{.underline} consisting of the deputy defense secretary, the
vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the principal director of
national intelligence, he said, noting that a good first step was having
the JAIC report directly to the deputy defense secretary.

That steering [committee would]{.underline} also [remove]{.underline}
any [bureaucratic obstacles]{.underline} [and]{.underline} would
[oversee]{.underline} the [development of a technology]{.underline}
[annex]{.underline} to the [National Defense
Strategy](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/Spotlight/National-Defense-Strategy/),
Work said. 

Also the [department should set AI readiness performance goals
by]{.underline} the [end of]{.underline} this [fiscal year]{.underline},
with an eye toward AI-ready implementation by 2025, he said.

Work noted that the U.S. is still the world leader in AI, but China is
structured to rapidly advance with its strong government support to
academia, the private sector and People\'s Liberation Army.

Identifying the right talent for AI, ensuring AI is used in an ethically
responsible manner and forming international partnerships are other
ingredients for successful AI implementation, Work said.

Groen said the [department agrees with the report]{.underline} and is
already implementing about 100 of recommendations that were given. Other
recommendations would be included in feasibility studies.

\"AI as a core tenet of defense modernization,\" Groen said. [AI efforts
will be fundamental to achieving quality networks]{.underline} and data
services [in a secure manner]{.underline}.

\"We\'ve created positive momentum for AI, and we continue to build on
that now. But now comes the real critical test in any transformation.
The hardest part is institutional change and change management of the
workforce and practices and processes that drive a business. This step
will not be easy, even within the Department of Defense, but it\'s
foundational to our competitive success, our accountability and our
affordability,\" he said. \"We have a generational opportunity here for
AI to be our future. We must act now. We need to start putting these
pieces into place now.\"

AI isn\'t just important for the DOD\'s warfighting capabilities, it
will also be a powerful driver of the American economy, Groen said.

THE PENTAGON WASTES YOUR MONEY

There are plenty of reasons to cut the [Pentagon's]{.underline} budget,
but its track record of [profligate spending]{.underline} is among the
[most obvious]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [Pentagon]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} a [private]{.underline} [corporation]{.underline},
gross [**mismanagement would have forced** it **into**
**bankruptcy**]{.underline} [years]{.underline} [ago.]{.underline}
**[Dysfunctional]{.underline} [internal controls]{.underline}**,
**[aided]{.underline}** and abetted [**by** years of
**lax**]{.underline} congressional and administration
**[oversight]{.underline}**, have [enabled it to waste]{.underline} tens
of [billions]{.underline} of dollars annually, [and]{.underline} the
[last **20 years**]{.underline} are [**littered** **with**]{.underline}
a parade of [overpriced, **botched** and bungled]{.underline}
**[projects]{.underline}**.

In just the first decade of this century, the [Pentagon was forced to
cancel a dozen ill-conceived, ineffective weapons programs that cost
taxpayers [\$46
billion](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2011/07/19/46-billion-worth-of-cancelled-programs)]{.underline}.
They included the [Future Combat Systems
program](https://www.defensenews.com/30th-annivesary/2016/10/25/30-years-future-combat-systems-acquisition-gone-wrong/),
a fleet of networked high-tech vehicles that did not work; the [Comanche
helicopter](https://nation.time.com/2012/05/25/real-lessons-from-an-unreal-helicopter/),
which---after 22 years in development---was never built; and the
40-ton [Crusader artillery
gun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-05-09-0205090111-story.html),
which never even made it to the prototype stage.

To put this example of managerial malfeasance in context, these canceled
programs collectively cost [more than]{.underline} the
[fed]{.underline}eral
government [[spent](https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/budget) on
th]{.underline}e Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA]{.underline})
[over the last five years]{.underline}.

At least the Pentagon killed those projects before they wasted any more
money. All too often, it does not know when to pull the plug. The
[Army's attempt to]{.underline} [replace]{.underline} its outmoded
[Bradley tank is a case in point]{.underline}. [Over the last 17 years,
it has blown an estimated [\$22.9
billion](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/army-decided-replace-bradley-fighting-vehicles-17-years-22b-ago-ncna1136141) on
three flawed prototypes]{.underline}, but in February---just three weeks
after rejecting the third failed design---it [issued]{.underline} yet
[another request for]{.underline} [proposals]{.underline} from defense
contractors.

Then there are [programs]{.underline} the **[Pentagon]{.underline}**
continues to [**green-light with zero** **assurance they
will**]{.underline} ever **[perform]{.underline} [as
advertised]{.underline}**. Exhibit A: The [Pentagon]{.underline} has
[wasted]{.underline} [more]{.underline} [than [\$67
billion](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692136.pdf)]{.underline} [since]{.underline}
the [late]{.underline} 19[90]{.underline}s [on]{.underline} a [ballistic
missile defense system]{.underline} [that [has never been demonstrated
to
work](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/missile-defense-risks)]{.underline} in
a real-world situation. A spawn of Ronald Reagan's Star Wars fantasy,
the system---based in Alaska and California---will never be able to
defend the continental United States from a limited nuclear attack. Any
country capable of launching a ballistic missile could easily foil the
system with [decoys and other
countermeasures](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/decoys-used-missile-defense-intercept-tests).

Another prime example is the [F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html).
Expected to cost [\$1.5
trillion](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/f35-fighter-jet-pentagon/) over
its lifespan, it has the dubious distinction of being the Department of
Defense's most expensive weapons program of all time. The [490 **F-35s**
built since]{.underline} the **[first prototype]{.underline}** flew
**[20 years ago]{.underline}** [continue]{.underline} [to
be **[plagued](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a30718538/f-35-flaws/) by**]{.underline}
a [**dozen** serious **flaws**]{.underline} and **[nearly 900
software]{.underline} [defects]{.underline}**, and roughly [half of the
fleet]{.underline} in 2017 and 2018 was [grounded for

buy [2,400
more](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/f-35-takes-flak-but-still-flying-high) F-35s
over the next 25 years.

The F-35 is just one of the malfunctioning weapons systems on the
Pentagon's
current [\$1.8-trillion](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-439#summary) shopping
list of overpriced aircraft, missiles, ships, satellites and tanks.
Other poor performers include the \$22-billion [Zumwalt
destroyer](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/after-sinking-billions-its-stealth-destroyers-navy-needs-more-money-keep-them-afloat),
a warship without a mission; the \$30-billion [littoral combat
ship](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/navy-spent-30b-16-years-fight-iran-littoral-combat-ship-ncna1031806),
which the Navy is already mothballing because it is virtually unusable;
and the Air Force's problem-plagued \$43-billion [KC-46 refueling
tanker](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/06/09/the-air-force-delays-a-full-rate-production-decision-for-the-kc-46/),
which offers little improvement over current refuelers.

But it is not only exorbitant hardware that picks taxpayer pockets.
[Pentagon]{.underline} administrative costs are also [out of
control]{.underline}. A January 2015 report by a [federal]{.underline}
[advisory panel found]{.underline} that the **[Pentagon could
save [\$125
billion](https://www.defensenews.com/2015/01/23/dod-business-panel-proposes-125b-in-savings/)]{.underline}** in
administrative waste by [**streamlining** its **bloated
bureaucracy**]{.underline}. That sum alone is 15 times more than
the [\$8.3
billion](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/488521-trump-reverses-on-request-to-cut-cdc-niaid-funding) the
Trump administration proposes to spend in the next fiscal year to fund
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during one of the worst
pandemics in modern history.

#### More funds exacerbate existing ineffectiveness 

**Manjoo 1/13** (Farhad Manjoo, New York Times columnist, 1-13-2022, "We
Must Stop Showering the Military With Money", The New York Times,
accessed 6-22-2022,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/military-budget-build-back-better.html>
)//kp

Last month, Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has
frustrated much of President Biden's policy agenda, released [a
statement](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-build-back-better-act) confirming
what he'd been hinting for weeks. He [would not
vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/us/politics/manchin-build-back-better.html) for
the Build Back Better Act, the Democrats' \$2.2 trillion 10-year plan to
address climate change and invest in child care, health care and
education. Manchin argued it would increase inflation, harm the
electricity grid and hamper national security and was simply just too
"mammoth" and "sweeping" to support.

"I have always said, 'If I can't go back home and explain it, I can't
vote for it,'"
he [said](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-build-back-better-act).

I don't doubt the political wisdom of Manchin's pledge to support only
what he can explain. I do wonder, though, how he applies his maxim to a
far more mammoth, more sweeping piece of the federal budget: the nearly
three-quarters of a trillion dollars that we are spending this year on a
military that has become the [epitome of governmental
dysfunction](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2021/11/the-pentagons-yearly-blank-check/), [self-dealing](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2022/01/the-bunker-the-pentagons-revolting-door/) and
overspending.

Of course, I'm only kidding. I don't actually wonder about Manchin's
stance on showering the Department of Defense with more money than it
asks for, even [more than it seems to know what to do
with](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/pentagon-has-returned-unused-128-billion-to-the-u-s-since-2009).
Right around the time he was bayoneting Build Back
Better, [Manchin](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-applauds-senate-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-secures-west-virginia-priorities) joined
87 other senators --- [Democrats and Republicans]{.underline} --- in
rubber-stamping another [gargantuan
budget](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/us/politics/defense-spending-bill.html) for
the Pentagon. They [allocated \$768 billion for]{.underline} the
military [in 2022]{.underline}, roughly [\$24 billion more
than]{.underline} the [White House requested]{.underline} from Congress.

Given all the challenges we face at home, does it make any sense to keep
spending so many hundreds of billions on the Pentagon? And even just in
terms of fighting wars, can anyone be satisfied with the way the
military is managing its funds? The Pentagon has never passed an audit
and says it may not be [able to until
2028](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/997961646/the-pentagon-has-never-passed-an-audit-some-senators-want-to-change-that).

[In 2020]{.underline} the U.S. [military's budget accounted for [almost
40
percent](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-04/fs_2104_milex_0.pdf) of]{.underline}
the world's [military expenditures]{.underline}. This level of
[**spending** has]{.underline} long [been **excessive**]{.underline},
but after a pandemic that has claimed the lives of more Americans
than [any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/12/02/covid-19-has-killed-more-americans-than-civil-war-how-do-we-memorialize-them/) [war
we
fought](https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/fs_americas_wars.pdf),
**[continuing to]{.underline} [throw money at the
militar]{.underline}**[y is an act of **willful disregard
for**]{.underline} the most **[urgent threats]{.underline}** we face.

According to a [projection by the Congressional Budget
Office](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56970-Outlook.pdf#page=10),
[Congress is projected to spend]{.underline} about [\$8.5 trillion for
the military]{.underline} over [the next decade]{.underline} --- about
[half a trillion more than]{.underline} is budgeted for [all nonmilitary
discretionary programs]{.underline} combined (a category
that [includes](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/non-defense-discretionary-programs) federal
spending on education, public health, scientific research,
infrastructure, national parks and forests, environmental protection,
law enforcement, courts, tax collection, foreign aid, homeland security
and health care for veterans).

You don't have to be a pacifist to wonder if this imbalance between
military and nonmilitary spending makes sense. [When we]{.underline}
[face so many other]{.underline} major [challenges]{.underline} ---
[from climate]{.underline} disasters [to political
instability]{.underline} and insurrection --- [shouldn't we
ask]{.underline} [whether it remains wise to keep handing the
military]{.underline} what is effectively [a blank check]{.underline}?
Are such lavish resources even good for national defense, or might the
[Pentagon's **near-bottomless access to funds**]{.underline} have
**[encouraged]{.underline}** a [[culture of
waste](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2016/01/millions-of-dollars-wasted-in-afghan-extractives-program/) **and**
**indulgence**]{.underline} that [**made it easier to blunder** into
Iraq and contributed to]{.underline} its [failures
in [Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/09/world/middleeast/afghanistan-war-cost.html)]{.underline}?

This gets to what's most frustrating about the Pentagon's enormous
budget: the halo of protection it enjoys in our political culture.
Despite the Pentagon's numerous missteps, our representatives too rarely
ask how much money for the military may be way too much money for the
military. We have long national debates about [whether it makes sense to
spend on things like parental
leave](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/paid-family-leave-how-lawmakers-could-compromise-on-build-back-better.html) or
college tuition, but lawmakers seldom expect such rigor from the Defense
Department. For example, why should we [keep building aircraft
carriers](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RS20643.pdf) --- each of which
costs [about \$1.5 billion a year to
operate](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2021-05/57088-AppendixA.pdf) ---
when we've already got most of the world's fleet of active aircraft
carriers? (We've got 11; no other nation has more than two, though China
may be [launching a
third](https://www.csis.org/analysis/signs-point-chinas-third-aircraft-carrier-launching-soon) soon.)

There is ample evidence that Congress's reluctance to ask basic
questions of the [Pentagon]{.underline} has **[harmed]{.underline}**,
rather than helped, the **[military's effectiveness]{.underline}**.
Consider the boondoggle that is [the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter
program]{.underline} --- the plan the Pentagon conceived [in the
1990s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html) to
build a new plane, which is expected to cost taxpayers [more than \$1
trillion](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/opinion/f-35-fighter-jet-cost.html) over
its 60-year life span. A [recent
[audit]{.underline}](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-226) from the
Government Accountability Office [found]{.underline} that [even the
Pentagon's extended timeline for when the plane might finally go into
full production is "not achievable]{.underline}," and there were more
than 850 "open deficiencies" in the project as of November 2020. I
wonder if Manchin could explain to his constituents how tolerating such
a level of mismanagement is good for our security.

I also wonder if Manchin could explain the [staggering size and
top-**heaviness of**]{.underline} the **[Pentagon's]{.underline}
staffing** --- why [the [ratio of enlisted troops to officers is
declining](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2021/12/the-bunker-star-creep/)]{.underline} across
the U.S. forces, [[**clutteri**ng the chain of
command](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Publications/Article/1325984/are-there-too-many-general-officers-for-todays-military/) with
layers of bureaucracy.]{.underline} A 2015 internal study found that the
[Pentagon [employed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.b4f9548f160e)]{.underline} (or
hired contractors to employ) [nearly as many deskbound]{.underline},
back-office [people as it had active-duty troops]{.underline}. The
report found that it **[could save \$125 billion]{.underline}** a year
by, among other measures, **[reducing overstaffing]{.underline}**
through retirements and attrition. The Pentagon buried that
report, [according to The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.b4f9548f160e).

Not only do lawmakers give the Pentagon a free pass on its budget;
sometimes they even force the agency to keep the little fat it's trying
to trim. The Air Force says that it's ready to retire its fleet of A-10
Warthogs, fighter airplanes that date back to the 1970s.
Congress [forbade](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2021/07/23/senate-policy-bill-rejects-air-force-request-to-send-some-a-10s-in-the-boneyard/) [any
such
reduction](https://breakingdefense.com/2021/12/congress-approves-retirement-of-160-air-force-planes-with-one-notable-exception/) in
2022.

Starting in 2017, Congress even required each military service to
submit [an annual wish list of "unfunded
priorities"](https://www.ntu.org/publications/detail/congress-should-do-away-with-dod-unfunded-priorities-lists-a-multibillion-dollar-wish-list-boondoggle) ---
that is, goodies that the services might want but that the White House
had not requested in its budget. It has since become routine for
Congress to not only give the Pentagon [much of what it asks
for](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/07/29/lawmakers-cave-to-wish-lists-and-give-the-pentagon-money-it-doesnt-need/) but
also ladle
on [extras](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-07/congress-should-end-the-military-s-wish-lists?sref=B3uFyqJT).

The reasons such spending persists aren't a big mystery. [The
military-industrial complex is every bit as politically powerful as
Dwight Eisenhower
warned](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2021/11/afghanistan-proved-eisenhower-correct/) it
would be. (A recent Wall Street Journal headline [captured the situation
well](https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-won-in-afghanistan-private-contractors-troops-withdrawal-war-pentagon-11640988154):
"Who Won in Afghanistan? Private Contractors.") In another trick, the
military spreads its contracts to a [large number of congressional
districts](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/),
giving every lawmaker a reason to celebrate excessive military spending.
([Manchin put out a
statement](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-applauds-senate-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-secures-west-virginia-priorities) taking
credit for all the benefits the new defense appropriation will bring to
West Virginia.)

And finally, there is plain patriotic posturing: Because every dollar to
the Pentagon can be defended as protecting the troops and the nation's
security, no politician will ever get in trouble for giving too much
money to the military.

Mandy Smithberger, who studies Pentagon excess at the Project on
Government Oversight, a nonpartisan independent group, told me that
while she has hopes that younger generations will begin to question the
military's excessive spending, the situation is unlikely to change
anytime soon.

"It's going to take members of Congress to really step up," she said.
That seems about as likely as pigs flying --- or, more aptly, F-35s.

#### More spending fails\-\--the military sucks

**De Rugy 3/10** (Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at George
Mason University, 3-10-2022, "More Defense Spending Does Not Equal More
Safety", Reason, accessed 6-28-2022,
<https://reason.com/2022/03/10/more-defense-spending-does-not-equal-more-safety/>
)//kp

The brutal [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} by Russia has
[renewed]{.underline} [conservatives\']{.underline} [calls
for]{.underline} large [increases of our defense budget]{.underline}.
The extra money, we are told, would fund more weapons to better prepare
us to respond to aggression in a world that looks increasingly
dangerous. As compelling as these arguments can be in a stressful time,
it\'s not quite so simple.

[Providing military defense is]{.underline} a [valid]{.underline}
function of the federal government. However, that [doesn\'t give license
to]{.underline} [Congress to simply pile on more spending]{.underline},
even when there are dangers out there. Nor does it mean that more
spending will result in a completely safe world for us Americans.
That\'s in part because that world doesn\'t exist. There\'s only so much
safety money can buy.

While I certainly don\'t pretend to know what the optimal budget for our
military is, [we are already spending a large amount on national
security and on the Pentagon]{.underline}. In fiscal year 2023, the
[United States is expected to spend]{.underline} more [than \$770
billion on national defense]{.underline}, with \$729 billion of this
amount being for the Department of Defense\'s military operations. This
enormous sum is **[more than the next 10 countries
spend combined]{.underline}**. [Russia]{.underline}, for instance,
[spends close to \$62 billion]{.underline}. [France and Germany spend
almost \$53 billion]{.underline} each. Assuming [China\'s numbers
are]{.underline} accurate, it spends \$[252 billion]{.underline}.

When considering how much more money we think is worth spending, we must
keep in mind that [not **every**]{.underline} **[additional
dollar]{.underline}** of military spending [will result in enhanced
national]{.underline} security. That\'s because government
[intentions]{.underline} **[do not equal results]{.underline}**. Elected
officials and **[bureaucrats]{.underline}** **[have weak incentives
to]{.underline}** [sensibly]{.underline} **[manage]{.underline}** tax
**[dollars]{.underline}**. They are not rewarded for maximizing taxpayer
value, nor are they usually punished for unnecessary risks. In addition,
interest groups often drive political decisions that run counter to the
best interest of the public.

[Military spending is not immune from]{.underline} these forces any more
than the entitlement and welfare parts of the budget. Just look at the
[**arms-industry lobbying** machine]{.underline}, which in 2021 alone
spent \$117 million in lobbying expenditures and used 763 lobbyists,
[likely **pushing** **for** as much **Pentagon spending** as they can
get]{.underline}. This explains why Congress continues to allocate funds
to produce weapons that the Pentagon itself says it doesn\'t need. It
also [explains]{.underline} the [**endless** saga of]{.underline} its
**[cost overruns]{.underline}**, as well as **[delays and
malfunctions]{.underline}** such as those of the F-35. The
[Defense]{.underline} [Department]{.underline} has been allowed to [fail
its audits repeatedly]{.underline}, meaning [**no one really knows
where** some of that **money**]{.underline} **[goes]{.underline}**. The
result is a less-than-optimal allocation of our large defense budget.

These facts alone don\'t mean there are no grounds for the argument that
the military is underfunded to do everything Congress demands of it. In
2017, the American Enterprise Institute\'s Mackenzie [Eaglen argued for
more]{.underline} military [spending]{.underline} because \"the United
States now fields a military that could not meet even the requirements
of a benign Clinton-era world,\" and that \"while the United States
continues to field the best military personnel in the world, policy
makers have asked them to do too much with too little for too long.\"

I have no reason to doubt Eaglen\'s claim. [However, unless the
political system]{.underline} [that produced]{.underline} these [poor
outcomes is]{.underline} [reformed]{.underline}, [one should remain
skeptical about]{.underline} the effectiveness of even [more
spending]{.underline}.

What about the idea that we should annually spend four percent of our
GDP on defense, as opposed to the three percent we are now spending? I
find this argument lacking. As a measure of economic activity, [GDP has
very little to do with our ability to defend ourselves]{.underline}.
There\'s [no reason]{.underline} for three percent, four [percent, or
any other portion]{.underline} of GDP [to be considered]{.underline} the
[right]{.underline} number.

If the defense-spending-to-GDP measurement reflects anything, it\'s
affordability. That brings us to our enormous budget deficits and
resulting growing debt. Unless Congress cuts non-defense spending
significantly, growing the military budget would grow the deficit.
However, if additional defense spending is deficit-financed, then we can
expect slower growth, as Harvard economist Robert Barro and I
demonstrated in a study back in 2013. That reduces, not increases, the
affordability of our defense budget.

In other words, let\'s make sure we\'re asking the right questions
before rushing to jack up the defense budget.
