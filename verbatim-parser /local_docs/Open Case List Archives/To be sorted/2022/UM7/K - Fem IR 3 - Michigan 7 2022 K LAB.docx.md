### **[Chivalric IR Link]{.underline}**

**The aff relies on narratives of chivalry that positions the USFG as a
masculine savior vis-à-vis the feminized post-colonial subjects in need
of rescue from their own native backwardness -- this locks in colonial
hierarchies of value**

> capacity from liberation through their alliance with American power.
> The romance heroine plays a role like that described by Frantz Fanon:

>
> In American mythology, this female role replays the Pocahontas myth,

> of Evangelina Cosio y Cisneros, the "Cuban Joan of Arc," a member of
> the prominent Cuban family who was imprisoned on suspicion of aiding
> the revolutionaries. The press virtually scripted the case as a
> romance novel, claiming that she had been imprisoned for resisting the
> lustful advances of a Spanish officer. Hearst's New York Journal
> launched an extensive letter-writing campaign on her behalf and then
> sent reporter Karl decker, in the role of knight errant, to rescue her
> (he staged it as a prison break, but accomplished it behind the scenes
> through bribes). This case enlisted the support of many readers from
> women's organizations; one wrote to the Journal that the episode
> reminded her "of the chivalry of the knights of old, who rescued
> damsels in distress." As the Journal noted in its book-length history
> of the case, "As in the old Romances, there is no uncertainty as to
> which way our sympathies should turn." The rescue of a captive Cuban
> woman served as a symbol for the entire Cuban nation -- a connection

>
> [If the entry into the war was viewed as a chivalric rescue mission,

## Space

### Link -- Securing Space

#### Securitization of space is rooted in realist and masculinist politics, justified by the enlightened will to know, dominate, and colonize

> **Griffin, 2009** (Penny, PhD and professor in the dept of politics
> and IR, Univ New South Wales, "The spaces between us: the gendered
> politics of outer space," in *Securing Outer Space,* Routledge, p.
> 68-69; spp)
>
> This 'warfighting' discourse is not, of course, the only construction
> of outer space to possess discursive currency in the US. 'Space
> exploration', as Crawford argues, 'is inherently exciting, and as such
> is an obvious vehicle for inspiring the public in general, and young
> people in particular' (2005: 258). Viewed predominantly as a natural
> extension to the so-called evolution of military and commercial 'arts'
> in the Western hemisphere, human, technological expansion into outer
> space is justified in terms of scientific, commercial, and military
> global entrepreneurship. [Conquering the final frontier of outer space
> is increasingly seen as crucial to a state's pre-eminence in the
> global economy]{.underline} (cf. 'Joint Vision 2020'). [International
> alliances in the post-Fordist economy 'have already consolidated the
> decision for future space exploration and colonization']{.underline}
> (Casper and Moore 1995: 315). In a particularly dramatic turn of
> phrase, Seguin argues that \[m\]ankind \[sic\] now stands at the
> threshold of long-duration space habitation and interplanetary travel'
> (2005: 980). Similarly, Manzey describes human missions to Mars less
> as contingent future events, but as the inevitable consequences of
> technological progress (Manzey 2004: 781-790). Space, once defined as
> a power-laden site of Cold War military conflict, has also become a
> site of international political and economic cooperation[. Often
> conceptualized in expansionist terms, as that which will make our
> world bigger, with space 'discovery' expanding human knowledge, space
> is also conceived of as that which will make the world smaller, in
> neo-liberal globalization terms, 'by reconfiguring capitalism and
> nationalism' (C]{.underline}asper and Moore 1995: 315). [The US
> 'warfighting' discourse is also at odds with much so-called 'space

> defines space as the 'province of all mankind' and asks that states
> act 'with due regard to the corresponding interests of States Parties
> to the Treaty' (Brearly 2005: 16-17). Within the US itself,
> congressionally-led [efforts to discuss and minimize the threats posed

> which there is somewhere in the region of 2,300 metric tons (ibid.:

> critics of the CTBT contend that ratifying the treaty would 'undercut
> confidence in the US deterrent' and thus increase 'the incentive for
> rogue states to obtain nuclear weapons' (Medalia 2006: 13). [All this

> rationalized from humanity's so-called 'natural' desire to explore and
> conquer]{.underline} (cf. Bush 2004; Crawford 2005; Mendell 2005).
> Crawford in proposing a case for the 'scientific and social'
> importance of human space exploration, suggests that, there are

#### US space discourse reproduces heteronormativity and masculine dominance

> heteronormative suggests that [the discourses through which space
> exists consist of institutions, structures of understanding, practical
> orientations and regulatory practices organized and privileged around
> heterosexuality.]{.underline} As a particularly dominant discursive
> arrangement of outer space politics, [US space discourse (re)produces
> meaning through gendered assumptions of exploration, colonization,

### Link -- Space Wars

#### The AFF's participation in the space race is based in a fear of weakness, softness, and lack -- sustains the devaluement of the feminine other to assert global power

> and IR, Univ New South Wales, "The spaces between us: the gendered

>
> As critics increasingly condemned Eisenhower's apparently passive and
> unconcerned leadership for being 'old-fashioned' and 'out of touch'
> (McDougall 1985:7), [a particular political discourse began to emerge
> in the US, founded on a certain type of sexual metaphor and the
> assertion of virile, heterosexual masculinity]{.underline}, led by
> Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. These were both men
> heavily [indoctrinated into the myths and ethos of patriotic frontier
> masculinity, and]{.underline} who placed [at the heart of their

> the American West had signaled freedom and a virile optimism to
> expansive, US frontier masculinity]{.underline} (see Hooper 2001:
> 68-69), [so the conquest and colonization of space provided a suitably
> challenge-filled outlet to revive]{.underline} the [frustrated
> masculinity]{.underline} of late 1950s America. In all this, US
> political discourse was [fueled by a fear of emasculation]{.underline}
> through Soviet achievement [and a national paranoia that the US might
> be perceived]{.underline}, by others and itself, [as in any sense
> weak, complacent, showing any kind of 'missile gap', or aspect of

> was quickly replaced with Kennedy's cult of masculine prowess, a
> career premised, as Dean articulates, on an 'ideology of masculinity'
> constructed around culturally resonant images of the 'stoic
> warrior-intellectual' (Dean 2001: 169). The late 1950s was period of
> massive US self-doubt, propelled by what Michaud refers to as 'a surge
> of discourses on emasculation and feminized conformity' (2005: 4).
> Kennedy's assertion (written in *The Nation,* before he announced he

> [that the US had 'gone soft" physically, mentally, spiritually soft';
> that the US was 'in danger of losing our will to fight, to sacrifice,

> show', found great sway across America, an assertion, as Dean
> illustrates, of manly strength against feminized
> weakness,]{.underline} youth against age, stoic austerity against
> debilitating luxury (2001: 170). Kennedy's immediate focus on the
> 'space gap' signaled the announcement of a more militaristically
> virile engagement. Space exploration thus became a central policy
> tenet of the Kennedy government, with the operation to get a US
> astronaut on the Moon a means of reasserting US authority and avenging

> colonization through the creation of so-called 'civilian' programmes
> (ostensibly, more open to the public) run by the National Aeronautics

### Link -- Space Awareness/Observation

#### Space Awareness both presumes and reinforces a hegemonic and masculine Cartesian subject

>
> As I argue, [the positioning of the astronaut as a scientific and
> exploratory figure is integrally linked to the positioning of this
> figure's perspective]{.underline}, both literal and metaphorical. Much
> of [the discourse of space culture is centred on the experiences of

> issues of the geographic and cartographic subject. For this
> reason]{.underline}, I contend that analysis of [spatial subjectivity
> is a productive contribution to analysis of the influence of gender on
> space culture]{.underline}. To analyse this, I will employ work from
> spatial theory on observation, perspective, and the geographic and
> cartographic subject. Gillian Rose's *Feminism and Geography: The
> Limits of Geographical Knowledge* forms an important part of my
> analysis, as does the work of Kathleen M. Kirby.1 Theoretical
> Grounding\[:\] Rose's *Feminism and Geography* is a detailed account
> of the influence of gendered ideology in the discipline of geography.
> As such, Rose's work seeks not the geographic distribution of women,
> nor even women's use of space, but the [underlying structural
> limitations]{.underline} which [have historically led to the
> privileging of a male subject in spatial theory]{.underline}.2 Rose
> explains that her focus is not on 'the geography of gender, but
> \[\...\] the gender of geography', a concept to which I will pay more
> critical attention later in this chapter.3 I argue that Rose's work
> has important implications for the analysis of gendered structures in
> work on outer space. [Kirby's work]{.underline} on the cartographic
> subject similarly illuminates the underlying gendered structure of the
> field itself. Her 'Re:Mapping Subjectivity: Cartographic Vision and
> the Limits of Politics' expands upon broader scholarship [on the
> hegemonic construction of the Cartesian subject]{.underline} to
> examine the spatial aspect of the development of this subject. This
> development, Kirby argues, 'was -- and continues to be --
> [inextricably tied to a specific concept of space and the technologies
> invented for dealing with that space']{.underline}.4 Kirby explores
> this concept through analysis of [Enlightenment perspectives on the
> bounded self -- the border between inner, bodily space, and the spaces
> outside]{.underline}.5 Kirby explores the construction of this border
> through analysis of the discourse of cartography and the concept of
> 'getting lost'. Kirby argues that 'getting lost' is a violation of the
> strict boundary between bodily interior and exterior for the
> cartographic subject, and further, this has important gendered
> implications which construct this subjectivity as a masculine one.6
> Both Rose and Kirby pay attention to questions of perspective in their
> studies of spatial theory, and it is these questions to which I
> dedicate this chapter. As I will show[, the perspective of an
> astronaut looking back at Earth is an important construction within
> human spaceflight]{.underline}.7 This construction is part of what
> leads me to analyse these texts from the perspective of earthbound
> spatial theory. I will further argue, using work by David Harvey on
> the origins of modern mapping, that [the perspective that an astronaut
> possesses -- that of an observer fully separated from the Earth itself
> -- is not a new concept in spatial theory]{.underline}.8 Harvey argues
> that [Western spatial discourse has privileged extra-terrestrial
> perspective since long before humans travelled into

> perspective in the development of Renaissance mapping, and its roots
> in Ptolemaic thought: \[\...\] in designing the grid in which to

> seemed as if space, though infinite, was conquerable and containable
> for purposes of human occupancy and action.9 Harvey argues that [the
> very foundations of modern mapping can be traced to the concept that
> the ideal observer is one entirely separate from Earth, so that he can
> see and know every part of the planet. I refer to this figure as *he*
> knowingly, for]{.underline} as I will further explore using the work
> of Rose and Kirby[, this construction of a detached observer is
> associated with masculine subjectivity.]{.underline} In this chapter I

> perspective inform the discourse around spaceflight at multiple sites
> within space culture. I argue that ultimately, [the perspective

> Haraway elucidates the meaning of this figure in her 'Situated

> exhaustive objectivity is not achievable]{.underline}.16 Haraway
> claims that 'only partial perspective promises objective vision'.17 In
> 'Situated Knowledges', Haraway calls for a feminist reclamation of the

> this chapter, [the perspective of spaceflight provides]{.underline}
> both [examples of the construction of the 'master
> subject',]{.underline} and also opportunities to destabilise this
> concept, which I argue can contribute to the Haraway's project of
> 'Situated Knowledges'. Rose's *Feminism and Geography* further
> elaborates on the way the 'master subject' figure has impacted upon

> end, in *Feminism and Geography* Rose makes a clear and succinct
> statement of her approach as one which concerns the gender *of*
> geography, rather than the subject of gender within traditional
> geographic discourse.18 In other words, Rose is interested in
> analysing the discipline itself for gendered attributes, not using the
> discipline as its stands to discuss gender issues. This is an
> important distinction not only for this chapter, but also for all that
> follows it, as I will discuss in my introduction to Part Two. For the
> purposes of this chapter however, it is particularly important because
> it relates to Rose's further discussion of the 'master subject' of the
> geographic discipline. **Rose and the Gender *of* Geography\[:\]** [In
> applying the concept of the 'master subject' to geography
> specifically, Rose illuminates how the field itself has insidiously
> privileged one particular perspective at the expense of all others.
> The key problem with this which Rose identifies is the construction of

> subject in relation to geography as 'a white, bourgeois, heterosexual
> man', who, in the development of the discipline, sought primarily to
> 'render the world amenable to the operation of masculinist
> reason']{.underline}.19 [The ideal of this geographic 'masculinist
> reason' is a way of knowing, and a knowledge, which can be generally
> applied]{.underline}. Rose writes: ['Geographers desire knowledge of
> the whole world, but, more importantly for their claims to power

> world]{.underline}.'20 [This 'knowledge of the whole world' has clear
> implications for spaceflight]{.underline}; for, as I will discuss

## Realism

### Realism Link -- Protection Racket

#### Realism replicates a protector/protected relationship that sustains authoritarian state practices, masks protector violence, and justifies intervention by some to protect others from other others.

> involve subjects---including women---in the provision of their own
> security]{.underline}.47 Two gendered aspects of Realist conceptions

> [Realists correlate security with invulnerability, invincibility and

> by a hostile or potentially hostile state. This means we have an
> assured nuclear deterrent available at all times.48 As Susannah
> Radstone has argued, [however, invulnerability is an unachievable
> fantasy with obviously gendered connotations. It is the female body
> that is penetrated and impregnated while the male body remains, or

> argued above, [nuclear technologies do not operate in a social vacuum.
> They are created and operated by humans and, as such, there can be no
> guarantees of infallibility]{.underline}. Indeed, the world may be
> decidedly less secure when submarines armed with nuclear missiles are
> continuously on patrol, but the emphasis in the White Paper on
> protection through superior technology makes this possibility
> unthinkable. Second, and perhaps [more important, Realist views of
> security cast the state and its military wing as "protector" and
> civilians within the state as "protected," a dichotomy which is
> profoundly gendered.]{.underline} Judith Hicks Stiehm, for instance,
> [highlights the historical association of the protector role with men
> and the protected role with women; further, she claims that the
> protector role gains meaning and status precisely through its
> privileging over those who are feminised as vulnerable.]{.underline}50
> As Iris Marion Young put it more recently: [The role of the masculine
> protector puts those protected, paradigmatically women and children,

> subordinate status like that of women in the patriarchal household. We
> are to accept a more authoritarian and paternalistic state power,
> which gets its support partly from the unity a threat produces and our
> gratitude for protection]{.underline}.51 [Although recent years have

> saturated with constructions of "masculine autonomy (freedom, control,

> others have pointed out that security discourse involves an enforced
> linkage between the protector and protected in the face of an external
> threat]{.underline}. For Stiehm [this functions to mask the fact that

> masculine values and norms (Tickner 2001; Sjoberg 2009).
> [Particularly, in the international security realm, values associated
> with masculinities]{.underline} (e.g., strength, rationality,
> autonomy) [are prized over values associated with femininities
> (]{.underline}weakness, emotion, interdependence) (Tickner 1992).
> Within this dichotomy, [there is a power hierarchy between different
> masculinities and different femininities such that an ideal-typical
> masculinity sits on top of a gendered hierarchy of traits in the
> international arena]{.underline} (Connell 1995; Hooper 2001). Feminist
> scholars have identified this ideal-typical masculinity as \"hegemonic
> masculinity\" (Connell 1995). Hegemonic masculinity refers to certain
> masculine norms and values that have become dominant in specific
> institutions of social control and remain in those institutions to
> maintain patriarchal social and political orders (Kronsell 2005, 281;
> Tickner 1992, 6). The dominance of hegemonic masculinity in
> international security is related to but not reliant on the
> overrepresentation of men in positions of political and defense
> leadership (Pettman 1996). [Masculinities are prized in political and
> military leadership, even when that leadership is performed by women.
> The dominance of hegemonic masculinity relies on its opposition to and
> competition with subordinated masculinities and
> femininities]{.underline}. Hegemonic masculinities at once promote a
> particular organization of the political order and reinforce unequal
> relationships between men and women in order to promote the
> legitimation of masculine authority (Tickner 1992, 6). Charlotte
> Hooper explains, \"[as masculinity is the valued term, it can be
> argued that femininity is merely a residual category, a foil or Other
> for masculinity to define itself against]{.underline}\" (Hooper 2001,
> 43). Values associated with masculinity are prized only insomuch as
> they are superior to values associated with femininity (Hooper 2001,
> 43). A man\'s (or anyone\'s) claim to masculinity, therefore, is a
> positional claim in opposition to a feminine other that society has
> constructed to be the lesser of the two binaries. Without the
> existence of an individual or group that can be labeled as the weaker
> party, masculine social norms would be without content. Masculine
> social norms in international politics are particularly evident in
> militarized institutions, which are structured around gendered,
> hierarchical relationships both within the institutions and in their
> accomplishment of their missions (Tickner 1992). [The term
> \"militarization\" is used to denote when \"militaristic values (e.g.,
> a belief in hierarchy, obedience, and the use of force)\" are adopted
> by states, organizations, individuals, corporations, and so
> on]{.underline} (Enloe 2007, 4). [Feminists have associated
> militarism, masculinity, and wartime hero narratives, arguing that
> militaristic behavior is a path by which men and masculine states can
> prove their masculinity]{.underline} (Huston 1983, 271; Sjoberg
> 2006b). Idealized masculinities for soldiers throughout history have
> included characteristics associated with aggression, bravery, courage,
> service, precision, and protection (Hooper 2001, 81). [Idealized
> militarized masculinities are social, but they are also physical,
> where militarics emphasize the soldiers\' physical strength,
> particularly upper body strength, by means of training exercises and
> certain areas of specialization within militaries]{.underline} (i.e.,
> the Navy SEALS, Army Rangers). [Many militaristic cultures emphasize

> physical and upper body strength, framing soldiering in opposition to
> women\'s \"natural\" lack of upper body strength and other physical

> soldiering and physical incapacity to soldier is feminized, then both
> the \"sex\" (male / female) and \"gender\" (masculine/ feminine)

> Sjoberg 2007). Instead, like their male counterparts, [many women
> soldiers are being asked to prove their masculinity in terms of
> physical prowess and military-favored social
> characteristics]{.underline} (Cohn 2000). At the same time, military
> recruiting ads that feature women show a double standard, where women

> masculinity while maintaining feminine appearance (including high
> heels, makeup, and jewelry) (Brown 2006). As several female soldiers

> the perceived weaknesses associated with femininity, all while walking
> a gender-role tightrope where they do not deconstruct the gender
> dichotomies on which sociopolitical relation- ships are founded[. Many
> militaries remain gendered not only in the personality characteristics
> they select for but also in the experiences of women who are a part of
> those organizations]{.underline}. Many military organizations exclude
> women from combat roles (Komblum 1984; l-lorrigan 1992). [Many
> militaries have high levels of sexual violence perpetrated by male
> soldiers against female soldiers and other implicit and explicit
> sexually discriminatory policies]{.underline} (Morris 1996). [Other
> military organizations construct soldiering in opposition to
> militarized feminized roles, such as military wives]{.underline}
> (Enloe 1990; Horn, chapter 4, this volume) and civilians (Elshtain
> 1987; Kinsella 2005; Sjoberg 2006a). The role of military wife

> sovereign states" (Opello and Rosow 19999, 226), and are said to have
> "interests \[tat\] are defined exogenously" in a "process \[that\] is
> characterized by intergovernmental bargaining and unlimited state
> interest" (Sjursen 2001, n.p.). In the billiard ball model there are
> no "good" states or "bad" states (Mearsheimer 1994-1995, 48), and
> "\[o\]nly the hard exteriors touch, and heavier or faster moving ones
> push others out of the way" (Burton 1972,28). There are other
> metaphorical contrivances for the milieu of international relations as
> well. For example, the "billiard ball" metaphor can be compared to the
> similar-sounding, albeit theoretically opposed, "'egg-box' conception
> of international society," whereby "the sovereign states are the eggs,
> the box is the international society and the purpose of the box is to
> 'separate and cushion, not to act'" (Wheeler 1996, 126). The "web" or
> "cobweb" model challenges the billiard ball image of states as
> hard-shelled actors by promoting the vision of an international
> society in which relations among a variety of global action resemble
> the intertwined threads of a web-like matrix (Burton 1972, 35-45).
> Sometimes it seems as if the billiard ball image of international
> relations is the target for every other metaphor that challenges the

> article -- "Billiard Balls or Snowflakes?" -- for example, Benjamin
> Fordham and Victor Asal (2007, 48) suggest that major powers be seen
> less as hard shelled impenetrable objects and more like metaphorical
> "snowflakes" "with many potentially relevant internal
> characteristics." Other metaphors include the "burning house" vision
> of the international system and the "forest" image of an international
> system comprising homogenous states pictured metaphorically as
> "trees." In recent years scholars have become rather creative in
> contriving metaphors to capture what they see as the nature of the

> Kaplan (1994, 75), for example, suggests the metaphor of a "hologram"

> feminist side, Sandra Whitworth declared that "the next stage of
> international relations theory will not be one that is merely
> critical, but one which is critical and feminist" (1989, 270). Ann

### AT: Positivism Good

#### Positivism is self-serving and overdetermined by desires

### Vulnerability = Ontological

**Vulnerability is a byproduct of embodiement, and thus an ontological
condition of humanity -- within our worldview, vulnerability is coded as
human and doesn't always need to be guarded... not as a sign of feminine
weakness**

> **The lowest common denominator of embodiment** [The body is
> ontologically multiple, which means that it is many things at the same
> time]{.underline} (Mol 2002). [Feminist social theory, for instance,
> has examined the body as inscribed and discursively
> (re)produced]{.underline} (Grosz 1994; 1997; Dallery 1992; Butler
> 1993), but also as that which writes the world (Kirby 1997; Vaittinen
> forthcoming). [The body is internally governed by gendered sex
> hormones, organic and synthetic alike]{.underline} (Irni 2013;
> Preciado, 2013[), while simultaneously home to other bodies such as
> microbes]{.underline} (Fishel, 2015), or sometimes foetuses (Homanen
> 2013). As discussed above[, the body is a vulnerable and destroyable
> target of violence, but also that which may violently destroy and
> explode the bodies of others]{.underline} (Wilcox, 2015). [The body is
> differentially grievable]{.underline} (Butler 2004) and dis/abled
> (Shildrick, 2002; 2012; McRuer 2006). It is a gendered and
> sexual(ised) object of desire as well as trade (Agathangelou 2004;

> strictly tied to able-bodiedness and the two gender binary (Butler

> extends towards other bodies, human and nonhuman alike (Haraway 1991),
> not only residing in space but also making space when exposed to/with
> other bodies (cf. Manning 2009). The human body can be *simultaneously
> all this*, and much more. It is not possible, in the space of this
> chapter or a lifetime, to discuss all these complementary ontologies
> of the body. Below[, I thus focus on elaborating a particular
> conception of the body that applies to all living human beings at all
> times. I call this concept the lowest common denominator of
> embodiment]{.underline} (Vaittinen forthcoming[). Its definition
> begins with the fact that all human bodies as organisms have certain
> fundamental, material needs, which make human beings existentially
> dependent on care provided by other bodies.]{.underline} In addition
> to breathing, [*all* human bodies]{.underline} need be fed and
> hydrated, to digest, and get rid of excess fluids and excrement in an
> adequately hygienic way. When incapable of doing so independently,
> they [need other bodies' assistance in meeting]{.underline} these
> [basic needs]{.underline}. In the course of a life-time, this makes
> all human bodies dependent on care provided by other bodies. While
> there may be also other fundamental needs, I refer [to nutrition,
> hydration, urination, defecation, and hygiene,]{.underline} because
> these needs [apply to *every single living/dying human body at all
> times*, regardless of age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class,
> status, or any other attributes of identity or social position. Only
> at death are our bodies freed from this existential embodied
> dependency on other carnal beings]{.underline} -- albeit even dead
> bodies tend to be subject to various practices of care, security and
> governance (cf. Auchter 2016). Of course, one can argue against the
> existential dependency on care by saying that we do not need concrete
> care from others throughout and at each moment of our lives. Yet (from
> a secular perspective at least) it is a fact that we only have one
> life, tied to one body organism, which can be prosthetically fixed and
> enhanced but only to a certain extent. If we look at the entire
> life-course of our embodiment, or do the same on level of populations,
> the periods of life when human beings are (presumably) independent
> from other bodies are limited to able-bodied adulthood (cf. McRuer
> 2006; Shildrick 2002; 2012). Taking this illusionary independent
> period of life as the norm leaves out innumerable lives, including our
> own lives at the times when we are frail, needy, and dependent. Yet,
> as shown by Cohn (2014) as well as by feminist care ethicists, in
> liberal politics and its security practices, invulnerability and
> independence *are* the norms, whilst those in need of care and
> protection are considered as exceptions. When human vulnerability is
> examined at the level of the lowest common denominator of embodiment,
> it becomes clearer still that, as for human bodies' existential need
> of care, there are *no exceptions*, only difference. That all bodies
> are existentially dependent on care does not mean that all bodies
> would need the same care in the same way, or could demand it with the
> same power and the same 'voice'. In the field of care needs too, there
> are power relations, with some vulnerable bodies being more powerful
> than others are, even as bare bodies in need of care (see Vaittinen
> 2015). This is because, in the prevailing material-discursive orders,
> some bodies' are inscribed with value, eligibility to care and
> embodied security, while the care needs of others are turned into
> something incomprehensible and barely recognisable (Vaittinen
> forthcoming). Nevertheless, the body's dependency on care given by
> other bodies is an ontology of human corporeality that, whether
> recognised or not, is present in all realistic ontologies of the body.
> It is the lowest common denominator. **Embodied in/security and its
> contending ontologies of relatedness** [It is notable that, on the
> level of the lowest common denominator, the body and its leaky care
> needs are not about the feminine.]{.underline} After all, [if we only
> just focus on the fact that everybody *must* eat, drink, urinate and
> defecate, maintain an adequate level of hygiene, and need care from

> denominator of embodiment marks a space where telling the feminine
> from masculine is not self-evident]{.underline} (cf. Isaksen 2002;
> Vaittinen 2015). [This fact of life applies as much to (cis)women as

> queer.]{.underline} It is even more notable that, in the era of the

> everywhere, as are therefore their leaky, disgust-materialist needs.
> Indeed, the fundamental leakiness and filth of human embodiment is
> also present in the military. Belkin (2012, 125172), for instance,
> has analysed the practices of filth and excremental self-control in
> the US army. Basham (2013, 87) in turn uses the loss of excremental

> international politics of elderly care, and hence from social security
> rather than security 'proper' (Vaittinen forthcoming). Here, unlike in
> a context where the body loses excremental self-control when exposed
> to the direct violence of other bodies, the body's existential
> leakiness denotes another type of relatedness with fellow carnal
> beings. This relatedness is about care, enacted by the body's
> vulnerability to its own decay. As feminists have emphasised, this
> vulnerability -- and the relatedness it necessitates with the Other --
> is something that just cannot be done away with. As argued above, from
> the most basic needs of the body (to eat, drink, urinate and defecate,
> and stay clean) follows that no human being can survive without care
> provided by other bodies. As in ethics of care, this inescapable
> neediness and dependency makes us always already latently related to
> and with other bodies  not antagonistically through the exposure to
> the embodied other's violence as in many existing accounts of embodied
> in/security, but through care needs that only other human bodies can
> meet. Yet, whereas my lowest common denominator of embodiment
> emphasises the body's existential need of care from other bodies for
> survival, the traditional premise of security studies is equally true:
> [*all* living bodies at all times can also be killed by other
> bodies.]{.underline} In this regard, it may well be argued that the
> [conventional security paradigms, including a range of feminist
> accounts, rely on another lowest common denominator of embodiment,
> namely the body's existential exposure to external threats of
> violence]{.underline}  \_t[he Hobbesian world.]{.underline} Both
> these conceptions of embodied in/vulnerability are fundamentally
> relational. [When one begins with care needs, the relations between
> people/bodies are defined in terms of nurturing and sustenance of
> life, both of which are absolutely necessary for the sustenance of our
> species. When one begins with the threat of external violence, our
