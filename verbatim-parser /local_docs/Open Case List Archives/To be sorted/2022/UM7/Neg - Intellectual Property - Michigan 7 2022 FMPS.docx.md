#### Hegemonic decline inevitable -- and no impact

**McCoy \'21** - J.R.W. Smail Professor of History at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison \[Alfred, Jan 29, \"American Hegemony Is Ending With a
Whimper, Not a Bang,\"
<https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-biden-america/> \]

[When empires decline]{.underline} and fall, th[ey seldom collapse in
the sort of sudden apocalypse portrayed in a monumental
series]{.underline} of paintings entitled "The Course of Empire" by
another denizen of the Catskill Mountains, the renowned artist Thomas
Cole. His 1836 painting in that series, now appropriately enough hung at
the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, shows a "savage enemy" plundering
a grand imperial capital whose inhabitants, debased by years of
luxurious living, can only flee in terror while women are raped and
buildings burn.

[Empires,]{.underline} however, [usually experience a long, less
dramatic decline before they fall in the Roman fashion,
th]{.underline}anks to events whose logic only becomes apparent years or
even decades later, as historians try to sort through the rubble. So
it's likely to be in what, until mid--last week, [wa]{.underline}s (and
still in many ways remains) [Donald Trump's America, where the signs of
decline are as erratic as they are omnipresent.]{.underline}

The most telling harbinger of that decline, Trump himself, is now in
exile at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Ten years ago in an essay for
TomDispatch titled "Four Scenarios for the End of the American Century
by 2025," I suggested that US global hegemony would end not with Thomas
Cole's apocalyptic bang but instead with the whimper of empty populist
rhetoric. "Riding a political tide of disillusionment and despair," I
wrote in December 2010, "a far-right patriot captures the presidency
with thundering rhetoric, demanding respect for American authority and
threatening military retaliation or economic reprisal. The world pays
next to no attention as the American Century ends in silence."

Trump's election in 2016 made all too real what, until then, had only
seemed to me a troubling possibility. With a legerdemain worthy of that
19th century showman P.T. Barnum's bag of bunkum (like the supposed
Cardiff Giant or the Fiji Island Mermaid), Trump's TV show The
Apprentice presented The Donald as a self-made billionaire of
extraordinary financial savvy. Who better to rescue America from the job
losses, stagnant wages, and foreign competition brought on by economic
globalization? But Trump had cheated his way into an Ivy League college;
many of his businesses had gone bankrupt; and his much-vaunted
entrepreneurial flair came down essentially to frittering away a \$400
million inheritance from his father. As journalist H.L. Mencken
predicted back in 1920, America had finally come to the point where "the
plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the
White House will be adorned by a downright moron."

Once in office, Trump soon bent the nation (but not the world) to his
will, rupturing time-tested alliances, tearing up treaties, denying
incontrovertible climate science, and demanding respect for American
authority with a thundering, if largely empty, rhetoric that threatened
military retaliation or economic reprisals globally. Despite the
manifest inanity of his policies, the Republican Party capitulated,
corporate tycoons applauded, and nearly half the American public cleaved
to their newfound savior.

As with all sellout shows, the best was saved for last. When the
Covid-19 pandemic struck with full force in March 2020, Trump turned up
at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, donning a MAGA hat,
to proclaim his "natural ability" when it came to medical science, while
distinguished doctors stood by like studio extras in mute testimony to
his otherwise risible claims. As the pandemic began climbing toward its
terrible, still developing toll, Trump hijacked White House briefings by
medical experts to promote a succession of crackpot claims---wearing a
mask was merely "politically correct"; Covid-19 was just another flu
that "becomes weaker with warmer weather"; hydroxychloroquine was a
cure; and shining ultraviolet "light inside of the body" or injecting
"disinfectant" were possible treatments. A surprising number of
Americans started drinking bleach to protect themselves from the virus,
forcing months of public health warnings.

[After nearly a century in which the United States had been a world
leader in promoting public health, the Trump
administration]{.underline}, to escape blame for its own escalating
failures[, walked out of the World Health Organization]{.underline}.
[Lending the country the aura of a failed state]{.underline}, [the CDC
itself, once the world's gold standard in medical research, bungled the
development of a coronavirus test and so forfeited any
serious,]{.underline} nationwide attempt to successfully track and trace
the disease (the most effective means of controlling it).

While smaller nations like New Zealand, South Korea, and even
impoverished Rwanda effectively curbed Covid-19, by the end of Trump's
term the United States already had experienced more than 400,000 deaths
and 24 million infections---significantly above any other developed
nation's death rate and a full quarter of the world's total cases.
Meanwhile, Beijing mobilized a rigorous public health campaign that
quickly contained the virus to just 4,600 deaths in a population of 1.4
billion. In only four months, China virtually eliminated the virus
(despite periodic new local breakouts) and had its economy humming along
with a 5 percent increase in gross domestic product, which accounted for
30 percent of global growth last year. [Meanwhile, after 11 months of an
incessant pandemic, the United States remained mired in a]{.underline}
crippling [recession. Th]{.underline}is [striking disparity in state
performance only accelerated China's quest to surpass the United States
as the world's largest economy and]{.underline}, with all that financial
clout, [become its preeminent power.]{.underline}

A TRAGICOMIC ENCORE

It was, however, President Trump's bid for an encore that would prove
truly extraordinary when it came to imperial decline. [During its 70
years as a global hegemon, Washington's public promotion of democracy
has been the signature program that has helped legitimate its global
leadership]{.underline} (no matter the CIA-style interventions it
launched or the colonial-style wars it continually fought).

While the Cold War often compromised that commitment in particularly
striking ways, following its end Washington has spent 30 years
officially promoting fair voting and democratic transitions, with
leaders like former president Jimmy Carter flying off to capitals on
five continents to oversee and encourage free elections. Suddenly, [the
world watched in slacked-jaw amazement as, on January 6 on the White
House ellipse, the president denounced a fair American election as
fraudulent and sent a mob of 10,000 white nationalists, QAnon
conspiracists, and other Trumpsters off to storm the
Capitol,]{.underline} where Congress was ratifying the transition to a
new administration.

Adding to this failed-state aura, the country's once-formidable national
security apparatus crumpled like a Third World constabulary as
right-wing militiamen breached the frail security cordon around the
Capitol and stormed its halls as if they were a lynch mob hunting for
congressional leaders. House majority leader Steny Hoyer's desperate
calls to a dawdling Pentagon and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan's
dangerously delayed mobilization of his state's National Guard, caused
by the US military's compromised chain of command, only seemed to echo
the sort of tropical coup scenarios I witnessed in Manila, the capital
of the Philippines, during the 1980s.

[When Congress was finally back in session, the Capitol still rang with
Republican calls, in the name of national unity, for forgetting what the
president had incited]{.underline}. In that way, Republican
congressional representatives seemed to echo the kind of impunity that
has long protected fallen military juntas in Asia or Latin America from
any accounting for their countless crimes. This attempt, in other words,
to perpetuate a would-be autocrat's power through a (failed) coup was
the sort of spectacle that many millions living in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America have experienced in their own fragile states but never
expected to see in America.

Suddenly, [our supposedly exceptional nation seemed tragically
ordinary.]{.underline} The [shimmering dome of the Capitol once
symbolized the vitality of this nation's democracy]{.underline},
inspiring others to follow its principles or at least acquiesce to its
power. This country now looks tattered and tired, caught like others
before it between forgetting in the name of unity or demanding the
powerful be held accountable for high crimes that will otherwise haunt
the nation. [Instead of aspiring to America's ideals or entrusting their
security to its power, many nations will likely find their own way
forward]{.underline}, [cutting deals with]{.underline} all comers,
starting with [China.]{.underline}

Despite an aura of overwhelming strength, [empires, even ones as
powerful as America's, often prove surprisingly fragile and their
decline regularly comes far sooner than anyone could have
imagined]{.underline}---particularly when the cause is not Thomas Cole's
"savage enemy" but their own self-destructive instincts.

Today, in the era of a 78-year-old president, a veritable Rip Van Biden,
Americans and the rest of the world are, it seems, waking up in a new
age. It could well be a daunting one.

### 1NC\-\--Defense\-\--Democracy

#### Alt causes to democracy's decline -- it's dead. 

**DeVega \'22** - Senior politics writer for Salon \[Chauncy, Mar 25,
\"How democracy dies: When it comes to Jan. 6, the American people
can\'t handle the truth,\"
https://www.salon.com/2022/03/25/how-democracy-dies-on-jan-6-the-american-people-cant-handle-the-truth/\]

During my graveyard walks I have been thinking a great deal about
America and its democracy crisis, and the poisons of fascism and white
supremacy that are literally killing this country. I keep visualizing a
tombstone with an inscription warning passers-by that most Americans
didn\'t even fight for democracy while it was dying, but went on with
life as usual. Those who tried to warn them about the impending disaster
just got tired and gave up.

That is effectively happening right now, in real time. A recent article
in the Washington Post issued a warning: \"Jan. 6 committee faces a
thorny challenge: Persuading the public to care.\" Apparently the House
committee investigating the Capitol attack of January 2021 \"has tried
to recruit high-profile journalists to write its report \... hoping to
build a narrative thriller that compels audiences and is a departure
from government reports of yore.\" Committee staffers also hope \"to put
together blockbuster televised hearings that the public actually tunes
into,\" which is a troubling way to frame a historic congressional
investigation.

[The apparent challenge is to make the public care]{.underline} \"about
an event that happened more than a year ago, and that many Americans
feel they already understand.\" The committee wants to turn \"hundreds
of thousands of pages of depositions, records and other evidence into an
accessible narrative\" aimed at \"hard-to-reach\" and \"deeply
polarized\" audiences. One unnamed committee member told the Post,
\"[There\'s one-third of the nation that will read it, one-third that
might read it, and one-third that won\'t even believe it]{.underline}.\"
More from the report:

The committee is also competing for attention amid a flurry of current
events that now includes the war in Ukraine, raising the stakes for the
committee\'s ability to hold the public\'s attention as the insurrection
moves further and further back from in public memory. Don Ritchie,
historian emeritus of the Senate, said that the most important thing for
any congressional committee is publicity.

\"Investigators need a certain sense of showmanship --- they really need
to demonstrate and dramatize what\'s happening because the public is
distracted,\" said Ritchie. \"After getting the publicity, then it\'s
figuring out what you\'re actually going to do about the problem.\"

In all, [this is a damning indictment of the current state of American
democracy and political culture. Donald Trump\'s regime and his coup
cabal attempted to nullify the results of the 2020 presidential
election,]{.underline} his followers launched a violent lethal assault
on the Capitol [and the Republican-fascists\' Jim Crow attacks on
multiracial democracy are escalating.]{.underline} [The United States
faces the possibility of a low-level civil war or sustained right-wing
insurgency]{.underline}. Yet the American people must be \"entertained\"
with a spectacle in order to care.

As sociologist Neil Postman famously warned in the title of his
best-known work, [the American people have \"amused themselves to
death\" through a culture of anti-intellectualism]{.underline}, and the
superficial, immediate gratification of mass media. Collective
narcissism is a major public health problem. So many people, because of
loneliness, alienation, social atomization and a culture of
hyper-individualism and self-centeredness, feel no sense of linked fate
with other human beings outside their families and immediate social
circles.

[America\'s educational system has been gutted through decades of active
neglect and right-wing malice. Courses that teach critical thinking and
civics have been systematically removed from the curriculum]{.underline}
of public education. As detailed by Lisa Duggan in her excellent book
\"The Twilight of Equality\", the social sciences and the arts and
humanities are being targeted for evisceration by these same right-wing
libertarian gangster capitalists at the college and university level as
well.

[Education is the]{.underline} best way, and perhaps **[only
way,]{.underline}** [to create responsible, informed citizens who have
the capacity and willingness to participate in a healthy
democracy]{.underline}. The global right is trying to destroy high
quality public (and private) education for that reason with the ultimate
goal of creating passive citizens and corporate drones.

[Extreme income and wealth inequality and wage stagnation also undermine
citizens\' ability to be active participants in a democratic
society]{.underline}. When people have to work multiple jobs in order to
scrape out a living, they are far less willing or able to find the
energy to care about democracy, let alone to turn those feelings and
concerns into action.

[More than half of all Americans read below a sixth-grade
level]{.underline}, which means that they are not able to properly
understand complex matters of politics and public policy.

Unions and other [institutions of civil society]{.underline} (sometimes
called the \"laboratories of democracy) [have been systematically
weakened by the American right.]{.underline} Those are (or were) places
where people learn the skills necessary to the practice of democracy. In
this climate, it is no surprise that America\'s governing institutions
are experiencing a legitimacy crisis: The public largely views their
elected officials and the organs of state as unresponsive to their needs
and desires --- and for good reason.

Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that elected officials at
the federal level (that is, in Congress) are highly unresponsive to the
policy demands of the average American and instead are beholden to the
richest individuals and most powerful corporations. It is certainly true
that Republicans are far worse in this regard, but Democrats are by no
means immune, especially the self-styled \"moderates\" or \"centrists.\"

By email I asked the cultural critic and education scholar Henry A.
Giroux --- the author of numerous books and a Salon contributor --- for
his thoughts on this problem: Why don\'t Americans seem to care about
their democracy? He offered a lengthy response, which I will quote in
part. \"Democracy is in exile in the United States and the political,
social and educational breakdown is intensifying,\" he began, observing
that the \"rise of neoliberal predatory capitalism\" in the 1980s marked
a key turning point:

Not only did the culture shift to a market-based language that
undermined any sense of the common good, shared values and trust, but it
embraced a language of privatization, deregulation and commodification
that commercialized all social relations and retreated from any
discourse that evoked matters of ethic, social responsibility and the
obligations of citizenship.

In the current moment[, the Republican Party and its allies among the
financial elite, corrupt politicians, and right-wing movements hold
democracy in contempt because it poses a threat to the unchecked
accumulation of capital, white nationalism, white supremacy, and an
emerging fascist politics]{.underline}. In an age when economic activity
is divorced from social costs, and matters of truth, justice, and
solidarity become the object of scorn, democracy and the formative
educational culture that legitimates it withers along with the ideals
and institutions that sustain it. At a time when all vestiges of
critical thought are being purged from public schools, women\'s
reproductive rights are under attack, and tyranny translates into
increasing levels of violence, the collapse of conscience, social
responsibility, and justice proceeds at an alarming pace.

Faced with these \"forces of conformity, anti-intellectualism and
authoritarianism,\" Giroux continued, ordinary people tend to \"lose
their capacity to think critically and act responsibly. \...
\[C\]ritical modes of agency wither, opening a space for both oppressive
forms of education and the tyrants that benefit from them. \... \[T\]he
public imagination succumbs to lies, conspiracy theories and the cult of
the strongman. Under such circumstances, the commanding visions of
democracy have not only disappeared, they have given way to the
tyrannical nightmares of an authoritarian future. It is little wonder
that a great many people no longer care or are willing to fight for a
democratic society.

Giroux is not suggesting we need some perfect society of
philosopher-kings to save American democracy from the fascist movement,
but if [the American people remain poorly informed and largely
disengaged the real-life problems caused or exemplified by a failing
democracy will become much worse, creating a toxic feedback loop.
\"There is no democracy without a knowledgeable public and no justice
without a language critical of injustice]{.underline},\" Giroux wrote.
\"Democracy should be a way of thinking about civic culture and the
development of a robust public imagination.\"

### 1NC\-\--Defense\-\--Biod

#### Bio-d's [not existential]{.underline} and try-or-die is [wrong]{.underline}. Nature's a [luxury]{.underline}, not a [necessity]{.underline}. 

**Keim, 19**---freelance journalist whose work has appeared in
publications including The Atlantic, WIRED, National Geographic News,
Aeon, Nautilus, Scientific American Mind, The Guardian, Audubon
Magazine, Grist, Mother Jones, Conservation, NOVA, and Anthropocene
(Brandon, "Conservation for the World We Want," Breakthrough Journal,
No. 11, Summer 2019, dml)

A slogan's purpose, of course, isn't to capture nuance. But there are
ways in which [this **[save-it-or-die]{.mark}** framing
**[rankles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, beginning with the fact that, [at
precisely the same time as **so many** wild lives are
**imperiled**]{.underline}, [**billions** of people are enjoying
**historically unprecedented** prosperity and health]{.underline}. That
is not to say that economic well-being automatically flows from
[nature's destruction]{.underline}, or that future well-being requires
it, but simply that it **[has not]{.underline}** yet [**precluded**
human flourishing]{.underline}.

Returning to megafauna and fire, [Earth is **more
fire-prone**]{.underline} than it once was, [but people have
**managed**]{.underline} --- not without suffering, often with
difficulty, but managed all the same. [The [depletion of
**whale**]{.mark}]{.underline} population**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.mark} **terrestrial [megafauna]{.mark}** reduced nutrient
flows]{.underline} from the deep sea and across landscapes [to a
**trickle**]{.underline}, [but the consequences [were **not
catastrophic**]{.mark}]{.underline} for us. Indeed, [the state of
[nature]{.mark}]{.underline} that conservationists hope to protect, and
present in terms of human self-interest, [[has]{.mark} **already
[been]{.mark} radically [transformed]{.mark}** from just a few thousand
years ago]{.underline} --- not just because of the late Pleistocene mass
extinctions, but also because of the dwindling of what and who remains.

Global **[[turtle]{.underline}]{.mark}**
population**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to pick one little-appreciated
example, [have **[collapsed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Not long ago they
existed in densities that, in terms of total per-hectare biomass, often
outweighed that of African savannah herbivores like elephant and
giraffes. Now turtles "are struggling to persist in the modern world,"
as a recent scientific review described their plight. "Their ecological
roles are now greatly diminished," and "The impacts of their lessened
roles are poorly appreciated and inadequately understood."
[**[Perhaps]{.mark}** the loss of all [that]{.mark}]{.underline} habitat
engineering (many turtles dig burrows that are used by other creatures
and contribute to long-term soil enrichment), seed dispersal, and
nutrient cycling has [**[diminished]{.mark}** human [well-being]{.mark}
in **significant** ways]{.underline}, [but [it's a **hard
arg**]{.mark}**ument** to make right now]{.underline}.

[It is **possible**]{.underline}, of course, [[that the
effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of turtle decline --- and amphibian decline
and bat decline and insect decline and megafauna decline, and on and on
--- [[have not]{.mark} yet [been]{.mark} **fully
[realized]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} that human [societies
are running on a]{.mark} biological]{.underline}
"**[[surplus]{.underline}]{.mark}**" banked over hundreds of millions of
years. By this light, just as people will eventually run out of fuels
derived from whole geological epochs' worth of fossilized plankton and
vegetable matter, so might we exhaust soils nourished by organismal
activity or air filtered by forest communities now missing animals who
once planted their seeds.

Alternatively, one could argue that although even a diminished biosphere
was enough to sustain human prosperity, the current 7.7 billion humans
[and]{.underline} 70 billion domesticated animals they exploit for food
[have **[pushed]{.mark}** that]{.underline} sustenance [[to its
**limits**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Taking these [precautionary
approaches]{.underline}, however, [is **not**]{.underline} quite [the
same as **directly equating** human health]{.underline}, security, and
prosperity [with]{.underline} a recent snapshot of nature --- especially
when that version of "nature" is implicitly equated with **[biological
diversity]{.underline}** and abundance, and even as so much of what we
take from the biosphere comes from simplified ecosystems.

[Tree [plantations **still sequester**]{.mark} carbon dioxide and exhale
oxygen [while generating **wood**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Defaunated
wetlands **still filter**]{.mark} water [and **buffer**]{.mark} against
storms]{.underline}. [[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
**[[food]{.underline}]{.mark}** we eat [[comes from]{.underline}]{.mark}
comparatively [[**low-diversity**
**crop**]{.underline}]{.mark}land**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Restoring]{.underline}, say, **[soil biodiversity]{.underline}** to the
plains of central North America, the world's most productive
agricultural landscape, [is more about **reducing chemical use** and
**changing farming techniques** to ensure]{.underline} their [long-term
productivity than returning them to their **former prairie
glory**]{.underline}.

To be sure, these [human-directed systems are often **less
multifunctional** than higher-biodiversity systems]{.underline}.
[Monoculture tree plantations]{.underline} store less carbon than wild
forests, [and defaunated wild forests store **less carbon**]{.underline}
than those with intact animal communities. [But conceiving of engineered
ecosystems in terms of **[resource yield]{.mark}** and a few other
metrics [is]{.mark} **terribly [reductionist]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Arguably]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} greatest service]{.underline} of
all [is]{.underline} the **[long-term [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that [intact ecologies]{.underline} provide. Species interactions
[and]{.underline} functional [redundancies]{.underline}
[help]{.underline} ecosystems --- and ultimately [the
biosphere]{.underline} itself --- **[adapt]{.underline}** to
environmental fluctuations, regrouping and supporting complex
arrangements of life even when Earth's climate changes or an asteroid
strikes.

[Yet that]{.underline} particular [[service **isn't one that
maps**]{.mark} **neatly** [onto]{.mark}]{.underline} short-term [[human
interests in **wood**]{.mark} **production**]{.underline}, **[clean
[water]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[or **fisheries**]{.mark}
**yield**]{.underline}. And [to **casually say** those benefits come
from]{.underline} "[nature]{.underline}" **[erodes]{.underline}**, or at
least blurs, [what conservationists want to **protect**]{.underline}:
[forms of nature]{.underline} in which communities and processes [found
in the **absence** of humans]{.underline} remain largely intact, and
where human activity doesn't divert their yields without nourishing more
nonhuman life in return. [To view]{.underline}, say, the pollination of
commodity crops by managed **[honeybees]{.underline}** trucked
cross-country [as an example of nature's bounty would be to **diminish**
nature]{.underline}.

2\.

This critique is not intended to downplay the hardships caused by
nature's decline and destruction. The recent Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)
report, which estimated that one in eight species of plants and animals
is now threatened with extinction, enumerates them well. Nature indeed
"sustains the quality of the air, fresh water and soils on which
humanity depends, distributes fresh water, regulates the climate,
provides pollination and pest control and reduces the impact of natural
hazards," and the impacts of ecological disruption are felt most by
people who possess the least.

Ultimately, though, [[human ingenuity can **substitute**]{.mark} for
many of nature's services]{.underline}. [The [results might be
**unpleasant**]{.mark}]{.underline} in many ways --- I'd much rather
rely on bats and earthworms than pesticides and fertilizers ---
[[but]{.mark} they're **[rarely]{.mark} an [existential]{.mark} threat**
to human societies]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} vast,
[**fertilizer-fueled Gulf of Mexico dead zone** is]{.underline} a
**[horrible]{.underline}**, shameful thing and has inflicted hardship on
many people, [but]{.underline} southeastern U.S. coastal [communities
**have not collapsed** because of it]{.underline}.

1.1.3 Engineered pandemics For most of human history, natural pandemics
have posed the greatest risk of mass global fatalities[.]{.underline}37
However, there are some reasons to believe that **[[natural pandemics
are very unlikely to cause human extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Analysis of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
red list database has shown that [[of]{.mark} the 833
recorded]{.underline} plant and animal [[species
extinctions]{.underline}]{.mark} known to have occurred [since 1500,
[less than 4%]{.mark} (31 species) [were]{.mark} ascribed to [infectious
disease]{.mark}]{.underline}.38 [[None]{.mark} of the mammals and
amphibians on this list [were globally dispersed, and other
factors]{.mark} aside from infectious disease also [contributed]{.mark}
to their extinction. It therefore seems that [our]{.mark} own
[species]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark} very **[numerous]{.mark}**, globally
[**dispersed**, and capable of]{.mark} a **[rational response]{.mark}**
to problems, **[is very unlikely to be killed off by a natural
pandemic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One underlying explanation for this is
that [[highly lethal pathogens]{.mark} can [kill their hosts before
they]{.mark} have a chance to [spread, so **there is a selective
pressure for pathogens not to be highly lethal**]{.mark}. Therefore,
pathogens are likely to co-evolve with their hosts rather than kill all
possible hosts]{.underline}.39

Certain, Climate Panel Warns. But How Hot Is Up to Us,\"
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/climate/climate-change-report-ipcc-un.html\]

[Humans have already heated the planet by roughly 1.1 degrees
Celsius]{.underline}, or 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the 19th century,
largely by burning coal, oil and gas for energy. [And the consequences
can be felt across the globe:]{.underline} This summer alone, blistering
heat waves have killed hundreds of people in the United States and
Canada, floods have devastated Germany and China, and wildfires have
raged out of control in Siberia, Turkey and Greece.

But that's only the beginning, [according to the report,
issued]{.underline} on Monday [by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change,]{.underline} [a body of scientists convened by the United
Nations. Even if nations started sharply cutting emissions today, total
global warming is likely to rise around 1.5 degrees Celsius within the
next two decades]{.underline}, a **[hotter future that is now
essentially locked in.]{.underline}**

[At 1.5 degrees of warming,]{.underline} scientists have found, [the
dangers grow considerably]{.underline}. Nearly 1 billion people
worldwide could swelter in more frequent life-threatening heat waves.
[Hundreds of millions more would struggle for water because of severe
droughts.]{.underline} Some animal and plant species alive today will be
gone. Coral reefs, which sustain fisheries for large swaths of the
globe, will suffer more frequent mass die-offs.

"[We can expect a significant jump in extreme weather over the next 20
or 30 years]{.underline}," said Piers Forster, a climate scientist at
the University of Leeds and one of hundreds of international experts who
helped write the report. "Things are unfortunately likely to get worse
than they are today."

[Loss of muscle mass:]{.underline} life is too easy for our muscles in
zero gravity and they melt away;

[Weakening of the heart]{.underline}: with less effort to make, it
becomes weaker and rounder;

Fluids (blood, lymphatic system) flow upwards to the upper parts of the
body. [Our entire vascular system is designed to fight gravity and pump
upwards,]{.underline} which it continues to do even when gravity is
gone;

[Risk of thrombosis: as a result of the above two points, the blood
circulates less quickly and can clot]{.underline};

Disturbance of the inner ear: our balance organ functions thanks to the
weight of small crystals on hair cells, and without gravity that is
lost.

The loss of muscle mass and the weakening of the heart can be partially
countered by a strict discipline of daily exercise. On the ISS,
astronauts do two hours of intense fitness (cardio and weight training)
per day, and yet they are very weak when they return to Earth. Bone
decalcification is also slowed down by weight training but remains one
of the most worrying issues for the health of potential Martian
astronauts, as a fracture could prove fatal on Mars. Vascular problems
are also considered extremely dangerous.

The limits of artificial gravity, radiation and the human psyche

Could gravity be recreated on the Mars spacecraft? It is known that in a
rotating system, the centrifugal force produces an acceleration that can
be used to recreate an equivalent of gravity. Unfortunately[, there is
not enough room on a spacecraft to incorporate a centrifuge in which
cosmonauts could spend a few hours a week]{.underline}, which would be
sufficient to reduce the physiological damage of microgravity.

Could the spacecraft itself be rotated? In Hollywood, yes, it\'s easy!
But in real life, it\'s a different story. Given that a spinning
spacecraft would solve all the problems associated with weightlessness,
the fact that no space agency is banking on such a development shows
that it is totally out of our reach conceptually, technically and
financially.

[The second major problem]{.underline} faced by potential future
Mars-bound astronauts [is that of radiation in space. The Earth\'s
double protection]{.underline} (atmosphere and magnetosphere) [partially
blocks or deflects UV rays and totally blocks X-rays and gamma rays as
well as solar wind particles and cosmic rays]{.underline}. This
protection has been compared to the equivalent of a 30-metre-thick
concrete wall, or one made of 80 centimetres of lead. Once they leave
this natural barrier, it is essential that the astronauts be protected
in other ways, by means of the spaceship\'s insulation and/or individual
shields. Despite these protections, it is estimated that Martian
astronauts would receive the maximum accepted radiation for an
astronaut\'s entire career over the course of their mission, with just
over half of this occurring during the outward and return journeys.

[A third major problem identified by the space agencies is human
psychology]{.underline}. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet cites a good
example of the psychological pressure astronauts face on the ISS: you
know there will inevitably be problems during your stay, but you don\'t
want to be the one to cause them. [The pressure on a Mars-bound crew
would be infinitely greater, as there would be no help available to them
in the event of a major problem.]{.underline} On the ISS, astronauts can
be returned to Earth within three hours. Th[e Martian astronauts would
be left to their own devices for the two-and-a-half years of their
mission, knowing that the slightest error or failure,]{.underline}
whether technical or human[, could result in the death of the entire
crew. It is impossible to test such a psychological situation on
Earth]{.underline}. The Mars 500 psychological isolation experiment
conducted by the European Space Agency developed methods of conflict
resolution, but it is in no way representative of the real conditions of
a voyage to Mars.

There are also direct and indirect effects that TNCs have on health
systems. For example, transnational drug companies provide essential
inputs, but their [operations result in [increased social
inequality]{.mark} and problematic [access issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
High-value added basic research remains clustered around universities

Indirectly, TNCs [negatively impact tax revenues used to fund health
systems]{.underline} and social programs through dubious accounting
methods like corporate inversions, debt shifting, and transfer pricing.
Not surprisingly, activists have targeted TNCs usurping natural
resources, charging exorbitant prices on life-saving medicines,
exploiting sweatshop labor, and creating ecological disasters.
Bolivia\'s "Water Wars" is a case in point where popular mobilization of
irrigation workers, farmers, teachers, factory workers, students, and
others, organized strikes, blockades, referendum, and investigations
that succeeded in putting a public water company under social control
instead of a monopoly by Bechtal corporation ([[Waitzkin,
2018]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0277953620307498#bib87)).
Alternative economic arrangements such as the solidarity economy based
on co-management, democratic decision-making beyond profit and state
controls offers to protect worker\'s rights and health ([[Birn et al.,
2017]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0277953620307498#bib5)).
In terms of health inputs, the non-profit collaboration Drugs for
Neglected Disease initiative has six new treatments, 12 new molecular
entities, and twelve clinical trials---all geared for public health---at
a fraction of the cost reported by for-profit drug companies to develop
medicines for public health goals ([[Light,

Still, more work is needed to assess the various harmful impacts of
TNCs, identify best strategies for changing corporate behavior, and
implement policies mitigating their negative health impacts ([[Baum and

Abstract Are IPRs institutions meant to foster innovative activities or
conversely to secure appropriation and profitability? Taking stock of a
long-term empirical evidence on the pharmaceutical sector in the US, we
can **[[hardly support IPRs]{.underline}]{.mark}** intended [[as
an]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[innovation rewarding
institution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to our analysis, pharma
patents have [constituted legal barriers to protect]{.underline}
intellectual [[monopolies rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[incentive]{.mark}]{.underline} and a [[reward to innovative
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Patenting strategies appear to be quite
aggressive in extending knowledge borders and enlarging the space
protected from the possibility of infringements. This is also witnessed
by the fact that patent applications are very [[skewed in]{.mark} the
covered [trade names]{.mark} and [patent thickness expands over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Conversely, the number of patents
protecting new drugs approved by the FDA which draw upon
government-sponsored research -- as such a mark for quality -- falls.
Firm-level analysis on profitability confirms strong correlation,
restricted to listed pharmaceutical firms, between patent portfolio and
profit margins.

1 Introduction Two distinctive roles have been attributed to
intellectual property rights (IPRs hereafter) by the economic
literature, namely, IPRs as incentives to undertake innovative
activities and IPRs as forms of appropriation (Dosi, Marengo, and
Pasquali 2006). As well acknowledged for instance by Adam Smith, Karl
Marx and Joseph Schumpeter, just to mention the classics, expensive
search efforts by [[profit-motivated agents]{.mark} imply some
[departure from]{.mark} purely [competitive
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the two crucial issues
concern, first, the extent of such a departure, that is the actual or
expected extra-profit necessary to trigger innovative search, and,
second, the possible monotonicity in the relation between such a
departure and the intensity of innovative effort. Such questions are
particularly thorny with respect to the scope and breadth of patents. In
one perspective, which we may call the incentive view, patents, by
restricting the possibility of imitation, grant the innovator a monopoly
rent which should motivate ex-ante and compensate ex-post the R&D
investment. In the alternative perspective, which we may call the
opportunity view, innovative activities are primarily driven by the
richness of opportunities of technological advances, while patents
represent intellectual barriers to innovation and obstacles to its
diffusion. Whether being institutional forms embraced to secure rents or
to ensure legitimate profits, both streams recognize patents as creators
of intellectual monopolies, even if in the former case they are a
necessary evil to drive the "unbound Prometheus" of innovation in
capitalist societies, while in the latter case they are primarily a
mechanism of generation of unproductive rents. Among all sectors, the
[[pharmaceutical]{.underline}]{.mark} one has been recognised to be one
of the [most [**dependent** on patents]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [to
ensure]{.underline} its [intellectual monopoly]{.underline}. The
reliance of pharma on patents -- it is commonly claimed -- [[descends
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the very [[nature of]{.mark} its [production
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on very low reproduction costs, and
facing instead almost [exclusively entry costs in terms of knowledge
generation.]{.underline} Given the potential easy replication of the
knowledge embedded in a product (Dosi and Nelson 2010), patents ensure a
temporary [[exclusive use of]{.mark} such [knowledge]{.mark} [which
would]{.mark} instead [be]{.mark} easily [acquired by
competitors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, the knowledge embedded
into pharmaceutical patents is often discrete and might be well confined
into claims, therefore quite apt to be patented (Orsenigo and Sterzi
2010). This work [[challenges]{.mark} the [correspondence between
patents and innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let us start by noticing
that historical records of drug search (see for instance the monumental
history of drug discovery in Sneader (2005)) show that until very
recently it has been mainly driven by search heuristics for discovery
and experimentation very far from mere appropriation objectives, even
when undertaken within corporate laboratories. More specifically, the
modern pharmaceutical industry was born -- mainly in Germany -- under a
regime of basically non-existent patent protection and then, after 1877,
thrived under a regime of rather weak protection of processes rather
than products. Still, the chemical/pharmaceutical oligopolies -- later
[[merged]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1925 into one [[monopolist
firm]{.underline},]{.mark} IG Farben1 -- were able to [reap **[hefty
profits stemming from]{.mark} the integration of ["pure" scientific
research]{.mark}**]{.underline} in close collaboration with
universities, applied product-oriented research, industrialization and
scaling-up of production, market penetration, and product
diversification. At the turn of the 20th century, the leading German
dyestuff companies were paying annual dividends between 18 and 26%
(Plumpe 1991). The German chemical/pharmaceutical industry is the first
one to enter the era of modern monopoly capitalism. We use this term as
a shorthand to mean industrial regimes characterized by a) the visible
hand (Chandler 1977) of either few oligopolistic firms, or indeed a
monopoly like the one of IG Farben in 1920's and 1930's Germany, or of
platform firms nowadays; and b) the ability of these oligopolists or
monopolist to secure a sustained stream of differential profits/rents.
Monopoly capitalism may be either due to complementary assets (Teece
1986) and distinct organizational capabilities (like those just
mentioned with reference to the 19th century German chemical industry),
or due to the consequences of the extreme increasing returns nature of
information-intensive activities (such as those associated with the
contemporary platform technologies), or due to the sheer outcome of
monopolistic rights over crucial tangible or intangible assets such as
patents.

#### Corporations are [weaponizing]{.underline} patents. 

**Gubby, 19** \[Helen Gubby works for Erasmus University, 9/26/19,
accessed on 7-18-2022, Onlinelibrary.wiley, \"Is the Patent System a
Barrier to Inclusive Prosperity? The Biomedical Perspective\",
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12730\]/ISEE

As the economy has largely shifted from industrial manufacturing to
high-tech, life science and information processing industries,
[[intellectual property h]{.mark}as become more and more important.
Corporations have become increasingly **aware** of the [potential of the
patent]{.mark}, not just as a shield to **protect** against
**imitation**, but [as a strategic tool to block competition]{.mark} and
dominate markets.]{.underline} Patents have come to [have a broader
strategic function in which innovation may only play a small
part.]{.underline} Although many patents do not produce any income: 'In
terms of strategy, though, the patent can be much more valuable'
(Macdonald, 2004, p. 143). [Patent **strategy** is directly related to
the business context.]{.underline} The Carnegie Mellon Survey of the US
manufacturing sector in 1994 revealed that firms often used patents as
strategic tools, rather than as simply a means of protecting an
invention from wrongful imitation (Cohen et al., 2000). In their
examination of motives to patent, Blind et al. (2009) recognised that,
although protection from imitation was still the most important factor,
'the importance of the strategic motives to patent are confirmed' (Blind
et al., 2006, p. 671). [Patent strategies The decision to
**pa[tent]{.mark}** [has becom]{.mark}e in part [**uncoupled** from the
original core]{.mark} purpose of the patent: to [protect an
**invention** from unfair]{.mark} **imitation** by other market
participants. [Larger firms]{.mark}, with the capital assets to pay for
the cost of patenting, use their patent portfolios strategically.
Patents have become [useful as bargaining chips; they provide
leverag]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}. Large patent portfolios are a
means to get access [to important co-operations or cross-licensing
arrangements]{.underline} (Blind et al., 2009, p. 431). [Yet while
building [the portfolio requires enormous legal costs, it contributes
little to research incentives]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, these
portfolios can be used not just to oblige competitors to take licences,
but also the terms of these licences can restrict competitors to certain
areas of technology (Barton, 2000). Larger firms can afford to play the
'wrap around' strategy. Instead of applying for a single patent to cover
an invention, other patents are filed around the main patent. These
related patents lock down the discrete features of an invention. The
tactic hinders entry to the market. [Competitors will be put to time,
effort and cost to fight their way through all the relevant patents
covering the technology. Furthermore, the chance that the competitor\'s
invention may infringe one of the many claims in one of the many patents
is high.]{.underline} Not only can damages be awarded for infringement,
but also an injunction. Injunctions prevent the party accused of
infringement from producing any products that require the use of the
technology covered by the infringed patent and all infringing products
are removed from the market. [Patents may be used simply to block
competitors. Using a patent as a blocking strategy is common
practice]{.underline} (Neuhäusler, 2012). [Defensive blocking is used to
protect a firm\'s own freedom to operate: it does not want to be shut
out by the patents of its rivals]{.underline}. An offensive blocking
strategy is where patents are filed to cover products or processes that
the firm does not intend to practice itself, but which could be viable
alternatives to competitors. [By patenting all conceivable alternatives,
research by competitors that might threaten their own technological lead
can be thwarted. As in general a **patentee** is under no obligation to
license out its technology to another, the strategy can deter market
entry or new product launch]{.underline}. This offensive blocking of
competitors by means of patents, 'is clearly a case of the patent system
being used for purposes other than for which it was originally intended'
(Blind, 2009, p. 436). However, [both [defensive and **offensive
blocking** should be a policy concern, as they can reduce **economic**
efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Defensive patenting increases
cost to firms without necessarily producing any benefit and offensive
patenting can reduce technological progress and increase consumer costs
by reducing competition (Thumm, 2004, p. 533). Using data from a
large-scale survey of patent applications, Torrisi discovered that a
substantial share of patents remained unused and a substantial number of
patent applications were filed to block other patents. There were
institutional differences; there were more unused patents in Japan and
the EU than in the USA. Although cautious to make generalisations about
unused patents, as some unused patents are there to ensure freedom to
operate or simply because of management inefficiency, Torrisi et al. did
conclude that: '\[o\]ur results highlight that there might be
substantial benefits that patent owners draw from being able to keep
patent rights unused. These would have to be balanced against possible
harm imposed on other economic agents' (Torrisi et al., 2016; , p.
1384). [These strategies show a disconnect with the original purpose of
the patent system. [Patent strategies impact on innovation, and this in
turn impacts on socie]{.mark}]{.underline}[ty. Concern]{.mark} was
already expressed quite forcibly some years ago by Turner: Surely when
the framers of the \[US\] Constitution empowered [Congress to [grant
monopolies to 'promote the progress of science and the
useful]{.mark}]{.underline} arts', they did not envision the
beneficiaries of this grant would use it to bury new technologies to
protect market share or capital investments. (Turner, 1998, p.209)
Administrative failures Patent offices have been struggling to cope with
the increasing number of patent applications: in 2017, more than 3
million patent applications were filed worldwide (WIPO, 2018). This
influx has resulted in substantial application backlogs, with an
increasingly long time between the patent filing and the patent grant:
five years is not unusual. Complaints of poor quality control have been
made concerning the US Patent and Trademark Office as well as the
European Patent Office (Abbott, 2004; Mabey, 2010). The WIPO recognised
a consistent upward trend in patent filings is putting patent offices
under enormous pressure (WIPO, 2017, p. 13). Why are these
administrative failings dangerous from a societal perspective? Patents
grant a monopoly that can impact innovative processes for 20 years or
more. Patents have been granted that should not have been granted. When
an overly broad patent is granted, this can block further innovation by
others. Broad patents may mean that access to vital research is not
available because the results of that [research are covered by patent
claims. In particular, broad basic patents on fundamental research can
block and deter follow-on research.]{.underline} The incentive to
innovate is reduced (Barton, 2000; Henry and Stiglitz, 2010).1 Back in
1966, [the societal implication of overly broad grants was expressed
clearly by the US Supreme Court when it rejected a broad claim covering
a group of chemicals: 'Such a patent may confer power to block off whole
areas of scientific development without compensating benefits to the
public]{.underline}.'2

#### IP protections are vital to resolve vaccine deficiencies. History disproves all pro patent arguments 

**Kumar, PhD, 7-12-21** (Rajeesh, Associate Fellow Manohar Parrikar
Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis,
https://www.idsa.in/issuebrief/wto-trips-waiver-covid-vaccine-rkumar-120721)

In October 2020, [India and South Africa]{.underline} had [submitted a
proposal to the]{.underline} World Trade Organization ([WTO), suggesting
a waiver of]{.underline} certain provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects
of [Intellectual Property Rights]{.underline} (TRIPS) Agreement [for the
"prevention, containment and treatment of COVID-19".]{.underline} The
proposal seeks the waiver of "the implementation, application, and
enforcement of sections 1, 4, 5 and 7 of part II of the TRIPS
agreement", which are stipulations referring to copyright, industrial
design, patents, and undisclosed information (trade secrets).1 The
[proponents]{.underline} of the proposal [argue]{.underline} that [[a
waiver will **enable timely and equitable access** to]{.mark} affordable
health products and technologies, including
[vaccines]{.mark}.]{.underline} Though many member countries had
supported and co-sponsored the proposal, [a small but influential group
of countries]{.underline}, mainly Australia, Canada, the European Union
(EU), Japan, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US[),
opposed it]{.underline}. [They argued]{.underline} that
[existing]{.underline} [exceptions]{.underline} under the TRIPS
Agreement [are sufficient]{.underline} to address the concerns mentioned
in the proposal. This resulted in sidelining of the waiver proposal for
months. However, on 5 May 2021, the Joseph Biden administration
announced its support for waiving intellectual property protections for
COVID-19 vaccines.2 It was a significant step towards breaking the
seven-month gridlock, and led to many more countries modifying their
position on the waiver proposal. On 25 May 2021, the co-sponsors of the
waiver proposal submitted a revised proposal that specified the scope of
the waiver as applying to "health products and technologies" and also
added a section on the proposed duration of the waiver, i.e., three
years.3 At present, more than 100 countries, including the US and China
support this proposal. The principal opponent of the waiver is the EU
and in June 2021, it submitted an alternative proposal to the TRIPS
Council, which requested to keep TRIPS' provisions intact and focused on
compulsory licensing and removing vaccine export restrictions to address
the concerns raised by India and South Africa.4 The EU proposal also
stated that the TRIPS Agreement does not prevent countries from taking
measures to protect public health.5 At the meeting of the TRIPS Council
on 8--9 June 2021, the member states agreed to text-based negotiations
focusing on two proposals tabled by members. The members also decided to
hold a series of meetings till the end of July 2021 to take stock of the
text-based negotiations. However, the latest developments show that the
waiver discussions hit a hurdle due to a split between the developed and
developing countries over the negotiation text. This brief discusses how
TRIPS becomes a barrier to the equitable access of COVID-19 vaccines. It
also examines how a waiver will help India in its fight against COVID-19
at home and abroad. TRIPS and its Exceptions TRIPS, a comprehensive
multilateral agreement on Intellectual Property (IP), was an outcome of
the Uruguay Round (1986--94) of negotiations of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Agreement came into force on 1 January
1995 and offers a minimum standard of protection for Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR).6 In WTO, IPR are divided into two main
categories. First, copyright and related rights (Articles 9 to 14, Part
II of the TRIPS Agreement). Second, industrial property that includes
trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, patents,
integrated circuit layout designs, and undisclosed information (Articles
15 to 38, Part II of the TRIPS Agreement).7 Article IX.3 and IX.4 of the
Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO deals with TRIPS waivers.
Article IX.3 says that in "exceptional circumstances" the Ministerial
Conference may waive off an obligation imposed on WTO member countries.8
Such a decision requires the support of three-fourths of the WTO
membership. According to Article IX.4, any waiver granted for more than
one year will be reviewed by the Ministerial Conference. Based on the
annual review, the Conference may extend, modify, or terminate the
waiver. The TRIPS Agreement provides some flexibility primarily in the
form of compulsory licensing and research exceptions through Articles 30
and 31. While Article 30 permits WTO members to make limited exceptions
to patent rights, Article 31 provides a detailed exception, provided
certain conditions are met. Compulsory licensing is the process of
granting a license by a government to use a patent without the patent
holder\'s consent. Article 31 permits granting compulsory license under
circumstances such as "national emergencies", "other circumstances of
extreme urgency", "public noncommercial use", or against
"anti-competitive" practices.9 In addition to these original waivers,
the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, adopted at the
2001 Doha Ministerial Meeting, also recognises some exceptions, for
instance, in situations of a public health emergency, member countries
have the freedom to determine the grounds upon which compulsory licenses
are granted. Similarly, under Article 66.1, the least developed
countries (LDCs) are given waivers for implementing TRIPS on
pharmaceuticals till 1 January 2033. COVID-19 and TRIPS Waiver [Two
significant factors rekindled the debate on TRIPS waiver for essential
medical products---first, vaccine inequity, and second, the
insufficiency of existing waiver provisions in fighting the COVID-19
pandemic. [COVID]{.mark}-19 [is an **exceptional circumstance**]{.mark},
and **[equitable global access]{.mark}** to the vaccine [is necessary to
**bring the pandemic under control**]{.mark}. However, the world is
witnessing quite the reverse, i.e., **vaccine
nationalism**]{.underline}. [Vaccine nationalism is "my nation first"
approach to securing and stockpiling vaccines before making them
available in other countries. [A TRIPS waiver would be instrumental in
addressing]{.mark} the **[growing inequality in]{.mark} the
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}, distribution, and pricing of the
COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine Inequity According to Duke Global Health
Innovation Center, which monitors COVID-19 vaccine purchases, [rich
nations representing just 14 per cent of the world population have
bought up to 53 per cent of the most promising vaccines so
far.]{.underline} As of 4 July 2021, the high-income countries (HICs)
purchased more than half (6.16 billion) vaccine doses sold globally. [At
the same time, the low-income countries (LICs) received only 0.3 per
cent of the vaccines produced]{.underline}. The low and middle-income
countries (LMICs), which account for 81 per cent of the global adult
population, purchased 33 per cent, and COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global
Access) has received 13 per cent.10 Many HICs bought enough doses to
vaccinate their populations several times over. For instance, Canada
procured 10.45 doses per person, while the UK, EU and the US procured
8.18, 6.89, and 4.60 doses per inhabitant, respectively.11
Source:"Tracking COVID-19 Vaccine Purchases Across the Globe", Duke
Global Health Innovation Center, Updated 9 July 2021. [Consequently,
there is a significant disparity between HICs and LICs in vaccine
administration]{.underline} as well. [As of 8 July 2021, 3.32 billion
vaccine doses had been administered globally.12 Nonetheless, [**only one
per cent** of people in LICs have been given]{.mark} at least [one
dose]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While in HICs almost one in four people have
received the vaccine, in LICs, it is one in more than 500.]{.underline}
The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that about 90 per cent of
African countries will miss the September target to vaccinate at least
10 per cent of their populations as a third wave looms on the
continent.13 South Africa, the most affected African country, for
instance, has vaccinated less than two per cent of its population of
about 59 million. This is in contrast with the US where almost 47.5 per
cent of the population of more than 330 million has been fully
vaccinated. In Sub-Saharan Africa, vaccine rollout remains the slowest
in the world. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), at
current rates, by the end of 2021, a massive global inequity will
continue to exist, with Africa still experiencing meagre vaccination
rates while other parts of the world move much closer to complete
vaccination.14 [This [vaccine inequity is]{.mark} not only morally
indefensible but also **clinically
[counter-productive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If this situation prevails,
[LICs could be waiting until 2025 for vaccinating half of their
people]{.mark}. Allowing most of the world's population to go
unvaccinated [will]{.mark} also **[spawn new virus mutations, more
contagious viruses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [leading to a [steep rise in
COVID]{.mark}-19 cases. Such a scenario could cause **twice as many
deaths** as against distributing them globally, on a priority
basis]{.underline}. [[Preventing this]{.mark} humanitarian catastrophe
[requires **removing all barriers**]{.mark} to the production and
distribution of vaccines.]{.underline} TRIPS is one such barrier that
prevents vaccine production in LMICs and hence its equitable
distribution. TRIPS: Barrier to Equitable Health Care Access The
[[opponents]{.mark} of the waiver]{.underline} proposal
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[IPR are not a]{.mark} significant
[barrier]{.mark} to equitable access]{.underline} to health care, and
existing TRIPS flexibilities are sufficient to address the COVID-19
pandemic. **[However, [history suggests the
contrary]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For instance, [when South Africa passed
the Medicines and Related Substances Act]{.underline} of 1997 to address
the HIV/AIDS public health crisis, nearly 40 of world's largest and
[influential pharma companies took the South African government to
court]{.underline} over the violation of TRIPS. The Act, which invoked
the compulsory licensing provision, allowed South Africa to produce
affordable generic drugs.15 The Big Pharma also lobbied developed
countries, particularly the US, to put bilateral trade sanctions against
South Africa.16 [Similarly, when Indian company Cipla decided to provide
generic antiretrovirals]{.underline} (ARVs) to the African market at a
lower cost, [Big Pharma retaliated through patent
litigations]{.underline} in Indian and international trade courts and
branded Indian drug companies as thieves.17 Another instance was when
Swiss company Roche initiated patent infringement proceedings against
Cipla's decision to launch a generic version of cancer drug,
"erlotinib". Though the Delhi High Court initially dismissed Roche\'s
appeal by citing "public interest" and "affordability of medicines," the
continued to pressure the generic pharma companies over IPR. 18
Likewise, Pfizer's aggressive patenting strategy prevented South Korea
in developing pneumonia vaccines for children.19 [A recent document
by]{.underline} Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), or [Doctors Without
Borders, highlights various instances of how **[IP hinders
manufacturing]{.mark} and supply of diagnostics,** medical equipment,
treatments and vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline}. For
instance, [during the peak of the COVID-19 first wave in Europe, Roche
rejected a request from the Netherlands to release the recipe of key
chemical reagents needed to increase the production of diagnostic
kits]{.underline}. Another example was patent holders threatening
producers of 3D printing ventilators with patent infringement lawsuits
in Italy.20 The MSF also found that [patents pose a severe threat to
access to affordable versions of newer vaccines.]{.underline}21
Source:"COVID-19 Vaccine R&D Investments", Global Health Centre,
Graduate Institute, Geneva, Updated 9 July 2021. The [[opponents]{.mark}
of the TRIPS waiver]{.underline} also [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[IP is the incentive for innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and if it
is undermined, future innovation will suffer. [However, [most]{.mark} of
the [COVID]{.mark}-19 medical [innovations]{.mark}, particularly
vaccines, [are developed with]{.mark} **[public financing]{.mark}
assistance**]{.underline}. [Governments spent billions]{.underline} of
dollars [[for COVID]{.mark}-19 vaccine research]{.underline}. Notably,
[out of \$6.1 billion in investment tracked up to July 2021**,
[98]{.mark}.12** [per cent]{.mark} was public funding]{.underline}.22
The US and Germany are the largest investors in vaccine R&D with \$2.2
billion and \$1.5 billion funding. Source:"COVID-19 Vaccine R&D
Investments", Global Health Centre, Graduate Institute, Geneva, Updated
9 July 2021. [Private companies received 94.6 per cent of this
funding]{.underline}; Moderna received the highest \$956.3 million and
Janssen \$910.6 million. Moreover, [governments also invested \$50.9
billion for advance purchase agreements]{.underline} (APAs) [as an
incentive for vaccine development]{.underline}. [A recent IMF working
paper also notes that [public research institutions]{.mark} were a key
driver of the COVID-19 R&D effort---[accounting for 70 per cent
of]{.mark} all [COVID]{.mark}-19 clinical [trials]{.mark}
globally.]{.underline}23 [The argument is that vaccines are developed
with the support of substantial public financing, hence there is a
public right to the scientific achievements]{.underline}. [Moreover,
private companies reaped billions in profits from COVID-19
vaccines]{.underline}. Source: Katharina Buchholz, "COVID-19 Vaccines
Lift Pharma Company Profits", Statista, 17 May 2021. [One could
argue]{.underline} that [since the US, Germany and]{.underline} other
[HICs are spending money, their citizens are entitled to get vaccines
first]{.underline}, hence [vaccine nationalism is morally
defensible]{.underline}. Nonetheless**[, it is not the
case]{.underline}**. The [TRIPS]{.underline} Agreement [includes several
provisions which mandates promotion of technology transfer]{.underline}
from developed countries to LDCs. For instance, Article 7 states that
\"the protection and enforcement of IP rights should contribute to the
promotion of technological innovation and the transfer and dissemination
of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of
technical knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic
welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.\"24 Similarly,
Article 66.2 also mandates the developed countries to transfer
technologies to LDCs to enable them to create a sound and viable
technological base. [The LMICs opened their markets and amended domestic
patent laws favouring developing countries' products against this
promise of technology transfer]{.underline}. [[Another
argument]{.underline}]{.mark} against the proposed TRIPS waiver [[is
that a waiver]{.underline} [would not increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[manufacturing]{.mark} of COVID-19 vaccines]{.underline}. Indeed, one
of the significant factors contributing to vaccine inequity is the lack
of manufacturing capacity in the global south. Further, a TRIPS waiver
will not automatically translate into improved manufacturing capacity.
**[However, [a waiver would be the first but essential step to increase
manufacturing capacity]{.mark} worldwid]{.underline}**e. For instance,
[[to export]{.mark} COVID-19 [vaccine]{.mark}-related products,
[countries need to ensure]{.mark} that [there are no IP
restrictions]{.mark} at both ends --]{.underline} exporting and
importing. The market for vaccine materials includes consumables,
single-use reactors bags, filters, culture media, and vaccine
ingredients. [Export blockages on raw materials, equipment and finished
products harm the overall output of the vaccine supply chain. If there
is no TRIPS restriction, [more governments]{.mark} and companies [will
invest in repurposing their facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly,
[the [arguments]{.mark} such as [that]{.mark} no other
[manufacturers]{.mark} can carry out the complex manufacturing process
of COVID-19 vaccines and generic manufacturing as that [**would
jeopardise quality**, have]{.mark} also [been **proven wrong**]{.mark}
**in the past**.]{.underline} For instance[, in the early 1990s, when
Indian company Shantha Biotechnics approached a Western firm for a
technology transfer of Hepatitis B vaccine, the firm
responded]{.underline} that "India cannot afford such high technology
vaccines... And even if you can afford to buy the technology, [your
scientists cannot understand recombinant technology in the least."25
Later, Shantha Biotechnics developed its own vaccine at \$1 per dose,
and the UNICEF]{.underline} (United Nations Children's Emergency Fund)
[mass inoculation programme uses this vaccine against Hepatitis
B]{.underline}. In 2009, Shantha sold over 120 million doses of vaccines
globally. India also produces high-quality generic drugs for HIV/AIDS
and cancer treatment and markets them across the globe. Now, a couple of
Indian companies are in the last stage of producing mRNA (Messenger RNA)
vaccines.26 Similarly, Bangladesh and Indonesia claimed that they could
manufacture millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses a year if pharmaceutical
companies share the know-how.27 Recently, Vietnam also said that the
country could satisfy COVID-19 vaccine production requirements once it
obtains vaccine patents.28 Countries like the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Turkey, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina and South Korea have the capacity
to produce high-quality vaccines but lack technologies and know-how.
However, Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia have
limited manufacturing capacities, which could also produce COVID-19
vaccines after repurposing. Moreover, COVID-19 vaccine IPR runs across
the entire value chain -- vaccine development, production, use, etc. A
mere patent waiver may not be enough to address the issues related to
its production and distribution. [What is more important here is to
share the technical know-how and information such as trade secrets.
Therefore, the [existing TRIPS flexibilities]{.mark}, such as compulsory
and voluntary licensing, [are insufficient]{.mark} to address this
crisis. Further, compulsory licensing and the domestic legal procedures
it requires is cumbersome and not expedient in a public health crisis
like the COVID-19 pandemic]{.underline}.

#### Patent system often [stifles]{.underline} the innovation it was designed to encourage.

**Freilich and Meurer, 21** \[Michael J. Meurer is a Professor of Law,

Over his career Thomas Edison garnered more U.S. patents than anyone in
his time. Edison profited from his patents, but he was also exposed to
the dark side of the patent system. He had to contend with lawsuits by
other patentees who sought -- and sometimes won -- a piece of his
success. While the patent system is designed to spur innovation like
Edison's, it also hampers it. [Easy [**copying** and imitation
discourage]{.mark} **innovation**, because why make the effort if
someone else will profit from it? The [**patent** system works by
enabling **inventors** to block]{.mark} unauthorized [use of
**patented** technology]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most technologies are
developed by many inventors over many years, a process called
"cumulative" innovation. [Too often, however, [early
**inventors**]{.mark} get a [patent]{.mark} on a small and [perhaps
**insignificant piece of the technological puzzle**]{.mark}, yet their
patent covers the entire puzzle. [Inventors]{.mark} who solve subsequent
parts of the puzzle may need to [pay royalties]{.mark} to the patentee,
[even if]{.mark} their [contributions]{.mark} are
[larger]{.mark}.]{.underline} As legal experts who focus on technology
law and policy, we suggest that the problem boils down to two issues:
[too many patents and too little accurate information about
them]{.underline}. [The U.S. is awash in patents. Over 350,000 U.S.
patents were granted in 2019, four times the per capita rate in
1980]{.underline}. From the perspective of research managers at big
firms, patents are cheap and easy to get. For example, in the early
2000s Bill Gates decided that Microsoft was patent-poor, and within a
few years the company increased annual patent applications by 50%.
[[Patents are easy to]{.mark} get because [the standards of
patentability are low]{.mark} and because the burden is on the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office to [**prove** an invention is not
patentable]{.mark}. Patent [examination is **slow**.]{.mark} It often
takes [three **years** or more]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite increased
staffing, the backlog of patent applications has continued to grow, and
examiners spend on average only 20 hours reviewing each application. The
patent examiner is required to read and understand the invention in an
application, determine whether the invention meets the claims of the
application, search existing technology to see if the invention already
exists and write a response to the application. Helter-skelter
examination causes errors -- many patents are too broad, or they cover
obvious inventions. To draw attention to problems caused by the flood of
low-quality patents, billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban endowed a chair
at the Electronic Frontier Foundation dedicated to elimination of
"stupid patents." [Innovative firms that succeed in assembling many
pieces of a technology puzzle into a finished product must consult with
a patent lawyer to learn whether their new technology is covered by one
or more patents owned by others. Ideally an innovator will get
permission to use patented technology, usually for a fee, or redesign
its technology to steer clear of relevant patents.]{.underline} In
practice this [patent "clearance" process is difficult, costly and
sometimes impossible]{.underline}. For technologies like smartphones[, a
patent attorney likely would need to review hundreds of patents,
including many patents that are not granted until long after the new
product is launched. Failure to license relevant patents creates a risk
of litigation and the threat the new technology could be forced out of
the **marketplace**.]{.underline} As a result, smartphone patent
litigation is far too common. Apple -- a smartphone pioneer -- has
participated in scores of lawsuits around the globe as both a defendant
and plaintiff. As a plaintiff, Apple sometimes uses its patents
opportunistically to hinder innovation by its rivals. For example, Apple
sued Samsung using a patent that claimed the slide-to-unlock feature on
a phone as Apple's invention. Despite strong evidence that inventors
before Apple had already accomplished the key steps to implement this
feature, Apple convinced the courts that their version of this feature
was patentable, and after seven years Samsung agreed to pay license fees
to Apple to settle the case. [Economic research **suggests** that these
[litigation costs and license fees burden innovative firms]{.mark} to
such a degree that on balance [the patent system discourages
innovation]{.mark}. In other words, [innovative firms gain a benefit
from their patents on their new technology]{.mark}, but that [benefit is
more than offset by the many patents owned by others]{.mark} that might
be [asserted against the new technology]{.mark}.]{.underline} When an
inventor gets a patent, she is supposed to reveal the secret sauce
behind the invention in the patent, a public document[. This allows
**scientists** and engineers to learn about the invention and use that
information to improve the technology.]{.underline} Or at least, that's
the theory. [In practice, many inventors make shoddy disclosures.
Experiments **reported** in patents are sometimes fictional and often
rely on dubious **methodology**. For instance, patent law permits an
inventor to disclose the fictional **finding** that a drug treats cancer
as evidence that she deserves a patent on that drug.]{.underline}
Inventors applying for patents are allowed to include predicted
experimental results. The intent is to allow for earlier disclosure and
to help smaller companies secure funding. But when evidence in patents
is wrong, other innovators can be misled. Further, if other innovators
want to figure out if the patented drug really treats cancer -- or any
other disease -- they need a license from the patentee. [Sometimes [key
pieces of **evidence** are missing entirely from patents]{.mark}. This
happens when a [patent covers aspects of a technology that the patentee
didn't actually invent]{.mark}. Imagine discovering that paper is a
mediocre incandescent conductor in light bulbs and using that discovery
to get a patent covering thousands of other conductors, including ones
that, unbeknownst to you, work much better]{.underline}. [Later
**innovators** might want to figure out whether other substances are
better conductors than paper, but they can't even start **experiments**
without a license.]{.underline} This happened to Edison. He was sued for
patent infringement after discovering a far better conductor than that
discovered by the patentee -- but because the patent was written
broadly, it nevertheless covered Edison's invention. There is also too
little information about the boundaries of patents. When an inventor
gets a patent, she is also supposed to provide clear boundary
information -- what a patent application covers and what it doesn't --
to the public about her patent rights. The patent system fails to ensure
this, however. The boundary information in patent applications is hidden
for 18 months until the application is published, and even longer if the
boundaries change later during examination. Once the patent is granted,
lawyers, judges and the public often have difficulty reaching agreement
on the meaning of boundary language that may be intentionally vague or
ambiguous. Inventors who come up with new chemicals, including
pharmaceuticals, tend to benefit from the patent system. Unfortunately,
the system appears to impose a net cost on most other technologies,
especially in high-tech industries. Opportunistic patent owners, often
called patent trolls, surprise inventors with patent claims about
inventions that are minor or distantly related to the technology that is
the target of the suit. Economics research shows such trolling activity
slows innovation. \[Over 100,000 readers rely on The Conversation's
newsletter to understand the world. Sign up today.\] [The [patent
**system** can be improved to deliver a net gain to all inventors even
without being drastically reworked]{.mark}. A good start would be to
[**rigorously** enforce existing standards about information
disclosure]{.mark}. Courts should push inventors to clearly describe and
explain their inventions.]{.underline} The flood of patents on minor
technical advances could be ended if patent fees were increased and if
the nonobviousness standard, which screens out minor advances, was made
stronger. Reducing the number of patents and increasing the amount of
information about each patent would go a long way toward making the
patent system work the way it was intended.

The debates on the impact of intellectual property rights has been
extended to the current discussion on climate change mitigation. Mass
development, transfer and adoption of climate-friendly technologies and
renewable energy has been recognised as [[**essential** to
mitigating]{.mark} [**climate change** within]{.mark} the [required
timeframe]{.mark}]{.underline} (Copenhagen Economics, 2009). The share
of renewable energy in global energy use rose from 17 per cent in 1990
to 18 per cent in 2015 (figure 1), but a large proportion of this
renewable energy is from traditional biomass. [Considerable efforts are
required to [develop and **adopt** key tech]{.mark}nologies such as
[solar and wind.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, [given the [differences
in resource **endowment**]{.mark},]{.underline} economic development
level and technological advancement among countries, there is need for
technology and [know-how [transfer from
tech]{.mark}nologically-[advanced countries to]{.mark} technologically
[lagging countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ockwell et al., 2010).
Technology transfer is crucial given the asymmetry in research and
development expenditure between developed and developing countries as
shown in figure 2. According to Correa (2013), [[90 per cent of
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[**development** is concentrated
in]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,]{.underline}
[Eu]{.underline}ropean Union, Japan and China; and 80 per cent of all
[[patented innovations in carbon capture]{.mark}, geothermal, solar PV
and wind energy technologies are owned by companie]{.underline}s from
France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom and the United
States. The TRIPS Agreement acknowledges these differences by taking
into consideration "the developmental and technological objectives" of
its members, while also recognising the special needs of its
least-developed country (LDC) members (preamble TRIPS Agreement). The
TRIPS Agreement grants their least developed country members more
flexibility in the implementation of their obligation under TRIPS in
order to help them achieve a strong technological base. This
[flexibility is not available to non-members of least developing
countries.]{.underline} The [[issue of i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntellectual
[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}roperty [[r]{.underline}]{.mark}ights is a
[major point of discussion in innovation and technology
transfer,]{.underline} including [clean energy technology innovation and
transfer]{.underline}. According to Latif (2012, 2013), technology
transfer and innovation [are [**key** issues in]{.mark} the
[Rio+20]{.mark} United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development
discussions]{.underline}, but IPR which are related to them are barely
mentioned. Nonetheless, there has been considerable policy debate over
the scope and [[role of **IPR** protection with]{.mark} respect to
[clean energy]{.mark} and climate mitigation technologies]{.underline}.
Some studies argue that IPR protection serves as an incentive to
innovate and transfer clean energy technologies, while others claim that
IPR protection would lead to [[**higher** costs of clean
tech]{.mark}nology and [hinder developing countries'
access]{.mark}]{.underline} because of the [[exclusive rights of]{.mark}
the [patent]{.mark}]{.underline} holder (ICTSD, 2008; Kapur, 2011).
Although the TRIPS Agreement provides for exceptions to the exclusive
right of patent holders under its Article 30, these [[exceptions apply
collectively]{.mark} and are [limited in nature]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Agreement also addresses the abuse of intellectual property rights
by its holders, by providing that appropriate steps could be taken where
IPR would unreasonably restrain trade or affect technology transfer
(Article 8(2) TRIPS Agreement) The studies that examine the effect of
IPR on climate change and clean energy technology have mixed conclusions
(Hascic et al., 2010; UNEP, et al., 2010), partly because of inadequate
data, different data sources and different methodologies. The analysis
of the impact of IPR protection on clean technology innovation and
transfer is a relatively young field of research. The majority of
studies approach the subject mainly from theoretical, legal and case
studies perspectives (Kapur, 2011; IRENA, 2012; Copenhagen Economics,
2009). To date, the literature lacks a comprehensive empirical
investigation of the impact of IPR protection on renewable energy using
econometric methods. This study makes an important contribution to the
literature on renewable energy development. While most studies on
renewable energy development and adoption have focused extensively on
the technical and economic aspects[, [little is known about]{.mark} the
legal and [institutional frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline} that may
influence renewable energy development. This study explores legal and
institutional frameworks with respect to renewable energy and focuses
specifically on IPR protection. While previous studies on the subject
have developed theoretical or case study approaches, this study extends
the IPR-renewable energy literature by [[taking advantage of novel panel
data on]{.mark} the [**degree** of IPR
**protection**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the GinartePark Index -- and
adopting fixed effect panel regression techniques. This broadens the
existing literature by using econometrics techniques to analyse the
effect of intellectual property rights protection on climate-related
technologies/renewable energy use. The two main research questions in
the study are as follows: does IPR protection hinder renewable energy
development? Does reforming IPR systems have significant positive
impacts on renewable energy development?

### 1NC\-\--IPR Bad\-\--Monopolies

#### Imposing IPR *[hampers]{.underline}* innovation and *[creates]{.underline}* monopolies 

Emrah **Karakilic 19**, holds a PhD in sociology from Goldsmiths,
University of London and 20. He finished his PhD in 2016 with a thesis
entitled The Limits of Cognitive Capitalism., "Rethinking intellectual
property rights in the cognitive and digital age of capitalism: An
autonomist Marxist reading", Technological Forecasting and Social Change
Volume 147, October 2019, Pages 1-9, 7-5-2019,

From this perspective, the enclosure of the common should be considered
a structural fetter on the development and growth of human beings. In
particular, intellectual property rights act as forms of structural
restraints for the expansion and development of productive forces. They
block the qualities and capabilities, that is, the very human
potentiality of wage-workers. They precisely interrupt the Foucauldian
circuit in which l'homme produit l'homme (man produces man). In this
regard, it is fair to state that by [[**imposing**
IPR]{.underline}]{.mark}, capital [[prepares]{.mark} its [own social
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of [[established capitalist
relations of **production**]{.mark}]{.underline} Furthermore, the
[enclosure through IPR [hinders]{.mark}]{.underline} the opportunities
for [[**innovation**,]{.mark} profit-making, [and
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the perspective of neoclassical
economics, Boldrin and Levine (2002, 2010) challenge the 'common
argument \[that\] the presence of strong intellectual property rights
spurs innovation leading to higher economic growth and increasing
benefits for all' (2002: 209). By drawing on quantitative models, they
analyse the [difference between property rights applied to material and
immaterial goods and show that [IPR constitute]{.mark}]{.underline} a
monopoly, '[[intellectual monopoly']{.underline}]{.mark}, ultimately
[[**hindering** free market]{.mark}, competition, growth, and
wealth]{.underline}. Again, from the perspective of neoclassical
economics, Lerner examines the impact of IPR policy shifts in 60 nations
over the past 150 years and finds a '[[lack of]{.mark} a positive
[impact of **strengthening**]{.mark} of [patent protection on
innovation']{.mark}]{.underline} (2009: 347), which is key for profit
making and economic growth. Martin (1998) inquiries into the
relationship between IPR and innovation from a different perspective. By
using real-life cases, he demonstrates how big companies purchase
someone else's idea to [[inhibit]{.mark} other [companies from
transforming]{.mark} this idea to [an innovative
product]{.mark}]{.underline} and selling it on the market as a
competitor of their product. Along the same lines, Baker, Jayadev and
Stiglitz's comprehensive - policy- paper argue that 'the current global
regime of intellectual property rights is inadequate in serving the
purpose of development and welfare ... both in developed and developing
countries' (2017: 7). They state that 'if the knowledge economy and the
economy of ideas is to be a key part of the global economy and if static
societies are to be transformed into 'learning societies' that are key
for growth and development, there is a desperate need to rethink the
current regime \[of IPR\]' (2017: 7). The famous Manchester Manifesto,
signed by fifty international scholars from various disciplines,
underlines 'the [[**significant** drawbacks']{.mark} of IPR]{.underline}
in 'its [[effects on]{.mark} economic [efficiency]{.mark}']{.underline}
(2009:2), especially in terms of '[reducing competition]{.underline} and
[[**allowing** large companies to **dominate**
markets]{.underline}]{.mark}' (2009: 4).

## Space Col Bad 

### 1NC\-\--Space Col Bad\-\--Contamination

#### Space causes bacterial resistance to [antibiotics]{.underline} which greatly [increases]{.underline} infection and [spread]{.underline}.

**Minhas, 20** \[Vikrant Minhas is a co-founder of the space research

Worryingly[, research from space flight missions has shown [bacteria
become]{.mark} more [**deadly** and resilient when exposed to
microgravity]{.mark} (when only tiny gravitational forces are present).
In space, [bacteria seem to become]{.mark} more [resistant to
**antibiotics** and]{.mark} more [**lethal**.]{.mark}]{.underline} They
also stay this way for a short time after returning to Earth, compared
with bacteria that never left Earth. Adding to that, [bacteria also seem
to mutate quicker in space]{.underline}. However, these mutations are
predominately for the bacteria to adapt to the new environment -- not to
become super deadly. More research is needed to examine whether such
adaptations do, in fact, allow the bacteria to cause more disease. Read
more: Bacteria found to thrive better in space than on Earth Bacterial
team work is bad news for space stations [Research has shown space's
[microgravity promotes **biofilm** formation]{.mark} of bacteria.
Biofilms are densely-packed cell colonies that produce a matrix of
polymeric substances allowing bacteria to stick to each other, and to
stationary surfaces. [Biofilms increase]{.mark} bacteria's
[**resistance** to antibiotics, promote]{.mark} their [survival and
improve]{.mark} their [ability to cause
**infection**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have seen biofilms grow and
attach to equipment on space stations, causing it to biodegrade. For
example, biofilms have affected the Mir space station's navigation
window, air conditioning, oxygen electrolysis block, water recycling
unit and thermal control system. The prolonged exposure of such
equipment to biofilms can lead to malfunction, which can have
devastating effects. Microorganisms that form biofilms include bacteria,
fungi and protists. Shutterstock Another affect of microgravity on
bacteria involves their structural distortion. Certain bacteria have
shown reductions in cell size and increases in cell numbers when grown
in microgravity. In the case of the former, [bacterial cells with
smaller surface area have fewer molecule-cell interactions, and this
reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics against them. Moreover, [the
absence of]{.mark} effects produced by [gravity]{.mark}, such as
sedimentation and buoyancy, could alter the way bacteria take in
nutrients or drugs intended to attack them. This [could result in the
increased **drug resistance and** infectiousness of bacteria in
space.]{.mark}]{.underline} All of this has serious implications,
especially when it comes to long-haul space flights where gravity would
not be present. [Experiencing [a bacterial infection that cannot be
treated]{.mark} in these circumstances [would be
**catastrophic**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The benefits of
performing research in space On the other hand, the effects of space
also result in a unique environment that can be positive for life on
Earth. For example, molecular crystals in space's microgravity grow much
larger and more symmetrically than on Earth. Having more uniform
crystals allows the formulation of more effective drugs and treatments
to combat various diseases including cancers and Parkinson's disease.
Also, the crystallisation of molecules helps determine their precise
structures. Many molecules that cannot be crystallised on Earth can be
in space. So, the structure of such molecules could be determined with
the help of space research. This, too, would aid the development of
higher quality drugs. Optical fibre cables can also be made to a much
better standard in space, due to the optimal formation of crystals. This
greatly increases data transmission capacity, making networking and
telecommunications faster. As humans spend more time in space, an
environment riddled with known and unknown dangers, further research
will help us thoroughly examine the risks -- and the potential benefits
-- of space's unique environment.

#### Missions to colonize [increase]{.underline} microbes. Extinction.

If we find life on another world (assuming it's not sentient and
well-armed), we're going to want to bring samples back to Earth. And
we're going to want to bring them back alive. So [we've got to have a
way of [prevent]{.mark}ing [**back**
**contamination**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} or the act of bringing
[extraterrestrial micro-organisms back to Earth, or into human
**colonies** in space]{.underline}. Our typical ways of preventing
contamination aren't going to work --- we can't leave the life behind,
and we can't sterilize everything. So we'd opt for heavy-duty
containment. When the Apollo missions returned with rock and dust
samples from the Moon, back contamination was a major concern. At the
time, scientists didn't know whether there would be life on the Moon,
but they felt it was better to be safe than sorry. To that end,
according to NASA's history of the quarantine program, "The existence of
hazardous, replicating microorganisms on the moon would be assumed."
During the missions, the Apollo crews were careful not to track
materials from the lunar surface into the Command Module which would
return to Earth. That sounds like "wash your hands and wipe your feet,"
but it's more complicated when you're wearing a bulky spacesuit in an
environment that's full of dust. Once they returned to Earth, the crews
went into immediate quarantine. First they lived in a mobile isolation
unit on the aircraft carrier that recovered the landing capsule, then in
an aircraft set up for isolation, and finally in a special quarantine
unit at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. They stayed there
for three weeks, while NASA doctors performed tests and watched for any
signs of illness that might indicate an alien infection. Apollo 11 crew
in quarantine. Image credit: NASA. Meanwhile, the lunar samples went to
the Lunar Receiving Lab at Johnson Space Center, where they could be
studied in careful quarantine. Once the samples were proven to be devoid
of life, some were released to other research facilities. NASA's plan
for bringing Martian samples home is a bit more advanced. The agency's
Planetary Protection Subcommittee recently laid out its proposal for
preventing back contamination. It includes a requirement that any
samples brought back to Earth must be either sterilized or packed in a
sealed container before being brought aboard the spacecraft. That
containment system must also have a redundant failsafe as a backup.
They're not playing around. The proposal also says, "The mission and the
spacecraft design must provide a method to 'break the chain of contact'
with Mars. No uncontained hardware that contacted Mars, directly or
indirectly, shall be returned to Earth." Sorry, Curiosity Rover: you can
never come home. Once on Earth, the samples would, according to NASA's
proposal, go straight to a Sample Return Facility, where they would be
subjected to a battery of tests for potential biohazards. Once they're
deemed clean, they will be distributed to other research facilities.
NASA's proposed Sample Return Facility would include Biosafety Level 4
labs (the same types of facilities where viruses like Ebola are studied
today), as well as cleanrooms to prevent the Martian samples from
picking up any stray Earth germs. Unfortunately, "such an integrated
facility is not currently available," NASA notes. What Could Go Wrong?
So, what happens in the unlikely event that those measures fail, and the
first crewed mission to Mars sets alien microbes loose on Earth? We
don't know, and that's what makes containment so important. The whole
thing could play out like a microscopic version of H.G. Wells' War of
the Worlds, where terrifying Martian invaders are killed off by Earth
viruses. [If [e]{.mark}xtra[t]{.mark}errestrial [microbes escape from
**containment**]{.mark}, they might not last long out in the world,
where they have to [compete with **Earth's**]{.mark} own battalions of
[bacteria]{.mark} and v]{.underline}iruses. Of course we might see the
opposite scenario. Extraterrestrial microbes [might [thrive in Earth's
**environment**,]{.mark} and they might [out-compete]{.mark} many [Earth
**microbes**]{.mark}, just like today's terrestrial invasive species ---
which are problematic enough without help from other
worlds.]{.underline} [[Humans]{.underline}]{.mark} would [have [no
natural immunity]{.mark} to Martian [pathogens]{.mark}, and [**our whole
species** might be **wiped** out]{.mark}]{.underline}. So you might
think of [extraterrestrial microbes as the [**potential** n]{.mark}ext
version of [Ebola]{.mark}, which explains the **[Biohazard]{.mark}**
Level [4]{.mark} recommendation]{.underline}. But humans aren't the only
ones in danger. [Extraterrestrial microbes could [rapidly wipe
out]{.mark} Earth's other [animal]{.mark} [species, plants, and
microbes]{.mark}.]{.underline} That might actually be a more horrific
scenario: [[humanity **survives**]{.mark}, but all the [animals]{.mark}
and [plants]{.mark} we **depend** on for sustenance [**die**
off]{.mark}, or all the microbes that play such a **vital** role in our
environment are displaced by alien microbes that don't fill the **same**
roles]{.underline}. There's probably an excellent [[post-apocalyptic

**creation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As I argue above in Section
2.1, [anthropogenic existential [risks **correlate**]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} human technological [development]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[All non-natural existential risks are the result of our technological

misunderstood as a quasi-Luddite argument against all technological
progress in general. [Scientific and technological **progress** has made

issue is of elevated importance because, as I argue above in Section
3.1, delaying space colonization has an almost imperceptible impact on
the long-term future of humankind, whereas existential risks and our
attempts at mitigating them (or failing to do so) has an enormous
impact.

While record-breaking wildfires burned across the Western United States,
Amazon executive chairman and billionaire Jeff Bezos stepped out of his
space capsule to a crowd of cheering fans. His company Blue Origin's
first launch into space was a success. Bezos became the second
billionaire to reach space and cement his stature as a leading private
space industry figure. The three billionaires building the private space
industry so far are: Richard Branson with Virgin Galactic, Elon Musk
with SpaceX and Bezos with Blue Origin. Musk has yet to make the trip to
space himself. \"If we can do this,\" exclaimed Branson, who preceded
Bezos' space trip by about a week, \"just imagine what you can do.\"
With a billion dollars, he should have added. These billionaires see
themselves as virtuous trailblazers of a new space age. While Branson
has the more docile plan of business expansion and commercial space
travel (think space tourism), Bezos envisions settlements on the moon.
Musk, famously, locates humanity's future in the colonization of Mars.
Besides their money, eccentricities and desire to float in space, these
three men share a dislike for paying taxes. Branson has moved billions
between tax havens to avoid paying in his home country of England. For a
number of years, Bezos and Musk, the two richest men in the world, paid
no federal income taxes. [Behind their [space]{.mark} ambitions is a
recognition of the [more **earthly** challenges]{.mark} to our future:
the depletion of resources, population growth and, most importantly,
climate change.]{.underline} In his post-launch briefing, Bezos even
spoke of the Earth's fragility and the need to protect it. \"As we move
about the Earth, we damage it,\" he said. In a separate interview, he
stressed the need to keep Earth \"as this beautiful gem of a planet that
it is.\" [Admissions like this demonstrate a [**willful** ignorance of
t]{.mark}he billionaires' own [complicity]{.mark} in these existential
crises.]{.underline} Bezos' Amazon is responsible for a carbon footprint
that rivals that of some countries. At the same time, Bezos and his
company fund a leading climate-change-denial think tank and reject
grassroots employee demands for greater climate action. Amazon has
created the Amazon Climate Pledge to reach net zero emission by 2040,
and Bezos has pledged \$10 billion toward the new Bezos Earth Fund. One
year after creating the pledge, however, the company's carbon emissions
increased by 19%, and Bezos has only given a fraction of his pledge.
[[Climate change is an immediate crisis that, at this point, we are in a
stage of harm managemen]{.mark}t and not prevention.]{.underline}
Proponents of the Green New Deal argue that to salvage our planet and
its inhabitants requires a warlike scale of mobilization. Estimates of
the cost of reconstructing a new, green economy usually amount to
trillions of dollars of government spending. In short, \$10 billion
isn't going to cut it. Upon his return from the sky, Bezos made it a
point to thank Amazon workers, who \"paid for all this.\" This
rhetorical thanks is a stark contrast to the working conditions in
Amazon warehouses and the union-busting efforts pushed by Amazon around
the country. It's important to remember how these billionaires made
their money and [what their space race really means while so many issues
persist at home.]{.underline} [While [they continue their **privatized**
space race, the rest of humanity is **imperiled**]{.mark}. The [planet
will continue to burn, and inequality will worsen until massive
action]{.mark} and investment is taken, which means billionaires finally
paying their fair share. Billionaires would do best to [put their space
race on pause and focus more of their **attention** on this

On December 19th, 2021, the Falcon 9 rocket, a private vehicle owned by
SpaceX, was launched, alleviating sustainability concerns regarding
space exploration with the end goal of colonizing Mars. Suddenly, the
idea of space exploration has become startlingly close, and less of a
trope from a sci-fi movie. However, the romanticism surrounding the
terraformation of Mars, and the space tourism industry as a whole, is
not only idealistic--it's incredibly dangerous. Space capitalists like
Elon Musk, owner and founder of SpaceX, have released concerning
statements that acknowledge Mars as having "no Earth-based government"
that carries "authority or sovereignty over Martian activities" and that
'"SpaceX will move to impose our own legal regime" to provide authority
over Mars. This capitalist trick to curtail government involvement is
particularly concerning, as the US government has no agency to instill
any pre-existing labor or human rights protections on the planet. SpaceX
is known for prioritizing profit over the well-being of their workers--
many infamous lawsuits have detailed a toxic work culture rampant with
sexual harassment and lack of workplace safety regulations, all swept
under the rug by the company. There is no doubt that they will enforce
similar exploitative labor practices on Mars. Mars colonization and
similar endeavors are simply a way for the bourgeoisie to maximize
profit while escaping government regulations needed to maintain healthy
working conditions. The reality of space travel is ugly in more ways
than one. For one, [space exploration propagates Western colonization
and imperialism.]{.underline} Institutions of oppression are inevitably
bound to seep into space endeavors, specifically when it comes to claims
over natural resources. The entitlement American private enterprises
possess when it comes to exploring the frontier of space skirts
dangerously into Manifest Destiny ideology, that we have the obligation
to colonize space despite the ruthless exploitation of land and minority
groups that will inevitably follow[. This harmful ideology, a main
motivating factor for [space exploration]{.mark}, [spins stories
of]{.mark} ultra-nationalistic white men justifying [exploitation to
secure **existence** for the future **generations**]{.mark}, a notable
white nationalistic dogwhistle.]{.underline} Manifest Destiny during
early American history did guarantee existence for future generations,
however they were exclusively white generations. To make matters worse[,
[the rise in space tourism]{.mark}--an industry that sends civilians to
space for leisurely reasons--[holds deadly consequences for the
environment. Wildfires, record heat waves, increased floods, among other
rapid shifts in weather conditions, are just a few of the many climate
disasters]{.mark} currently endangering all life on Earth. [As
**flights** to space double and triple]{.mark} in numbers in the next
decade, in addition to the rockets, [so too will **carbon** emissions
and burning fuels, advancing the destruction of the ozone layer]{.mark}.
The irony is not lost on anyone[; billionaires push space-age
**Manifest** Destiny]{.mark} and utopian daydreams on Mars [as a way to
escape **the climate change**]{.mark} that they largely accelerated,
[while continuing **to fund the destruction**]{.mark} of the atmosphere.
However, many climate scientists acknowledge that it is not too late to
rectify the situation on Earth. The facts are simple: Mars colonization
is a form of utopianism, providing an escape for the bourgeoisie rather
than a haven for all people. Conversely, **[climate change]{.mark}** is
a very real and devastating threat that [requires **immediate**
attention]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead of shuttling money and precious
resources into inhospitable planets like Mars, billionaires should
reinvest in the Earth to ensure the safety of future generations[. As

Achieving 5. Conflict risks [[Conflict risks]{.mark} are risks that [are
created by]{.mark} the **prospect** of hostile actors or powers in the
**context** of **[space colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Conflict
risks are in principle not unlike conflicts that humankind has
experienced throughout its Earth-based history, but they are much
[greater]{.mark} in [**scope** and
**severity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The four conflict risks I
focus on are depicted in Fig. 5. I identify two catastrophic and two
existential conflict risks. 5.1. Secession and independence conflicts
Human habitats beyond Earth are likely to remain modest in the near-term
future. The International Space Station, humankind\'s most advanced
habitat-like project so far, can accommodate six people and is dependent
on supplies from Earth. More ambitious colonization projects such as
SpaceX\'s plan for Mars colonies typically envision what amounts to very
small and simple camps (Musk, 2017). Managing such simple colonization
projects should be doable legally and politically. [With more **mature**
colonies, however, the picture changes]{.underline}. Imagine, for
example, the large, self-sustaining habitat on Venus that consists of 2
billion people that I mentioned in a thought experiment before. That
h[ypothetical habitat is truly self-sustainable, in the sense that
[survival]{.mark} on Venus is [not contingent]{.mark} in any way on
[resources o]{.mark}r other kinds of [**support** from]{.mark}
[Earth]{.mark}. If prior human history is an indication, it is
conceivable that the Venusians could at some point seek to change their
political status.]{.underline} They might want to no longer be [governed
by Earth or Earth-based governments and instead have sovereignty to
autonomously and freely shape Venus' future]{.underline}. They might, in
other words, [seek to [secede and become an independent
political]{.mark} entity]{.underline}. Given prior human history of
secession and independence movements, such a claim to independence in
the context of space colonization could easily result in violent
conflict, and given the scale of the conflict parties in this scenario,
the bloodshed could be much greater than all the wars that happened in
Earth\'s history so far. Of course, we do not know what the dominant
political philosophy of the future will be. Perhaps popular sovereignty
and the wish for autonomy will be fully respected and met with
unconditional, enlightened understanding. But that prospect is, at best,
uncertain, and the prospect of catastrophic violent conflicts seems at
least possible. 5.2. Reactionary colonies Let us assume for the sake of
argument that the risks surrounding secessionist claims of
extraterrestrial colonies will eventually have been overcome and that
there are colonies which have attained a country-like or world-like
status. What should the [political systems in and the [moral
**foundations** of]{.mark} those independent [colonies]{.mark} look
like]{.underline}? Ideally, they would be at least as democratic,
liberal, and generally morally progressive as the most democratic,
liberal, and morally progressive countries today. More specifically[,
independent future [colonies]{.mark} should have **socio-political**
systems]{.underline} that do not lower average wellbeing or create
(disproportionately) more [[**suffering** compared to their pre-existing
peers]{.mark} such as Earth-based countries (]{.underline}Or whatever
the dominant polity on Earth in that future might be.). However, there
is no guarantee that independent colonies will meet that socio-political
and moral bar. It is possible that there will be colonies whose
[socio-political systems are regressive in one way or another, marked by
a relative moral decay compared to the **baseline** of political systems
and moral frameworks]{.underline}. I call such [[potential
**undesirable** entities]{.mark} reactionary colonies]{.underline}. The
emergence of reactionary colonies might seem implausible given that
humankind has, very roughly speaking, so far morally improved over the
course of its history.9 But reactionary colonies might actually be a
fairly common future development. [If humankind at some point achieves
the **technological** means for creating colonies with relative ease,
creating new [colonies]{.mark} might be an attractive option for
[**extremist** groups and beliefs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Imagine, for
example, [a religious group that believes in the [**fundamental**
superiority of men over women]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a religious
group might find it difficult adhering to their flawed moral principles
in a pluralistic society. Opting for colonial exodus might represent an
attractive opportunity for that religious group to build a society from
scratch which is based on their notions of female inferiority and
subjugation. The specific risk posed by reactionary colonies is twofold.
Reactionary colonies would by definition lower the average happiness and
wellbeing of humankind and create unnecessary, preventable suffering.
Reactionary colonies would also represent potential rogue actors that
could greatly amplify the aberration risks described in Section 4. For
example[, a [dictatorial regime]{.mark} that causes [great
**suffering**]{.mark} to its population might be tempted to [expand its
**dictatorial ideology**]{.mark} to other colonies. Or that dictatorial
colony could be led by a [psychopathic elite]{.mark} that enjoys letting
[sentient simulations suffe]{.mark}r as much as possible]{.underline}.
The potential catastrophic and even existential multiplicator effects of
reactionary colonies are, unfortunately, numerous. 5.3. Inter-colonial
conflict Let us, again for the sake of the argument, assume that the
previous problem of reactionary colonies has somehow been solved or
avoided. Humankind has continued its path of technological development,
and it has established several large clusters of colonies beyond the
Solar system. [Assuming that the fundamental problem of
faster-than-light communication has not been solved yet, communication
between the clusters lags months or even years, and physical contact
between the clusters is rare since travel takes even longer than
communication.]{.underline} The inevitable consequence of such a
splintering of human civilization is that the different clusters of
colonies would over time develop distinct cultures, and with only scarce
and delayed contact with other clusters, a form of intergroup bias
(Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002), the moral preference of one\'s own
in-group over the out-group, would likely start to manifest. Over time,
[that us-versus-them heuristic could help create distinct and solidified
social identities within the colony clusters]{.underline} (Hewstone &
Greenland, 2000), and the beliefs and preferences about the outgroup
colonies could become more overtly negative. Given enough time and great
enough idiosyncratic development within each colony cluster, the
cultural and moral connections between the colony clusters could further
erode, and in their place, a sense of dread and looming danger about the
others' goals and preferences could take hold. Over a long enough period
of time and great enough separation, the perception that other colonies
are a threat could grow; so much so that taking preventative action and
attacking and suppressing them might seem like the most rational course
of action (Torres, 2018). [Given the scale and the likely technological
sophistication of future weapons systems, a violent conflict between
advanced colonies and colony clusters would create suffering on an
astronomical scale]{.underline}. Of course, the prospect of
inter-colonial conflict is somewhat speculative (Cirkovic, 2019). But
given humankind\'s past experiences, violent conflict clearly seems
within the realm of the possible. That does not mean that such an almost
immeasurably terrible conflict is unavoidable. Even the slightest
probability of such conflict, however, means immense potential expected
disvalue. 5.4. [Hostile extraterrestrial intelligence We do not
currently know whether intelligence, biological or artificial, exists
beyond Earth, but it is not implausible to assume so. Coming into
contact with as well as refraining from seeking contact with
extraterrestrial intelligence poses risks, as I discuss in
Section]{.underline} 4. In addition to these risks, extraterrestrial
intelligence also poses a conflict risk: If an extraterrestrial
intelligence has moral values that are sufficiently different form
humankind\'s, the intelligence could de facto react to humankind and
other forms of intelligence with hostility. At first glance, the
prospect of a hostile extraterrestrial intelligence, be it biological or
artificial, might seem farfetched. Isn't some baseline of altruistic
moral behavior to be expected of any kind of intelligence? We might
intuitively associate intelligence with prosocial behavior of one kind
or the other, but from an evolutionary perspective, greater intelligence
is not necessarily correlated with prosocial and altruistic behavior
towards other species (Raybeck, 2014). Intelligence is the generalized
capability for achieving goals, regardless of moral underpinnings and
considerations. After all, that is why artificial intelligence as
superintelligence is an existential risk today: [[Superintelligence is a
**threat**]{.mark} precisely because it is much more intelligent than
humans but lacks any inherent sense of [**human preferences** and
**moral** values]{.mark}. Hostile extraterrestrial intelligence is a
serious risk even if such intelligence is exceedingly rare in the
universe.]{.underline} The mere possibility of hostile intelligence
could result in something like a "Dark Forest" (Yu, 2015) game theoretic
configuration. If benevolent biological or artificial intelligence is
aware of the possibility of hostile alien intelligence, the best course
of action is silence (If there might be hostile alien intelligence, best
not to be noticed.). In addition, preventative action could also be a
rational choice: If an alien intelligence --- such as our human
civilization --- is being observed gradually expanding beyond our home
planet, a risk averse intelligence, even one that is benevolent in
principle, might find it prudent to eliminate that civilization; be it
[because the civilization in question might become hostile or because it
might, through folly or ineptitude, draw unwanted **attention** to
oneself. The mere possibility of fundamentally [hostile intelligence
co]{.mark}uld, in that sense, be enough to [fuel a **silent astronomical
war.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Private-sector companies and industries likewise are looking for
ever-more competitive ways to succeed, by developing and incorporating
creative and useful innovations into products and services that we all
benefit from and enjoy in virtually every area of life. This paper

patents, trademarks and similar rights upon which the lion's share of

role]{.mark} in growing the [**economies** of]{.mark} developed and

areas: 1. Intellectual property protection benefits the economy. 2.
Intellectual property protection promotes innovation. 3. Intellectual
property protection helps firms monetize their innovations and grow. 4.
Intellectual property protection helps small and medium enterprises. 5.
Intellectual property protection benefits consumers and society. As [the
'knowledge economy' advances, more and more of the value that firms and
the overall economy achieve will come from high value-added
intangibles---including IP in inventions, brands and works. In many
companies even now, 80% or more of their market value is attributable to
intangibles, including IP. In some small [companies]{.mark}, the only
value is the [intellectual property they own in an exciting new

[[U.S. businesses]{.mark},]{.underline} meanwhile, [continue to [[invest

China]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and they are growing [more
outspoken about their intention to continue doing so.]{.underline} In
a [[speech]{.underline}](https://www.csis.org/analysis/business-and-trade-are-our-national-interest) in
Washington this month, Evan Greenberg, a former chair of the U.S.-China
Business Council, called [[decoupling an]{.mark} "economic
[impossibility]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} and urged U.S. companies
to redouble their efforts to enter the Chinese market. Decoupling,
Greenberg said, will only "feed China's worst instincts" and at the same
time undercut U.S. global competitiveness.

"The [[less reliant China is on American]{.mark}-produced

#### US regulatory policy causes Chinese *[tit for tat]{.underline}* retaliation which causes divergence.

[[In response to US hostility]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[China]{.mark} has
[chosen to retaliate tit- for- tat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a strategy
simultaneously consists of a promise and a threat[: [if]{.mark} the
[United States does nothing]{.mark}, then [neither will China;
conversely]{.mark}, if]{.underline} the [United States attacks, so will
China]{.underline}. One of the most famous examples of this strategy is
the 'liveand- let- live' system that emerged during the trench warfare
in the First World War.46 There, it was observed that [[cooperation is
possible even amongst antagonists]{.underline}.]{.mark} Soldiers on the
frontline defied orders from their higher command and refrained from
shooting at the enemy as long as their opponents reciprocated. To deter
America's aggressive strategy of stifling Chinese leading technology
companies, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has a few [[regulatory
tools]{.underline}]{.mark} at its disposal. One of them is the AML which
has emerged as a powerful economic weapon allowing the Chinese authority
to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over foreign multinationals.
The coercive capacity of the AML is expected to increase, given that a
pending amendment to its powers would [[enhance]{.mark} its [punitive
capacities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2.1 The Folk Theorem To illustrate China's tit- for- tat strategy,
consider the following hypothetical game between the United States and
China.47 In this game, the [United States makes the first
move]{.underline}, and it must decide whether it will maintain the
status quo of accommodating the rise of China or take a more aggressive
stance in [[order to deter China from acting]{.mark} in a way that would
[harm US interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this hypothetical game, [if
the United States keeps to the status quo]{.underline}, both countries
will receive the same payoff score of 10. However, if the United States
takes an aggressive approach, it will receive a score of 15 and China
will obtain a score of 1. [[China must then decide whether to punish the
United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, which will harm both itself and the
United States. If China chooses to punish the United States, then both
countries gain nothing. While the cooperative outcome yields the highest
joint payoffs for the two countries, this [[equilibrium]{.mark} [cannot
be achieved in]{.mark} a [one- shot game]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the
game is only played once, then the United States' dominant strategy will
be one of aggression in which it will receive the largest advantage. In
this scenario, United States will obtain the maximum payoff of 15. China
will not be content but it is better off acquiescing and collecting a
payoff of 1 instead of being left with zero gain. However, in reality,
the United States and China are repeatedly and continuously i[nteracting
with each other in this relationship.]{.underline} Given that this game
involves an infinite number of interactions, China will opt for a
different strategy to fulfil its objectives. It will [[choose to punish
the United States, in which case the United States will obtain
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. In anticipation of being punished by
China, the United States will modify its strategy to tolerate China's
rise, as a result of which China will acquiesce, achieving a payoff of
10 for both players. The key to maintaining this equilibrium is the
implicit threat of punishment, and peace is only possible if China has
the capacity to retaliate against any US aggression. This logic applied
during the Cold War. In his Nobel Peace Prize lecture, Robert Aumann
said: 'In the long years of the cold war between the US and the Soviet
Union, what prevented "hot" war was that bombers carrying nuclear
weapons were in the air 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Disarming would
have led to a war.'48

increasingly confident that by the decade\'s end, China\'s economy will
finally surpass that of the United States as the world\'s largest in
terms of GDP at market exchange rates. Western elites may dismiss the
significance of that milestone; the CCP\'s Politburo does not. For
China, size always matters. Taking the number one slot will turbocharge
Beijing\'s confidence, assertiveness, and leverage in its dealings with
Washington, and it will make China\'s central bank more likely to float
the yuan, open its capital account, and challenge the U.S. dollar as the
main global reserve currency. Meanwhile, China continues to advance on
other fronts, as well. A new policy plan, announced last fall, aims to
allow China to dominate in all new technology domains, including
artificial intelligence, by 2035. And Beijing now intends to complete
its military modernization program by 2027 (seven years ahead of the
previous schedule), with the main goal of giving China a decisive edge
in all conceivable scenarios for a conflict with the United States over
Taiwan. A victory in such a conflict would allow President Xi Jinping to
carry out a forced reunification with Taiwan before leaving power\--an

#### Further decoupling is destabilizing 

Edward **Wong 7/5**, a diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times
who reports on foreign policy from Washington, D.C, "U.S. Aims to Expand
Export Bans on China Over Security and Human Rights", The New York
Times, 7-5-2022,

The Biden administration on Tuesday put five Chinese companies on an
export blacklist for continuing to support Russia's military-industrial
sector. It was the first time the U.S. government had [taken action
against Chinese companies for aiding Russia since the war in Ukraine
began in February,]{.underline} though U.S. officials say the [[Chinese
government]{.mark} and most companies appear to be [complying
with]{.mark} the U.S.-led [sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Even before those actions, the Biden administration had [[doubled down
on]{.mark} a Trump administration policy of [wielding export
controls]{.mark}]{.underline} as a cudgel against Chinese companies.

In 2018, Congress passed a law requiring the Commerce Department to
expand its controls on sensitive U.S. technologies that flow abroad.

Although some lawmakers say the government has moved too slowly on this,
the department under both the Trump administration and the Biden
administration has aggressively wielded a more targeted tool, called the
entity list, which cuts foreign companies and organizations off from
U.S. technology unless their U.S. suppliers obtain a license to sell
goods to them.

The Trump administration put Huawei and SMIC, two prominent Chinese
technology companies, on that list.

Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the Commerce Department under Biden was
adding China-based companies and organizations to the list at a much
faster rate than ones from any other country. Of 475 foreign entities
added since January 2021, 107 are based in China, according to a new
tally of data that the agency provided to The New York Times. By
contrast, the administration put 23 Russia-based entities on the list
before the war --- then quickly added 252, in addition to imposing
broader restrictions on entire categories of technology goods.

The administration has also blacklisted companies based in Pakistan,
Belarus, Myanmar, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Britain, but
those numbers are much smaller.

Most of the China-based entities listed during the Biden administration
were judged by U.S. officials to have military roles or to be involved
in systemic human rights abuses. Some have suspicious ties with Iran,
North Korea and Pakistan, countries with nuclear programs that the
United States is trying to constrain, U.S. officials said. A few are
linked to aggressive actions in disputed territory in the South China
Sea.

The United States has also extended the reach of its export restrictions
well beyond U.S. borders. It has forbidden companies anywhere in the
world from exporting certain items if they are made with American
technology to some listed entities, including Russian military groups
and Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. The United States
can also restrict exports to listed entities of foreign goods that
contain certain amounts of U.S. products.

"One of the lessons from the use of that tool with Huawei is that it can
be a pretty powerful mechanism," said Samm Sacks, a researcher on
technology policy at Yale Law School and New America. "It captures a lot
of third-country suppliers."

Some U.S. lawmakers say further technology restrictions would be a
potent tool to wield against Beijing and that threats to broaden those
controls might help deter potential hostilities by Chinese leaders
toward Taiwan. But some analysts warn of possible retaliation from
China.

"As the United States continues to exploit the extraterritorial reach of
its regulations, the growing threat of a [[regulatory 'arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark},' particularly with China, adds to an already
jittery business environment," Jeanette Chu, a senior associate at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in March.

"The '[[tit for tat' nature of export controls]{.mark} and sanctions
today risks [undermining the effectiveness of]{.mark} export
[controls]{.mark} and leaving]{.underline} [policymakers with limited
options]{.underline}," she added.

Although the [Chinese government]{.underline} denounces Washington's use
of sanctions[, it has [increasingly used]{.mark} its [own form
of]{.mark} economic [punishments]{.mark}]{.underline} [t]{.mark}o harm
countries that [take stands contravening Beijing's political
views.]{.underline} Recent targets include Australia, Japan, South Korea
and Norway. When Lithuania permitted Taiwan last year to open a
representative office in its capital, China cut off its exports to
Lithuania as well as imports.

In June 2021, Beijing enacted the "Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law," aimed at
punishing companies and individuals that comply with foreign sanctions
against China. And the Chinese government has an export control law that
it could use broadly.

China remains behind the United States in many technological fields but
is catching up quickly. In some areas --- biotechnology, artificial
intelligence and 5G communications, for instance --- China is at or near
the fore. And it is set to overtake the United States in national
spending on research and development within the next several years.

"Scientific and technological innovation has become the main battlefield
of the international strategy contest, and the competition around the
commanding heights of science and technology is unprecedentedly fierce,"
President Xi Jinping of China said in a speech in May 2021.

Biden administration officials say the export controls imposed on Russia
show that the strength of the U.S.' actions comes from coordination with
partner nations.

At Biden's democracy summit in December 2021, the United States,
Australia, Denmark and Norway announced they would begin building a new
export control policy program to limit technologies going to
authoritarian governments engaged in human rights abuses. The United
States has been carrying out other discussions in its trade and
technology dialogue with the European Union.

The most prominent global export regime now, the Wassenaar Arrangement,
is intended to control sales of technology that can be used for military
as well as commercial purposes, but critics say it has drawbacks,
including that Russia is a member.

[Any new multilateral system for export controls must be done with
partners so that many countries impose the same limits]{.underline},
Estevez said last month. "As anyone knows, [**[if you dam half the
river,]{.mark} the [water is still flowing]{.mark}**," he
added.]{.underline}

But Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, warned that many nations that have deep trade
ties with China could resist efforts to impose broad export controls on
the country.

"I don't think you'd see the level of unanimity that the sanctions on
Russia would have, so that would risk splitting the coalition," he said.

And the potential for further restrictions on China is already causing
some concern among American business executives.

Myron Brilliant, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said the business community had been "steadfast in its support
of the multilateral use of sanctions against Russia given that country's
unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine," but that views on China were
"more complex and nuanced."

"The [business community has deep concerns with China's predatory and
market distortion policies,]{.underline} yet we must also recognize that
the two [[largest economies]{.mark} are [very
integrated]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said. "So the [[impact of broad
decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark} or extensive sanctioning of China would
be [[much more destabilizing."]{.mark} ]{.underline}

**[I]{.underline}**NTELLECTUAL **[P]{.underline}**ROPERTY LAW, the body
of legal doctrine and practice that governs the ownership of
information[, is animated by a dichotomy of creatorship and
infringement.]{.underline} In the most often repeated narratives of
creatorship/infringement in the United States, the former produces a
social and economic good while the latter works against the production
of that social and economic good. Creators, those individuals whose work
is deemed protectable under copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret,
and unfair competition law, create valuable products that contribute to
economic growth and public knowledge. Infringers, those individuals who
use the work of creators without their permission, steal those valuable
products and act as drains on economic growth and public knowledge.
These narratives, while comforting, are frequently oversimplified in
public cultural conversations, in ways that center and elevate
Westernness and whiteness and obscure and replicate histories of race
and (neo)colonialism. The Color of Creatorship is a book about the
[historical and continuing [relationships between **race** and]{.mark}
(neo)[coloniality in **i**]{.mark}ntellectual **[p]{.mark}**roperty
law]{.underline}. In it, I join a respected and growing group of
scholars in contending that [intellectual property law is a set of
[**rhetorics** about citizenship]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, unlike
those who have previously written about the relationships between
intellectual property and citizenship, I focus on the latter as a
discourse through which race and coloniality continue to structure
doctrinal practices in copyright, patent, and trademark law.
[Citizenship in the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates was and [continues
to be a raced concept]{.mark}]{.underline}. More specifically, [it is a
concept constructed by and through constantly [evolving public cultural
conceptions of **Americanness**, **white** masculinity,]{.mark}
property, [**racial** capitalism,]{.mark} and labor]{.underline}. I use
the term "intellectual property citizenship" as an anchoring analytic
for understanding how [intellectual property and citizenship have
evolved---and continue to evolve---in deeply intertwined and **raced**
ways.]{.underline} Through a periodic analysis of [American legal
cases]{.underline}, political speeches, and cultural practices, this
book shows that [copyright, patent, and trademark regimes are imagined
through always already racialized notions of citizenship that purport to
be free of racial bias.]{.underline} [Citizenship]{.underline}, while
presumed to be race neutral, [is **frequently** **defined** via shifting
normative claims about race, gender, and class and implicit definitions
of "good citizens]{.underline}."1 This book is more specifically about
the complex ways that [whiteness and its attendant property interests
structure intellectual property law, often in the guise of **equality**
and race **neutrality**.]{.underline}2 Racial inequality is a continuing
and persistent problem in intellectual property law, not because of
legal happenstance, economic motive, or racial accident but because
copyright, patent, and trademark doctrines are fundamentally prefigured
through raced conceptions of citizenship. [[Intellectual property
citizenship]{.mark}, then, [is a "**grid of
intelligibility**]{.mark}"3---a framework [for understanding how power
is **organized**]{.mark}--- that reveals the racializing and [colonizing
**principles**]{.mark} around which familiar and [repeated doctrinal
standards]{.mark} in copyright, patent, and trademark law were and are
structured]{.underline}. The [[**codified** racial
discrimination]{.mark} that [made i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty
[law]{.mark} the purview of whites in the 1800s [did not
disappear]{.mark}.]{.underline} It persisted through the continuing
racialized entanglements of the principles of EuroAmerican citizenship
with the principles of Euro-American creatorship. Because conceptions of
[Americanness were and are [**structured** through a trenchant
"**racial** **episteme**]{.mark},"4 a frame that a priori constrains
possibilities for treating people of color as full persons, let alone
full creators, [the discourse of **citizenship** operates as a]{.mark}
[container]{.mark} for [importing race into intellectual property law,
even]{.mark} when the law itself [purports to be
**colorblind**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The continuing practice of thinking
about copyright, patent, and trademark law [through romanticized
imaginings of American citizenship constrains the manner in which
knowledge production/protection can be understood, managed, and
adjudicated with respect to race]{.underline}. I do not claim that such
racial investments explain the outcome in all intellectual property
cases. However, [I contend that intellectual property law is
**organized** through a racial episteme that consistently protects the
(intellectual) property interests of white people and devalues the
(intellectual) property interests of people of color.]{.underline}
Tracing "racial scripts" is a tangible method for understanding
America's racial episteme and how it informs citizenship and
creatorship/infringement as discursive formations. Racial scripts are
historically grounded and flexible racist logics about racial groups
that can be accessed at any time to exclude the original or other people
of color.5 They operate as shorthand mechanisms for calling upon
dominant American ideals of national identity, patriotism, political
economy, and personhood without necessarily explicitly invoking racial
categories or colonial logics. In this way, racial scripts can be baked
into the seemingly colorblind ideals of [American [citizenship]{.mark}
that, in turn[, inform intellectual property]{.mark}]{.underline} law.
Examining how [intellectual property law operates as a [space of racial
formation]{.mark} in which the [meaning of **racial** **categories**
evolves]{.mark} over time is a [prerequisite]{.mark} to undoing
[entrenched white privilege]{.mark} and democratizing knowledge
production and ownership.6 [I]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty law
is also a "racial project,"7 that [reproduces **particular** racial
orders]{.mark}, in which people of color are **coded** as lacking the
capacity to create]{.underline}. Unspoken longings, fears, anxieties,
and prejudices wrapped in economic and legal language move us to prefer
certain intellectual property narratives over others, predictably to the
detriment of people of color. When anti-racist, anti-colonial activists
grapple with the racial episteme that structures intellectual property
law, they can advocate for strategies that resist the underlying drivers
of unjust copyright, patent, and trademark policies. While such
resistive strategies may ultimately still provide only precarious and
fleeting relief, as Derrick Bell famously argues, they confront the
fears and anxieties that sustain racial and colonial knowledge
hierarchies.8 This book contributes to a growing body of scholarship at
the intersections of race and intellectual property law through its
historically situated consideration of the links among race,
coloniality, and knowledge governance.9 [It traces evolutions in the
racial rhetorics around copyrights, patents, and trademarks that
unfolded in parallel with the economic and political turns of the
nation.]{.underline} Such an inquiry is useful in contextualizing the
increasingly important legal regimes governing knowledge that mark some
bodies as not only inherently incapable of creatorship but also
inherently undeserving of citizenship. [As the racial rhetorics of
intellectual property law have changed over time, in ways that are
consistent with post--civil rights era colorblindness, they have come to
exclude people of color in new and different ways.]{.underline}
Accordingly, addressing intellectual property law's structural
inequalities requires thinking about how these racial evolutions persist
in a nation that claims to value all people equally. When marginalized
groups are considered to be "aberrations from the ethnoclass of Man"10
contra a white ideal, as Alexander Weheliye writes, they cannot fully
occupy the space of creatorship or (intellectual) property ownership
until the nation attends to the contours of inequality and exclusion.
While Weheliye is commenting on anti-Blackness, his statement is true
for all those people of color who are considered outside of the
ethnoclass of Man. In the so-called information economy, intellectual
property justice is racial justice. Working through key moments in
intellectual property history in the period between 1790 and 2016
reveals that even as American understandings of creatorship/infringement
have seemingly evolved, they have actually remained remarkably racially
conservative and consistent over time. This book will not provide an
exhaustive account of race, coloniality, and intellectual property law
during that period. Such a project is neither possible nor desirable.
Instead, it focuses on reading some of the most important and notable
historical touchstones in copyright, patent, and trademark law as
examples of the continuity of racial scripts and colonial relations of
domination in the context of knowledge production. I INTRODUCTION
CREATING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CREATING AMERICANS [Race enters writing,
the making of art, as a structure of feeling, as something that
structures feelings, that lays down tracks of affection and repulsion,
rage and hurt, desire and ache]{.underline}. These tracks don't only
occur in the making of art; they also occur (sometimes viciously,
sometimes hazily) in the reception of creative work. Here we are again:
we've made this thing and we've sent it out into the world for
recognition---and because what we've made is in essence a field of human
experience created for other humans, the field and its maker and its
readers are thus subject all over again to race and its infiltrations.

Standard dictionary and textbook definitions of [capitalism refer to an
economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of

private profits, etc]{.underline}.9 Hence a [necessary condition for
intellectual capitalism to be present is to have private ownership of
intellectual capital]{.underline}. This is what [the

system as an **[[institution]{.underline}]{.mark}** allows for. However,
most [intellectual property rights are temporary]{.underline}, and when
patents and secrets expire, [the corresponding information becomes
public property]{.underline}.10 In [that sense, there is a feature of
"intellectual socialism" as well]{.underline}. Still, if the share of
industrially useful knowledge generated in the private domain compared
to the public domain is large, and if its growth rate is also large,
[then at some point [private]{.mark}ly held [knowledge will
**dominate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, if technical knowledge
is doubled every seventh year and all new knowledge is privatized
through patents for twenty years before it becomes publicly owned, then
close to 7/8 (= 87.5%) of the knowledge is under private ownership at
any one point.11 The exact figures are not important here, of course,
but what is important is the fact that if privately held knowledge grows
faster than that which is publicly held, it will dominate in the not so
distant future.12 [In broad terms [intellectual cap]{.mark}italism [can
be interpreted as a confluence of a capitalist economy]{.mark} and a
knowledge or information economy]{.underline}. More specifically[,
intellectual capitalism is taken here to refer to an economic system
with basic capitalist institutions ([private property rights]{.mark},
private profit, competitive markets and free enterprise) in which
productive assets and processes, as well as commercial transactions and

TRIPS Agreement and Access to Medicines Intellectual property rights
(IPRs) are time-limited legal rights granted to inventors and creators.
IPRs include copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and
geographical indications, while protected subject-matters include, but
are not limited to, brands, inventions, designs, and biological
materials. Importantly, IPRs overlap as a product may be covered by a
series of rights. For example, a pharmaceutical medicine, defined by
Britannica as a 'substance used in the diagnosis, treatment, or
prevention of disease', is protected by patents, trademarks, and trade
secrets. Patents are the most common form of IPR used for the protection
of innovation in pharmaceuticals. Patents grant inventors limited market
exclusivity for their inventions, and, in exchange, the inventor must
disclose sufficient information such that competitors will be able to
step into the market. This disclosure allows a competitor to make
preparation to enter the market at the end of the monopoly period. Due
to this legally-mandated exclusivity, patent owners -- usually
multinational corporations -- have the right to prevent others from
making, using, or selling a patented invention. The TRIPS Agreement,
concluded as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiation
and in force since 1995, provides a minimum of 20 years patent
protection. The belief is that the duration allows corporations to
recoup the expenses of developing, testing and upscaling an innovative
pharmaceutical product. From the onset, [the TRIPS [IP regime created
imbalance between innovation, market monopoly, and medicines
access]{.mark}, because it failed to take into consideration the health
burden, development needs and local conditions of the various countries
that make up the WTO.]{.underline} This has led to several issues.
First, [[the market monopoly of IP rights]{.mark}, which [allows the
corporation to set the market for drugs, has created a privileged
societal class with access to lifesaving medication]{.mark}
distinguishing them from those excluded from access to available
medications.]{.underline} This phenomenon is vividly illustrated in the
HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1990s and early 2000s. While [HIV/AIDS patients
i]{.underline}n developed countries were able to afford antiretroviral
(ARVs) treatments, which had been developed, approved and patented as
early as 1987, many patients [in Africa and other parts of the
developing world could not afford the approximately USD 12,000 per annum
treatment at that time]{.underline}. By 2001, [approximately 2.4 million
people in the region had died of AIDS.]{.underline} The South African
government intervened to reduce the cost of ARVs by amending its
domestic patent laws to allow the authorization of parallel imports of
patented pharmaceuticals and to encourage the use of generic drugs, but
it was sued by the US industry group Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). Though the lawsuit was eventually
dropped, it highlights the measures pharmaceutical corporations, backed
by some national governments, are willing to take to protect their
profits at the cost of human lives. Significantly, we see [how
[law]{.mark} (or the threat of legal action) [is used]{.mark} not only
[to protect and expand]{.mark} the [profitability]{.mark} of a certain
kind of property but]{.underline}, as Anjali Vats and Deidré Keller have
taught us, [also [reveals IP law's racial investments in whiteness and
its]{.mark} continuing [implications for racial (in)equality]{.mark},
particularly [in the way it informs systems of ownership, circulation,
and distribution of knowledge.]{.mark}]{.underline} Similarly, Natsu
Saito takes up the analysis of IP, race and capitalism by theorizing
some of the ways in which [['value' in IP law]{.mark} concentrated in
the hands of large corporations [is calculated in terms of its
profitability rather than what it contributes to]{.mark} the well-being
of [society]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the proverbial chickens have
come home to roost as even rich countries are beginning to feel the bite
of the dysfunctional IP system. The issue of excessive pricing for
medicines is a growing problem in developed countries as well and has
now become the single biggest category of healthcare spending in these
states, particularly the US. An empirical report by I-MAK reveals how
[excessive pharmaceutical patenting is extending monopolies and driving
up drug prices.]{.underline} The report, for example, notes that [over
half of the top twelve drugs in the US have more than 100 attempted
patents per drug.]{.underline} Specifically, the report revealed that
Humira® by AbbVie (used in the treatment of Crohn's disease and the US's
highest grossing drug) has been issued 130 patents. The drug costs USD
44,000 annually and generated more than USD 19.2 billion for the company
in 2019 alone. The Report also notes that the first patent filed for
Herceptin® -- used in the treatment for certain breast and stomach
cancers -- was in 1985 but currently has pending patent applications
that could extend its market monopoly for 48 more years. Meanwhile,
Celgene has over 105 patents for its oral cancer drug Revlimid® (used in
the treatment of multiple myeloma) extending its monopoly until the end
of 2036 -- a patent lifespan of 40 years[. In addition to excessive
patenting and pricing, we have also come to understand the power of data
in this context. [Health inequity and inequalities in vaccine access are
not unfortunate outcomes of the global IP regime; they are part of its
central architecture. The system is functioning exactly as it is set up
to do.]{.mark}]{.underline} Second, regulatory agencies worldwide
require drugs to undergo safety and efficacy testing to ensure they are
harmless before approval. These tests, known as clinical trials, involve
human subjects and are costly because they can run up to three separate
phases. The data collected during these clinical trials are the
proprietary materials of the company conducting the tests. Because it is
expensive and time-consuming, generic drug companies usually rely on the
safety and efficacy data of brand name companies to seek regulatory
approval as long as they can prove their generic version is chemically
and biologically equivalent to the original. Relying on the test data of
brand name companies reduces the production cost for generic medicines
and allows for quicker market entry. However, recent years have seen a
promotion of time-limited, legally mandated protection against the
non-proprietary use of such data by generic companies. This is known as
data exclusivity. Put differently, data exclusivity is a period when a
generic company cannot use the clinical trial data of an innovator
pharmaceutical company to receive regulatory approval for a generic
medicine. In so doing, data exclusivity provides a layer of protection
in addition to patent protection to further delay market entry of
generic medicines. Data exclusivity periods vary depending on the
jurisdiction. For example, it is twelve years in US and ten years in the
EU. While the TRIPS Agreement does not create property rights over
registration data, the US and the EU have continued to champion and
export data exclusivity through free trade agreements, particularly for
biologics. For example, the US Affordable Health Care for America Act in
2009 extended a 12-year exclusivity period for biologics. This US
interpretation for registration data was also included in the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which sought a 10-year data
exclusivity for new biologics. However, after intense negotiations, the
data exclusivity protection was reduced to 5 years for new
pharmaceuticals. In this instance[, we see [a crystallising of
Euro-American ideas of property]{.mark} and a willingness to promote
those property interests [through the law]{.mark}, both domestic and
international. In fact, certain scholars assert that this [pursuit of
higher]{.mark} TRIPS [standards is driven]{.mark}, in part, by the US
desire to achieve levels of protection it anticipated from the TRIPS
Agreement but failed to secure. Given the influence of the industry and
its representative group, PhRMA, in seeking stronger protection on a
global scale, it is not surprising that the US's post-TRIPS policies
continue to rachet up standards [in ways that undermine access to
affordable medicines, and perpetuate social hierarchy and
subordination.]{.mark}]{.underline} Third, [patent practices in recent
decades have seen pharmaceutical companies engaging in trivial and
cosmetic tweaking of a drug whilst still reaping the benefit of 20 years
of patent protection]{.underline}. This tweaking sometimes involves
making minor changes to patented drugs, such as changes in mode of
administration, new dosages, extended release, or change in color of the
drug. These changes normally do not offer any significant therapeutic
advantage even though pharmaceutical companies argue they provide
improved health outcomes to patients. [These [additional patents on
small changes to existing drugs,]{.mark} known as evergreening or patent
thickets, [block the early entry of competitive, generic medicines that
drive medicine prices dow]{.mark}n. For example, while not mandated by
TRIPS, many US led TRIPS-plus free trade agreements have expanded the
scope for evergreening]{.underline}. These include the US-Jordan FTA
(2000), US-Australia FTA (2004) as well as the US-Korea FTA (2007),
which allow for the patenting of new forms, uses, or methods of using
existing products. [The [development discourse]{.mark} often touted by
developed nations to help countries in the Global South 'catch up' [is
empty when the essential medicines needed to stay alive are deliberately
denied and weaponised]{.mark}.]{.underline} The cancer drug Gleevec®,
owned by Novartis, is another example of how pharmaceutical companies
often secure patents on new, more convenient versions with marginal
therapeutic benefit to patients whilst blocking the entry of generic
medicines. In 2013, Novartis' patent application for Gleevec®-- the β
crystalline form of the salt imatinib mesylate -- was rejected by the
Indian Supreme Court because it lacked novelty. However, the company has
secured patents for this product in other jurisdictions such as the US
and has maintained a high price of Gleevec there. But in India the price
of Gleevec® was reduced from approximately USD 2,200 to USD 88 for one
month's treatment in the generic drugs market as a result of the 2013
Indian Supreme Court judgement. Novartis is not the only culprit. The
depression drug Effexor® by Pfizer was granted an evergreen patent when
the company introduced an extended-release version, Efexor-XR®, even
though there was no additional benefit to patients. Eventually, the
patent was declared invalid, but by then it had already cost an
estimated USD 209 million to Australian taxpayers and kept generic
competition off the market for two and a half years. In another
instance, Pfizer went on to secure an additional patent for the
Pristiq®, which contained identical chemical compound as Efexor-XR®,and
again with no added therapeutic benefit. [These evergreening practices,
of course, have material effects. Apart from [delaying the entry of
generic versions, they give brand-name pharmaceutical companies free
reign in the market]{.mark}, which allows them to set the market
price.]{.underline} Recent years have seen [[monopoly prices rise
exorbitantly causing]{.mark} significant [financial strain to patients,
domestic healthcare services]{.mark} and even insurance companies in
developed countries.]{.underline} A notorious example is Martin Shkreli,
who in 2015 bought the rights to an anti-malarial drug, then raised the
price by 5,000 per cent from a cost of USD 13.50 to USD 750. Similarly,
a white paper by I-MAK shows how excessive patenting and related
strategies are driving families to overspend on lifesaving medicines.
Celgene, the makers of Revlimid® raised the price of the drug by more
than 50 per cent since 2012 to over USD 125,000 per year of treatment.
Using the example of Solvadi® by Gilead, which costs USD 84,000 per
treatment, Feldman notes the drug would cost the US Department of
Defense more than USD 12 billion to treat all hepatitis-infected
patients in US Veterans Affairs. But the US is not alone. In Europe,
expensive drugs have prompted a growing backlash against pharmaceutical
corporations. Reacting to these price hikes, Dutch pharmacies are
bypassing these exorbitant prices by preparing medicines in-house for
individual patients. [[The broken IP system ranging from an
extraordinarily low standard for granting patents to permissions of
patent thickets around a single molecule has not only severely distorted
the system of innovation, but they have also skewed access to
life-saving drugs.]{.mark} As a result, prices for new and existing
medicines are constantly rising, making essential medicines inaccessible
for millions of people around the world.]{.underline}

In this article, I am interested in exploring the legal doctrine of
copyright from the standpoint of a postcolonial critic. According to
Shelley Wright, there is a 'deep and continuing grip of colonial
thinking on all systems currently in place, from the personal and local
to the global.'1 And the law of copyright is no exception. [Like other
areas of [intellectual property,]{.mark} copyright as [a Western
philosophical idea]{.mark}, is deeply [imbued with the values of the
European Enlightenment, liberalism,]{.mark} and a society founded on a
print-based culture.]{.underline} As Wright suggests,
[[copyright]{.mark} continues to be one of 'the [quintessential
representations of]{.mark} the modern, public world of [bourgeois
expansion, male dominance and European colonial infl uence in the
creation of political and economic systems]{.mark} in Europe and the
colonies.]{.underline}'2 Indeed, [[the Western history of copyright is
inextricably tied to the Western history of
colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} A major argument in this article is
that [[copyright]{.mark} (like other forms of intellectual property) is
not a natural right, but instead [embodies]{.mark} a particular set of
[values and assumptions]{.mark} -- such as [the need to commodify
ideas]{.mark}, and also the expression of those ideas.]{.underline} As a
product of the European Enlightenment, [the concept of [copyright has
been infused with]{.mark} the ideals of [the liberal legal
tradition]{.mark}, and these [ideals -- such as 'private property',
'authorship' and 'possessive individualism']{.mark} -- are not universal
principles of property law, but instead are Western ones.]{.underline}
Consequently, [the supposedly universally-shared view of copyright law
embodied in [international agreements]{.mark} such as]{.underline} the
Berne Convention [and the TRIPS Agreement are not simply 'agreements',
but rather [are multifaceted projects (or dominant narratives)]{.mark}
which are [laden with values]{.mark} stemming from particular cultural
traditions, and which have [evolved from]{.mark} particular historical
moments in [Western history]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However,
while [these values have been [packaged and exported around the globe
based on their apparent universality]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is signifi
cant to note that copyright remains a foreign concept in many cultures.
Indeed, a number of societies take a radically different view as to
'what constitutes property or what may rightfully be the subject of
private ownership.'3 Several cultures also consider 'copying' or sharing
ideas within a community as a sign of respect and recognition -- not as
piracy, or a violation of private property rights.4 Before moving on to
explore the concept of copyright law in more detail, I should outline my
reasons for wishing to scrutinise the laws in this area using a
postcolonial lens. [Copyright is a multi-billion dollar global industry,
which has increasingly become an enormous source of revenue for
countries of the North.]{.underline}5 From a postcolonial perspective,
[the export of copyright products raises particular concerns as these
items are not simply just another trade commodity, but emblematise the
exporting cultures' values and traditions.]{.underline} In other words,
Disney movies and MTV songs are not simply just another product because
they represent the cultural signs and symbols of the dominant
narrative.6 Due to the enormous volume and dominant position of Western
popular culture on a global scale[, critics have labeled this
essentially one-way traffi c as a form of 'cultural imperialism' in this
postcolonial era.]{.underline} As Fredric Jameson suggests, [the export
of American culture around the globe has had a far deeper impact than
earlier forms of colonisation, imperialism]{.underline} or simple
tourism, [as these cultural goods]{.underline} (along with agribusiness
and weapons) [constitute the principal economic exports for the
US]{.underline}.7 Moreover, [the current imbalance in global information
fl ows is in many ways merely an extension of the exploitative colonial
past]{.underline}. For this reason, Philip Altbach asserts that
['\[[c\]opyright must not be seen in isolation from issues of access to
knowledge, the needs of Third World nations, and the broad history of
colonialism and exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}'8 I
also wish to examine the concept of copyright law in more detail in
order to partially fi ll the gap in understanding of the negative impact
of an overly prescriptive international copyright regime. This is
important, as [most of the opposition in the late 1990s to the
international intellectual property regime primarily focused on the dire
effects of patents for countries in the South.]{.underline}9 This
article will begin by exploring the concept of copyright law as
essentially a Western idea, and then move on to discuss copyright and
the colonial process, the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement as
colonial (and postcolonial) constructs, and the role of international
copyright law in continually othering the South in the global publishing
and software industries. [[The Western liberal idea of intellectual
property law has now been globalised through]{.mark} the Agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights or
[TRIPS]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}78 The TRIPS Agreement was
[established as [part of the]{.mark} World Trade Organization [(WTO)
regime]{.mark}]{.underline} that came into operation on 1 January 1995.
TRIPS is one of the number of agreements which make up the WTO, and
links intellectual property rights to WTO obligations. [This
international legally binding agreement establishes minimum standards
for intellectual property rights, which members of the WTO must
implement through national legislation.]{.underline} Under TRIPS, the
151 members of the WTO (at 27 July 2007) are required to give effect to
a set of basic minimum principles and rules covering copyright,
trademarks, patents, layout-designs of integrated circuits, geographical
indications, industrial designs, and protection of undisclosed
information. There are also uniform remedies available for the
enforcement of these rights. In many cases, nations are applying higher
standards than were previously applied in their domestic law. For
example, longer terms of protection, fewer exceptions to the scope of
rights, and sometimes new rights. While [the Agreement]{.underline} has
only been in force for thirteen years, [it has been heavily criticised
by Southern nations as essentially [a neocolonial instrument --
privileging the colonial view over the postcolonial ambitions of the
Other]{.mark}]{.underline}.79 Copyright protection is provided for in
Articles 9--14 of the TRIPS Agreement. These provisions are discussed
briefl y below.

#### Legal agreements are grounded in the construction of intellectual property regulations as enlightened safeguards against the primitive savagery of indigenous conceptualizations of property -- international legal frameworks are an ethically bankrupt starting point for change.

[The problems that the establishment of an international legal framework
for world trade could pose for developing countries had been noticed
right from the beginning.]{.underline} In 1964, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) was founded because it was
felt by developing countries that the pattern of world trade
disproportionately favoured the industrialised nations (Blakeney, 1996,
p. 26; Zamora, 1995, pp. 512, 518). In the course of the negotiations
leading to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organisation (WTO
Agreement), a convergence in the positions of the industrialised and the
developing countries has repeatedly been attempted, with some success
(Blakeney, 1996, p. 6). When the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ended with the Final Act on the results of
the Uruguay Round and the Agreement establishing the WTO in Marrakesh on
April 15, 1995, the creation of the WTO as a specialised agency of the
UN realised the hope (reaching back to the time of the creation of the
UN itself) of an international organisation with responsibility for
world trade (Blakeney, 1996, pp. 29, 36; Zamora, 1995, pp. 503, 506;
Jackson, 1998, pp. 24-9); thus in theory, the promotion of world trade
should benefit each Member, developed or developing alike. The preamble
to the WTO Agreement states expressly in the second paragraph that
especially the least developed countries should be secured "a share in
the growth of international trade commensurate with the needs of their
economic development". This overriding principle also applies to TRIPs
(Appendix 1C to the WTO Agreement), and the preamble to TRIPs expressly
recognises (in paragraph 6) the special needs of the least-developed
countries as far as the required domestic implementation of laws and
regulations is concerned, "in order to enable them to create a sound and
viable technological base \...". [These aims indicate the intention to
create the implementation of a benign system of universal common
standards of intellectual property rights for the mutual benefit of all
nations. However, it is well known that originally [the principal
objective of]{.mark} what was to become [TRIPs was]{.mark} actually [the
fight against piracy of Western intellectual property rights in
developing countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the 1970s, the realisation
of the adverse effect which the increase of sales of counterfeited
trade-marked goods had on trade income prompted industrialised countries
to reach an "Agreement on Measures to Discourage the Importation of
Counterfeit Goods", whereby the United States took the lead.8 It was
also the United States which pushed for a recognition of legislative
measures for the protection of intellectual property rights as to be
considered within the jurisdiction of GATT, and not of WIPO only, as
developing countries, especially Brazil and India, had argued (Blakeney,
1996, pp. 2-3; Zamora, 1995, p. 529). This was the starting point for
the present situation of TRIPs being within the WTO framework (Drahos
with Braithwaite, 2002, p. 109).9 The "anti-counterfeit" origin of TRIPs
does not appear in its final preamble (Blakeney, 1996, p. 9), but the
preamble makes clear that [the objective of TRIPs is "the provision of
effective and appropriate means for the enforcement of trade-related
intellectual property rights, taking into account differences in
national legal systems",]{.underline} which obviously encompasses
measures against counterfeited goods. Thus [[TRIPs grew out of the
endeavours by the Western industrialised world to safeguard and enforce
their own Western intellectual property rights, based on Western
concepts, in the non-Western, and typically developing,
countries.]{.underline}]{.mark}10 Theoretically, this could have been
achieved without any reciprocity, because [what really matters to
Western interests is that [Western rights are respected in a nonWestern
context and culture, especially by way of an effective combat against
piracy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus bilateral agreements could have been
reached ensuring that, say, a US patent will be duly protected and
enforced in developing country X, without the requirement that a patent
granted in X will be enforced in the US, or indeed, without X even being
required to maintain a national patent law which could enable X to grant
patents itself; hence there would be no (theoretically) enforceable
right in a country outside X. Such a measure would be openly colonial in
its approach, but politically unsustainable in the late twentieth
century or today, because the developing countries have achieved
sufficient political counterbalance against Western interests during the
period of decolonialisation that allows them to counteract such
strategies at a large scale.11 [[TRIPs]{.mark} wishes to represent a
compromise]{.underline}, which may have been honestly conceived as such
in that it leaves some flexibility for developing countries (Correa,
2002, p. 52), [but, as it [is modelled on Western intellectual property
legislation]{.mark}, it is nevertheless in effect slanted in favour of
Western interests]{.underline} (Drahos with Braithwaite, 2002, pp. 11-6,
143-6; Correa, 2000, p. 3; Robbani, 2005, pp. 565, 571). [The "provision
of effective and appropriate means for the enforcement of trade-related
intellectual property rights" (preamble, pt. c) is obtained through an
introduction of minimum standards of intellectual property
protection]{.underline} (Article 1 (1) TRIPs). These minimum standards
are [determined by TRIPs itself]{.underline}, which is remarkably
detailed for an international instrument in respect of the substantive
law of the respective intellectual property rights,12 [and by broad
reference to the central international intellectual property
conventions,]{.underline} especially the Paris Convention for the
Protection of Industrial Property 1883 (Paris Convention) and the Berne
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 1886 (Berne
Convention).13 [The principle of minimum standards as a basis of mutual
recognition and protection of intellectual property rights is reinforced
by the national treatment rule]{.underline} (Article 3) which echoes the
existing intellectual property conventions in this respect.14 As a
result[, [non-Western countries are required to introduce
comprehensively the Western regime of intellectual property rights,
irrespective of whether this regime is necessarily compatible
with,]{.mark} and useful to, [their own cultures and
economies]{.mark},15 otherwise they would not be able to conform to the
protection obligation of Western intellectual property rights in their
own territory. Non-Western countries are also [expected to undergo an
industrialisation process according to the model of Western]{.mark}
industrialised nations [to create a context in which]{.mark} Western
[intellectual property rights would]{.mark} then [become
meaningful]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ngenda, 2005; Gana, 1996, p. 738). In
return for the protection of their own rights, [Western countries could
generously agree to recognise Westerntype intellectual property rights
originating from developing countries, because these rights were
unlikely to arise often and would not pose a real competitive
threat.]{.underline}16 This is a good example of [[the liberal
ideal]{.mark} of two equal contracting parties that \[[ignores\]
the]{.mark} real imbalance created by [political and economic
realities.]{.mark}]{.underline} It could also be seen as [a modern
version of [constructed savagery of the non-developed world]{.mark}
which [will be overcome by the gift of intellectual property rights from
the developed and civilised nations]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 How Western
in nature TRIPs effectively is, can be shown by the fact that [Western
national legal systems have had to adapt little to TRIPs,18 while, for
example, Latin American and Carribean states had to make significant
changes in their intellectual property laws to implement the minimum
standards]{.underline} (Correa, 2000, pp. 101, 111).19 More recently,
[TRIPs also serves as a bottom line for further extension of IP
protection which the developed world continues to push for in bilateral
"TRIPsPlus" agreements]{.underline} with countries of the developing
world (Drahos, 2001, p. 805). Such "[friendly nudges" towards adaptation
of international standards are obviously not a development of the
postcolonial era.]{.underline} The national treatment provision of the
Paris Convention in Article 2 intended to compel Paris Union members to
provide mutually adequate industrial property laws. It contributed to
Switzerland's decision to introduce a patent law (which it did not have
when it joined the Paris Union) in order to be able to give effect to
this obligation towards nationals of the Paris Union (Oddi, 1987, p.
869). The Netherlands also enacted patent laws which it had abolished
some time before (Bender, 2000, p. 54; Drahos with Braithwaite, 2002, p.
36). [The Paris Convention, and later the Berne Convention, had the then
industrialised Western countries of the 1880s as relevant potential
members to the Paris/Berne Union in mind; the non-Western
world]{.underline} (where it did not have the status of a colony anyway
and was therefore part of the Paris/Berne Union, see Drahos, 2002a, pp.
766-7; Drahos with Braithwaite, 2002, p. 75) [was not perceived as a
significant candidate for such conventions, and conflicts with
indigenous cultures as a result of this transplantation of rights were
then unlikely to be noticed as a potential problem.]{.underline}
Sensitivity in relation to one-sided technology transfer and possible
lack of economic equality was also less developed in the nineteenth
century, despite an otherwise generally far greater tendency to arrogant
nationalism among the European nations. An example is the awkward
British standard gauge of railways of 561 /2 inches (1,435 mm) that can
be found in much of Continental Europe (which adopted the metric system
far earlier) because George Stevenson's first locomotives delivered from
England were produced with this gauge. The legal protection of such
technological innovations usually follows suit and that may help
explaining why it was possible at all to agree on a modest legal
standardisation through the Paris and Berne Conventions in the much more
belligerent atmosphere of the nineteenth century.

#### Reformism is not emancipatory but instead contributes to the iterative perfection of colonial capitalism -- the transformative potential of legal change is circumscribed by hegemonic power structures that are embedded in international political systems.

These events -- [[the corporate capture of the global pharmaceutical IP
regime, state complicity and vaccine imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark} --
are not new. Recall Article 7 of TRIPS, which states that [the objective
of the Agreement is the 'protection and enforcement of intellectual
property rights \[to\] contribute to the promotion of technological
innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of
technology'.]{.underline} In similar vein, Article 66(2) of [TRIPS
further calls on developed countries to 'provide incentives to
enterprises and institutions within their territories to promote and
encourage technology transfer to least-developed country'.]{.underline}
While [[the language of 'transfer of technology' might seem
beneficial]{.mark} or benign, in actuality [it is
not]{.mark}]{.underline}. As I discussed in my book, and as Carmen
Gonzalez has also shown, [when [development objectives are incorporated
into international legal instruments and institutions]{.mark}, they
become [embedded in structures that]{.mark} may [constrain their
transformative potential and reproduce North-South power
imbalances.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is because [these [development
objectives are circumscribed by capitalist imperialist structures,
adapted to justify colonial practices and mobilized through racial
differences. These structures are the essence of international
law]{.mark} and its institutions even in the twenty-first century. They
continue to [animate broader socio-economic engagement with the global
economy]{.mark} even in the present [as well as]{.mark} in [the legal
and regulatory codes that support them]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus[, it
is not surprising that even in current global health crisis, [calls for
this same transfer of technology]{.mark} in the form of a TRIPS waiver
to scale up global vaccine production is being t[hwarted by the hegemony
of developed state]{.mark}s inevitably influenced by their respective
pharmaceutical companies. The '[emancipatory potential']{.mark} of TRIPS
[cannot be achieved if it was not created to be emancipatory in the
first place]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also makes obvious the ways
[[international IP law is]{.mark} not only [unsuited to promote
structural reform to enable]{.mark} the self-sufficiency and
[self-determination of the countries in the global south]{.mark}, but
also [produces asymmetries]{.mark} that perpetuate
inequalities.]{.underline} Concluding Remarks What this pandemic makes
clear is that [the development discourse often touted by developed
nations to help countries in the Global South 'catch up' is empty when
the essential medicines needed to stay alive are deliberately denied and
weaponised. Like the free-market reforms designed to produce
'development', [IP deployed to incentivise innovation is]{.mark} yet
another [tool in the service of private profits]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
this pandemic has shown, [t[he reality of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[contemporary capitalism -- including [the IP regime]{.mark} that
underpins it -- [is competition among corporate giants driven by profit
and not by human need]{.mark}. T]{.underline}he needs of the poor weigh
much less than the profits of big business and their home states.
However, it is not all doom and gloom. Countries such as India, China
and Russia have stepped up in the distribution of vaccines or what many
call 'vaccine diplomacy.' Further, Cuba's vaccine candidate Soberana 02,
which is currently in final clinical trial stages and does not require
extra refrigeration, promises to be a suitable option for many countries
in the global South with infrastructural and logistical challenges.
Importantly, Cuba's history of medical diplomacy in other global South
countries raises hope that the country will be willing to share the
know-how with other manufactures in various non-western countries, which
could help address artificial supply problems and control over
distribution. In sum, [this pandemic provides an opportune moment to
overhaul this dysfunctional global IP system.]{.underline} We need not
wait for the next crisis to learn the lessons from this crisis.

#### Patent laws are a form of intellectual neocolonialism that ensures the accumulation of wealth in the hands of industrialized Western nations through market monopolization.

Partners in Health and Farmer's [efforts to bring modern medicine to an
ex-colony]{.underline} such as Haiti [must be considered in the current
moment of globalization]{.underline}, where [countries are growing more
interconnected and financially dependent than ever before]{.underline}.
Farmer works extensively to bring down the cost of TB-related drug
pricing. [This struggle over pricing highlights the challenges faced by
poor countries in an increasingly global market where most drug
companies are protected by patent laws safeguarded by the World Trade
Organization.]{.underline} According to Oxfam International, [roughly 14
million people in developing countries die each year from infectious
diseases that could be prevented with wider access to medical treatments
and medications]{.underline}. However, [as part of the Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, the WTO has ensured
that the patent regulations for mostly Western pharmaceutical companies
should be protected over measures to increase wider availability of
drugs to poor nations.]{.underline} Thus, [Farmer's struggle to bring
down drug pricing globally reflects another postcolonial concern: the
inability of ex-colonies and the poorer nations of the world to
effectively receive the same standard of care and access to medical
advances as the rich]{.underline}. For Farmer, [this is a problem of
neo-colonization, where wealth continues to be accumulated in the
nations of the West, or the former colonizers, while poor nations, or
the bulk of the colonized world, continue to suffer.]{.underline}
