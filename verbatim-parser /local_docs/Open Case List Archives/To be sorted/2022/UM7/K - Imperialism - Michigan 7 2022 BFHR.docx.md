The **[[celebration of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s 70 years of
existence [provides]{.underline} another [opportunity to
unearth]{.underline} the [**real [history]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[ideas]{.underline}, [practices and destruction wrought by]{.underline}
this [military alliance]{.underline}. [Even with]{.underline} the [clear
exposure of]{.underline} the [cooperation between NATO]{.underline},
[the CIA and]{.underline} the [British MI6 to [spread **terror** and
**psychological warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe immediately
after the formation of this military alliance, the [[mainstream]{.mark}
media]{.underline}, [academics and [policy makers]{.mark} remain [silent
on]{.mark}]{.underline} activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
'**[[false flag]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [[op]{.mark}eration[s that
distorted]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[real causes of insecurity in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark} after 1945. The [[evidence
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[manipulations]{.mark} of the peoples of
the world [to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**continued
[survival]{.mark}** [of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [[**well
documented** in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**fraudulent interventions**
and bombings in the Balkans]{.underline}]{.mark} right up the [present
multiple wars against]{.underline} the [peoples of Iran]{.underline}.

Vijay Prashad had identified [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as [the **prime
[defend]{.mark}er** of [the Atlantic project]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
Atlantic project, he noted was, "[a]{.underline} fairly straightforward
[campaign by the propertied classes]{.underline} to [maintain or
restore]{.underline} their [position of dominance]{.underline}." This
Atlantic Project was anchored in the military alliance called
[NATO]{.underline} with its principal work, that of **[[reversing the
South Project]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the [[struggles]{.mark} for peace
bread and justice [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[poorer citizens]{.mark}
of the planet]{.underline}, especially those who had emerged on the
world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.

The [**[ostensive reason]{.mark}** for the founding of NATO [was
to]{.mark}]{.underline} '[[thwart]{.underline}]{.mark}' [[Soviet
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but in practice]{.mark} the
organization was [a prop for **western capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the core prop for Wall
Street. In this year, there will be many commentaries on the fact that
the existence of NATO reflects a Cold War relic, that NATO is obsolete
and lost its mandate, but very few will [[link]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[expansion of [NATO to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**military
management** of the international system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Prior to
1991, the planners of NATO could justify the existence of NATO on
ideological and political grounds, but with the threat of a multi polar
world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO expanded to the point where
this author joined with others in labelling this organization Global
NATO to [[reflect its]{.mark} **current imperial
[mandate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Global thrust of NATO now comprises
29 members from Europe and North America along with 41 'partners' that
had [started off [under]{.mark} the [banner of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
North Atlantic [[Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} Council (NACC) in
1991. [Since that time]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} has
[[launched]{.mark} a lengthy war]{.underline} without end [in
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}, [colluded in]{.underline} the
[destruction of [Iraq and]{.mark} conspired with
**[militarists]{.mark}**]{.underline} to forge 'Partnership for Peace'
(with most members of the former Warsaw Pact states). The core 29
members are now enmeshed with treaties and undertakings from states
involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. There are
also the 'partners' from across the globe: Afghanistan, Australia,
Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and
Pakistan. This enlargement served the military purposes of encircling
China and Russia who military planners in the West targeted.

There is [[**no shortage** of lit]{.mark}erature [on
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and its [[milestones]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[but]{.mark} **very [few]{.mark}**]{.underline} have
[[documented]{.underline}]{.mark} the [real [crimes]{.mark}
of]{.underline} this [global network of]{.underline} anticommunist
[operatives who precipitated **real [terror]{.mark}** and psychological
warfare against]{.underline} the [citizens of Europe [and]{.mark} North
America while supporting **mass [atrocities]{.mark}** [from
Algeria]{.mark} to [Indonesia]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[South
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. Books such as that of NATO's Secret Armies:
Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by Danielle Ganser and
The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World
War, by Stephen Kinzer [used **[rigorous research]{.mark}
techniques**]{.underline} to [[uncover]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[dark
history]{.mark}** of NATO]{.underline}. These two books can be
distinguished from the [**[bland]{.mark}** **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} texts that [[discusses NATO
inside]{.underline}]{.mark} the old calculations of
'[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark},' '[[concert of
democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}', '**[[security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**' and the [[balance of
power]{.underline}]{.mark},' [and **[s]{.mark}**pheres **[o]{.mark}**f
**[i]{.mark}**nfluence]{.underline}. Most recently, this IR rendering of
the history of NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at
Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one
of the coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document
spelt out ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress,
Nicolas Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that
the current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On
the day before the actual 70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to a joint session of the
US Congress advocating an expansion of the alliance while promoting a
military buildup against Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have
to reflect deeply on whether the current sanctions regime and the
special propose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade
Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of inter imperialist
rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the
shifting alliances yielded confusion among working peoples who
ultimately went to fight against each other in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to Hiroshima.

The continued struggles for bread, peace and justice ensure that it is
only the authoritarian leaders from [the **[Global
South]{.mark}**]{.underline} who [are [compromised
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**real meaning** of]{.mark} the
**existence of [NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the present era, there
is a [new capitalist competition]{.underline} while North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as [an **integral
part** of the Pentagon's **world command
structure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Recent experiences]{.underline} have
[demonstrated]{.underline} in [Afghanistan]{.underline},
[Iraq]{.underline} and [Libya]{.underline} that the **[[moguls]{.mark}
of Wall Street are [willing to wage as many wars]{.mark}, to [destroy as
many countries and]{.mark} to [kill as many people as necessary to
achieve]{.mark} the [dominance of US capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The [destruction of Libya was a classic example]{.underline} of the
convergence of finance as warfare, the weaponization of information and
incessant bombing to destroy a society. Where at the start of NATO the
[[war scare]{.underline}]{.mark} was [[the **propaganda
method**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[In the]{.mark} **current [digital
age]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[brain hacking and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[engineering of]{.underline}]{.mark} smart phones have placed the
**[giant [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** firms of Apple , Google,
Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook [[at the forefront of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**[new weapons]{.mark} platform** [of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and
Wall Street. This [analysis]{.underline} is in three parts [spelling out
the rationale for]{.underline} the call for [**[all progressive
forces]{.mark}** to [join together to concentrate]{.mark}]{.underline}
their [[energies in the **dismantling**]{.mark} **of
[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

End Times

[[Imperialism]{.mark} today [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more
aggressive]{.underline}** [and **boundless**]{.underline}]{.mark} in its
objectives than ever.61 [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the present period of
[**[declining]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony**, as well as **economic
and ecological** decline, [the]{.mark} **dollar-[oil-Pentagon
regime]{.mark}**, backed by the]{.underline} entire [triad]{.underline}
of the United States/Canada, Europe, and Japan, [[is exerting **all of
its**]{.mark} **military and financial [power]{.mark}** [to gain
**geopolitical**]{.mark} **and geoeconomic
[advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}.62 [[The goal is to
**subordinate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [still further those **[countries
at the bottom]{.mark} of the world hierarchy**]{.underline}, while
[putting obstacles in the way of **emerging economies**]{.underline},
and [[overthrowing all states that **violate the rules**]{.mark} **of
the dominant order**]{.underline}. Intercore conflicts within the triad
continue to exist but are currently suppressed, not only due to the
overwhelming force of U.S. power, but also as a result of the perceived
need in the core to contain China and Russia, which are seen as
constituting grave threats to the prevailing imperial order. In China
and in Russia, for different but related historical reasons, global
monopoly-finance capital lacks the dominant combination with the
national capitalists within their political economies that is present in
the other BRICS countries. Meanwhile, [[the
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [[is in
**disarray**]{.mark}, experiencing **centrifugal**]{.underline}, as
opposed to centripetal [tendencies, arising [out of]{.mark}
economic]{.underline} **[stagnation]{.underline}** [and the
**instability generated**]{.underline} [by **[imperial
blowback]{.mark}**]{.underline} emanating from adjacent regions,
[particularly the **Middle East** and **North Africa**]{.underline}.

Under these circumstances, [global value/supply chains]{.underline},
along with [energy, resources, and finance, are]{.underline} more and
more [viewed in **military-strategic terms**. At the center]{.underline}
of this interlocked, globalized world order [is the **unstable
hegemony**]{.underline} [exercised by **[Fortress
America]{.mark}**]{.underline} over both Europe and Japan. The United
States today is [[pursuing]{.underline}]{.mark} a strategy of
[**[full-spectrum dominance]{.mark}**, aimed at not only military, but
also technological, financial, and even global "**energy
dominance**"---[against]{.mark}]{.underline} a backdrop of **[impending
[planetary catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and economic and
**political disarray**]{.underline}.63

In these deteriorating conditions, [neofascist tendencies have
**reemerged once again**, constituting monopoly-finance capital's
**final class-based recourse**---an alliance between **big
capital**]{.underline} [and a newly mobilized **reactionary lower-middle
class.**]{.underline}64 More and more, [[**neoliberalism** is merging
into **neofascism**]{.mark}, [**unleashing racism** and]{.mark}
**revanchist [nationalism]{.mark}**. Anti-imperialist [**peace
movements** have **waned**]{.mark}]{.underline} in most of the
capitalist core, [even in the context of a **revival of the
left**]{.underline}, raising once again the question of social
imperialism.65

There is a sense, of course, in which much of this is familiar. As
Magdoff noted,

> centrifugal and centripetal forces have always coexisted at the core
> of the capitalist process, with sometimes one and sometimes the other
> predominating. As a result, periods of peace and harmony have
> alternated with periods of discord and violence. Generally the
> mechanism of this alternation involves both economic and military
> forms of struggle, with the strongest power emerging victorious and
> enforcing acquiescence on the losers. But uneven development soon
> takes over, and a period of renewed struggle for hegemony emerges.66

**[Late [imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, [[represents
a]{.mark} **historical [end point]{.mark} for the capitalist world
order**, [presaging **either**]{.mark} **planetary
[catastrophe]{.mark}** [or a **new**]{.mark} **revolutionary
[beginning]{.mark}**. Today's Earth]{.underline} System emergency [gives
new **urgency**]{.underline} [to the age-old collective struggle for
"freedom in general."]{.underline}67 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} wider
[human [struggle must build on]{.mark} the **continuing [revolutionary
resistance of]{.mark} the [workers]{.mark} and peoples**]{.underline} in
the global South, [[aimed]{.mark} **first and foremost [at]{.mark}
overthrowing [imperialism]{.mark}**[, as the **global manifestation of
capitalism**. Labor]{.mark} **in core nations [cannot be free]{.mark}**
[until]{.mark} labor in periphery nations is free and **[imperialism is
abolished]{.mark}**]{.underline}.68 What Marx called
[socialism]{.underline}, a society of sustainable human development,
[can only be constructed on a **universal basis**]{.underline}.
[All]{.underline} narrow, invidious, [exploitative relations **must
go**]{.underline}, [and humanity must at last confront with sober senses
its relations with its kind and its unity with the earth]{.underline}.69

8\. [[Reconstructing]{.underline}]{.mark} a "[[front of
countries]{.mark} and peoples [of the South]{.mark}]{.underline}" is
[one of the [**fundamental conditions** for]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[emergence of]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[another
world]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[not founded on **imperialist
domination**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Without underestimating the importance of all kinds of transformations
originating in the societies of the North in the past and present, it
should be emphasized that they have remained, up to now, tied to
imperialism. It should not be surprising, then, that the [[great
transformations on]{.mark} the [**world scale** originated
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[revolt of peoples in the
**peripheries**]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the Russian Revolution (the
weak link of that time) to the Chinese Revolution and [the [Non-Aligned
Movement]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Bandung]{.underline}) that, for a time,
forced imperialism to "adjust" to demands that conflicted with the logic
of its expansion. The page of the [[Bandung Conference]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the [[Tricontinental]{.underline}]{.mark} (1955--1980),
of a globalization that was multipolar, has turned.

The conditions of existing globalization prohibit a remake of the
Bandung Conference. The current ruling classes in the countries of the
South are attempting to be part of this globalization, which they
sometimes hope to bend in their favor, but which they do not fight.
These can be divided into two groups: those who have a "national"
project, the nature of which --- mainly capitalist, but nuanced by
concessions (or not) to the working classes, yet in open or muted
conflict with imperialism --- should be discussed on a case-by-case
basis, such as China or the emergent countries of Asia and Latin
America; and those who do not have such a project and accept having to
adjust unilaterally to imperialist requirements (these, then, are
comprador ruling classes).

Various kinds of alliances are emerging between states (governments),
some of which can be seen within the WTO. We should not spurn the
possibilities that such alliances might open for movements of the
working classes (without, of course, having any illusions).

Is a front of the peoples of the South possible, one that goes beyond
the rapprochements between the ruling classes? The construction of such
a front is difficult since it is set back by the "culturalist"
deviations mentioned above, and results in confrontations between
peoples of the South (on pseudo-religious or pseudo-ethnic bases). It
will be less problematic if and insofar as the [[states]{.mark} that
have a project could]{.underline} --- [under pressure from their
peoples]{.underline} --- [[move in a]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[**resolutely anti-imperialist** direction]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
that implies that their [projects [set aside]{.mark} any
[illusions]{.mark}]{.underline} that "[[national
capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[governments]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} resolutely and [[exclusively able to modify
**imperialist globalization**]{.underline}]{.mark} in their favor [[and
become **active agents**]{.underline}]{.mark} in that globalization,
participating in forming the world system (and not unilaterally
adjusting to it). These [[illusions]{.mark} are **still
[widespread]{.mark}** [and reinforced]{.mark}]{.underline} by the
rhetoric that flatters the "emergent countries," on the way to "catching
up," developed by institutions in the service of imperialism.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} insofar as [[facts]{.underline}]{.mark} come
to [**[contradict]{.mark}** these illusions]{.underline},
[[national]{.mark} popular and **[anti-imperialist
blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline} might once again [[pave the way
to]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[internationalism of
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can only hope that [[**progressive
forces** in the North]{.mark} will [**understand** and **support**
this]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Looking forward: academic and practitioner pushback against colonialism,
and cautionary tales

[[Given]{.mark} the]{.underline} historical and [[ongoing]{.mark} mutual
[**complicity between knowledge producers** and **policy-makers** in
**upholding imperial**]{.mark}]{.underline} and racial [[**orders**,
we]{.mark} now [consider]{.mark}]{.underline} the responsibilities,
possibilities and challenges faced in [altering the nature of that
nexus]{.underline}. [Doing so requires]{.underline} turning to what
Danso and Aning call [an ['**episteme of
alternativity**]{.mark}']{.underline};41 [and the primary way for
academics to enact this would be to draw on anti-colonial practice and
legacies]{.underline}, rather than imperial competition, [as the
foundation of their theorizing]{.underline}.

Thus, in his article, Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh forefronts global South
policy-makers and focuses on the nuclear order (a topic that is
typically associated with realist IR) to demonstrate how it can be
approached through an alternative, critical epistemology.42 Disrupting
the 'Great Power gaze', Mpofu-Walsh asks what the politics of
non-proliferation looks like from the perspective of the global South,
especially the African continent as the sole nuclear weapon-free zone
(NWFZ). There, denuclearization is fundamentally linked to
decolonization. Thus anti-colonial goals, rather than
hegemonic/imperialist competition, are at the root of both policy and
theorizing. How different would IR knowledge and theories on nuclear
weapons be if African praxis and the importance of NWFZs were taken
seriously? Turning to the Middle East, Gani similarly argues in her
article that the inclusion of non-western history and voices---from
policy-makers to activists and scholars---in think-tank discussions can
mitigate the latent colonialism that shapes western policy.43

Nevertheless, [even with an incorporation of non-western
practice]{.underline} and knowledge in policy making and scholarly
theorizing, [multiple perspectives that are marginalized even in the
local context, owing to class or gender, may continue to go
unheard]{.underline}.44 One crucial way in which both academics and
practitioners can challenge such patterns is by [adopting a more
expansive reading of what constitutes 'knowledge' and indeed
'practice']{.underline}. In doing so, [[we can dismantle]{.mark} some of
the [constructed]{.mark} and [**false hierarchies** between **elite
'knowledge'**]{.mark}]{.underline} and 'research' on one hand, [[and
local 'tradition']{.underline}]{.mark} on the other.45 [The former is
assumed to be objective, reliable and associated with
western]{.underline} (and western-validated) [universities; while the
latter is viewed as subjective]{.underline}, unscientific and commonly
associated with Indigenous, racialized, grassroots communities.
[[Assumptions about who counts as a true knowledge]{.mark} producer or
[**'expert'** is]{.mark} not only [elitist]{.mark} but **heavily
[racialized and gendered]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Definitions of who
counts as a 'practitioner' are equally narrow, so that scholars or
policy-makers may place much weight on the views and actions of state,
global governance and corporate practitioners, but do not view as equal
practitioners those involved in everyday practice in their
communities---those who in fact sustain their ecology, livelihoods,
security and identities, all while having to navigate the impact of
top-down policies.46

Both the articles by Jan Wilkens and Alvine Datchoua-Tirvaudey on
climate justice, and by Althea Rivas and Mariam Safi on the organizing
and practices of Afghan women, share knowledge from non-elite local
communities and challenge the above binaries and hierarchies. In their
article on climate justice in the Arctic and the Mediterranean, Wilkens
and Datchoua-Tirvaudey explain that academic--practitioner knowledge
exchange has often been a contributing factor in continued climate
injustice.47 The existing patterns of this knowledge exchange on climate
governance are dependent on hierarchies of knowledge, namely, the
valorization of western/'scientific' knowledge production at the expense
of the needs and knowledges of the Indigenous and local communities most
affected by climate change (i.e. the community-based practitioners,
rather than the institutional/state ones). Moreover, the spaces where
such knowledge exchange takes place are often exclusionary (in who is
invited, in the parameters of discourse and/or in the extortionate costs
of participating), producing an intra-elite debate.48 Having identified
these racialized patterns, they offer a corrective decolonial strategy
for ethical climate governance, founded on practice-based knowledge and
diverse ways of knowing that bring in those excluded insights.

The article by Rivas and Safi also provides an example of how the
academic--practitioner nexus can be 'decolonized', one in which everyday
knowledges of Afghan women, in all their diversity and complexity, are
centred in peacebuilding efforts.49 Their article, co-written by an
academic and a local practitioner, offers a methodology of how to take
into account the internal hierarchies of positionality, interests and
knowledges that are always present when engaging with grassroots
communities for the sake of 'research'. Rivas and Safi also demonstrate
the importance of registering and valuing the unlooked-for, atypical
knowledges from below, such as the subtle observations offered by Afghan
women in rural areas that, contrary to wider assumptions, reflect their
political engagement and interest.

Caution against extractivism in the search for such local knowledge
exchange is at the forefront of both the above contributions.50 Thus
academics should remain reflexive in what the purpose of their research
is, and who really benefits. Moreover, a praxis of decolonizing such
research necessarily entails taking time in a way that is at odds with
the current culture of speedy and multitudinous productivity in
academia: the rapid churning out of articles from 'the field' should
raise appropriate questions about how, why and for whom that research is
being conducted.

Of course, at issue is not just whom but also what we consider as worthy
of scholarly and policy attention, and how inclusive we are of
alternative methodologies. Dependence on state and official archives,
'canonical' theorists, written records and English-language sources all
reproduce the racialized hierarchies inherent in the prioritization of
certain types of knowledge and transmission.51 These factors also close
the door on appreciating the power---both practical and
ideational---generated by collective social action, whose impact cannot
(and should not) be individualized to one or a few visible and often
romanticized protagonists. Recognizing all this and reading into the
silences of the archives should encourage greater attention to
non-hegemonic record-keeping, story-telling and witnessing beyond
elitist and prohibitive barriers---from oral histories, to poetry, art
and independent publishing on paper and online. As anti-colonial and
anti-racist thinkers and activists have long argued, these are the ways
in which those who are dispossessed and marginalized, but also,
consequently, autonomous, have kept their identities, cultures and
memories alive, and sought to prevent their experiences from being
suppressed and erased.52 In the face of systematic racism and the
colonial dismantling of their histories, those who are marginalized are
not, in fact, silent but continue to cultivate and share knowledge, even
if they may lack the resources and type of support received by hegemonic
knowledges (and people).53 Recognizing the equal validity of
marginalized forms of knowledges in both academic and policy realms
pushes back against the de-representation in knowledge exchanges within
elite spaces and formats.

However, it would be erroneous to assume from these arguments that
knowledge produced by so-called elite communities is always bad, and
that knowledge or cultural production from the bottom up is always more
authentic and supports the cause of justice. Srdjan Vucetic\'s article
unsettles multiple binaries, between the elite and the 'masses', as well
as between academics and practitioners.54 Drawing on the work of Stuart
Hall, he complicates what we read as knowledge production and who we see
as its progenitors, challenging the notion of purely top-down (and
imperialist) identity construction. Exploring the role (and popularity)
of nationalistic films and novels as signifiers of this consensus
between policy-makers and wider society, Vucetic demonstrates that it is
not enough to hold accountable only those deemed to possess political
capital, be they policy-makers or academics. Rather, it is necessary
also to challenge the broader pressures and expectations of the public
that produce a collusion between elite and mass discourse, and help to
foreclose the adoption of more critical, justice-oriented policies.
Thus, if we focus solely on academics and practitioners in any
anti-racist work, we miss the uncomfortable reality that narrow,
exclusionary nationalism that foments such racism and imperialist
foreign policies actually enjoys substantial 'buy-in' from people and
may be an accepted part of a local (in this case British) identity.

This observation reinforces the need outlined above for a more expansive
approach to defining knowledges, but this time when interrogating the
generators of coloniality. This in turn allows us to bring into equal
focus other facilitating institutions and mediums of knowledge
dissemination, many of which play a pivotal role in making colonial
tropes and erasures more palatable, accessible, even culturally and
economically valuable. This theme runs through several of the articles
in this special issue. As noted above, Vucetic\'s article focuses on
cultural output; Antweiler looks at museums and schools; Baji considers
the instrumentalization of local folklore for imperialist ideologies in
Japan; Plonski and Manchanda examine the power of racial capitalism via
Israel\'s surveillance industry and marketing; and Gani scrutinizes the
impact of journalistic discourse and think tanks.

Thus far, a lot of responsibility for challenging the racial and
colonial dynamics of the academic--practitioner nexus has been placed
with knowledge producers, whether within or outside academia. But it is
necessary to emphasize that efforts have already been under way, not
only to 'decolonize' our academic disciplines, but to bring that
discourse into the public realm. At that point practitioners need to
carry their share of responsibility in listening to and applying the
expertise (whether academic or community-based) that can foster more
just policies. Instead, the attention policy-makers give to expertise is
often selective and politicized, based not on what can actually improve
people\'s lives but on what helps to justify the existing approaches
adopted by governments. The current denigration and growing
securitization of critical race theory, especially in the United States
but increasingly elsewhere, is an example of attacks on emancipatory
knowledges that challenge power and oppression. Offering another stark
example of this, Amal Abu-Bakare explores in her article the lack of any
serious attempts to confront Islamophobia in society, despite the wealth
of research and expert advice from scholars and community-based
practitioners available to policy-makers.55 Focusing on the cases of the
UK and Canada, she highlights the way in which practitioner
intervention, in this case that of security and police officials, has
actively prevented the adoption of expert guidelines on tackling
Islamophobia on the grounds that they might interfere with their
counterterrorism strategies. In many ways this is a blatant
acknowledgement from policy-makers that their counterterrorism strategy
is inherently built upon racial tropes and discrimination. In contrast,
so-called 'neutral' research on terrorism and/or counterterrorism is
embraced by practitioners, precisely because such research might not ask
uncomfortable questions about the racial foundations or assumptions that
are necessary to enact their policies.

Abu-Bakare\'s article offers an example of the limitations of
academic--practitioner knowledge exchange. [[Exhorting scholars to
**make**]{.mark} **their [research policy relevant]{.mark}** does not
address the unequal receptivity towards critical research that may
challenge policy]{.underline}. Nor does it sufficiently take into
account the implicit disciplining that can take place in that process of
knowledge exchange. [Those very spaces or channels that are created to
facilitate]{.underline} sharing, listening and [negotiation between
knowledge producers and practitioners]{.underline} (through all the
blurred boundaries between them) [may reproduce and [**reify
hierarchies** through **unequal interactions**]{.mark}. Is real dialogue
possible if power dynamics render the interlocutors
unequal?]{.underline}56 Or, in their efforts to be heard, taken
seriously, and make their presence worthwhile, academics and other
knowledge producers may find themselves being subtly socialized into the
very modes of speech and thought that they sought to criticize. This can
also happen in reverse when grassroots practitioners share spaces with
scholars and elite institutions. [[The path-breaking and radical ideas
needed to initiate change]{.mark} on some of the most deep-seated
problems in politics and society [may be diluted]{.mark} in such spaces
[for]{.mark} the sake of **[pragmatism]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
communication, **[[undermining the ability to imagine]{.mark} real
[alternatives]{.mark} to the status quo]{.underline}**. This is not to
say that knowledge producers, whether academic or community-based,
should not engage with policy-makers, but rather that they should be
clear in what they seek to achieve---[if]{.underline}, for example,
constructive dialogue or [receptivity to expertise is unlikely, it is at
times necessary and an ethical responsibility simply to register
alternative ideas or contestation]{.underline}. Returning to the point
made at the start of this piece, [this cautions us in how we champion
'impact' and knowledge--policy engagement, especially if we only
recognize engagements that supplement and are **'useful' to systems of
power** rather than those that **hold them to account**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

This special issue introduces the readers of International Affairs to
the relatively undertheorized and underhistoricized relationship between
race, knowledge production and policy-making. The articles demonstrate
the ways in which [practitioners have historically relied on research
produced within the academy to inform [policy]{.mark}]{.underline},
initiating the establishment of departments and disciplines for this
purpose, [but they also show the reverse to be equally true: that
policy]{.underline}, both foreign and multilateral, [[influences
the]{.mark} possibilities and **[parameters of
research]{.mark}**]{.underline}, funding and recruitment practices, and
retention of jobs.57 [A key goal of this special issue has been to
foster reflection on the ways in which knowledge production]{.underline}
(in its multifaceted forms) [contributes to]{.underline} or challenges
the practice of [racism and coloniality]{.underline}; [and the ways in
which [policy]{.mark}]{.underline} and practice shape, validate, [limit
or ignore [knowledge production]{.mark}---in ways that]{.underline}
either **[[perpetuate]{.underline}]{.mark}** or interrogate
**[[coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the three categories
delineated above show, [the]{.underline} **[[academic--practitioner
nexus]{.underline}]{.mark}** is best captured as a series of
foreclosures that actively work to uphold narrowly espoused evolutionary
myths of the discipline and [entrench a naturalization of
white-racialized subject positions in academic discourse on the
'international', while sidelining scholars and activists, notably women
and people of colour]{.underline}, who have made undeniable
contributions to analysis of the contemporary world.58 All this brings
into view, as one scholar puts it, 'the fundamental ways in which IR
already is, and always has been, complicit in ordering politics'.59

As we have argued in this introductory piece, the exposure in this
special issue of the deep academic--practitioner nexus confronts and
challenges the 'gaps' discourse advanced at the expense of making
visible the existing reciprocity that disciplines the boundaries of
acceptable enquiry. [The outcome of this disciplining at the theoretical
level can be seen in the construction of paradigms that normalize
Eurocentric presuppositions on 'how the world is']{.underline}. But such
outcomes are also made manifest through material implications generated
by narrow policy responses and policy instruments.

[The special issue is]{.underline} not just an exposure, though; it is
also [a **call for repair**. To embark on a project of repair, those
involved in knowledge production]{.underline}, dissemination and
application---[within [academia]{.mark}]{.underline}, think tanks,
museums, schools, cultural production and policy---first and foremost
[[need to recognize that **their work is not detached from**]{.mark}
**the [real world]{.mark}**, even if they seek to make it
so]{.underline}. If the articles in this special issue have shown
anything, it is that [there can be no realistic and honest demarcation
between political and apolitical knowledge]{.underline}: to assert
neutrality is like offering a blank slate that will inevitably be
written over. It is worth knowing that [even with the best intentions,
**[a scholar\'s work is]{.mark} likely to be [co-opted for political
ends]{.mark}**[; and that **one\'s erasures**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
blind spots regarding injustice, [even if innocently produced, [will be
**taken as justification for**]{.mark}]{.underline} inaction and
[**[marginalization of]{.mark} these [injustices]{.mark} in the real
world**.]{.underline}

[Sincerity in seeking to prevent racist or imperialist co-optation
necessitates more **open interrogations of power** and commitments to
justice]{.underline}: and without doubt IR, whether 'analytical' or
'critical', and academia more broadly, are filled with sincere and
honourable scholars who care about the world they live in and have the
capacity to enact positive change. [Questioning and challenging accepted
and expected modes of academic enquiry requires courage and creativity,
both of which are aided through collective effort]{.underline}. This
special issue, then, is an invitation to adopt that courage and
creativity in how we cultivate knowledge, in questioning the purpose and
the ends of that knowledge, and to be discerning in how we try to put it
into practice.

### FW --- Asia Discourse

The problematization inherent in Orientalism in the wake of both WWII
and Vietnam is clear: **[such appropriative violence]{.underline}**,
[generalizations, and adaptations of the "Oriental" present]{.underline}
**[significant dangers]{.underline}** [to Asian and Asian American
populations]{.underline}. When [reduced to either]{.underline}
**[faceless notions of fear and death]{.underline}** [or to singularized
caricatures of spies and warmongers]{.underline}, such
[dehumanization]{.underline} can be (and [is]{.underline}) [used as a
tool for encouraging collective action against these apparent
"threats."]{.underline} Such is [evident in the wake of the bombing of
Pearl Harbor, when white American officials imprisoned **innocent
Japanese Americans**]{.underline} not unlike Picture Bride's Hana and
Taro in domestic internment camps. Twenty years later, Americans waged
[similar collective actions against **Vietnamese soldiers**, civilians,
and]{.underline} the conflict's [survivors over the course of the
Vietnam war and in its aftermath]{.underline}. These
Orientalist-inspired actions presented severe physical and historical
implications for Vietnamese men, women, and children. During the war,
emboldened by notions that they were fighting a collectively deserving
and essentially soulless enemy, American troops routinely brutalized and
sexually victimized Vietnamese women and civilians. Ninh's novel details
several instances of American soldiers' savagery in Vietnam, including
the [rape]{.mark} of a young North Vietnamese soldier named Hoa by a
troupe of American soldiers. During the war, American troops
indiscriminately assaulted Vietnam and Vietnamese men, women, and
children with an endless barrage of physical and sexual violence on a
massive scale. Additionally, however, during and in the aftermath of the
Vietnam War, popular American media was also working to deface images of
men like The Sorrow of War's Kien and Vuong to justify the U.S.'
involvement in Vietnam and American soldiers' subsequent brutality
overseas. The release of propaganda and films like The Green Berets and
The Deer Hunter perpetuated images of men like Kien and Vuong as
unfeeling and apathetic warmongering monsters and indirectly promoted
the idea that Vietnamese women were merely necessary casualties or
deserved conquests of the war. These [generalizations and reactions not
only encouraged anti-Asian violence overseas and presented an immediate
physical danger to Asians and Asian Americans, but also entailed the
near complete erasure of accounts]{.underline} like Uchida and Ninh's
[from]{.underline}---ultimately---[what Western powers perpetuate as the
**universal lexicon of knowledge**]{.underline} [concerning the planet's
eastern hemisphere]{.underline}. Therefore, The Sorrow of War is so
critical as, without accounts like Ninh's, narratives dismissive of
Vietnamese autonomy would, historically, have been better able to
dominate Western perceptions of a supposedly "deserving" population of
Vietnamese men, women, and children. Almost thirty years after American
troops withdrew from Vietnam's jungles, leaving [behind a myriad of
destruction---a mark ultimately symbolic of white America's racial
apathy and endless imperialist quest to maintain its own
preeminence---American Orientalism would again reconfigure itself and
result in the manifestation of yet another new adaptation of Lee's
"Oriental" figure]{.underline}. Decades after Vietnam, the U.S.' next
adaptation of the "Oriental" would need to be [outlandish and
encompassing enough to justify white officials' **imperialist assaults**
on the freedoms of Asian and Asian American populations]{.underline} at
home and abroad. Therefore, while adaptations of the Oriental in the
early 1940s and mid-to-late 1960s---perpetuated to justify the mass
incarceration of Japanese Americans and as grounds for American
interventionism in Vietnam---were already ludicrously grand, white
America's next readaptation of the Oriental figure in the early
twentyfirst century would prove to be white America's most dramatic
assault on Asian individualism--- and, subsequently, its deadliest call
to arms---yet.

[If one wishes [to be exposed to]{.mark}]{.underline} news,
[[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} or perspective [[that
contravenes]{.mark} the prevailing US/[NATO]{.mark} view]{.underline} on
the war in Ukraine, [[a **rigorous search** is]{.mark}
**[required]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And [[there is **no guarantee**
that]{.mark} **search [will succeed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is
because the [state/corporate [censorship]{.mark} regime that has been
imposed in the West with regard to this war [is]{.mark} **stunningly
[aggressive]{.mark}**[, **rapid** and
**comprehensive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On a virtually daily basis, any off-key news agency, independent
platform or individual citizen is liable to be banished from the
internet. In early March, barely a week after Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, the twenty-seven nation European Union --- citing
"disinformation" and "public order and security" --- officially banned
the Russian state-news outlets [RT and Sputnik]{.underline} from being
heard anywhere in Europe. In what Reuters called "an unprecedented
move," [all television and online platforms were barred]{.underline} by
force of law [from airing content from those two outlets]{.underline}.
Even prior to that censorship order from the state, [Facebook and Google
were already banning those outlets]{.underline}, and [Twitter
immediately announced they would as well]{.underline}, in compliance
with the new EU law.

But what [was "**unprecedented**"]{.underline} just six weeks ago [has
now become **commonplace**, even **normalized**. Any platform devoted to
offering inconvenient-to-NATO new]{.underline}s or alternative
perspectives [is **guaranteed a very short lifespan**]{.underline}. Less
than two weeks after the EU's decree, [Google announced that it
was]{.underline} voluntarily [banning **all Russian-affiliated
media**]{.underline} worldwide, meaning [Americans]{.underline} and all
other non-Europeans [were]{.underline} now [blocked from viewing those
channels]{.underline} on YouTube if they wished to. As so often happens
with Big Tech censorship, much of the pressure on Google to more
aggressively censor content about the war in Ukraine came from its own
workforce: "Workers across Google had been urging YouTube to take
additional punitive measures against Russian channels."

[So **prolific** and **fast-moving** is this censorship regime that it
is virtually **[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to count how
many]{.mark} platforms, agencies and individuals [have been
**banished**]{.mark} for the crime of expressing views deemed
"**pro-Russian**]{.underline}." On Tuesday, [Twitter]{.underline}, with
no explanation as usual, suddenly [banned one]{.underline} of the most
informative, reliable and careful dissident accounts, named "[Russians
With Attitude]{.underline}." Created in late 2020 by two
English-speaking Russians, the account exploded in popularity since the
start of the war, from roughly 20,000 followers before the invasion to
more than 125,000 followers at the time Twitter banned it. An
accompanying podcast with the same name also exploded in popularity and,
at least as of now, can still be heard on Patreon.

What makes this outburst of Western censorship so notable --- and what
is at least partially driving it --- is that [there is a]{.underline}
clear, demonstrable **[hunger]{.underline}** in the West [for news and
information]{.underline} that is [**banished by Western news sources**,
ones which loyally and unquestioningly mimic claims from]{.underline}
the U.S. government, [NATO]{.underline}, and Ukrainian officials. As The
Washington Post acknowledged when reporting Big Tech's "unprecedented"
banning of RT, Sputnik and other Russian sources of news: "In the first
four days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [viewership of more than a
dozen Russian state-backed propaganda channels on YouTube
**spiked**]{.underline} to unusually high levels."

Note that [this [censorship]{.mark} regime [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
completely one-sided and, as usual, [**entirely [aligned with U.S.
foreign policy]{.mark}**. Western news]{.underline} outlets and social
media platforms [have been flooded with **pro-Ukrainian propaganda** and
**outright lies**]{.underline} from the start of the war. A New York
Times article from early March put it very delicately in its headline:
"Fact and Mythmaking Blend in Ukraine's Information War." Axios was
similarly understated in recognizing this fact: "[Ukraine misinformation
is **spreading**]{.underline} --- and **[not just from
Russia]{.underline}**." Members of the U.S. Congress have gleefully
spread fabrications that went viral to millions of people, with no
action from censorship-happy Silicon Valley corporations. That is not a
surprise: [all [participants]{.mark} in war [use
**disinformation**]{.mark} and **propaganda**]{.underline} [[to
**manipulate**]{.mark} **public [opinion in their
favor]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and that certainly includes all direct and
proxy-war belligerents in the war in Ukraine.

Yet there is little to no censorship --- either by Western states or by
Silicon Valley monopolies --- of pro-Ukrainian disinformation,
propaganda and lies. The [censorship goes **only in one direction**: to
silence any voices deemed "**pro-Russian**,"]{.underline} regardless of
whether they spread disinformation. The "Russians With Attitude" Twitter
account became popular in part because they sometimes criticized Russia,
in part because they were more careful with facts and viral claims that
most U.S. corporate media outlets, and in part because there is such a
paucity of outlets that are willing to offer any information that
undercuts what the U.S. Government and NATO want you to believe about
the war.

Their crime, like the crime of so many other banished accounts, was not
disinformation but skepticism about the US/NATO propaganda campaign. Put
another way, [it is not "**disinformation**" but]{.underline} rather
**[viewpoint-error]{.underline}** that is [targeted for silencing. One
can spread as many lies and as much disinformation as one
wants]{.underline} provided that it is [designed to advance]{.underline}
the **[NATO]{.underline}** agenda in Ukraine (just as one is free to
spread disinformation provided that its purpose is to strengthen the
Democratic Party, which wields its majoritarian power in Washington to
demand greater censorship and commands the support of most of Silicon
Valley). But what [one **cannot**]{.underline} do is **[question the
NATO/Ukrainian propaganda framework]{.underline}** without running a
very substantial risk of banishment.

It is unsurprising that [Silicon Valley monopolies exercise their
**censorship power**]{.underline} [in full alignment with the **foreign
policy interests of the U.S. Government**]{.underline}. Many of the key
tech monopolies --- such as [Google and Amazon]{.underline} ---
routinely [seek]{.underline} and obtain [highly lucrative contracts with
the U.S. security state,]{.underline} including both the CIA and NSA.
Their top [executives enjoy]{.underline} very close [relationships with
top Democratic Party officials]{.underline}. And [Congressional
Democrats have]{.underline} repeatedly [hauled tech executives before
their various Committees to explicitly threaten them with legal and
regulatory reprisals if they do **not censor more**]{.underline} in
accordance with the policy goals and political interests of that party.

But one question lingers: why is there so much urgency about silencing
the small pockets of dissenting voices about the war in Ukraine? This
war has united the establishment wings of both parties and virtually the
entire corporate media with a lockstep consensus not seen since the days
and weeks after the 9/11 attack. One can count on both hands the number
of prominent political and media figures who have been willing to
dissent even minimally from that bipartisan Washington consensus ---
dissent that instantly provokes vilification in the form of attacks on
one's patriotism and loyalties. Why is there such fear of allowing these
isolated and demonized voices to be heard at all?

The answer seems clear. The [[benefits]{.mark} from this
war]{.underline} for multiple key Washington power centers **[[cannot be
overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [**[billions]{.mark} of dollars**
in aid and weapons being sent by the U.S. to Ukraine [are
flying]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[so fast]{.underline}**]{.mark} and
[[with]{.mark} such **seeming [randomness]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[it is **difficult to track**]{.mark}. "Biden approves \$**350
million**]{.underline} in military aid for Ukraine," Reuters said on
February 26; "Biden announces \$**[800 million]{.underline}** in
military aid for Ukraine," announced The New York Times on March 16; on
March 30, NBC's headline read: "Ukraine to receive **[additional \$500
million]{.underline}** in aid from U.S., Biden announces"; on Tuesday,
Reuters announced: "U.S. to announce **[\$750 million
more]{.underline}** in weapons for Ukraine, officials say." By design,
[these gigantic numbers have long ago lost **any meaning**]{.underline}
[and provoke **barely a peep of questioning**]{.underline} let alone
objection.

It is not a mystery who is benefiting from this orgy of military
spending. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that "[the Pentagon will host
leaders from the top eight U.S. weapons manufacturers]{.underline} on
Wednesday [to discuss the industry's capacity to meet
Ukraine's]{.underline} weapons [needs]{.underline} if the war with
Russia lasts years." [Among those]{.underline} participating in this
meeting about the need to increase weapons manufacturing to feed the
proxy war in Ukraine [is **[Raytheon]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is
[fortunate to [have]{.mark} retired General]{.underline} Lloyd [[Austin
as]{.mark} **Defense [Secretary]{.mark}**, a position to which he
[ascended from]{.mark} the **[Raytheon]{.mark} Board of Directors**. It
is virtually impossible to imagine an **event more favorable to the
weapons manufacturer industry**]{.underline} [than]{.underline} this war
in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**:

This permanent power faction is far from the only one to be reaping
benefits from the war in Ukraine and to have its fortunes depend upon
prolonging the war as long as possible. [The union of the U.S. security
state, Democratic Party neocons, and]{.underline} their [media allies
has not been riding this high since the glory days of 2002]{.underline}.
One of MSNBC's most vocal DNC boosters, Chris [Hayes,
gushed]{.underline} that the war in [Ukraine]{.underline} has
[revitalized faith and trust in the **CIA**]{.underline} [and
**intelligence community**]{.underline} more than any event in recent
memory --- deservedly so, he said: "[The last few weeks have been
[like]{.mark} the **[Iraq]{.mark} War [in reverse]{.mark}**]{.underline}
for US intelligence." [[One can barely read]{.underline}]{.mark} a
mainstream newspaper or watch a corporate [[news]{.underline}]{.mark}
outlet [[without]{.mark} seeing]{.underline} [the nation's most
**[bloodthirsty warmongering band]{.mark} of neocons**]{.underline} ---
David [Frum]{.underline}, Bill [Kristol]{.underline}, Liz
[Cheney]{.underline}, Wesley [Clark]{.underline}, Anne
[Applebaum]{.underline}, Adam [Kinzinger]{.underline} --- [being
celebrated as **wise experts**]{.underline} and heroic warriors for
freedom.

[This war has been very good indeed for the permanent Washington
**political and media class**]{.underline}. And although it was taboo
for weeks to say so, it is now beyond clear that [the only goal that the
U.S. and its allies have when it comes to the war in Ukraine is to keep
it **dragging on for as long as possible**]{.underline}. Not only are
there no serious American diplomatic efforts to end the war, but [the
goal is to ensure **that does not happen**]{.underline}. They are now
saying that explicitly, and it is not hard to understand why.

The [benefits from **endless quagmire**]{.underline} in Ukraine [are as
**immense** as they are **obvious**. [The]{.mark} military [budget
**skyrockets**.]{.mark} Punishment is imposed on the
**arch-nemesis**]{.underline} of the Democratic Party --- [Russia and
Putin]{.underline} --- [while they are **bogged down**]{.underline} [in
a war from which **Ukrainians suffer most**]{.underline}. The
[[**citizenry** unites]{.mark} **behind their leaders**]{.underline} and
is [**[distracted from]{.mark} their collective [deprivations]{.mark}**.
The emotions provoked]{.underline} by the horrors of this war ---
unprecedentedly shown to the public by the Western media which typically
ignores carnage and victims of wars waged by Western countries and their
allies --- [is a]{.underline} very [potent tool to **maintain
unity**]{.underline} [and **demonize domestic adversaries**. The pundit
class finds strength, purpose and resolve, able to feign a Churchillian
posture without **any of the risks**. Prior sins]{.underline} and crimes
of American elites [are **absolved**]{.underline} [and
**forgotten**]{.underline} at the altar of maximalist claims about
Putin's unprecedented evils --- just as they were absolved and forgotten
through the script which maintained that the U.S. had never encountered
a threat as grave or malignant as Trump. After all, [if Putin and Trump
are Hitler or even worse, then anyone who opposes them is **heroic** and
**noble**]{.underline} regardless of all their prior malignant acts.

And that is why [even small pockets of dissent **cannot be
tolerated**]{.underline}. It is vital that [Americans and Europeans
remain entrapped inside a **completely closed system of
propaganda**]{.underline} about the war, just as Russians are kept
entrapped inside their own. [Keeping these populations **united in
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline} of fighting a proxy war against Russia
[[is]{.mark} far [too valuable]{.mark} on too many [levels to permit
any]{.mark} **questioning or [alternative perspectives]{.mark}**.
Preventing people from asking who this war benefits]{.underline}, and
who is paying the price for it, [is **paramount**]{.underline}.

[Big Tech has]{.underline} long [proven to be a reliable instrument of
**censorship** and **dissent-quashing**]{.underline} for the U.S.
Government (much to the chagrin of corporate media employees, Russian
outlets still remain available on free speech alternatives such as
Rumble and Telegram, which is why so much ire is now directed at them).
A rapid series of [ostensible "**[crises]{.mark}**"]{.underline} ---
Russiagate, 1/6, the COVID pandemic --- [[were **all exploited**]{.mark}
**to condition [Westerners to believe]{.mark} that [censorship
was]{.mark} not only justified but [necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
their own good. In the West, [censorship now provokes not **anger** but
**gratitude**. All of that laid the perfect foundation for this new
**escalation of a censorship regime**]{.underline} in which dissent, on
a virtually daily basis, is increasingly more difficult to locate.

No matter one's views on Russia, Ukraine, the U.S. and the war, it
should be deeply alarming to watch such a concerted, united campaign on
the part of the most powerful public and private entities to stomp out
any and all dissent, while so aggressively demonizing what little
manages to slip by. No matter how smart or critically minded or
sophisticated we fancy ourselves to be, [none of us is immune to
**official propaganda**]{.underline} campaigns, [**studied** and
**perfected** over decades. Nor is any of us immune to the pressures of
**group-think**]{.underline} and herd behavior [and **hive
minds**]{.underline}: these are embedded in our psyches and thus easily
exploitable.

[That is precisely the objective of **restricting and closing the
information system**]{.underline} available to us. [It makes it
extremely **difficult to remain skeptical or critical of the
bombardment**]{.underline} [of approved messaging we receive every day
from every direction in **every form**.]{.underline} And [[that is
**precisely the reason** to **oppose such**]{.mark} **censorship
[regimes]{.mark}**[. An opinion]{.mark} or belief adopted [due to
**propaganda** and **reflex** rather than]{.mark} autonomy and
[**critical evaluation** has **no value**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Contents and Discontents of Deliberative Democracy The year 2019
will be remembered as the year of protest with millions of people taking
to the streets in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe to express their
frustration with their political leaders. We appear to be in the middle
of a democratic recession: approval ratings for most politicians and
political parties across the world are abysmal, there are deep divisions
in most Western democracies, and public trust in democratic institutions
are at record lows (Fishkin & Mansbridge, 2017). The democratic boom
following the wave of political decolonization in the 1950s and the end
of the Cold War appears to be well and truly over with the rise of
authoritarianism, social unrest, state repression of dissent, increasing
human rights violations, government crackdown on free speech, violent
conficts over natural resource extraction and an increase in modern
slavery, all of which are happening in 'democratic' countries (Amnesty
International, 2019). Democracy, or at least the model of dominant party
system representative democracy in Europe and the United States appears
to be under threat. [The recognition that in modern liberal Western
democracies formal democracy through majority rule precluded genuine
participation of citizens led to a 'deliberative turn']{.underline} in
democratic theory in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The deliberative
turn, pioneered by the philosophies of Habermas and Rawls and further
elaborated by political theorists like Cohen, Dryzek, Fishkin, Gutmann,
Mansbridge, and Thompson among others, began as a normative project that
focused on [deliberation as an ideal rational discourse where consensus
was reached freely and without coercion. Political legitimacy was thus
established through deliberative processes that refected the discursive
quality of decision making]{.underline} rather than representation
through voting. [Rationality of a democracy]{.underline} according to
Habermas (1975, p. 32) was less about majority rule, which could not
represent the interests of all citizens, but [should be based on the
'genuine participation of citizens in political will formation.' Thus,
more participatory forms of democracy required a deliberative ideal
involving a discursive process where citizens could freely communicate
as equals to arrive at a rational consensus on decisions]{.underline}
afecting their lives. Merely acknowledging diferences and inequalities
does not make them disappear. Rather than seek an authoritarian
consensus, a truly deliberative framework would need to accommodate
confict and dissent as well. Moufe (1999) argues that a preoccupation
with procedural issues relating to consensus depoliticizes the public
sphere and that a robust and vibrant public sphere needs to embrace
confict and dissent. A more radical and progressive democratic politics
would transform antagonism into 'agonistic pluralism' where political
contestations refect not 'antagonism between enemies but agonism between
adversaries' (Moufe, 1999, p. 754). The aim is to 'domesticate'
destructive antagonism into a constructive agonism where democratic
decisions may or may not be fully consensual but can also respectfully
accept unresolvable disagreements' (Hillier, 2003, p. 42). Or as
Foucault (1984, p. 379) puts it 'one must not be for consensuality, but
one must be against nonconsensuality.' Deliberative democrats have
acknowledged these critiques and attempted to broaden the scope of
deliberative democracy to accommodate exclusions and inequalities. For
instance, consensus---the desired outcome of deliberation---was seen as
not always desirable even when possible (Gutmann & Thompson, 2018).
Habermas's later work also adopted a more fexible approach,
acknowledging that '[in the case of controversial existential questions
arising from diferent worldviews even the most rationally conducted
discursive engagement will not lead to consensus']{.underline}
(Habermas, 2001, p. 43). The task then of a successful [deliberative
politics is to institutionalize appropriate procedures that can enable
rational discourse among informed publics. This 'public sphere' is the
institutionalized discursive space where ordinary citizens could
deliberate about politics, the economy, and other issues that afected
their lives]{.underline}. Habermas's notion of a public sphere was based
on a historical analysis of the emergence of new forms of public
interaction that took place in cofee houses, salons, and public squares
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. However, feminist and
po[stcolonial scholars have critiqued Habermas's notion of public sphere
as being exclusionary and lacking in open access, participation and
social equality that are key to democratic deliberation. If the public
sphere was the space where consensus was being manufactured it becomes a
new site of hegemonic domination]{.underline} (Fraser, 1990). [The
merchants and intellectuals who deliberated]{.underline} in cafes and
salons about the weighty political and social issues of their time would
in all probability have not appreciated the fact that the cofee they
consumed was produced by slave labor in the colonies (Eze, 1997).
Moreover, as Fraser (1990) points out, [opinion forming in the public
sphere does not translate into actual decision-making in the political
sphere, and even if such an extension were possible it would entrench
existing hegemonies and reinforce existing structural inequalities and
exclusions.]{.underline} While ideal conditions of deliberative
discourse may exist and enable rational consensus among wealthy
residents of suburban Frankfurt or Princeton deliberating about the
installation of additional streetlights in their neighborhood, [it is
difcult to imagine how Indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon
can engage in deliberative discourse as equal citizens with powerful
market and state actors intent on expanding mining and logging on
Indigenous lands. Even in urban contexts it would be naïve to expect
that citizens can participate as equals, respectfully, and exercise
their reason freely given the realities of structural inequalities and
discriminations based on race, class, gender and sexual
orientation.]{.underline} Another [signifcant shortcoming in
deliberative theories is its lack of a sophisticated analysis of power,
which seems to be treated almost like an exogenous variable. The liberal
quest for legitimacy seemingly elides notions of power and authority
because a key assumption of the deliberative ideal is the absence of
coercive power. Legitimacy of a consensus produced by communicative
rationality can also be hegemonic because one cannot assume that
legitimacy always exists without domination]{.underline} (Clegg, &
Haugaard, 2009; Moufe, 1999). Some scholars argue that deliberative
democracy has a 'nuanced view of power' because it acknowledges that
coercive power can exist in deliberative practice (Curato et al., 2017,
p. 31). However, [they claim it is possible to limit coercive power
through good 'procedural design']{.underline} involving selection of
'less partisan' participants, using independent facilitators or making
deliberations public. [Such an approach to power is patently
unsatisfactory because it elides relationships between power, legitimacy
and authority. How does 'procedural design' handle dissent or confict?
And if there is no dissent or confict in deliberations then has there
been an elite capture of the process by excluding or marginalizing
dissenting stakeholders? Deliberative democrats also assume that power,
and sometimes coercion, is needed in a deliberative process, especially
when implementing decisions contested by certain groups even if the
deliberative process was fair]{.underline} and reasoned (Curato et al.,
2017). So the assumption is that the state, the only 'legitimate' source
of coercive power, can and should use coercion to implement decisions
arrived at in deliberative forums. As we shall see later when we discuss
conficts over natural resources, this is clearly an untenable argument
because [it legitimizes the use of state violence to implement decisions
made in deliberative forums characterized by vastly structurally unequal
conditions that disempower marginalized populations. Debates about
deliberative democracy elide power dynamics in the broader political
economy]{.underline} in which deliberative processes are embedded
(Dryzek, 2016). In cases where [there are signifcant power asymmetries
and where actions can have serious economic, social and environmental
impacts on communities as is the case with extractive industries,
procedural design, however carefully designed, cannot accommodate
divergent and sometimes incommensurable views]{.underline} on land use.
Rather institutional, material, and discursive power that constitute the
global political economy determine governance structures and processes
of natural resource extraction. [These forms of power somehow remain
'outside' of deliberative discourse but create particular forms of
legitimacy that deny pluralism of values and rationalities thus
marginalizing the legitimate struggles of populations whose values do
not conform to the 'norm']{.underline} (Banerjee, 2018, p. 804). To
summarize: despite its shortcomings there appears to be consensus among
scholars in the feld that a deliberative process can 'help revive
democratic legitimacy, provide for more authentic public will formation,
provide a middle ground between widely mistrusted elites and the angry
voices of populism, and help fulfll some of our common normative
expectations about democracy' (Fishkin & Mansbridge, 2017, p. 6). But is
this optimism unfounded? What are the silences and erasures in
deliberative democracy? Are there limits to 'authentic public will
formation' and 'democratic legitimacy' that marginalize segments of the
citizenry? These are some questions I explore in the next section.
Postcolonial and Decolonial Deliberations What is remarkable about the
various debates in deliberative democracy is the silence about Western
colonialism, especially in Habermas's universalizing notion of
communicative rationality. Similar silences can be seen in the work of
some Enlightenment thinkers whose concession (and complicity) to slavery
and colonialism is paradoxical and puzzling given their proclamations of
universal freedom (Dhawan, 2014; Eze, 1997). Enlightenment reasoning and
philosophies of history provided an intellectual justifcation of more
than two hundred years of colonialism. There was little awareness that
the much-celebrated use of reason also creates new forms of domination,
even more insidious than coercive power because these forms of
domination are justifed by reason itself (Adorno & Horkheimer, 1972).
[Liberal ideas of freedom, progress, development, and democracy are
deeply embedded in the idea of Empire, whose mission involved political
subjugation of those it sought to empower and civilize without a
critical refexivity of the impact of European colonialism on European
philosophy]{.underline} (Banerjee & Arjaliès, 2021). Even the Frankfurt
School, despite its infuential work on domination in modern society and
critiques of the Enlightenment, is as Said (1993, p. 278) points out
'stunningly silent on racist theory, anti-imperialist resistance, and
oppositional practice in the empire'. It is important we engage with
these critiques to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the complex
historical relationships between colonialism and democracy and more
importantly identify what traces continue to exist in contemporary
political thought. As Fabian (2002, p. 33) points out, good or bad
intentions do not alone invalidate knowledge: for that to happen 'it
takes bad epistemology which advances cognitive interests without regard
for its ideological presuppositions.' And certainly one could argue
[there is an epistemological closure in EuroAmerican representations of
democracy that does not recognize attempts by postcolonial countries to
create their own forms of governance consistent with their own
conceptions of freedom and rights because they may not conform to
'ideal' standards]{.underline} (Koelble & Lipuma, 2008). If
Enlightenment inspired ideas of democracy elides historical facts about
slavery and colonialism then it becomes imperative to reimagine
democracy while maintaining the Enlightenment's spirit of critique, or
as Marx puts it ['the weapon of the criticism cannot replace criticism
of the weapon]{.underline}.'

[The introduction of geo-historical and bio-graphical configurations in
processes of knowing and understanding allows for a radical
re-framing]{.underline} (e.g. de-colonization) [of the original formal
apparatus of enunciation]{.underline}.2 I have been supporting in the
past those who maintain that [it is not enough to change the content of
the conversation, that it is of the essence to change the terms of the
conversation. Changing the terms of the conversation implies going
beyond disciplinary or interdisciplinary controversies and the conflict
of interpretations. As far as controversies and interpretations remain
within the same rules of the game (terms of the conversation), the
control of knowledge is not called into question. And in order to call
into question the modern/colonial foundation of the control of
knowledge, it is necessary to focus on the knower rather than on the
known. It means to go to the very assumptions that sustain locus
enunciations.]{.underline} In what follows I revisit the formal
apparatus of enunciation from the perspective of geo- and bio-graphic
politics of knowledge. My [revisiting is epistemic rather than
linguistic, although focusing on the enunciation is unavoidable if we
aim at changing the terms and not only the content of the
conversation]{.underline}. The basic assumption is that [the knower is
always implicated, geo- and body-politically, in the known,]{.underline}
although [modern epistemology]{.underline} (e.g. the hubris of the zero
point) managed to conceal both and [created the figure of the detached
observer, a neutral seeker of truth and objectivity who at the same time
controls the disciplinary rules and puts \[themself\] in a privileged
position to evaluate and dictate.]{.underline} The argument is
structured as follows. Sections I and II lay out the ground for the
politics of knowledge geo-historically and bio-graphically, contesting
the hegemony of zero point epistemology. In Section III, I explore three
cases in which geo- and body-politics of knowledge comes forcefully to
the fore: one from Africa, one from India and the third from New
Zealand. These three cases are complemented by a fourth from Latin
America: my argument is here. It is not the report of a detached
observer but the intervention of a de-colonial project that 'comes' from
South America, the Caribbean 4 Theory, Culture & Society 26(7--8) and
Latinidad in the US. Understanding the argument implies that the reader
will shift its geography of reasoning and of evaluating arguments. In
Section IV, I come back to geo- and body-politics of knowledge and their
epistemic, ethical and political consequences. In Section V, I attempt
to pull the strings together and weave my argument with the three cases
explored, hoping that what I say will not be taken as the report of a
detached observed but as the intervention of a de-colonial thinker. In
semiotics, a basic distinction has been made (Emile Benveniste) between
the enunciation and the enunciated. The distinction was necessary, for
Benveniste, to ground the floating sign central to Ferdinand de
Saussure's semiology and its development in French structuralism.
Benveniste turned to the enunciation and, by doing so, to the subject
producing and manipulating signs, rather than the structure of the sign
itself (the enunciated). With this distinction in mind, I would venture
to say that [the interrelated spheres of the colonial matrix of
power]{.underline} (economy, authority, gender and sexuality, and
knowledge/subjectivity[) operate at the level of the enunciated while
patriarchy and racism are grounded in the enunciation]{.underline}.
Let's explore it in more detail (Benveniste, 1970; Todorov, 1970).

What is a revolution? We used to think we knew. [Revolutions **were**
seizures of power]{.underline} by popular forces aiming to transform the
very nature of the political, social, and economic system in the country
in which the revolution took place, usually according to some visionary
dream of a just society. Nowadays, [we live in an age when, if rebel
armies do come sweeping into a city,]{.underline} or mass uprisings
overthrow a dictator, [it's unlikely to have **any such
implications**]{.underline}; when profound social transformation does
occur---as with, say, the rise of feminism---it's likely to take an
entirely different form. It's not that revolutionary dreams aren't out
there. But [contemporary revolutionaries rarely think they can bring
them into being]{.underline} by some modern-day equivalent of storming
the Bastille.

At moments like this, it generally pays to go back to the history one
already knows and ask: Were revolutions ever really what we thought them
to be? For me, the person who has asked this most effectively is the
great world historian Immanuel Wallerstein. He argues that for the last
quarter millennium or so, revolutions have consisted above all of
planetwide transformations of political common sense.

Already by the time of the French Revolution, Wallerstein notes, there
was a single world market, and increasingly a single world political
system as well, dominated by the huge colonial empires. As a result, the
storming of the Bastille in Paris could well end up having effects on
Denmark, or even Egypt, just as profound as on France itself---in some
cases, even more so. Hence he speaks of the "world revolution of 1789,"
followed by the "world revolution of 1848," which saw revolutions break
out almost simultaneously in fifty countries, from Wallachia to Brazil.
In no case did the revolutionaries succeed in taking power, but
afterward, institutions inspired by the French Revolution---notably,
universal systems of primary education---were put in place pretty much
everywhere. Similarly, the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a world
revolution ultimately responsible for the New Deal and European welfare
states as much as for Soviet communism. The last in the series was the
world revolution of 1968---which, much like 1848, broke out almost
everywhere, from China to Mexico, seized power nowhere, but nonetheless
changed everything. This was a revolution against state bureaucracies,
and for the inseparability of personal and political liberation, whose
most lasting legacy will likely be the birth of modern feminism.

[[Revolutions]{.mark} are]{.underline} thus **[planetary]{.underline}**
phenomena. [But there is **more**]{.underline}. What [they]{.underline}
really do is [[transform]{.mark} **basic
[assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[about what politics is]{.mark}
ultimately [about]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the wake of a revolution,
[[ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} that had been [[considered]{.mark}
**veritably lunatic [fringe]{.mark}**]{.underline} [quickly
[become]{.mark} the **[accepted]{.mark} currency of
debate**]{.underline}. Before the French Revolution, the [ideas that
change is good,]{.underline} that government [policy is the]{.underline}
proper [way to manage it, and]{.underline} that [governments
derive]{.underline} their [authority from an entity called ["the
people"]{.mark} were considered]{.underline} the sorts of [things one
might [hear from **crackpots** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**demagogues**]{.mark}, or]{.underline} at best a handful of
freethinking [intellectuals who spend their time **debating in
cafés**]{.underline}. [A generation [later, even the
**stuffiest**]{.mark} magistrates, priests, and headmasters [had
to]{.mark} at **least [pay lip service]{.mark}**]{.underline} to these
ideas. Before long, we had reached the situation we are in today: that
[[it's necessary to **lay**]{.mark} **out [the terms]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} **anyone to even notice**]{.underline} they are there.
They've become common sense, [[the]{.mark} **very [grounds of]{.mark}
political [discussion]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[A quarter of **the [America]{.mark}n population** is now [engaged
in]{.mark} "**guard labor**"---[defending
**property**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [supervising work, or otherwise
[keeping]{.mark} their fellow [Americans **in
line**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Until 1968, most world revolutions really just introduced practical
refinements: an expanded franchise, universal primary education, the
welfare state. The world revolution of 1968, in contrast---whether it
took the form it did in China, of a revolt by students and young cadres
supporting Mao's call for a Cultural Revolution; or in Berkeley and New
York, where it marked an alliance of students, dropouts, and cultural
rebels; or even in Paris, where it was an alliance of students and
workers---was a rebellion against bureaucracy, conformity, or anything
that fettered the human imagination, a project for the revolutionizing
of not just political or economic life, but every aspect of human
existence. As a result, in most cases, the rebels didn't even try to
take over the apparatus of state; they saw that apparatus as itself the
problem.

It's fashionable nowadays to view the social movements of the late
sixties as an embarrassing failure. A case can be made for that view.
It's certainly true that in the political sphere, the immediate
beneficiary of any widespread change in political common sense---a
prioritizing of ideals of individual liberty, imagination, and desire; a
hatred of bureaucracy; and suspicions about the role of government---was
the political Right. Above all, the movements of the sixties allowed for
the mass revival of free market doctrines that had largely been
abandoned since the nineteenth century. It's no coincidence that the
same generation who, as teenagers, made the Cultural Revolution in China
was the one who, as forty-year-olds, presided over the introduction of
capitalism. Since the eighties, ["freedom" has come to mean "**the
market**,"]{.underline} and "the market" has come to be seen as
identical with capitalism---even, ironically, in places like China,
which had known sophisticated markets for thousands of years, but rarely
anything that could be described as capitalism.

[The [ironies are **endless**]{.mark}. While **the new free market
ideology**]{.underline} has framed itself above all as a rejection of
bureaucracy, it [has]{.underline}, in fact, [been responsible for the
first **administrative system** that has **operated on a planetary
scale**]{.underline}, with its [endless layering of public and private
bureaucracies]{.underline}: the IMF, World Bank, WTO, trade
organizations, financial institutions, transnational corporations, NGOs.
[This is precisely the system that has imposed free market orthodoxy,
and opened the world to **financial pillage**, under]{.underline} the
watchful aegis of [American arms]{.underline}. It only made sense that
the first attempt to recreate a global revolutionary movement, the
Global Justice Movement that peaked between 1998 and 2003, was
effectively a rebellion against the rule of that very planetary
bureaucracy.

Future Stop

In retrospect, though, I think that later [historians will conclude that
the **legacy** of the sixties revolution was **deeper**]{.underline}
than we now imagine, and that [the **[triumph]{.mark} of capitalist
markets** and their various planetary administrators and
enforcers]{.underline}---which seemed so epochal and permanent in the
wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991---[[was]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, far
**[[shallow]{.mark}er]{.underline}**.

I'll take an obvious example. One often hears that antiwar protests in
the late sixties and early seventies were ultimately failures, since
they did not appreciably speed up the U.S. withdrawal from Indochina.
But afterward, [[those controlling]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [foreign
[policy were]{.mark} so [anxious about]{.mark} being met with **similar
popular [unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and even more, with unrest
[within the military itself]{.underline}, which was genuinely falling
apart by the early seventies---that [they [refused to commit]{.mark}
U.S. [forces]{.mark} to any **major ground**]{.underline} conflict for
almost thirty years. [It took **9/11**]{.underline}, an attack that led
to thousands of civilian deaths on U.S. soil, [to fully overcome the
notorious "Vietnam syndrome"---]{.underline}and even then, the war
[planners made an]{.underline} almost [obsessive effort to ensure the
wars were effectively **protest-proof**. Propaganda was
**incessant**]{.underline}, the media was brought on board, experts
provided exact calculations on body bag counts (how many U.S. casualties
it would take to stir mass opposition), and the rules of engagement were
carefully written to keep the count below that.

The problem was that since those rules of engagement ensured that
thousands of women, children, and old people would end up "collateral
damage" in order to minimize deaths and injuries to U.S. soldiers, this
meant that in Iraq and Afghanistan, intense hatred for the occupying
forces would pretty much guarantee that [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[couldn't
obtain its]{.mark} military [objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And
remarkably, the [war planners seemed to be **aware of
this**]{.underline}. It didn't matter. [[They considered it]{.mark} far
[more important to **prevent**]{.mark} **effective
[opposition]{.mark}**]{.underline} at home [[than to]{.mark} **actually
[win]{.mark}**]{.underline} the war. It's as if [American forces in Iraq
were ultimately defeated by]{.underline} the ghost of **[Abbie
Hoffman]{.underline}**.

Clearly, an antiwar movement in the sixties that is still tying the
hands of U.S. military planners in 2012 can hardly be considered a
failure. But it raises an intriguing question: What happens when the
creation of that sense of failure, of the complete ineffectiveness of
political action against the system, becomes the chief objective of
those in power?

Is it possible that this preemptive attitude toward social movements,
[the **designing of wars**]{.underline} and trade summits [in such a way
that preventing effective opposition is considered more of a priority
than the **success of the war or summit itself**]{.underline}, really
reflects a more general principle? What if **[[those]{.mark} currently
[running]{.mark} the system]{.underline}**, most of whom witnessed the
unrest of the sixties firsthand as impressionable youngsters,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[consciously]{.underline}** or
unconsciously (and I suspect it's more conscious than not)---[[obsessed
by]{.mark} the **prospect of revolutionary social
[movements]{.mark}**]{.underline} once again challenging prevailing
common sense? The thought first occurred to me when participating in the
IMF actions in Washington, D.C., in 2002. Coming on the heels of 9/11,
we were relatively few and ineffective, the number of police
overwhelming. There was no sense that we could succeed in shutting down
the meetings. Most of us left feeling vaguely depressed. It was only a
few days later, when I talked to someone who had friends attending the
meetings, that I learned [we had in fact **shut them down**: the police
had introduced such **stringent security measures**, canceling **half
the events**]{.underline}, that most of the actual meetings had been
carried out online. In other words, [the government had decided it was
more important for protesters to walk away **feeling like
failures**]{.underline} [than for the IMF meetings to take
place]{.underline}. If you think about it, [[they afforded
protesters]{.mark} **extraordinary [importance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

It would explain a lot. In most of the world, the last thirty years has
come to be known as the age of neoliberalism---one dominated by a
revival of the long-since-abandoned nineteenth-century creed that held
that free markets and human freedom in general were ultimately the same
thing. Neoliberalism has always been wracked by a central paradox. It
declares that economic imperatives are to take priority over all others.
[Politics]{.underline} itself [is just a matter of creating the
**conditions for growing the economy**]{.underline} by allowing the
magic of the marketplace to do its work. [All other hopes]{.underline}
and dreams---of equality, of security---[are to be
**sacrificed**]{.underline} for the primary goal of economic
productivity. [But global economic [performance]{.mark} over the last
thirty years [has been]{.mark} **decidedly
[mediocre]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With one or two spectacular exceptions
(notably China, which significantly ignored most neoliberal
prescriptions), [growth rates have **been far below what they
were**]{.underline} in the days of the old-fashioned, state-directed,
welfare-state-oriented capitalism of the fifties, sixties, and even
seventies. By its own standards, then, [the project was already a
**colossal** failure even before the 2008 collapse.]{.underline}

[If]{.underline}, on the other hand, [we stop taking world leaders **at
their word**]{.underline} [and instead think of **[neoliberalism]{.mark}
as a political project**, it]{.underline} suddenly [looks
**spectacularly effective**]{.underline}. The [politicians]{.underline},
CEOs, trade bureaucrats, and so forth who regularly meet at summits like
Davos or the G20 may [have done a miserable job in creating a world
capitalist economy that meets the needs of a majority of the world's
inhabitants]{.underline} (let alone produces hope, happiness, security,
or meaning), [but they have succeeded magnificently in
**[convinc]{.mark}ing [the world]{.mark} that
[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and not just capitalism, but
exactly the financialized, semifeudal capitalism [we happen to have
right now---[is the **only viable**]{.mark} **economic
[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If you think about it, this is a
remarkable accomplishment.

Debt cancellation would make the perfect revolutionary demand.

How did they pull it off? [[The **preemptive attitude toward**]{.mark}
**social [movements]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} clearly a [part of it]{.mark};
under no conditions can alternatives, or anyone proposing alternatives,
be seen to experience success. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} helps
[[explain]{.mark} the]{.underline} almost unimaginable [investment in
"**[security]{.mark} systems**"]{.underline} of one sort or another: the
fact that [the United States]{.underline}, which lacks any major rival,
[spends more on its military and intelligence than it did during the
Cold War]{.underline}, along [with the almost dazzling accumulation
of]{.underline} private security [agencies, intelligence]{.underline}
agencies, militarized [police, guards, and mercenaries]{.underline}.
Then [there are the **[propaganda organs]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including a massive media industry that did not even exist before the
sixties, **[celebrating police]{.underline}**. Mostly
[these]{.underline} systems do not so much attack dissidents [directly
as [contribute to]{.mark} a **pervasive climate of fear**, **jingoistic
conformity**,]{.underline} life [insecurity, and **simple
despair**]{.underline} that makes [any thought of changing the world
seem an **idle fantasy**]{.underline}. Yet these security systems are
also extremely expensive. Some economists estimate that a quarter of the
American population is now engaged in "guard labor" of one sort or
another---defending property, supervising work, or otherwise keeping
their fellow Americans in line. Economically, most of this disciplinary
apparatus is pure deadweight.

In fact, most of the economic innovations of the last thirty years make
more sense politically than economically. Eliminating guaranteed life
employment for precarious contracts doesn't really create a more
effective workforce, but it is extraordinarily effective in destroying
unions and otherwise depoliticizing labor. The same can be said of
endlessly increasing working hours. No one has much time for political
activity if they're working sixty-hour weeks.

It does often seem that, [whenever there is a choice between one option
that makes capitalism seem the **only possible economic system**, and
another that would **actually make capitalism a more
viable**]{.underline} economic system, [neoliberalism means always
choosing the **former**. The combined result is [a **relentless campaign
against the**]{.mark} **human [imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Or,
to be more precise: imagination, desire, individual creativity,
[all]{.underline} those [things]{.underline} that were to be [liberated
in the last great world revolution, were to be contained strictly in the
**domain of consumerism**]{.underline}, or perhaps in the virtual
realities of the Internet. In all other realms they were to be strictly
banished. We are talking about the murdering of dreams, the imposition
of an apparatus of hopelessness, designed to squelch any sense of an
alternative future. Yet as a result of putting virtually all their
efforts in one political basket, [[we are]{.mark} left in the bizarre
situation of **[watching the capitalist system
crumbling]{.mark}**]{.underline} before our very eyes, [[at]{.mark} just
[the moment everyone]{.mark} had finally [concluded **no other
system**]{.mark} **would be [possible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Please do not mistake my love of ideas for an escapist retreat into
idealism. Quite the contrary: I think [the task of theorizing is to
invent modes of experiencing the world]{.underline}, [even if the route
is a circuitous journey that does not lead from fiction to nonfiction
but instead from truth to falsity]{.underline}. [Fiction in our age of
continuous-real-time-captured-by-iPhone news updates is so much more
frequently true]{.underline}. [The world is **real but not easily
apparent**]{.underline}. There is a world as such but no way of
encountering it that is not, as Stanley Cavell says, an interpretation.
[All encounters are a sensuous process of labor with the world and not
before the world or after]{.underline} it. Therefore, [the fight
to]{.underline} see, [think, and feel things as they are requires an
affirmative sense of genre]{.underline}; cnn is a genre, security
reports are a genre, terror alert levels are a genre, and Chomsky-esque
truth-telling is a genre, although all of these we are inured to or
primed for as a common sense of reality.25 Sometimes [we need wilder
genres like **horror or sci-fi or speculation** so that we have the
capability to see past]{.underline} what Rudy Rucker calls "**[consensus
reality]{.underline}**" into the weird worlds of brain implant
experiments, detailed in chapter 6, that have been going on since the
1960s or the emerging freaks of science---explored in chapter 9---that
could, if we pay attention, challenge our restrictive normative
boundaries of the human.26 [I take inspiration in]{.underline} Sayak
Valencia's work on [gore or splatter cinema as an analytic category for
contemporary capitalism to expand the attention of empiricism to include
the gore of the real world.]{.underline}27 Like Valencia finds in the
genre of gore, [the practices of torture, disappearing, and spectacular
violence that suture together the political economy of bodies in the
border region between Mexico and the United States are no longer
exceptional events but increasingly global practices]{.underline}. The
choice of genre is not haphazard. Valencia further distinguishes the
sadistic erotics of snuff from the specific necro-practices of gore,
which produce spectacular forms of extra-state narco violence, the
smooth flow of goods and labor necessary for globalization, and the
persistence of state sovereign violence all in one stroke.28 For
Valencia, the genre of gore as opposed to other genres of horror and
snuff captures these "processes of doubling" and invisibility that
characterize the narco-statecapital-death-body machine.29 Like horror
and science fiction more generally, Valencia, like Rucker, describes the
"irreal" character of social relations and their reproduction
correspondingly requiring a contrarealist genre to make visible what is
meant to be ignored or normalized. Rucker and Valencia practice a kind
of transrealism as an art form that "deal\[s\] with the world the way it
actually is"30 because mere description is insufficient to pierce the
veil of consensus reality. The endurance of consensus reality as a genre
of naïve realism is indebted to an aesthetic but also a corresponding
anesthetic that foregrounds a "common sense" in place of an openness to
experience of what has not previously been experienced.31 [Consensus or
commonsense reality shields us from a world that would otherwise be too
real, creating a feeling of the irreal.]{.underline} According to
Rucker, as long as the evening news feels real, the consensus can
continue despite unbelievable contradictions. This is a fact tested well
beyond what I thought was darkly possible by the first year of the
Donald Trump presidency. As a collective--- what Félix Guattari called a
machinic unconscious---we tune in and tune out simultaneously.32
Valencia similarly highlights the degree to which [gore capitalism can
engage in labor practices and new forms of violence markedly dystopian
by any public consensus of a moral life without somehow calling into
question the state or globalization.]{.underline}33 [Even catastrophic
material contradictions fail to create a legitimacy crisis, and
frequently outright fictions mobilize whole nations.]{.underline} [There
is no better proof of this than the public consensus aided and abetted
by thousands of scholars that the greatest threat to humanity is a
handful of people called terrorists]{.underline}. [Without these new
genre- inspired tools for investigation, how else do you make sense of
autonomous killer robots and the savage biopolitics of conquistadors,
and equally find inspiration in Go-playing ai platforms and nearly
annihilated cosmologies resurging against any "realistic"
odds?]{.underline} How do we get from horror to critique? Rucker
recommends that we can "turn off the tv (or now ubiquitous internet),
eat something, and go for a walk, with infinitely many thoughts and
perceptions mingling with infinitely many inputs."34 Furthermore,
artists of all sorts, scholars included, can refuse to allow this
"severely limited and reactionary mode condition all of our writing."35
[We can instead employ the tricks of other aesthetic genres]{.underline}
and conceptual speculation to expand the sensory capabilities [to **see
the world beyond consensus reality.**]{.underline} In this sense,
[theory can be a kind of dark magic, a destroyer of worlds, an art of
sensual experience.]{.underline} We can craft concepts like spells. We
can conjure ideas from the virtual in hopes of altering the experience
of reality. What comes after that is beyond our control. To this end,
what if the primary goal of studying global politics was not to explain
things like laws, rules, and predictions but was rather to broaden how
much of the world we could experience and be part of? What if
international relations was an empiricism infused with what Cavell calls
imagination, such that we can "take the facts in, realize the
significance of what is going on, make the behavior real for
\[ourselves\], make a connection"?36 Cavell says this process of
imagination is what Wittgenstein called "interpretation" or "seeing
something as something."37 [The failure to see so many things and others
as "something" is a plague of much greater significance than any
research problem that can be saved by the next methodological
breakthrough]{.underline}. And the "seeing something as something"
problem is as equally unlikely to be solved by any scientific
breakthrough, in the narrow sense. Instead [we have to find tactics for
making sense of "what is fantastic in our ordinary
lives."]{.underline}38

### FW --- Knowing Subject

#### Their model of debate is premised on the "knowing subject" of colonial modernity that operates untouched by racial configurations of power -- vote affirmative to decenter their epistemology of scholarly detachment.

**Mignolo '09** \-- (Walter D. Mignolo, 2009, "Epistemic Disobedience,
Independent Thought and Decolonial Freedom," Theory, Culture & Society

ONCE UPON a time [scholars assumed that the knowing subject in the
disciplines is transparent, disincorporated from the known and untouched
by the geo-political configuration of the world in which people are
racially ranked and regions are racially configured]{.underline}. From a
detached and neutral point of observation (that Colombian philosopher
Santiago Castro-Gómez (2007) describes as the hubris of the zero
point[), the knowing subject maps the world and its problems, classifies
people and projects into what is good for them.]{.underline} Today that
assumption is no longer tenable, although there are still many
believers. At stake is indeed the question of racism and epistemology
(Chukwudi Eze, 1997; Mignolo, forthcoming). And once upon a time
scholars assumed that if you 'come' from Latin America you have to 'talk
about' Latin America; that in such a case you have to be a token of your
culture. Such expectation will not arise if the author 'comes' from
Germany, France, England or the US. In such cases it is not assumed that
you have to be talking about your culture but can function as a
theoretically minded person. As we know: the first world has knowledge,
the third world has culture; Native Americans have wisdom, Anglo
Americans have science. The need for political and epistemic delinking
here comes to the fore, as well as decolonializing and de-colonial
knowledges, necessary steps for imagining and building democratic, just,
and non-imperial/colonial societies. [Geo-politics of knowledge goes
hand in hand with geo-politics of knowing. Who and when, why and where
is knowledge generated]{.underline} (rather than produced, like cars or
cell phones)? [Asking these questions means to shift the attention from
the enunciated to the enunciation]{.underline}. And by so doing, turning
Descartes's dictum inside out: [rather than assuming that thinking comes
before being, one assumes instead that it is a racially marked body in a
geo-historical marked space that feels the urge or get the call to
speak, to articulate, in whatever semiotic system]{.underline}, the urge
that makes of living organisms 'human' beings. By setting the scenario
in terms of geo- and body-politics I am [starting and departing from
already familiar notions of 'situated knowledges']{.underline}. Sure,
[all knowledges are situated and every knowledge is
constructed]{.underline}. But that is just the beginning. The question
is: [who, when, why is constructing knowledges]{.underline} (Mignolo,
1999, 2005 \[1995\])? [Why eurocentered epistemology carefully
hidden]{.underline} (in the social sciences, in the humanities, in the
natural sciences and professional schools, in think tanks of the
financial sector and the G8 or G20), its own geo-historical and
bio-graphical locations? The shift I am indicating is the anchor
(constructed of course, located of course, not just anchored by nature
or by God) of the argument that follows. It is [the beginning of any
epistemic de-colonial de-linking with all its historical, political and
ethical consequences. Why? Because geo- historical and bio-graphic loci
of enunciation have been located by and through the making and
transformation of the colonial matrix of power]{.underline}: a racial
system of social classification that invented Occidentalism (e.g. Indias
Occidentales), that created the conditions for Orientalism;
distinguished the South of Europe from its center (Hegel) and, on that
long history, remapped the world as first, second and third during the
Cold War. [Places of nonthought]{.underline} (of myth, non-western
religions, folklore, underdevelopment involving regions and people[)
today have been waking up from the long process of westernization.
The]{.underline} anthropos inhabiting non-European places discovered
that \[they\] had been invented, as anthropos, by a locus of
enunciations self-defined as humanitas.

### FW --- Ontology

#### ONTOLOGY. Their framework forces debate to [turn production towards destruction]{.underline}, creating a condition of [permanent war]{.underline}. 

Maurizio **Lazzarato 22**, PhD Philosophy from the Université de Paris
VIII, 4-3-2022, \"War, Capitalism, Ecology • Ill Will,\"
https://illwill.com/war-capitalism-ecology, jy

Postscript: a crisis of ontology

[The identity of production and destruction [points to a crisis
in]{.mark} the **[conception of being]{.mark}**]{.underline} [whose
productive power philosophy has **sought to affirm**]{.underline} (being
as creation, a continuous process of expansion, a construction of the
world and of man). [This]{.underline} long history of being [is
**overturned**]{.underline} by the First World War, after which [the
[self-production]{.mark} of being **[coincides with]{.mark} its
[self-destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [philosophies]{.underline}
of the 1960s and 1970s failed to recognize this new situation in any
way. On the contrary, they [doubled down on being's power of
**invention**, **proliferation**, and **differentiation**. The negative
of destruction was **expelled**]{.underline} from thought right at the
moment that being, [under the regime of **total production**, became
comparable to a "geological" force capable of modifying the earth's
morphology, while **destroying the conditions of its
habitability**]{.underline}. The critique of the negative focused on the
Hegelian dialectic, but it failed to problematize the absolute negation
that the new face of capitalism harbored within it. At the moment that
being seemed to be enriched by the continuous production of new
singularities, it is consumed, exhausted, and even threatened with
extinction. Such is the unprecedented situation that philosophy avoids
like the plague.

[[The identity of]{.mark} production and [destruction obliges us to
**reconsider**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only the category of work, but
[all those [productive forces]{.mark} [that]{.mark} might [seek to
**inherit the power of being**. Total war]{.mark} and the conjoined
acceleration of Capital]{.underline}, [of the State]{.underline}, of
science/technology, and of work [have [rendered]{.mark} the Marxian
[opposition]{.mark} between forces of production and relations of
production **[inoperative]{.mark}**]{.underline}, because [[**productive
forces** are]{.mark} at the same time **[destructive
forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the 19th century, work and its
partners, science and technology, seemed to constitute a power of
creation imprisoned in relations of production (specifically, private
property and the State that secured it). They needed to be freed from
the grip of the latter so that they could develop those productive
powers heretofore constrained by profit, private property, and class
hierarchies. Under post-total war conditions of capitalism[, it is
undecidable if **[work is production]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or
**destruction**]{.mark}, since [it is **both**]{.mark} **at the same
time**]{.underline}. For this reason, [there can be **no ontology of
work**]{.underline}: the modalities of political action must be
rethought.

[Battles, refusal, [revolts]{.mark}, cooperation]{.underline},
"reparative" activities, [solidarities, and revolutions **[are always on
the table]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [[the break]{.mark} with
capitalism [is **more**]{.mark} **necessary today [than
ever]{.mark}**]{.underline}, since [[what is at stake is the]{.mark}
**very [life of the species]{.mark}**]{.underline}; but all [[this
appears]{.mark} [within a framework]{.mark} **radically [modified by the
existence of destruction]{.mark}**, which production casts **alongside
it like a shadow**.]{.underline}

### FW --- Policy Debate

#### Policy debate is invested in a false assumption of subjective citizenship and sovereignty that is *[rooted in settler colonial consciousness]{.underline}* -- Rhetorical spaces, like debate, layer ideological structures of settler reproduction which create the conditions for settler colonialism to reproduce itself.

To answer the first claim---that [US rhetoric is the communication
practice of organizing people and materials to serve the needs of the
colonial settlement]{.underline}---I begin by looking at the
Aristotelian tradition's ongoing influence on the field. [Aristotle's
rhetoric is a publicfacing procedure for persuasion within a subjected
citizenry]{.underline}. Its objective: to find all means that might
convince an audience, not because dialectic deliberation will not work,
but because "affecting the decisions of juries and assemblies is a
matter of persuasiveness, not of knowledge." 1 [Rhetoricians in the
US]{.underline} still invested in Aristotle [must account for this
colonial carryover from Britain's Aristotelian tradition]{.underline}.
[It represents particular forms of [rhetorical]{.mark} criticism [and
pedagogical practices---like]{.mark} public speaking,
**[debate]{.mark}**, and oral defenses---that **[rely on a notion of
subjective]{.mark} citizenship and [sovereignty]{.mark}** [**rooted
in**]{.mark} a colonial (then **[settler colonial]{.mark})
[consciousness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.2 Lauer argues, for example, that
classical rhetoric was essential in propulsion of the Roman Republic
into the Roman Empire. As a result of Augustus's shift from deliberative
to epideictic rhetoric, the Roman Empire was able to sustain the spread
of Roman ideology onto lands that would have otherwise exceeded its
authority.3 Augustus knew that the legitimacy of the Roman Empire was
contingent upon the ability to shape public memory so that Roman law
would be seen as morally virtuous. Thus[, [the **rhetorical authority of
sovereignty** was used to justify]{.mark} the [expansion of]{.mark} the
Roman [Empire **as a function of the persuasive power of its
leaders**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Mary E. Stucky and John M. Murphy
describe the way [[rhetorical authority is used]{.underline}]{.mark},
much like the Romans, [[to]{.mark} also [remove native peoples from
their]{.mark} stewarded [lands for]{.mark} economic
[exploitation]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}S.4 In both cases,
[rhetorical subjection and [claims to sovereignty]{.mark} are
communicated onto bodies and lands, **[exert]{.mark}ing a [discursive
force]{.mark}** [that commits colonial violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[The practice of issuing rhetorical authority is intrinsically connected
to colonial modernity.]{.underline} From Aristotelian thought to the
middle of the twentieth century, "[rhetorical criticism" focused almost
exclusively on studying a speaker's capacity to persuade publics through
oratory.]{.underline}5 This meant [that a training in rhetoric required
studying "the texts of speeches delivered by the common and uncommon men
who attempted to crystallize and mold public thinking about the issues
of their day]{.underline}." 6 The [purpose of this training was not to
disrupt existing systems of domination but, rather, to replicate them:
as important as public address \[is\] itself in understanding \[US\]
American culture is the character of the training in rhetoric provided
by the nation's colleges and universities. Rhetoric and rhetorical
training ... reflect to some extent the demands and expectations of the
environment; the public image of the orator inevitably influences the
collegiate training of future orators.]{.underline}7 Raymie McKerrow
suggests that this tradition of training orators was reflected in the
field up until the critical turn in the 1970s where scholars then begin
to turn to rhetorical criticism of social justice movements and scholars
like Maurice Charland and Michael Calvin McGee begin to rethink
rhetorical subjectivity. McKerrow also credits Walter Fisher for work on
[narrative rhetoric]{.underline}, which McKerrow argues [gave the field
a language to study a "rational world paradigm" through narrative
fidelity---though this "world paradigm" was certainly not inclusive of
the indigenous narrative epistemologies]{.underline} already circulating
for centuries before the arrival of European rhetoric.8 While McKerrow
argues that the 1970s moved US rhetoric past its European colonial roots
and into a postmodern scholarly practice, [much of the field continues
to be entangled with processes of settler colonial modes of production:
invoking political subjectivities, authorizing sovereignty, and
narrating the settler colonial consciousness]{.underline}.9 Notably,
[the "the rhetoric of modernity" is a structural process driven by the
production of colonial subjects]{.underline} (i.e., Christian, white)
[and capitalist practices of production which originated in Europe and
were spread throughout the Americas via genocide, occupation,
enslavement, and war.]{.underline}10 Ultimately, the rhetoric of
modernity is about the sovereignty constructed through a European
ideological paradigm that was deduced from the rhetorical authority
invented by monarchs, trade companies, and churches. Furthermore, [that
sovereignty exerted over colonial subjects relies on a distribution of
settler colonial narratives that exist on a trajectory that has not
quite finished the settler colonial project; settling for [rhetorics of
liberal modernity]{.mark} simply "crucially [contributes to **blocking
out indigenous** ]{.mark}**peoples' [struggles]{.mark}** for a
post-settler colonial future."]{.underline} 11 Thus, it is not enough to
say that rhetoric is "the study" of how settler colonial ideology is
communicated. Rather, it [is a specific public-facing [communication
practice]{.mark} that [organize]{.mark}s [people and materials
(]{.mark}especially land) [to serve]{.mark} the needs of a
[settlement]{.mark} through claims of political
sovereignty]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[rhetoric]{.mark} produces and
[circulates narrative forms that **foreclose a postsettler
future**]{.mark} by **[reproducing]{.mark} the same sets of
[relationships]{.mark}** between bodies, lands, and power **both
[in]{.mark} our [research]{.mark} practices**]{.underline} (as I will
describe below) **[[and]{.mark} in our [pedagogies (like
debate]{.mark},]{.underline}** public speaking, etc). Claim #2:
[[assemblage theory frames rhetoric as an organizing logic]{.mark}
Embedded within the theory of assemblages is a way to consider how
**[communication moves ideological power]{.mark}** onto bodies and
throughout territories]{.underline}. [Research on White Settler
Governance (WSG)]{.underline} emerging from Canadian Cultural Studies
[reverberates]{.underline} Walter Mignolo and Lorenzo Veracini's
sentiment on [the importance of studying the mechanisms of production
behind settler colonialism]{.underline}. Scott Lauria Morgensen relies
on a framework rooted in Foucault's biopolitics and settler colonial
studies to describe how [WSG is founded by apparatuses of power that
persist in producing populations and institutions that can reproduce
settler logics]{.underline}: [the biopolitics of settler colonialism
will explain that the colonial era never ended ... . Theories of the
biopolitical state, regimes of global governance, and the war on terror
will be insufficient unless they critically theorise settler colonialism
as a historical and present condition and method of all such
power]{.underline}.12 [Settler colonialism]{.underline}, thus, [is **not
simply a condition** that afflicts native peoples and lands, **but is a
method [settler states]{.mark} undertake** in order to **[layer
ideological structures of]{.mark} settler
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} like universities, hospitals, and
courts [onto yet settler-occupied territories.]{.underline} I argue that
**[this is a communicable method]{.underline}**. Patrick Wolfe suggests
WSG organizes and endures through material mechanisms of ideological
replacement, those that eliminate native peoples from lands and then
occupy those lands indefinitely: "settler colonizers come to stay:
invasion is a structure not an event ... elimination is an organizing
principal of settler-colonial society rather than a one-off (and
superseded) occurrence ... . Settler colonialism destroys to replace."
13 [What settler colonialism replaces,]{.underline} though, [is the
order of how sets of relations between lands, peoples, and ideologies
are mapped out onto invaded territories. As a structure of settler
ideological power---or what I refer to as an
assemblage]{.underline}---[[WSG]{.mark} persist in
[territorializ]{.mark}ing [native lands and eliminat]{.mark}ing native
[peoples through]{.mark} **organizing [logics of]{.mark} subjectivity
and [sovereignty]{.mark}** **[circulated through narratives]{.mark} of
settler logic.**]{.underline} [Conventional rhetoric's "**[agonistic"
emphasis on evaluating]{.mark} the efficacy** of a]{.underline} given
presidential address, [**[congressional debate]{.mark}**, or other
communicative practice is inherently conservative, and thus settler
colonial, for it [positions the WSG]{.mark} statu[s quo as a
given]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is, [when the organizing logics of
settler colonialism are communicated effectively, this is "effective"
rhetoric]{.underline}. Therefore, to frame rhetoric as the communicable
organizing logics of WSG, a study of assemblages is warranted. For
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, [assemblages are an "ad hoc logic"
about the ways social formations rely on a combination of heterogeneous,
material and human parts to create change.]{.underline}14 [Assemblages
are like self-replicating, overdetermined political machines where many
seemingly random materials are arranged in a self-reinforcing fashion to
produce and sustain a particular outcome]{.underline}. While Deleuze and
Guattari's understanding of political desire is ultimately framed in the
context of late capitalism, [thinking through]{.underline} their
conception of [assemblage as it is moved by a settler colonial
desire]{.underline}---a desire Mignolo asserts is dually capitalistic
and genocidally white supremacist---[warrants a discussion of how
political ideologies of domination are assembled by rhetorical
logics.]{.underline} For one, assemblages are not things, and they do
not produce things; they are arrangements of things.15 Assemblages,
though, do territorialize and code particular annunciations with an
organizing logic. In this case, [materials and bodies are arranged and
mobilized on territories according to the logics of settler desire
(resource extraction, labor extraction, and genocide]{.underline}),
which has the dual effect of creating the conditions for settler logic
to reproduce. For DeLanda, this point is particularly important: what
one feels as an effect (or affect) from assemblages is the sense that
territories are being reshaped and bodies recoded to be more conducive
to the reproduction of the assemblage.16 This facet of assemblages
intersects with the biopolitical study of WSG by explaining the ways
[**[ideological structures]{.mark}** of power **[arrange racial and
economic hierarchies]{.mark}** in the service of [producing]{.mark} the
[conditions by which settler colonialism can
reproduce]{.mark}.]{.underline} The other facet of assemblage, and the
one that pertains most to the study of rhetoric, is Deleuze and
Guattari's concept of the abstract machine. [An assemblage comprises the
abstract machine, the concrete (material) components, and the personae
(bodies]{.underline}). The abstract machine is the organizing logic of
an assemblage: "the condition of an assemblage is abstract because it is
not a thing or object that exists in the world, but rather something
that lays out a set of relations wherein concrete elements and agencies
appear." 17 Thus, the abstract machine of an assemblage organizes the
materials (including and especially land) and personae of the assemblage
in a way that their sets of relationships affect the flows of power
toward a particular desire. In the case of WSG, [the capacity to call
settler colonial subjects into being, the capacity to make sovereignty
claims over native lands, and the capacity to normalize this invasive
process through religious or grand global political narrative is
organized by the abstract machine of settler logic]{.underline}---or
what I described earlier as rhetoric. The [abstract machine layers power
over bodies and lands in a way that reshapes them to reproduce
structures of settler power]{.underline}. In other words, [settler
colonial governance is an assemblage of ideological power]{.underline}
in North America [that territorializes the lands stewarded by native
peoples, codes the bodies of native, Mestizx, and black peoples as
Other, and **shapes rhetorical/communicable landscapes** into **spaces
conducive to the reproduction of the settlement**.]{.underline}
[Rhetoric is the organizing logic of this white settler assemblage that
is continuously communicated (discursively and affectively) to arrange
the relationships between settler bodies, native bodies, occupied lands,
and technologies of occupation. These tenets of rhetoric are articulated
in the organizational logic of settler colonialism. We cannot undo
settler colonialism unless we confront the **normalization of these
logics** and begin to rearticulate an anticolonial praxis-driven method
for studying rhetoric.]{.underline} This work---if it assumes that
conventional rhetoric is, in fact, the organizing logic of the settler
colonial assemblage in North America---[can undo our complicity as
rhetoricians to reproduce settler colonialism.]{.underline}

Towards a Decolonial Imaginary Scholarship on decoloniality offers a
critical perspective where [subaltern difference becomes the basis for
decolonizing deliberative democracy involving a critical engagement with
knowledges and cultural practices that were delegitimized by
colonialism]{.underline} (Faria et al., 2010). Decoloniality recognizes
the failure of the postcolonial state to live up to the promise of
decolonization and ['interrogates the postcolonial nation state as a
colonizing entity]{.underline} in the context of struggles over
Indigenous sovereignty' (Banerjee, 2021, p.4). Emerging from Latin
America, decolonial scholarship followed a different but related
trajectory than postcolonial studies, which was dominated by the work of
diasporic South Asian scholars trained in the English literary canons
and whose inaccessible writing had little to offer to non-English
speaking scholars (Misoczky, 2019). Settler colonialism in the Americas,
as we have discussed earlier, differed in significant ways from the
predominantly British colonialism in India, the Middle East and Africa,
which was the focus of postcolonial studies (Harding, 2017). The
fundamental critique of European colonialism by decolonial scholars was
similar to what was articulated earlier by postcolonial scholars[: the
fixing of difference based on a privileged Eurocentric position, racial
hierarchies, and the binary categorizations of primitive/modern,
developed/underdeveloped, and civilized/barbaric.]{.underline} However,
there is a temporal difference: while postcolonial scholarship refers
mainly to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [decoloniality begins
from the moment of European invasion of the Americas in the fifteenth
century]{.underline} (Bhambra, 2014). Postcolonial scholarship's
obsession with culture and the fetishization of difference also diverted
criticism of capitalism and its associated inequalities and forms of
oppression, which are central to decolonial thinking (Dirlik, 1994).
Latin American scholars like Aníbal Quijano, María Lugones, Gloria
Anzaldúa, Maldonado-Torres and Walter Mignolo among others pioneered
scholarship with a [decolonial epistemic perspective that takes into
account diverse worldviews, particularly of subaltern racial and ethnic
populations from the Global South, to produce alternate epistemologies
that transcend the Western canon]{.underline}. Colonial difference
becomes the basis of the production of these subaltern knowledges
[resulting in a decolonized epistemology from the perspective of
marginalized populations]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2000). The notion of
coloniality is inextricably linked with modernity---[coloniality is
constitutive of modernity and hence 'there is no modernity without
coloniality and no coloniality without modernity']{.underline} (Mignolo
& Walsh, 2018, p. 4). This critical 'border thinking' (Anzaldúa, 1987)
is [the decolonial response to]{.underline} Habermas's Eurocentric
'unfinished project of [modernity']{.underline} from the perspective of
the oppressed and exploited side of the colonial difference (Grosfoguel,
2013, p. 26). Quijano's (2000, 2007) concept of [the coloniality of
power, which constitutes the global capitalist system in liberal
democracies, is central to decolonial thought.]{.underline} Coloniality
of power reflects [forms of domination that continued in democratic
postcolonial countries after the end of direct colonialism]{.underline},
reinforcing historical structural inequalities of the colonial era
(Ballestrin, 2015). Coloniality of power is [based on a Eurocentric
racialized classification of societies]{.underline} that was imposed on
Latin America after European invasion: the modernity that was designed
to break the shackles of the primitive past of postcolonial countries
also [embedded them in racial and ethnic hierarchies that constitute the
international division of labor]{.underline} (Grosfoguel, 2007; Quijano,
2007). Feminist philosophers have extended decolonial scholarship by
drawing attention to the coloniality of gender, which was neglected in
initial formulations of decoloniality (Harding, 2017; Lugones, 2010;
Manning, 2018). Decolonial feminism requires overturning the coloniality
of gender by a critical analysis of the racialized and capitalist forms
of gender oppression (Lugones, 2010). [Knowledge production has
generally been a one way street where theories that are produced in the
'global North' are imposed on the 'global South'
(]{.underline}Alcadipani et al., 2012). Producers of theories, including
democratic theories, have generally ignored postcolonial critiques and
subaltern theories. [This epistemic coloniality infects theories of
democracy in two ways]{.underline} requiring new modes of understanding:
first, there is a need to understand how [coloniality in democracy
produces inequality and injustice, conditions that will always hinder
the democratic project.]{.underline} Second, [democracy in coloniality
requires an understanding of how democracy is used to sustain
coloniality]{.underline} (Ballestrin, 2015). This is the essence of the
decolonial project. Such a [perspective can provide deeper insights into
understanding why and how democracies in postcolonial countries
'deviate' from the norm while also understanding how the norm itself is
constituted by colonial relations of power.]{.underline} Western powers,
to protect their own interests, have exported democracy to non-European
sites through soft power using international aid, trade deals, human
rights regimes and cultural exchange programs, backed up by military
power when these forms of persuasion fail or as Ballestrin (2015, p.
221) puts it, 'when the platforms of democracy and human rights serve to
justify contemporary imperial expansion, coloniality is imposed.'
Decoloniality is also rooted in praxis whereas much of postcolonial
scholarship is preoccupied with the cultural domain[. The starting point
for a decolonial praxis is to imagine radically different perspectives
that can dislodge Western rationality as the only basis of
reality]{.underline} (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018). This does not mean an
outright rejection of Western notions of progress, democracy and
development but involves a [critical reflexivity that can 'liberate the
production of knowledge, refection, and communication from the pitfalls
of European rationality/modernity']{.underline} (Quijano, 2007, p. 177).
Rather than lapse into fundamentalist thinking, a critique of
Eurocentric modernity is [a project of transmodernity]{.underline}
(Dussel, 2012), which involves [imagining multiple worlds and forms of
democratic alterity as opposed to the global imposition of a single
modernity and liberal form of democracy centered in Europe]{.underline}
(Grosfoguel, 2013). Transmodern forms of democracy entails decolonizing
the racial and capitalist bases of liberal democracy. [This
epistemological decolonization is a difficult task involving new forms
of intercultural understanding that could form the basis of alternate
rationalities]{.underline}. Merely bringing in non-Western perspectives
into the canon is not sufficient---for example describing an African
'ubuntu' ethics in a European academic journal may qualify as an
alternative moral theory but it still fails as a decolonization project
because this knowledge is interpellated in Western rules of validation
of knowledge and a coloniality of power (Naude, 2019). Perhaps
[understanding decolonial sites of dissent, resistance, and protest and
the multitude of livelihood struggles arising from a politics of
difference may enable us to imagine other worlds that are not defined by
Eurocentric modernity]{.underline} (Escobar, 2004). Many of these
struggles are about a [praxis of living and communal organizing that is
delinked from the modern capitalist nation state (]{.underline}Mignolo &
Walsh, 2018).

#### Centering the colonial state-form of NATO as the locus of discussion cements racialized power relations as a fixture of academic dialogue and precludes generating revolutionary energy towards indigenous political praxis -- framing out the sovereign state in debate is key.

Decoloniality is not the same as political decolonization that occurred
during the 1800s in Latin America and the mid twentieth century in
Africa and Asia when former colonies gained independence and became new
nation states. The transition from colonialism to nationalism while
marking a postcolonial moment for the nation state excluded large
segments of its populations who were now governed by the same
rationality and coloniality of knowledge that inscribed the colonial
project. Recognition of ethnic minorities among postcolonial nations
does not challenge existing power relations or the dominant state model
of development. For instance, while the United Nations Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples guaranteed their economic, cultural and
religious rights and the right to strengthen their social and political
institutions, it not clear how Indigenous peoples can actually exercise
these rights, because as Article 46 of the Declaration states: 'Nothing
in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State,
people, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to
perform any act contrary to the Charter of the United Nations or
construed as authorizing or encouraging any action which would dismember
or impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity or political
unity of sovereign and independent States'. However, [a decolonial
imaginary requires delinking from the 'political unity of sovereign and
independent states' because it is this unity that fixes colonial
difference within global power structures, disallowing other modes of
existence]{.underline}. Any [alternative framework must take into
account 'the epistemic force of local histories and to think theory
through the political praxis of subaltern groups, where the Other
becomes the original source of an ethical discourse']{.underline}
(Escobar, 2004, p. 217). In rejecting the universalizing and totalizing
claims of Western modernity, a [decolonial imaginary does not privilege
the nation state as a site for struggle because coloniality ensures that
the state cannot be decolonized or democratized]{.underline} (Mignolo &
Walsh, 2018). Instead, the decolonial project is a search for multiple
local and regional forms of governance that avoids the pitfalls of
undemocratic and repressive regimes which characterize contemporary
liberal democracies. Scholarship on Indigenous sovereignty in Australia,
the Americas and New Zealand has challenged dominant narratives about
the founding of these nation states and documented how a [false
political authority was claimed through land that was 'acquired'
forcibly or fraudulently and by unilateral extinguishment of native
title]{.underline} (Hendrix, 2010). The triumphalist narratives of
settler colonial states never pose the key question: '[Where does the
force of one law to extinguish the laws of the other draw its legitimacy
from'?]{.underline} (Watson, 2006, p. 29). This denial of [the original
violence of state sovereignty and colonial histories along with an
affirmation of Indigenous cultures becomes the basis of Indigenous
claims to sovereignty and self-determination]{.underline} (Volmert,
2010). Whether in settler colonies or post-colonial countries,
Indigenous groups with distinct preferences and cultures remain
marginalized minorities despite being bestowed with 'citizen rights.['
Rather than participate in public will formation Indigenous peoples have
the will of non-Indigenous citizens imposed on them and only a shift in
political authority can change their current situation.]{.underline}
While some [advocates of deliberative democracy may be 'greatly
skeptical about the chances of survival']{.underline} of Indigenous
communities (Benhabib, 2002, p. 185) their [ongoing struggles to protect
their lands indicate that resistance is fertile]{.underline} (Banerjee
et al., 2021). These communities have been fighting to preserve their
way of life since the colonial era began and their struggles continue in
the postcolonial era. [Colonial sovereignties of the modern nation state
supersede Indigenous sovereignty and where there is conflict and dissent
in deliberative procedures of public will formation the (post) colonial
state exercises coercive power to impose the will of 'the
people']{.underline}, as I discuss in the next section.

The Radical Imagination The preceding section examines how colonial
ideologies and discourses were reinforced and challenged in financial
literacy texts targeting Indigenous people. I have undertaken such an
analysis not in the name of improving Indigenous financial literacy
education or making any suggestions regarding alternatives: as a settler
subject in Canada, I don't believe that is my place. Rather, I wish to
ask what we, as settlers (and those who, more broadly, benefit from
settler colonialism), can learn from the foregoing discussion as it
relates to [the radical transformation of settler culture, society,
economics, and politics. How Indigenous people organize and strategize
to survive and rebel against colonialist neoliberal extractive
capitalism is vitally important]{.underline}, but not my jurisdiction
(see Lowman and Barker 2015). I am interested in how settlers, the
beneficiaries of colonialist neoliberal extractive capitalism (to
different extents, based on class, race, gender, and other forms of
oppression; see, e.g., Day 2016), can better rebel from within, in part
by learning from (and taking risky action in solidarity with) Indigenous
struggles. For me, [the notion of the radical imagination is crucial.
The radical imagination in this sense implies the ability to recognize
that the present social order is neither inevitable nor necessary; there
have been, there are, and there could yet be other modes for organizing
social life]{.underline} (see Graeber 2007). Here, [the example of
Indigenous social, political, and economic systems in the past and in
the present can be vital,]{.underline} though we are wise to recognize
that gazing at them can also invite the colonial maneuver of
romanticization and appropriation. [The radical imagination is not a
normative category and does not map neatly onto any one ideological,
political, or identitarian approach]{.underline}. Rather, as Cornelius
Castoriadis (1997a) argues, [the radical imagination is a constant force
of disruption, questioning, and creativity working at the very core of
the individual and of society.]{.underline} Castoriadis (1997b) posed
the radical imagination as [the elemental protean substance of the human
subject, but also of social institutions writ large. The institutions of
marriage, the police, and the education system, all social power
formations, even when concretely or brutally material, are held in place
and reproduced through the imaginative work of social
actors.]{.underline} Castoriadis likens it to magma, a substance that is
at times fluid but at other times solidifies, only to become liquid
again at the next tectonic eruption. Following Castoriadis, Alex
Khasnabish and I have approached the radical imagination not as a
private possession located in the mind of the individual but as [a
collective process that emerges from dialogue, debate,]{.underline} and
peoples' often fraught and difficult solidarity in the face of social
power relations (Haiven and Khasnabish 2014). From Robin D. G. Kelley's
(2002) study of the traditions of the Black radical imagination we have
learned about the way [the radical imagination echoes between social
movements, cultural producers, and intellectuals, not only within
particular struggles and locales but globally in an interconnected
age.]{.underline} This approach affirms Marcel Stoetzler and Nira
YuvalDavis's (2002) argument that the [imagination is not some
transcendental universal force but a situated one, contingent on how it
is diversely expressed and articulated in bodies intersected by the
forces of racialization, gender expression, sexuality, citizenship,
ability, and so on]{.underline}.

**[debate]{.underline}**. [In the North, critics focus on the problems

anti-trust regulations that keep technical architecture intact will not
rein in Big Tech, nor will they sufficiently constrain its global

--- not the use --- is the problem. Allowing platforms to amass a richly
detailed database about billions of people is a bad idea, even if it is
done by five or ten Facebooks and Googles with select limitations on
data practices. [Regulation can reduce the excesses, but it will not fix
the issue: a regulated surveillance state is still a surveillance state,
and an economy with a few corporations per product is still an economy
ruled by oligarchs]{.underline}. **[Technology is not neutral. Its

### FW --- AT: Scenario Planning

#### [Scenario planning is bad -- its results in the discursive colonization of future worlds and bolsters the hegemonic governance of militaristic imperial powers.]{.underline}

**Ossewaarde '17** \-- Associate professor in governance, society and
technology, University of Twente (Marinus Ossewaarde, 7-21-2017,
"Unmasking scenario planning: The colonization of the future in the
'Local Governments of the Future' program", Futures, Volume 93, pg.
80-88, <http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.futures.2017.07.003>, accessed

Colonization and the closing of futures [Scenario planning is meant to
be a dialectical quest for open futures, whereby alternative worlds are
envisioned and judgement as to the most desirable world is
suspended.]{.underline} Such a dialogical process, associated with
democratic [politics of world making, typically implies the critique,
negation and transcendence of the established power
constellation]{.underline}, which is by its very nature conservative.
Hence, [power holders are tempted to believe that their rule is
indefinite and that history has ended -- since all activities are
directed towards the maintenance of the current order]{.underline}.
Conversely, action, which 'has an inherent tendency to force open all
limitations and cut across all boundaries' is discouraged (Arendt 1958:
190). Hannah Arendt therefore went so far as claiming that 'action, seen
from the viewpoint of the automatic processes which seem to determine
the course of the world, looks like a miracle' (Arendt 1958: 246).
[Established power elites may have an interest in scenario planning, but
the future with which they are fascinated is the prolongation of their
current worlds. In other words, scenario planning is used for colonizing
the future. In a colonized 'scenario planning', predominant or currently
powerful stakeholders do not search for alternative futures, but,
instead, enact their own ideological discourses, imaginaries and frames.
The current power constellation is left unquestioned, and taken for
granted in the scenario planning, as if established power factions will
perdure in the future. The negation of wellestablished biases and
prejudices is held in check, in order to safeguard the status quo. Such
conservativism is legitimized by referring to current trends that are
endowed with the aura of necessity or inevitability]{.underline}
(natural and eternal laws). A colonized 'scenario planning' therefore
[masks unequal and often illegitimate power relationships.]{.underline}
Historically, it appears that [scenario planning has more often than not
been a tool for colonization, designed to secure the future rule of the
established power complex. In the 1940s, Herman Kahn and the RAND
Corporation developed scenario planning to enable US military rulers to
forecast the moves of potential opponents and to accordingly develop
counteroffensives in the nuclear arms race]{.underline} (Tevis 2010). In
the 1970s, Pierre Wack and [Royal Dutch/Shell established scenario
planning activities as an integral part of strategic management, to
secure oil interests in the context of ecological crisis and the oil
crisis]{.underline} (Wack 1985; Chermack and Coons 2015). The stimulus
for scenario planning in these cases was the perceived rise of
uncertainties in a world that had become more unpredictable and
potentially apocalyptic. Horror scenarios of nuclear wars and a Third
World War had become commonplace in the 1950s. Stories of ecological
catastrophe, with a vision of large tracts of the earth rendered
uninhabitable, the collapse of global food production, the acidification
of the oceans, sea-level rise and storms, and droughts of growing
intensity, became common since the publication of the Club of Rome
report in 1972 (Wright et al 2013). In the hands of ruling military,
governmental and corporate powers, ['scenario planning' became a method
for ensuring strategic victory in a context of uncertainties and
complexities. Since such scenario planning aimed at predictability,
ambiguities were undesirable factors that were better
eliminated]{.underline}, both in theory and practice (Amer, Daim and
Jetter 2013). [Computer simulations, game theoretic tools, forecasting
methods, trend research, horizon scanning, and visual imageries filtered
out all that which could not be mapped]{.underline} (O'Brien 2016).
Pierre Wack, who introduced scenario planning at Royal Dutch/Shell,
emphasizes that the future is only half closed. He made a plea for the
incorporation of both literary and technical methods in scenario
planning, to facilitate both the imagination and calculation of probable
futures (Chermack and Coons 2015). According to Wack, the future is
partly determined by trends that cannot but persist (Van't Klooster and
Van Asselt 2006). Population growth and ageing are examples of such
trends; and the corresponding implications for food demand, transport,
housing, and other kinds of infrastructure clearly have to be reckoned
with in any scenario planning. At the same time, for Wack, the future
cannot be fully outlined based on these data and graphics. The partial
openness of the future lies in the unpredictability of future
generations' actions in reaction to these trends. Robotic warfare is one
possible future; large-scale euthanasia is another. But it is also
imaginable that ecological disasters may wipe off entire populations.
These futures are imaginable and yet not simply fictive because the
'material' for their 'creation' is already available here and now. For
instance, it is highly probable that white Americans will no longer be
the majority population in the United States by 2050, but the question
as to how white Americans will cope with living as a minority in the US
invites different answers (Martín Alcoff 2015: 24; 26). [Colonization
aims at ruling out openness, with the aim of shaping a future
(preferably one that seems to be the product of predetermined trends
that cannot be altered by human decisions) in which the current status
quo is preserved]{.underline}. O'Brien (2016) explains that Royal
Dutch/Shell's interest in [scenario planning is motivated by its will to
shape a future in which remains a dominant key actor that moulds the
world in its own interest: its scenario planning practices and its wish
to maintain its hegemony are interconnected. ']{.underline}Shell's
scenario plans,' O'Brien (2016: 334) notes, 'are credited with the
company's success in outwitting the thugs, and thereby contributing to
the larger project of securing Western interests amidst the turmoil of
globalization.' [Such a hegemonic project has its prices in terms of
human rights abuses, oil pollution and corporate crimes (Holzer 2007;
Hennchen 2015).]{.underline} The organized fossilfuel industry is
powerful enough to protect its vested interests and to promote a
strategy of inaction (no reduction of fossil-fuel emissions), so that
nothing really changes. Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist,
explains that to safeguard the current status quo, the fossil-fuel
industry, including Royal Dutch/Shell, funds a 'climate change denial
campaign' to discredit climate science -- which advocates radical change
now -- and prevent dialogues. In this campaign, a significant part of
the established power elites, including the Koch Brothers, and
influential politicians like John McCain and Joe Lieberman, makes a
mockery of climatology, and of particular scientists (Wright and Mann
2013). [The pertinent question that ought to be raised,]{.underline}
O'Brien (2016: 341) therefore [concludes is: 'whose future is being
planned, by whom, for whom and to what ultimate end?' When scenario
planning is a tool for colonization, the future is planned by and for
the established power constellation, even if 'larger' entities such as
national, European or Western interests are invoked. Such scenario
planning is legitimized by discrediting 'doom scenarios', through
discourses on the liberating potential of technology]{.underline} (which
should be able to solve the problems that it creates) [and
(correspondingly) on the inevitable course of history.]{.underline}

Vijay Prashad had identified [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as [the **prime

Atlantic project, he noted was, "[a]{.underline} fairly straightforward
[campaign by the propertied classes]{.underline} to [maintain or
restore]{.underline} their [position of dominance]{.underline}." This
Atlantic Project was anchored in the military alliance called

organization was [a prop for **western capital**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the core prop for Wall

[expansion of [NATO to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**military
management** of the international system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Prior to
1991, the planners of NATO could justify the existence of NATO on
ideological and political grounds, but with the threat of a multi polar
world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO expanded to the point where
this author joined with others in labelling this organization Global
NATO to [[reflect its]{.mark} **current imperial
[mandate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Global thrust of NATO now comprises
29 members from Europe and North America along with 41 'partners' that
had [started off [under]{.mark} the [banner of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
North Atlantic [[Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} Council (NACC) in
1991. [Since that time]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} has
[[launched]{.mark} a lengthy war]{.underline} without end [in
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}, [colluded in]{.underline} the
[destruction of [Iraq and]{.mark} conspired with
**[militarists]{.mark}**]{.underline} to forge 'Partnership for Peace'
(with most members of the former Warsaw Pact states). The core 29
members are now enmeshed with treaties and undertakings from states
involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. There are
also the 'partners' from across the globe: Afghanistan, Australia,
Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and
Pakistan. This enlargement served the military purposes of encircling
China and Russia who military planners in the West targeted.

the history of NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at
Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one
of the coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document
spelt out ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress,
Nicolas Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that
the current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On
the day before the actual 70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to a joint session of the
US Congress advocating an expansion of the alliance while promoting a
military buildup against Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have
to reflect deeply on whether the current sanctions regime and the
special propose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade
Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of inter imperialist
rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the
shifting alliances yielded confusion among working peoples who
ultimately went to fight against each other in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to Hiroshima.

The continued struggles for bread, peace and justice ensure that it is
only the authoritarian leaders from [the **[Global
South]{.mark}**]{.underline} who [are [compromised
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**real meaning** of]{.mark} the
**existence of [NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the present era, there
is a [new capitalist competition]{.underline} while North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as [an **integral
part** of the Pentagon's **world command
structure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Recent experiences]{.underline} have
[demonstrated]{.underline} in [Afghanistan]{.underline},
[Iraq]{.underline} and [Libya]{.underline} that the **[[moguls]{.mark}

many countries and]{.mark} to [kill as many people as necessary to
achieve]{.mark} the [dominance of US capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The [destruction of Libya was a classic example]{.underline} of the
convergence of finance as warfare, the weaponization of information and
incessant bombing to destroy a society. Where at the start of NATO the
[[war scare]{.underline}]{.mark} was [[the **propaganda

NATO at Birth: Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and
psychological warfare against Europeans.

In the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall there were major press
reports on the role of NATO's stay behind armies that had been operating
inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten years earlier, when the kidnapping
and killing of the former Italian Prime Minister, Aldo Moro rocked
western Europe, it emerged that his demise had been authored
byclandestine paramilitary network code-named "[[Operation
Gladio]{.underline}]{.mark}" that [was a **[false flag
op]{.mark}eration** of NATO]{.underline}. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had
[meticulously documented how [NATO funded]{.mark} and]{.underline} often
**[even directed [terrorist organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**
throughout Europe in what was termed a "strategy of tension" [[with the
aim of preventing]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[rise of the left]{.mark}**
in Western European politics]{.underline}. [NATO's]{.underline} "[secret
armies]{.underline}" engaged in subversive and criminal activities in
several countries.

In the specific case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable
crime of contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged
to the Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, the
CIA and MI6 had [**[worked]{.mark} closely** [with]{.mark} former
**[fascists]{.mark}** to oppose citizens and organizations
in]{.underline} Western [Europe]{.underline} that were anti-capitalists.
Under the leadership of US planners such as Allen Dulles, William Colby,
Frank Wisner and later James Angleton, these operatives weaned and
[[nursed]{.mark} a network of [agents and]{.mark} **secret [arms
dumps]{.mark}**]{.underline} across Europe, a network that would remain
secret but active throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser elaborated on
the extensive operations of Operation Gladio all across Europe
[[with]{.mark} the [**explicit aim** of subverting]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[**democratic wishes** of]{.mark} European [citizens]{.mark} who
were [opposed to oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is worth quoting at
length the role of the secret armies.

"NATO's "[secret armies]{.underline}" [engaged in **subversive** and
**criminal activities**]{.underline} in several countries. In
[Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind army, working with the
army, [[staged a **coup**]{.mark} **d'état** and killed Prime Minister
Adnan Menderes]{.underline}; in [[Algeria]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1961,
the French stay-behind army staged a [coup with the CIA against
the]{.underline} French [government of Algiers]{.underline}, which
ultimately failed; in 1967, the [Greek]{.underline} stay-behind army
staged a coup and [imposed a **military
[dictatorship]{.mark}**]{.underline}; in 1971 in Turkey, after a
military coup, the stay-behind army [[engaged in]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[[domestic terror]{.underline}]{.mark}" and killed hundreds; in 1977 in
[Spain]{.underline}, the stay behind army [carried out a
[massacre]{.mark} in Madrid]{.underline}; in 1980 in
[Turkey]{.underline}, the [head of the stay behind army
staged]{.underline} a [**coup** and took power]{.underline}; in 1985 in
[Belgium]{.underline}, the [stay behind attacked and [shot]{.mark}
shoppers]{.underline} randomly [in [supermarkets]{.mark}]{.underline},
killing 28; in Switzerland in 1990, the former head of the Swiss stay
behind wrote the US Defense Department he would reveal "the whole
truth," and was found the next day stabbed to death with his own
bayonet; and in 1995, England revealed that the MI6 and SAS helped set
up stay behind armies across Western Europe."\[5\]

The [**mainstream [media]{.mark}** and **University
commentaries**]{.underline} have [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} been [[able
to confront this history]{.mark} in so far [as]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**manipulation** and **deception** that gave rise
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the birth of [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[still at work]{.underline}]{.mark} against the citizens of Europe and
the United States.

#### **This propaganda war scare is [directly funded]{.underline} by US defense industries --- the only real "impending threats" are threats to their [profits]{.underline}.**

War Scare, NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe
and North America.

At the end of World War II, the [**[defense Industries]{.mark}** in the
USA]{.underline} had been [faced with the choice of conversion and
retooling]{.underline} the [factories]{.underline} that made weapons [or
continue]{.underline} the [**massive subsidies** for]{.underline} the
[industries vested in military and armaments production]{.underline}.
The [choice]{.underline} was eventually [made to [embark on]{.mark} a
[**propaganda war scare** to justify]{.mark}]{.underline} the [need for
an expanded army and]{.underline} it was in this context when
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} was conceived. [[To sustain]{.mark} the **WW
II [armaments enterprise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[there needed to
be]{.mark} a **cycle of [war scare]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[fabrication and inflation of threats and
enemies]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was in this context that Lawrence D.
[Bell]{.underline}, President of Bell Aircraft Corporation, in a
statement to the U.S. Air Policy Commission Finletter Commission) on
September 29, 1947, [stated]{.underline} that "[as soon as there is a
war scare]{.underline}, [there is a **lot of money
available**]{.underline}." \[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn,

> "The [aircraft corporations that]{.underline} had [garnered **enormous
> profits** during the war]{.underline} on the back of government
> contracts had [discovered]{.underline} by 1947 [that peace was
> ruinous]{.underline}. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial
> marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating
> environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more
> companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the
> civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations, while
> efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and
> stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly." \[7\]

In the spring of 1948, the U.S. [Secretary of Defense]{.underline} James
Forrestal and top officials of the Harry Truman administration began to
[sound [alarm about]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[looming]{.mark} Soviet
[attack]{.mark} against Western Europe]{.underline}. It is now known,
from declassified documents, that the [[officials]{.mark} were
[aware]{.mark} that [there was **no credible evidence** to
back]{.mark}]{.underline} up their [[war scare]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Some analysts have argued that the war scare of 1948 was [[devised to
save]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**aircraft [manufacturing]{.mark}**
[industry]{.mark}]{.underline} [from]{.underline} plunging into
[bankruptcy]{.underline}. And this goal was achieved. In the book Harry
S. Truman and the War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states that [within 2
months of]{.underline} the [emergence of the scare]{.underline}, the
Truman administration [revamped the aircraft industry by]{.underline}
embarking on a [**57% increase** in purchase of military
aircraft]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [total budget of the
**Pentagon**]{.underline} was [increased by 30%.]{.underline}

[NATO]{.underline} was [born]{.underline} on April 4, 1949 [out of this
**propaganda war** to deceive]{.underline} the [US citizens
about]{.underline} a [pending attack of the Soviet Union]{.underline} on
Western Europe. The [[task of organizing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[deception]{.mark} of]{.underline} the citizens of [the
West]{.underline} was [[assigned to the **C**]{.mark}entral
**[I]{.mark}**ntelligence **[A]{.mark}**gency]{.underline}. There are
now so many books and articles on the role of the CIA in
**[[deception]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[**propaganda** and
**psychological warfare**]{.underline}]{.mark} that we will not spend a
great deal of time on the role of the Covert agencies in giving
legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David
Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively how the Dulles
brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in this deception.
\[8\] It was especially chilling how [[Universities]{.underline}]{.mark}
were suborned to be [[**surrogates** for **this**]{.mark}
**psychological warfare**]{.underline}. Noam Chomsky has dealt with this
aspect of the period of the birth of NATO in the work on the
Universities and the Cold War.\[9\]

#### Operations are [designed]{.underline} by neo-Nazis, solidifying capitalism under the ruse of "freedom" and protection from the working class --- this [cements]{.underline} a colonial hierarchy of violence.

Racists and anticommunists in the propaganda war

It was [[not by accident]{.underline}]{.mark} that the thinkers and
[[planners of]{.mark} these **secret [operations]{.mark}**
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} known [[racists and **Nazi
s**]{.mark}**ympathizers**]{.underline}. Frank Wisner who hailed from
Mississippi in the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who
was an architect of the false flag operations and the deception
associated with NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War,
in 1948 Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special
Projects. Soon afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this
Office of Special Projects was renamed the Office of Policy Coordination
(OPC). This became the espionage and counter-intelligence branch of the
Central Intelligence Agency. Later James Jesus Angleton was to take this
brand of counter intelligence work to the highest levels of state
assassinations. Wisner had been mandated told to create an
[[organization]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[concentrated
on]{.underline}]{.mark} "[propaganda]{.underline}, [economic
warfare]{.underline}; [preventive direct action]{.underline}, including
[sabotage]{.underline}, [anti-sabotage]{.underline},
[demolition]{.underline} and evacuation measures; [[subversion against
**hostile**]{.mark} **states**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
assistance to underground resistance groups, and [support of indigenous
[anti-Communist elements in]{.mark} **threatened [countries]{.mark}**
[of the **free world**]{.mark}]{.underline}." It was from this opaque
sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination where the brainwashing
and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era was refined. Evan Thomas
reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early Days of the CIA, the
OPC's charter gave it responsibility for "propaganda, economic warfare;
preventative direct action, including sabotage, antisabotage, demolition
and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
assistance to underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous
anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world."

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[the **principal prop** for]{.mark}
**international [capitalism]{.mark}** today]{.underline}.

In the celebratory events to memorialize the founding of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when
the North American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the
[**founding [members]{.mark}** were [colonial
overlords]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Colonialism and imperialism took a
**new form**]{.mark} under]{.underline} the [leadership of US
capitalists defending the dollar and Wall Street]{.underline}. At that
historical moment in 1949, the justification for starting this
organization was that it constituted a system of collective defense
whereby its member states agreed to mutual defense in response to an
attack by any external party. The external party in question at that
time was the USSR; insofar as NATO had been formed as an alliance
ostensibly to defend Western Europe against 'communist expansion'. In
the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new Allies agreed "an armed attack
against one or more of them... shall be considered an attack against
them all."

The [[US]{.mark} **military and industrial [leaders]{.mark}**
[studied]{.mark}]{.underline} the [terror and propaganda [tactics
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Nazis]{.underline}]{.mark} in order
[[to]{.mark} learn]{.underline} the lessons of [how to [develop]{.mark}
an **efficient [military machine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. James Whitman
in the book, Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making
of Nazi Race Law, outlined what the fascists had learnt from the
eugenics movement in the United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist
scientists from Germany had found a place in the US academy, the top
planners of the Cold War linked the US primacy to the global history of
racism to the efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of
conservative Germany.

One of the [[unspoken aspects of]{.underline}]{.mark} the first years of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} was the [question of
[containing]{.mark}]{.underline} the possible [[**revolutionary
impulses** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the German [[working
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. [To forestall]{.underline} such a
[possibility]{.underline}, the thinkers and planners of [NATO
collaborated with]{.underline} the former [**fascists** to learn their
skills]{.underline}. The details of this alliance have been spelt out in
the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The Devil's Chessboard:
Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government. The
[merging of fascist ideas with]{.underline} the ideas of [Jim
Crow]{.underline} in the United States were [refined in]{.underline} the
secret operation called, [[Operation Paperclip]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Anne Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to
Bring Nazi Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the
secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA)
largely carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps
(CIC), in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and
technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were
taken from Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily
between 1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former
leaders, of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a
military program that has brought us the weaponization of space.

The creators of NATO simultaneously [[mobilized]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[colonial and fascist elements in **[Belgium]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[Spain]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[Italy]{.mark}** and
**[France]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of the twelve founding members, six
were outright colonial powers and at that moment, countries such as
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Portugal [[looked to the
US]{.mark}A [to support]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[plunder of colonial
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the specific case of France, in order
[to assist French colonialism]{.underline},
[[Algeria]{.underline}]{.mark} was [named]{.underline} as [a territory
of NATO]{.underline}. Sixty years later when the President of France,
Macron, apologized for the crimes of [[killing **more than one
million**]{.mark} Algerians]{.underline}, there is [[no reflection
inside **western**]{.mark} **academic [institutions]{.mark}** [on
this]{.mark} role of NATO in Africa]{.underline}. Currently, the French
have been the most aggressive in promoting the fiction that the defense
radius of Europe stretches 4000 kilometers out from Brussels, up to the
arctic, well across the Russian frontier and down into central Africa.

It is not widely known that, initially, the [Portuguese fascists
were]{.underline} some of the [**principal beneficiaries**
of]{.underline} the membership of [NATO]{.underline}, [with **major
deployment** of nuclear weapons]{.underline} in the Azores as reward for
the NATO [support for colonialism in [Angola]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[Mozambique]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Guinea]{.mark} and other Portuguese
outposts]{.underline} of colonial domination. Prior to the formation of
NATO in 1949, the 1947 [document]{.underline} of the State Department on
Cooperative Development of Africa had [stipulated that colonialism would
assist]{.underline} the recovery of [European capitalism]{.underline}.
\[12\]The State Department had been [[explicit in outlining how
**cheap**]{.mark} **foodstuffs** and **raw [materials]{.mark}** [from
Africa would assist Europe]{.mark}'s recovery and create]{.underline}
the [basis for unity and economic regeneration]{.underline}.

The USA set about creating a number of international institutions to
guarantee the survival of Europe and of capitalism, the IMF, IBRD (World
Bank), the NATO, GATT, to guarantee the strength of the USA in
international trade and finance.

By the time NATO was formed in 1949, the US planners had already [made
their plans]{.underline} with Britain and France [to extend]{.underline}
their [**military control** over Africa]{.underline}. France was
bequeathed the task of maintaining order in western Africa while the
British sought to maintain naval power incorporating the British
facilities [from the Suez]{.underline} Canal down [through]{.underline}
Aden ([Yemen]{.underline}), to Mombasa ([Kenya]{.underline}), Simons
town [South Africa across to Malaysia]{.underline}. \[13\] The [**racist
apartheid** regime]{.underline} had [persuaded NATO]{.underline} that
[it was necessary to integrate]{.underline} the [South African military
into]{.underline} the [western defense planning]{.underline} in order to
protect the 'Cape route.' After the Suez crises of 1956 and the 1967 war
this alliance with the [racist regime deepened]{.underline}. Throughout
its existence [[NATO]{.mark} assisted in]{.underline} the
[[refine]{.mark}ment of [the **racial**]{.mark} **status
[hierarchy]{.mark}** [in which whites]{.mark} are [dominant]{.mark} [and
**p**]{.mark}eople **[o]{.mark}**f **[c]{.mark}**olor]{.underline} are
[[subordinate]{.underline}]{.mark}. \[14\]

> This incorporation of racist ideas into western defense continued a
> long tradition that shaped the outlook of NATO and reinforced the
> outlook of Frantz Fanon: "[Colonialism is violence in its **natural
> state**]{.underline}." France and Britain excelled in this violence
> with the Belgians cementing their communications and logistics
> coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba and later support the killing of
> the Secretary General of the United Nation, Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\]

Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal deepened their links to NATO but
in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the planned offensive of the British
and the French in the Suez war. After this war, both the currencies of
Britain and France suffered sharp declines with France seeking cover
inside the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), while the British
pound accepted its place as a prop to the US dollar in the global
economy. Within a year after the Suez debacle, France had pushed for the
Treaty of Rome that paved the way for the European Economic Community to
be a competitive force with US capitalists.

Within the context of the competition between European capitalists and
US capitalists, Charles De Gaulle exhibited pique at the organization of
NATO that supported the armaments culture of US capital. Charles De
Gaulle partially pulled France out of this alliance in 1966 after it
became clear that this military organization was dominated by the United
States and Britain (supporting their military industries). De Gaulle
argued for an independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a signatory to
North Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North Atlantic Council.
Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned to the fold of the
NATO military structures in 2009.

The duplicitous actions on the part of the French leadership were always
based on calculations meant to preserve the dominance of French capital
in Africa. When the US devalued the dollar in 1971 and broke the
agreements of the Bretton Woods Treaty, it was the French who complained
about the Exorbitant Privilege of the Dollar. For a short period, both
the President of France and the Chancellor of West Germany had chafed
under the privilege and had worked hard to bring into being the
Maastricht Treaty and the Europe Union to end the dominance of the
dollar in the international capitalist system. It was known than the one
necessary aspect of this emerging common currency in Europe would be the
dismantling of the military occupation of Europe by US military
personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and Helmut Schmidt had linked
the common currency, the European Central Bank and common foreign and
security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that ultimately Europe will
break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the face of this threat and
the fall of the centrally planned economy that the forward planners
expanded NATO.

#### NATO's humanitarian missions are nothing more than the [new cover story]{.underline} for imperial interventions.

Emergence of Global NATO and the [[myth of]{.underline}]{.mark}
'**[[humanitarian intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}**'

Usually, [when]{.underline} an [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[formed for]{.mark} a specific [purpose]{.mark} such as
halting]{.underline} the spread [[of communism]{.underline}]{.mark},
that [alliance is folded when]{.underline} the [mission]{.underline} is
[complete]{.underline}. Hence, [[after]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[fall]{.mark} of the Soviet Union]{.underline} in 1991, it was
[[expected]{.underline}]{.mark} by those seeking the 'peace dividend'
that the mission of [[NATO]{.mark} would be **[scaled
down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}, [NATO
[expanded]{.mark}]{.underline}, seeking to encircle Russia by extending
its membership to include former members of the Warsaw Pact countries.
Progressive scholars have documented the cynicism of the US military
planners who orchestrated the 'humanitarian intervention' [in the
[Balkans]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to [advance the hegemony of US
capitalism]{.underline} after the fall of the Soviet Union. The
scholarship on this [manipulation of the European **working
peoples**]{.underline} to [entrench NATO is rich]{.underline} and needs
to be revisited at this moment of the celebration of the 70thanniversary
of the founding of NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book, The Hidden Hand:
Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence' brought out evidence
to expose how the [[massacres]{.mark} in the Balkans]{.underline},
helped [give a **new [impetus]{.mark}** [to US
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}.' \[16\] David Gibbs had argued, "How the
Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy." It is worth quoting at
length how the Balkans [war]{.underline} was [[used to manipulate
**public opinion**]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline},

> "Perhaps most importantly, the massacre helped give a new impetus to
> US hegemony, contributing to its post-Cold War legitimacy. In
> bolstering America's hegemonic position, the significance of the
> Srebrenica massacre cannot be overstated: The massacre helped [trigger
> a NATO **bombing campaign**]{.underline} that is [**widely credited**
> with ending the Bosnian war]{.underline}, along with the associated
> atrocities, [and]{.underline} this campaign [[gave NATO]{.mark} a
> [**new purpose** for the post-Soviet era]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since
> that time, the Srebrenica precedent has been continuously invoked as a
> justification for military force. The [perceived need to prevent
> massacres]{.underline} and oppression helped [justify]{.underline}
> later [interventions in [Kosovo]{.mark}]{.underline},
> [[Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
> [[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as the ongoing fight against
> ISIS. The recent UN doctrine of Responsibility to Protect, which
> contains a strongly interventionist tone, was inspired in part by the
> memory of Srebrenica." \[17\]

The [[more **nefarious aspect**]{.mark} of]{.underline} this
[manipulation of **humanitarianism** [was]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[ways]{.underline}]{.mark} in which elements such as Bernard Kouchner
[used]{.underline} their [credentials as]{.underline} former [[members
of the left]{.mark} and progressive]{.underline} forces [to [give cover
to]{.mark} **US [imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the war in
the Balkans it is now accepted by the military planners that
[[humanitarian intervention]{.mark} acts as [a **force
multiplier**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[18\] This [position]{.underline}
was [**explicitly stated** by]{.underline} General [Colin
Powell]{.underline} who noted, "Just as surely as our diplomats and
military, American NGOs are out there serving and sacrificing on the
front lines of freedom NGOs are such a force multiplier for us, such an
important part of our combat team." These observations can [shed light
on]{.underline} the relationship between NGOs such as Doctors without
Borders and the International Rescue Committee in **[[global
militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The **[celebration of NATO]{.underline}**'s 70 years of existence
[provides]{.underline} another [opportunity to unearth]{.underline} the
[**real history** of]{.underline} the [ideas]{.underline}, [practices
and destruction wrought by]{.underline} this [military
alliance]{.underline}. [Even with]{.underline} the [clear exposure
of]{.underline} the [cooperation between NATO]{.underline}, [the CIA
and]{.underline} the [British MI6 to spread **terror** and
**psychological warfare**]{.underline} in Europe immediately after the
formation of this military alliance, the [mainstream media]{.underline},
[academics and policy makers remain silent on]{.underline} activities of
the 'stay behind armies' and '**[false flag]{.underline}**' [operations
that distorted]{.underline} the [real causes of insecurity in the
world]{.underline} after 1945. The [evidence of]{.underline} the
[manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure]{.underline} the
[**continued survival** of NATO]{.underline} has been [**well
documented** in]{.underline} the [**fraudulent interventions** and
bombings in the Balkans]{.underline} right up the [present multiple wars
against]{.underline} the [peoples of Iran]{.underline}.

Vijay Prashad had identified [NATO]{.underline} as [the **prime
defender** of the Atlantic project]{.underline}. This Atlantic project,
he noted was, "[a]{.underline} fairly straightforward [campaign by the
propertied classes]{.underline} to [maintain or restore]{.underline}
their [position of dominance]{.underline}." This Atlantic Project was
anchored in the military alliance called [NATO]{.underline} with its
principal work, that of **[reversing the South Project]{.underline}**;
the [struggles for peace bread and justice by]{.underline} the [poorer
citizens of the planet]{.underline}, especially those who had emerged on
the world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the
Caribbean.

The [**ostensive reason** for the founding of NATO was to]{.underline}
'[thwart]{.underline}' [Soviet aggression]{.underline}, [but in practice
the organization was a prop for **western capital**]{.underline} and
after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the core prop for Wall Street.
In this year, there will be many commentaries on the fact that the
existence of NATO reflects a Cold War relic, that NATO is obsolete and
lost its mandate, but very few will [link]{.underline} the [expansion of
NATO to]{.underline} the [**military management** of the international
system]{.underline}. Prior to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify
the existence of NATO on ideological and political grounds, but with the
threat of a multi polar world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO
expanded to the point where this author joined with others in labelling
this organization Global NATO to [reflect its **current imperial
mandate**]{.underline}. The Global thrust of NATO now comprises 29
members from Europe and North America along with 41 'partners' that had
[started off under the banner of]{.underline} the North Atlantic
[Cooperation]{.underline} Council (NACC) in 1991. [Since that
time]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} has [launched a lengthy
war]{.underline} without end [in Afghanistan]{.underline}, [colluded
in]{.underline} the [destruction of Iraq and conspired with
**militarists**]{.underline} to forge 'Partnership for Peace' (with most
members of the former Warsaw Pact states). The core 29 members are now
enmeshed with treaties and undertakings from states involved in the
Mediterranean Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain,
Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. There are also the 'partners'
from across the globe: Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan,
Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan. This enlargement
served the military purposes of encircling China and Russia who military
planners in the West targeted.

There is [**no shortage** of literature on NATO]{.underline} and its
[milestones]{.underline}, [but **very few**]{.underline} have
[documented]{.underline} the [real crimes of]{.underline} this [global
network of]{.underline} anticommunist [operatives who precipitated
**real terror** and psychological warfare against]{.underline} the
[citizens of Europe and North America while supporting **mass
atrocities** from Algeria to Indonesia]{.underline}, and [South
Africa]{.underline}. Books such as that of NATO's Secret Armies:
Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by Danielle Ganser and
The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World
War, by Stephen Kinzer [used **rigorous research
techniques**]{.underline} to [uncover]{.underline} the [**dark history**
of NATO]{.underline}. These two books can be distinguished from the
[**bland** **i**nternational **r**elations]{.underline} texts that
[discusses NATO inside]{.underline} the old calculations of
'[strategy]{.underline},' '[concert of democracies]{.underline}',
'**[security cooperation]{.underline}**' and the [balance of
power]{.underline},' [and **s**pheres **o**f **i**nfluence]{.underline}.
Most recently, this IR rendering of the history of NATO has been served
up in a document entitled, NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis.
Published by Harvard University with one of the coauthors being a former
US ambassador to NATO. This document spelt out ten challenges.\[1\]
However, in a testimony before Congress, Nicolas Burns boiled down the
challenge of NATO to one objective; that the current role of NATO must
be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On the day before the actual
70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
delivered an address to a joint session of the US Congress advocating an
expansion of the alliance while promoting a military buildup against
Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have to reflect deeply on
whether the current sanctions regime and the special propose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is
ushering in another round of inter imperialist rivalry reminiscent of
the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the shifting alliances yielded
confusion among working peoples who ultimately went to fight against
each other in Europe, spreading barbarism throughout the world, from
Auschwitz to Hiroshima.

The continued struggles for bread, peace and justice ensure that it is
only the authoritarian leaders from [the **Global South**]{.underline}
who [are compromised on]{.underline} the [**real meaning** of the
**existence of NATO**]{.underline}. In the present era, there is a [new
capitalist competition]{.underline} while North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as an **integral part** of the
Pentagon's **world command structure**]{.underline}. [Recent
experiences]{.underline} have [demonstrated]{.underline} in
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline} and [Libya]{.underline}
that the **[moguls of Wall Street are willing to wage as many wars, to
destroy as many countries and to kill as many people as necessary to
achieve the dominance of US capitalism]{.underline}**. The [destruction
of Libya was a classic example]{.underline} of the convergence of
finance as warfare, the weaponization of information and incessant
bombing to destroy a society. Where at the start of NATO the [war
scare]{.underline} was [the **propaganda method**]{.underline}, [In the
**current digital age**]{.underline}, [brain hacking and]{.underline}
the [engineering of]{.underline} smart phones have placed the **[giant
technology]{.underline}** firms of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Facebook [at the forefront of]{.underline} the [**new weapons platform**
of NATO]{.underline} and Wall Street. This [analysis]{.underline} is in
three parts [spelling out the rationale for]{.underline} the call for
[**all progressive forces** to join together to concentrate]{.underline}
their [energies in the **dismantling of NATO**]{.underline}.

NATO at Birth: Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and
psychological warfare against Europeans.

In the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall there were major press
reports on the role of NATO's stay behind armies that had been operating
inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten years earlier, when the kidnapping
and killing of the former Italian Prime Minister, Aldo Moro rocked
western Europe, it emerged that his demise had been authored
byclandestine paramilitary network code-named "[Operation
Gladio]{.underline}" that [was a **false flag operation** of
NATO]{.underline}. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's Secret Armies:
Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had [meticulously
documented how NATO funded and]{.underline} often **[even directed
terrorist organizations]{.underline}** throughout Europe in what was
termed a "strategy of tension" [with the aim of preventing]{.underline}
a [**rise of the left** in Western European politics]{.underline}.
[NATO's]{.underline} "[secret armies]{.underline}" engaged in subversive
and criminal activities in several countries.

In the specific case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable
crime of contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged
to the Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, the
CIA and MI6 had [**worked closely** with former **fascists** to oppose
citizens and organizations in]{.underline} Western [Europe]{.underline}
that were anti-capitalists. Under the leadership of US planners such as
Allen Dulles, William Colby, Frank Wisner and later James Angleton,
these operatives weaned and [nursed a network of agents and **secret
arms dumps**]{.underline} across Europe, a network that would remain
secret but active throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser elaborated on
the extensive operations of Operation Gladio all across Europe [with the
**explicit aim** of subverting]{.underline} the [**democratic wishes**
of European citizens who were opposed to oppression]{.underline}. It is
worth quoting at length the role of the secret armies.

"NATO's "[secret armies]{.underline}" [engaged in **subversive** and
**criminal activities**]{.underline} in several countries. In
[Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind army, working with the
army, [staged a **coup d'état** and killed Prime Minister Adnan
Menderes]{.underline}; in [Algeria]{.underline} in 1961, the French
stay-behind army staged a [coup with the CIA against the]{.underline}
French [government of Algiers]{.underline}, which ultimately failed; in
1967, the [Greek]{.underline} stay-behind army staged a coup and
[imposed a **military dictatorship**]{.underline}; in 1971 in Turkey,
after a military coup, the stay-behind army [engaged in]{.underline}
"[domestic terror]{.underline}" and killed hundreds; in 1977 in
[Spain]{.underline}, the stay behind army [carried out a massacre in
Madrid]{.underline}; in 1980 in [Turkey]{.underline}, the [head of the
stay behind army staged]{.underline} a [**coup** and took
power]{.underline}; in 1985 in [Belgium]{.underline}, the [stay behind
attacked and shot shoppers]{.underline} randomly [in
supermarkets]{.underline}, killing 28; in Switzerland in 1990, the
former head of the Swiss stay behind wrote the US Defense Department he
would reveal "the whole truth," and was found the next day stabbed to
death with his own bayonet; and in 1995, England revealed that the MI6
and SAS helped set up stay behind armies across Western Europe."\[5\]

The [**mainstream media** and **University commentaries**]{.underline}
have [not]{.underline} been [able to confront this history in so far
as]{.underline} the [**manipulation** and **deception** that gave rise
to]{.underline} the birth of [NATO]{.underline} is [still at
work]{.underline} against the citizens of Europe and the United States.

War Scare, NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe
and North America.

At the end of World War II, the [**defense Industries** in the
USA]{.underline} had been [faced with the choice of conversion and
retooling]{.underline} the [factories]{.underline} that made weapons [or
continue]{.underline} the [**massive subsidies** for]{.underline} the
[industries vested in military and armaments production]{.underline}.
The [choice]{.underline} was eventually [made to embark on a
**propaganda war scare** to justify]{.underline} the [need for an
expanded army and]{.underline} it was in this context when
[NATO]{.underline} was conceived. [To sustain the **WW II armaments
enterprise**]{.underline}, [there needed to be a **cycle of war scare**
and]{.underline} the [fabrication and inflation of threats and
enemies]{.underline}. It was in this context that Lawrence D.
[Bell]{.underline}, President of Bell Aircraft Corporation, in a
statement to the U.S. Air Policy Commission Finletter Commission) on
September 29, 1947, [stated]{.underline} that "[as soon as there is a
war scare]{.underline}, [there is a **lot of money
available**]{.underline}." \[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn,

> "The [aircraft corporations that]{.underline} had [garnered **enormous
> profits** during the war]{.underline} on the back of government
> contracts had [discovered]{.underline} by 1947 [that peace was
> ruinous]{.underline}. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial
> marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating
> environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more
> companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the
> civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations, while
> efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and
> stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly." \[7\]

In the spring of 1948, the U.S. [Secretary of Defense]{.underline} James
Forrestal and top officials of the Harry Truman administration began to
[sound alarm about]{.underline} a [looming Soviet attack against Western
Europe]{.underline}. It is now known, from declassified documents, that
the [officials were aware that there was **no credible evidence** to
back]{.underline} up their [war scare]{.underline}. Some analysts have
argued that the war scare of 1948 was [devised to save]{.underline} the
[**aircraft manufacturing** industry]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
plunging into [bankruptcy]{.underline}. And this goal was achieved. In
the book Harry S. Truman and the War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states
that [within 2 months of]{.underline} the [emergence of the
scare]{.underline}, the Truman administration [revamped the aircraft
industry by]{.underline} embarking on a [**57% increase** in purchase of
military aircraft]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [total budget of
the **Pentagon**]{.underline} was [increased by 30%.]{.underline}

[NATO]{.underline} was [born]{.underline} on April 4, 1949 [out of this
**propaganda war** to deceive]{.underline} the [US citizens
about]{.underline} a [pending attack of the Soviet Union]{.underline} on
Western Europe. The [task of organizing]{.underline} the [deception
of]{.underline} the citizens of [the West]{.underline} was [assigned to
the **C**entral **I**ntelligence **A**gency]{.underline}. There are now
so many books and articles on the role of the CIA in
**[deception]{.underline}**, [**propaganda** and **psychological
warfare**]{.underline} that we will not spend a great deal of time on
the role of the Covert agencies in giving legitimacy to the idea of a
Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David Talbot are two writers who have
documented extensively how the Dulles brothers ensnared every major
profession in the USA in this deception. \[8\] It was especially
chilling how [Universities]{.underline} were suborned to be
[**surrogates** for **this psychological warfare**]{.underline}. Noam
Chomsky has dealt with this aspect of the period of the birth of NATO in
the work on the Universities and the Cold War.\[9\]

Racists and anticommunists in the propaganda war

It was [not by accident]{.underline} that the thinkers and [planners of
these **secret operations** were]{.underline} known [racists and **Nazi
sympathizers**]{.underline}. Frank Wisner who hailed from Mississippi in
the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who was an
architect of the false flag operations and the deception associated with
NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War, in 1948 Frank
Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special Projects. Soon
afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this Office of Special
Projects was renamed the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC). This
became the espionage and counter-intelligence branch of the Central
Intelligence Agency. Later James Jesus Angleton was to take this brand
of counter intelligence work to the highest levels of state
assassinations. Wisner had been mandated told to create an
[organization]{.underline} that [concentrated on]{.underline}
"[propaganda]{.underline}, [economic warfare]{.underline}; [preventive
direct action]{.underline}, including [sabotage]{.underline},
[anti-sabotage]{.underline}, [demolition]{.underline} and evacuation
measures; [subversion against **hostile states**]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} assistance to underground resistance groups, and
[support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in **threatened
countries** of the **free world**]{.underline}." It was from this opaque
sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination where the brainwashing
and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era was refined. Evan Thomas
reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early Days of the CIA, the
OPC's charter gave it responsibility for "propaganda, economic warfare;
preventative direct action, including sabotage, antisabotage, demolition
and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
assistance to underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous
anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world."

[NATO]{.underline} as [the **principal prop** for **international
capitalism** today]{.underline}.

In the celebratory events to memorialize the founding of
[NATO]{.underline} in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when the North
American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the [**founding
members** were colonial overlords]{.underline}. [Colonialism and
imperialism took a **new form** under]{.underline} the [leadership of US
capitalists defending the dollar and Wall Street]{.underline}. At that
historical moment in 1949, the justification for starting this
organization was that it constituted a system of collective defense
whereby its member states agreed to mutual defense in response to an
attack by any external party. The external party in question at that
time was the USSR; insofar as NATO had been formed as an alliance
ostensibly to defend Western Europe against 'communist expansion'. In
the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new Allies agreed "an armed attack
against one or more of them... shall be considered an attack against
them all."

The [US **military and industrial leaders** studied]{.underline} the
[terror and propaganda tactics of]{.underline} the [Nazis]{.underline}
in order [to learn]{.underline} the lessons of [how to develop an
**efficient military machine**]{.underline}. James Whitman in the book,
Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race
Law, outlined what the fascists had learnt from the eugenics movement in
the United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist scientists from
Germany had found a place in the US academy, the top planners of the
Cold War linked the US primacy to the global history of racism to the
efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of conservative Germany.

One of the [unspoken aspects of]{.underline} the first years of
[NATO]{.underline} was the [question of containing]{.underline} the
possible [**revolutionary impulses** of]{.underline} the German [working
peoples]{.underline}. [To forestall]{.underline} such a
[possibility]{.underline}, the thinkers and planners of [NATO
collaborated with]{.underline} the former [**fascists** to learn their
skills]{.underline}. The details of this alliance have been spelt out in
the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The Devil's Chessboard:
Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's Secret Government. The
[merging of fascist ideas with]{.underline} the ideas of [Jim
Crow]{.underline} in the United States were [refined in]{.underline} the
secret operation called, [Operation Paperclip]{.underline}. Anne
Jacobsen, Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring
Nazi Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the secret
program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely
carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC),
in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians,
such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from
Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily between
1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders,
of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a military
program that has brought us the weaponization of space.

The creators of NATO simultaneously [mobilized]{.underline} the
[colonial and fascist elements in **Belgium**]{.underline},
**[Spain]{.underline}**, [**Italy** and **France**]{.underline}. Of the
twelve founding members, six were outright colonial powers and at that
moment, countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and
Portugal [looked to the USA to support]{.underline} their [plunder of
colonial societies]{.underline}. In the specific case of France, in
order [to assist French colonialism]{.underline}, [Algeria]{.underline}
was [named]{.underline} as [a territory of NATO]{.underline}. Sixty
years later when the President of France, Macron, apologized for the
crimes of [killing **more than one million** Algerians]{.underline},
there is [no reflection inside **western academic institutions** on this
role of NATO in Africa]{.underline}. Currently, the French have been the
most aggressive in promoting the fiction that the defense radius of
Europe stretches 4000 kilometers out from Brussels, up to the arctic,
well across the Russian frontier and down into central Africa.

It is not widely known that, initially, the [Portuguese fascists
were]{.underline} some of the [**principal beneficiaries**
of]{.underline} the membership of [NATO]{.underline}, [with **major
deployment** of nuclear weapons]{.underline} in the Azores as reward for
the NATO [support for colonialism in Angola]{.underline},
[Mozambique]{.underline}, [Guinea and other Portuguese
outposts]{.underline} of colonial domination. Prior to the formation of
NATO in 1949, the 1947 [document]{.underline} of the State Department on
Cooperative Development of Africa had [stipulated that colonialism would
assist]{.underline} the recovery of [European capitalism]{.underline}.
\[12\]The State Department had been [explicit in outlining how **cheap
foodstuffs** and **raw materials** from Africa would assist Europe's
recovery and create]{.underline} the [basis for unity and economic
regeneration]{.underline}.

The USA set about creating a number of international institutions to
guarantee the survival of Europe and of capitalism, the IMF, IBRD (World
Bank), the NATO, GATT, to guarantee the strength of the USA in
international trade and finance.

By the time NATO was formed in 1949, the US planners had already [made
their plans]{.underline} with Britain and France [to extend]{.underline}
their [**military control** over Africa]{.underline}. France was
bequeathed the task of maintaining order in western Africa while the
British sought to maintain naval power incorporating the British
facilities [from the Suez]{.underline} Canal down [through]{.underline}
Aden ([Yemen]{.underline}), to Mombasa ([Kenya]{.underline}), Simons
town [South Africa across to Malaysia]{.underline}. \[13\] The [**racist
apartheid** regime]{.underline} had [persuaded NATO]{.underline} that
[it was necessary to integrate]{.underline} the [South African military
into]{.underline} the [western defense planning]{.underline} in order to
protect the 'Cape route.' After the Suez crises of 1956 and the 1967 war
this alliance with the [racist regime deepened]{.underline}. Throughout
its existence [NATO assisted in]{.underline} the [refinement of the
**racial status hierarchy** in which whites are dominant and **p**eople
**o**f **c**olor]{.underline} are [subordinate]{.underline}. \[14\]

> This incorporation of racist ideas into western defense continued a
> long tradition that shaped the outlook of NATO and reinforced the
> outlook of Frantz Fanon: "[Colonialism is violence in its **natural
> state**]{.underline}." France and Britain excelled in this violence
> with the Belgians cementing their communications and logistics
> coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba and later support the killing of
> the Secretary General of the United Nation, Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\]

Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal deepened their links to NATO but
in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the planned offensive of the British
and the French in the Suez war. After this war, both the currencies of
Britain and France suffered sharp declines with France seeking cover
inside the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), while the British
pound accepted its place as a prop to the US dollar in the global
economy. Within a year after the Suez debacle, France had pushed for the
Treaty of Rome that paved the way for the European Economic Community to
be a competitive force with US capitalists.

Within the context of the competition between European capitalists and
US capitalists, Charles De Gaulle exhibited pique at the organization of
NATO that supported the armaments culture of US capital. Charles De
Gaulle partially pulled France out of this alliance in 1966 after it
became clear that this military organization was dominated by the United
States and Britain (supporting their military industries). De Gaulle
argued for an independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a signatory to
North Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North Atlantic Council.
Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned to the fold of the
NATO military structures in 2009.

The duplicitous actions on the part of the French leadership were always
based on calculations meant to preserve the dominance of French capital
in Africa. When the US devalued the dollar in 1971 and broke the
agreements of the Bretton Woods Treaty, it was the French who complained
about the Exorbitant Privilege of the Dollar. For a short period, both
the President of France and the Chancellor of West Germany had chafed
under the privilege and had worked hard to bring into being the
Maastricht Treaty and the Europe Union to end the dominance of the
dollar in the international capitalist system. It was known than the one
necessary aspect of this emerging common currency in Europe would be the
dismantling of the military occupation of Europe by US military
personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and Helmut Schmidt had linked
the common currency, the European Central Bank and common foreign and
security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that ultimately Europe will
break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the face of this threat and
the fall of the centrally planned economy that the forward planners
expanded NATO.

Emergence of Global NATO and the [myth of]{.underline} '**[humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}**'

Usually, [when]{.underline} an [alliance]{.underline} is [formed for a
specific purpose such as halting]{.underline} the spread [of
communism]{.underline}, that [alliance is folded when]{.underline} the
[mission]{.underline} is [complete]{.underline}. Hence,
[after]{.underline} the [fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline} in 1991,
it was [expected]{.underline} by those seeking the 'peace dividend' that
the mission of [NATO would be **scaled down**]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, [NATO expanded]{.underline}, seeking to encircle
Russia by extending its membership to include former members of the
Warsaw Pact countries. Progressive scholars have documented the cynicism
of the US military planners who orchestrated the 'humanitarian
intervention' [in the Balkans]{.underline} in order to [advance the
hegemony of US capitalism]{.underline} after the fall of the Soviet
Union. The scholarship on this [manipulation of the European **working
peoples**]{.underline} to [entrench NATO is rich]{.underline} and needs
to be revisited at this moment of the celebration of the 70thanniversary
of the founding of NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book, The Hidden Hand:
Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence' brought out evidence
to expose how the [massacres in the Balkans]{.underline}, helped [give a
**new impetus** to US hegemony]{.underline}.' \[16\] David Gibbs had
argued, "How the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy." It is
worth quoting at length how the Balkans [war]{.underline} was [used to
manipulate **public opinion** in Europe]{.underline},

> "Perhaps most importantly, the massacre helped give a new impetus to
> US hegemony, contributing to its post-Cold War legitimacy. In
> bolstering America's hegemonic position, the significance of the
> Srebrenica massacre cannot be overstated: The massacre helped [trigger
> a NATO **bombing campaign**]{.underline} that is [**widely credited**
> with ending the Bosnian war]{.underline}, along with the associated
> atrocities, [and]{.underline} this campaign [gave NATO a **new
> purpose** for the post-Soviet era]{.underline}. Since that time, the
> Srebrenica precedent has been continuously invoked as a justification
> for military force. The [perceived need to prevent
> massacres]{.underline} and oppression helped [justify]{.underline}
> later [interventions in Kosovo]{.underline},
> [Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}, and
> [Libya]{.underline}, as well as the ongoing fight against ISIS. The
> recent UN doctrine of Responsibility to Protect, which contains a
> strongly interventionist tone, was inspired in part by the memory of
> Srebrenica." \[17\]

The [more **nefarious aspect** of]{.underline} this [manipulation of
**humanitarianism** was]{.underline} the [ways]{.underline} in which
elements such as Bernard Kouchner [used]{.underline} their [credentials
as]{.underline} former [members of the left and progressive]{.underline}
forces [to give cover to **US imperialism**]{.underline}. Since the war
in the Balkans it is now accepted by the military planners that
[humanitarian intervention acts as a **force multiplier**]{.underline}.
\[18\] This [position]{.underline} was [**explicitly stated**
by]{.underline} General [Colin Powell]{.underline} who noted, "Just as
surely as our diplomats and military, American NGOs are out there
serving and sacrificing on the front lines of freedom NGOs are such a
force multiplier for us, such an important part of our combat team."
These observations can [shed light on]{.underline} the relationship
between NGOs such as Doctors without Borders and the International
Rescue Committee in **[global militarism]{.underline}**.

[and]{.underline} the \"[indispensable nation]{.underline}.\" These
enduring tropes explain why all [presidential candidates]{.underline}
feel compelled to [offer [**ritualistic paeans** to]{.mark} America's
greatness]{.underline} and why President Barack Obama landed in hot
water --- most recently, from Mitt Romney --- for saying that while he
believed in \"[[American exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark},\" it was
[[no different from]{.underline}]{.mark} \"British exceptionalism,\"
\"Greek exceptionalism,\" or any other country's brand of **[[patriotic
chest-thumping]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Most statements of \"**[American exceptionalism]{.underline}**\"
[[presume]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[America's
values]{.underline}]{.mark}, [political system]{.underline}, [and
history]{.underline} are [unique and [worthy of **universal
admiration**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They also
[[imply]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} [is]{.underline} both [[**destined**
and **entitled** to play a]{.underline}]{.mark} distinct and [**positive
[role]{.mark}** [on the world stage]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The only thing wrong with this [**[self-congratulatory
portrait]{.mark}** of America's global role]{.underline} is that [it
is]{.underline} mostly [a myth]{.underline}. Although the United States
possesses certain unique qualities --- from high levels of religiosity
to a political culture that privileges individual freedom --- the
conduct of U.S. foreign policy has been determined primarily by its
relative power and by the inherently competitive nature of international
politics. [By focusing on]{.underline} their [**supposedly exceptional**
qualities]{.underline}, [[Americans]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~blind~~
\[[[deceive]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[themselves]{.underline}]{.mark} to
the ways that they are a lot like everyone else.

This [**[unchallenged faith]{.mark}** in American exceptionalism
[makes]{.mark} it harder for Americans to understand why others are less
enthusiastic about U.S. dominance]{.underline}, often alarmed by U.S.
policies, and frequently [irritated by]{.underline} what they see as
[U.S. [hypocrisy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [whether]{.underline} the subject
is possession of [nuclear weapons]{.underline}, conformity with
[international law]{.underline}, [or America's tendency to
condemn]{.underline} the conduct of [others while ignoring
its]{.underline} own [[failings]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ironically, U.S.
[[foreign policy would]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [[be **more
effective** if Americans]{.mark} were [less convinced of their]{.mark}
**own unique [virtues]{.mark}**]{.underline} and less eager to proclaim
them.

**[Myth 1]{.underline}**

[There Is **Something Exceptional** About American
Exceptionalism]{.underline}.

Whenever American leaders refer to the \"unique\" responsibilities of
the United States, they are saying that it is different from other
powers and that these differences require them to take on special
burdens.

Yet there is nothing unusual about such lofty declarations; indeed,
those who make them are treading a well-worn path. Most [[great]{.mark}
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[consider]{.mark}ed [themselves
**superior** to]{.mark} their [rivals]{.mark}]{.underline} and have
believed that they were advancing some greater good when they imposed
their preferences on others. The [[British]{.underline}]{.mark} thought
they were [[bearing the]{.underline}]{.mark} \"**[[white man's
burden]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" while [[French]{.mark} colonialists
invoked [la mission civilisatrice]{.mark} to justify]{.underline} their
[empire]{.underline}. [[Portugal]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose imperial
activities were hardly distinguished, believed it was
[promoting]{.underline} a certain [[missão
civilizadora]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even many of the officials of the
former Soviet Union genuinely believed they were leading the world
toward a socialist utopia despite the many cruelties that communist rule
inflicted. Of course, the United States has by far the better claim to
virtue than Stalin or his successors, but Obama was right to remind us
that [[all countries prize their **own**]{.mark} **particular
[qualities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So when [[America]{.mark}ns]{.underline} proclaim they are exceptional
and indispensable, they are [[simply the latest]{.mark} nation [to sing
a **familiar**]{.mark} **old [song]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Among great
powers, [thinking you're special is the **norm**]{.underline}, [not the
exception]{.underline}.

**[Myth 2]{.underline}**

[The United States **Behaves Better** Than Other Nations]{.underline}
Do.

Declarations of American exceptionalism rest on the [belief]{.underline}
that [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[uniquely virtuous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
nation, [one that loves peace]{.underline}, [nurtures
liberty]{.underline}, [respects human rights]{.underline}, [and embraces
the rule of law]{.underline}. Americans like to think their country
behaves much better than other states do, and certainly better than
other great powers.

If only it were true. The United States may not have been as brutal as
the worst states in world history, but a dispassionate look at the
[[historical record belies]{.mark} most [claims about]{.mark} America's
**moral [superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For starters, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}
has been one of [[the most expansionist]{.mark} powers [in]{.mark}
**modern [history]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It began as 13 small colonies
clinging to the Eastern Seaboard, but eventually [expanded across North
America]{.underline}, seizing Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California
from Mexico in 1846. Along the way, it [[eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark}
most of [the [native]{.mark} population]{.underline} and
[confined]{.underline} the [survivors to **impoverished
reservations**]{.underline}. By the mid-19th century, it had [pushed
Britain out of the Pacific Northwest and consolidated]{.underline} its
[hegemony]{.underline} over the Western Hemisphere.

The [United States]{.underline} has [fought **numerous
wars**]{.underline} since then --- starting several of them ---
[and]{.underline} its [wartime conduct has hardly been]{.underline} a
model of [restraint]{.underline}. The 1899-1902 conquest of the
[[Philippines]{.underline}]{.mark} [killed]{.underline} some 200,000 to
[400,000 Filipinos]{.underline}, most of them [civilians]{.underline},
and the United States and its allies did not hesitate to
[dispatch]{.underline} some [305,000 [German]{.mark} and **330,000
[Japanese]{.mark} civilians** through aerial bombing]{.underline} during
World War II, mostly through deliberate campaigns against enemy cities.
No wonder Gen. Curtis LeMay, who directed the bombing campaign against
Japan, told an aide, \"[[If the U.S. lost]{.underline}]{.mark} the war,
[[we would be]{.mark} **prosecuted as [war
criminals]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" The United States [dropped more than
6 million tons of bombs during]{.underline} the [Indochina
war]{.underline}, including tons of [napalm and lethal
defoliants]{.underline} like Agent Orange, and it is [directly
responsible for]{.underline} the [deaths of]{.underline} many of the
roughly [1 million civilians]{.underline} who died in that war.

More recently, the U.S.-backed [Contra war in [Nicaragua]{.mark}
killed]{.underline} some [30,000 Nicaraguans]{.underline}, a percentage
of their population equivalent to 2 million dead Americans. U.S.
military action has led directly or indirectly to the deaths of [250,000
[Muslims]{.mark} over the past three decades]{.underline} (and that's a
low-end estimate, not counting the deaths resulting from the sanctions
against Iraq in the 1990s), including the more than 100,000 people who
died following the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003.
[U.S.]{.underline} drones and Special [Forces]{.underline} are [going
after **suspected terrorists**]{.underline} in at least five countries
at present and have [[killed]{.underline}]{.mark} an unknown number of
[[innocent civilians]{.underline}]{.mark} in the process. Some of these
actions may have been necessary to make Americans more prosperous and
secure. But while Americans would undoubtedly regard such acts as
indefensible if some foreign country were doing them to us, hardly any
U.S. politicians have questioned these policies. Instead, Americans
still wonder, \"Why do they hate us?\"

The [United States]{.underline} talks a good game on human rights and
international law, but it has [refused to sign]{.underline} most [human
rights treaties]{.underline}, [is not a party to the International
Criminal Court]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} has been all too willing
to [cozy up to dictators]{.underline} --- remember our friend Hosni
Mubarak? --- [with **abysmal** human rights records]{.underline}. If
that were not enough, the abuses at [[Abu Ghraib]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the George W. Bush administration's reliance on
[[waterboarding]{.underline}]{.mark}, extraordinary rendition, and
[[preventive detention]{.underline}]{.mark} should shake America's
belief that it consistently acts in a morally superior fashion. Obama's
decision to retain many of these policies suggests they were not a
temporary aberration.

The United States never conquered a vast overseas empire or caused
millions to die through tyrannical blunders like China's Great Leap
Forward or Stalin's forced collectivization. And given the vast power at
its disposal for much of the past century, Washington could certainly
have done much worse. But the record is clear: U.S. leaders have done
what they thought they had to do when confronted by external dangers,
and they paid scant attention to moral principles along the way. [[The
idea]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} **uniquely [virtuous]{.mark}** [may be
**comforting**]{.mark} **to Americans**]{.underline}; [[too bad it's not
true]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Myth 3

America's Success Is Due to Its Special Genius.

The United States has enjoyed remarkable success, and Americans tend to
portray their rise to world power as a direct result of the political
foresight of the Founding Fathers, the virtues of the U.S. Constitution,
the priority placed on individual liberty, and the creativity and hard
work of the American people. In this narrative, the United States enjoys
an exceptional global position today because it is, well, exceptional.

There is more than a grain of truth to this version of American history.
It's not an accident that immigrants came to America in droves in search
of economic opportunity, and the \"melting pot\" myth facilitated the
assimilation of each wave of new Americans. America's scientific and
technological achievements are fully deserving of praise and owe
something to the openness and vitality of the American political order.

But America's past success is due as much to good luck as to any
uniquely American virtues. The new nation was lucky that the continent
was lavishly endowed with natural resources and traversed by navigable
rivers. It was lucky to have been founded far from the other great
powers and even luckier that the native population was less advanced and
highly susceptible to European diseases. Americans were fortunate that
the European great powers were at war for much of the republic's early
history, which greatly facilitated its expansion across the continent,
and its global primacy was ensured after the other great powers fought
two devastating world wars. This account of America's rise does not deny
that the United States did many things right, but it also acknowledges
that America's present position owes as much to good fortune as to any
special genius or \"manifest destiny.\"

**[Myth 4]{.underline}**

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates Is Responsible for **Most
of the Good** in the World]{.underline}.

[Americans]{.underline} are [**fond of [giv]{.mark}ing themselves**
[credit for positive]{.mark} international
[developments]{.mark}]{.underline}. President Bill Clinton believed the
United States was \"[[indispensable to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[forging]{.underline}]{.mark} of **[stable [political
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" and the late Harvard University
political scientist Samuel P. Huntington [[thought **U.S.
primacy**]{.mark} was central]{.underline} \"[to]{.underline} the future
of [freedom]{.underline}, [democracy]{.underline}, [open
economies]{.underline}, [and international order in the
world]{.underline}.\" Journalist Michael Hirsh has gone even further,
writing in his book At War With Ourselves that America's global role is
\"[[the **greatest gift** the world]{.mark} has [received
in]{.mark}]{.underline} many, many centuries, possibly [all of
**recorded [history]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Scholarly works such as
Tony Smith's America's Mission and G. John Ikenberry's Liberal Leviathan
emphasize America's contribution to the spread of democracy and its
promotion of a supposedly liberal world order. Given all the high-fives
American leaders have given themselves, it is hardly surprising that
most [Americans see their country as]{.underline} an [**overwhelmingly
positive force** in world affairs]{.underline}.

Once again, there is something to this line of argument, just not enough
to make it entirely accurate. The United States has made undeniable
contributions to peace and stability in the world over the past century,
including the Marshall Plan, the creation and management of the Bretton
Woods system, its rhetorical support for the core principles of
democracy and human rights, and its mostly stabilizing military presence
in Europe and the Far East. But the belief that all good things flow
from Washington's wisdom overstates the U.S. contribution by a wide
margin.

For starters, though Americans watching Saving Private Ryan or Patton
may conclude that the United States played the central role in
vanquishing Nazi Germany, most of the fighting was in Eastern Europe and
the main burden of defeating Hitler's war machine was borne by the
Soviet Union. Similarly, though the Marshall Plan and NATO played
important roles in Europe's post-World War II success, Europeans deserve
at least as much credit for rebuilding their economies, constructing a
novel economic and political union, and moving beyond four centuries of
sometimes bitter rivalry. Americans also tend to think they won the Cold
War all by themselves, a view that ignores the contributions of other
anti-Soviet adversaries and the courageous dissidents whose resistance
to communist rule produced the \"velvet revolutions\" of 1989.

Moreover, as Godfrey Hodgson recently noted in his sympathetic but
clear-eyed book, The Myth of American Exceptionalism, the spread of
liberal ideals is a global phenomenon with roots in the Enlightenment,
and European philosophers and political leaders did much to advance the
democratic ideal. Similarly, the abolition of slavery and the long
effort to improve the status of women owe more to Britain and other
democracies than to the United States, where progress in both areas
trailed many other countries. Nor can the United States claim a global
leadership role today on gay rights, criminal justice, or economic
equality --- Europe's got those areas covered.

Finally, [[any **honest accounting**]{.mark} of the past
half-century]{.underline} must [[acknowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[downside of American primacy]{.underline}. The [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} has been the [[major producer of
**g**]{.mark}reen**[h]{.mark}**ouse
**[g]{.mark}**ase**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} for most of the last
hundred years and thus a principal cause of the adverse changes that are
altering the global environment. The United States [[stood on the wrong
side]{.mark} of the]{.underline} long [struggle]{.underline} against
apartheid [[in]{.mark} South [Africa]{.mark} and [backed]{.mark} plenty
of **unsavory [dictatorships]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- including Saddam
[Hussein's]{.underline} --- [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} short-term
[**strategic [interests]{.mark}** [dictated]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Americans may be justly proud of their role in creating and defending
Israel and in combating global anti-Semitism, but its one-sided policies
have also prolonged Palestinian statelessness and sustained Israel's
brutal occupation.

Bottom line: [[Americans take too much credit]{.mark} for]{.underline}
global [progress [and accept too little blame]{.mark} for areas where
[U.S.]{.mark} policy has **in fact been
[counterproductive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Americans]{.underline} are
blind \[[[deceived]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[to]{.mark} their weak
spots]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in ways [that have **real-world
[consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Remember when [[Pentagon
planners]{.underline} [thought]{.underline}]{.mark} [U.S.]{.underline}
troops [would be greeted]{.underline} in Baghdad [with [**flowers** and
**parades**]{.mark}]{.underline}? [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly
[[got **RPGs** and **IEDs** instead]{.underline}]{.mark}.

First, [the views of American political leaders]{.underline} from
Alexander Hamilton to George W. Bush fit [within a]{.underline}
**[discursive history]{.underline}** [of the United States, which lies
at the]{.underline} **[ideological core of American
Exceptionalism]{.underline}**. [American Exceptionalism]{.underline}
does not consist of one unified body of thought; it spans many different
academic disciplines and [has been used by various scholars to explain
everything from the **uniqueness of American political thought** to the
peculiar motivations behind US foreign policy.]{.underline} But
**[scholars in]{.underline}** the fields of US History, European
History, Ameri- can Studies, American Politics and Public Policy, and
**[IR]{.underline}** (specifically diplomatic history) [accord
with]{.underline} what Adas (2001) identifies as [the \"essence\" of
American Exceptionalism: an unwavering belief in the uniqueness of the
United States and a commitment to a providential mission to transform
the rest of the world in the image of the United States]{.underline}
(Hietala 1985; Lipset 1996; McEvoy-Levy 2001; Streeby 2001; Glaser and
Wellenreuther 2002; Henry 2003; Ignatieff 2005). As Anatol Lieven notes,
[\"anyone\" can be American, but \"America\" is simultaneously
unattainable]{.underline}. Thus, [one can adopt the allegedly unique
qualities, including liberty, **constitutionalism**, **law**,
**democracy**, individualism]{.underline}, and separation of church and
state that are ostensibly defined and possessed by Americans, [but
\"America\" must also be bounded and protected from encroachment,
danger, and oppositional values that could destroy its **Anglo-Saxon
core**]{.underline} (Lieven 2005). [The United States, on account of its
special values, has a superiority that is \"self- evident\" and beyond
reproach; at the same time, the United States is divinely ordained to
serve as the only political, cultural, and economic model for the rest
of the world.]{.underline} [A]{.underline} **[critical genealogy of
Exceptionalism]{.underline}**, provided below, **[reveals the interplay
of]{.underline}** the providential mission, **[justification for
expansionism]{.underline}** [based on the superiority of American values
and the inability of others to govern themselves, and a **racial
hierarchy** with Anglo-Saxons on top]{.underline} (McDougall 1997; Hoff
2007). As noted in the Introduction, herein is our claim that [American
Exceptionalism provides a specific context to the Orientalist ideology
in the \"making\" of America.]{.underline} All nations have a \"myth\"
of origin, but there is a particular ambivalence that haunts the idea of
the nation\... it is an ambivalence that emerges from a growing
awareness that, despite the certainty with which his- torians speak of
the \"origin\" of nation as a sign of the \"modernity\" of society, the
cultural temporality of the nation inscribes a much more transitional
social reality. (Bhabha 1990:1) Thus, [the nation\'s \"coming into
being\" taps into and relies upon particular narratives that must be
constantly and creatively naturalized. The \"we-ness\" of the nation is
predicated upon the Other against which the \"we\" is constituted.
American Exceptionalism is a **foundational fiction** of \"America\'s\"
**coming into being**, involving a \"disavowal, displacement, exclusion,
and cultural contesta- tion\" in the colonial encounters **between
America and its Others**]{.underline} (whether indig- enous Americans,
Filipinos, Latinos, Arabs, African slaves, etc.) (Bhabha 1990:5). But,
and as American political thought demonstrates, this myth of origin is
also decidedly about a distinction from European (particularly British)
nation- states. A few critical IR scholars have examined the issue of
Exceptionalism, thus providing a point of departure to integrate studies
of Othering, nationalism, and imperialism, with studies of how [the
American nation distinguished itself from Europe in order to surpass
it]{.underline} (Campbell 1998b; Cox 2005). Campbell points out the
irony of the American revolutionaries\' insistence that they were not
like the Europeans, given the fundamental assumption that \"they
possessed the qualities of European civilization in contrast to the
barbarity of the Indian way of life\" (Campbell 1998b:123). Thus,
[\"America\" came into being with an ever present fragility; how could
the United States establish itself as more humane and more successfully
liberal than Europe yet subdue and conquer Amerindians and even- tually
others in the name of Western civilization?]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} **[anxious desire]{.underline}** [to be both a
beneficiary]{.underline} of centuries [of Western civilization but to
set a separate, unique course in the world has continued]{.underline}
since the American Revol the endurance of the need of the United States,
even recent administration, [to]{.underline} continuously [assert
Exceptionalism]{.underline} and Orientalism. Accordingly, the second
reason for understanding Excepti talism is in order to make sense of the
differences and distinctions between the United States and Europe
pointed out by political leaders and scholars. In effect, if critical IR
scholars are more attentive to Exceptionalism, they will find that, the
similarities to Orientalism notwithstanding, there are key insights
about the relationship between the United States and Europe that are
worth exploring. This is particularly important given that mainstream
analysis of Exceptionalism is committed to a particular political agenda
that ultimately supports American hegemony or, at least, fails to be
sufficiently critical of pre-9/1 1 American bellig- erence or post-9/1 1
American military actions. For instance, **[Kagan]{.underline}** (2003)
[argues that the United States must forge ahead with its own course;
with Europe moving toward the changes the European Union engenders, the
United States is the only country to provide the military force, order,
and stability the world needs]{.underline}. As Kagan warns, \"\[i\]t is
time to stop pretending that Europeans and Americans share a common view
of the world, or even that they occupy the same world\" (3). And,
Charles Kupchan notes: \"\[t\]he next clash of civilizations will not be
between the West and the rest but between the United States and Europe -
and Americans remain largely oblivi- ous.\" (Kupchan 2002). Kupchan
predicts an intense transatlantic rivalry between the US Federal Reserve
and the European Central Bank over the control of the international
monetary system, sturdy competition in terms of internet communi-
cations technological advances, corporate international acquisitions and
invest- ments, and the strength of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar, as
well as [tension over EU plans for increasing military capabilities to
support European security]{.underline}, which [would **challenge NATO\'s
relevance** and create competition for diplomatic influence]{.underline}
in the Middle East. **[Mainstream IR]{.underline}**
[scholars]{.underline} and commentators have [attempted to wrap their
minds around the so-called \"crisis\" of the transatlantic
divide]{.underline} (Reid 2004; McCormick 2005). Are Europe and the
United States strong allies in counter- terrorism intelligence, or do
European countries and publics really view, as per sporadic polls, the
United States as the biggest threat to world peace (Guitta 2006)? Are
European attitudes toward the United States still open and friendly or
increasingly punctuated with ambivalence, apprehension, and even
hostility, particularly regarding the US claims to \"promote democracy\"
(Kopstein 2006)? Has US hegemony reached its limit in the face of the
way the European Union has stitched together various nation states to
marshal collective and unified strength, to respond adequately to the
new digital age, and to carefully address thorny issues of trade
integration and collective security? (Kupchan 2003). Do Europe and the
United States still need or even want to be a part of the same
collective security agreement, given European resentment of its heavy
reli- ance on the United States during the intervention in Kosovo,
divisiveness as to how to address terrorism after 9/11, Europe\'s
resistance to the US desire to pro- vide military aid to Turkey on the
eve of the invasion of Iraq, and European criti- cism over the US wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan (Croci and Verdun 2006)? Or, are the fears that
\"developing\" countries are sponsoring Islamic fundamental- ism,
proliferating nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons for their
security, or offering fierce economic competition substantial enough to
warrant continued yet apprehensive transatlantic cooperation? [While
Europeans are said to view international law as a primary tool of
diplomacy, the United States has defended its sovereign right to put
forth a national security strategy without consulting with
others.]{.underline} The 2005 EU Counterterrorism Strategy focused on
political responses inclusive of prevention, understanding, and justice;
the White House 2003 National Strategy for Combating Terrorism
emphasized defeat of the enemy and an offensive militaristic approach.
Some scholars even make distinctions between \"old terrorism\" in
Europe, or political violence exercising some measure of restraint with
clear political goals, versus the \"new\" terrorism the United States
primarily faces by unseen enemies who are decentralized and without
clear political goals (Stevenson 2003). Inter- estingly, Judt (2005:11)
discusses Europe\'s direct experience of the \"worst\" - civil war,
genocide, anarchy, whereas the United States supposedly had \"no direct
experience of the worst of the twentieth century-and is thus regrettably
immune to its lessons.\" George W. Bush noted soon after 9/11: On
September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against
our country. Americans have known wars - but for the past 136 years,
they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941.
Americans have known the casualties of war - but not at the center of a
great city on a peaceful morn- ing. Americans have known surprise
attacks - but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was
brought upon us in a single day - and night fell on a different world, a
world where freedom itself is under attack. (Bush 2001) These
**[contemporary tensions]{.underline}** and questions **[should be
understood in the context of American Exceptionalism]{.underline}**,
[which reveals a long-standing ambivalence by the United
States]{.underline} about Europe. Orientalism does not make these
distinctions between Western countries, and we implore critical IR to
think through the implications of the aforementioned questions. We argue
that [the tension within the so-called Atlantic Alliance]{.underline} is
not simply about changes rendered by globaliza- tion or by the Bush
Doctrine, or even a potential rethinking about transatlantic values, as
mainstream scholars might maintain. Rather, it [is indicative of how and
why Western powers differ in the way they perform
sovereignty]{.underline}. A critical analysis of the clashes would bring
to light how European power is not necessar- ily \"better\" than or more
inclusive than American hegemony but is perhaps tak- ing advantage of
the backlash against American Exceptionalism in its most recent form.
This brings us to the next point. Our third reason for examining
Exceptionalism in tandem with Orientalism is to understand the different
logics at work in US foreign policy and the cre- ation of its identity.
If identity is fundamentally understood through other identities, who
are the \"others\" and what kinds of others are there? As Diez (2004:4)
notes in the context of understanding whether the European Union offers
a different type of identity formation in international politics, there
are different kinds of difference with different kinds of purposes and
implica- tions.

status]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- or what the Indian historian Dipesh
Chakrabarty has called "[[the **imaginary waiting room**]{.mark} of
history]{.underline}."

The proximate birth of the international civil society we are familiar
with today should probably be situated in the period at the closing of
World War I when the Treaty of Versailles was signed, eventually leading
to the formation of the League of Nations amid much high-flying
rhetoric.

The League of Nations failed for many reasons, not least that the United
States, an early proponent of a new system of international governance,
never joined the organization. Much less famous though are the many ways
that the progressive-sounding diplomacy begun at Versailles failed a
vast majority of the world's people by not making their interests a
priority --- or even taking them into consideration. China's nationalist
government, to take one example, was surprised to learn that as a result
of a kind of horse-trading at the organization's high table among
Britain, France, and Italy, the league granted legitimacy to Japan's
takeover of its territories that had been controlled by Germany before
World War I. As a result, China refused to sign the treaty.

Japan, for its part, was disgusted by the league's failure to address
notions of [[racial hierarchy]{.underline}]{.mark} then [**so
[dear]{.mark}** [to the West]{.mark}]{.underline}. As scholar G. John
Ikenberry noted in his recent book, A World Safe for Democracy:
[[Liberal Internationalism]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Crises of Global
Order, former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson
"[[projected]{.underline}]{.mark} a [vision of **[universalism]{.mark}**
in rights and values]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} **quickly
[compromised]{.mark}** [when]{.mark} it was
[expedient]{.mark}]{.underline}." [When]{.underline} the [Japanese put
forward]{.underline} a [resolution affirming [equality among]{.mark}
nations]{.underline} with no distinctions [based on [**race** or
**nationality**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Washington backed
down]{.underline}]{.mark} in deference to Britain, [which saw an
idea]{.underline} like this as [[a threat to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[legitimacy of its **settler**]{.mark} **colony
[project]{.mark}**]{.underline} then underway [in
Australia]{.underline}. This may have been the operative rationale in
this diplomacy, but it should also not be forgotten that the United
States at the time was itself a country that practiced [[**legally
enforced** white supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark} and separatism. Wilson,
himself, [praised the Ku Klux Klan and oversaw]{.underline} the
[segregation]{.underline} of the federal work force.

China and Japan both had obvious reasons to feel disserved by the era's
international diplomacy, but as bad as they were, the humiliations they
suffered were of a categorically smaller nature than the insults
delivered to a large host of then-still-colonized lands. The [League of
Nations gave **powerful [endorse]{.mark}ments** to Western
[imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [granting European
countries]{.underline} the [authority to extend]{.underline} their
[control over **broad stretches** of territory under the guise
of]{.underline} the league's so-called [mandates]{.underline}.

The continent of [Africa]{.underline} was **[especially
targeted]{.underline}** by these arrangements. African colonies had just
[supplied]{.underline} hundreds of [thousands of troops and invaluable
economic support to]{.underline} their [European masters]{.underline}
during World War I, and returning African veterans clamored for
independence. In response, [European]{.underline} powers
[[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Africans]{.underline}]{.mark} had
[[not]{.mark} yet [reached]{.mark} a [**level of civilization**
required]{.mark} to]{.underline} even begin [contemplating
self-rule]{.underline}. The irony was lost on the Europeans that they
themselves had just emerged from what was arguably the most barbarous
war in history.

This was not the end of the insults though. To impose their authority on
the few independent African states, the league --- at European direction
--- [challenged self-rule in **Liberia** and **Ethiopia**]{.underline},
[claiming]{.underline} a [humanitarian obligation to do so]{.underline}
[because of alleged enslavement]{.underline} in those states. As
political scientist Adom Getachew wrote in her recent book, Worldmaking
After Empire: The Rise and Fall of Self-Determination, "That the charge
of slavery became [the [**idiom** through which black
self-government]{.mark}]{.underline} would be
[[undermined]{.underline}]{.mark} should strike us as deeply perverse
not only because of Europe's central role in the trans-atlantic slave
trade and slavery in the Americas but also because of the labor
practices that characterized colonial Africa in the twentieth century."
Yet at the time, and for decades to come, [[European
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} brutally imposed [[forced labor]{.mark} on
their African colonies [to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} high
[[production]{.underline}]{.mark} rates [[of **coveted**]{.mark} **raw
[materials]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as [rubber and
cotton]{.underline}.

The next big opportunity for a Western-led international community to
introduce more democracy and equity in global governance came after the
next world war. Similar lofty rhetoric ensued, as did similar
compromises at the expense of the world's colonized people. After even
greater sacrifices --- measured in the lives of colonial soldiers
fighting in European wars --- and greater extractions of wealth were
made to keep the economies of the imperial powers afloat, expectations
were even higher this time, especially among Africans, that great powers
would willingly pave the way for their independence.

Amid new rounds of high-flying progressive rhetoric about freedom,
accountability, and timetables for self-rule, the discussions that
produced the [[Atlantic Charter]{.underline}]{.mark} fueled this
optimism. But as much as Wilson had done with regard to Japanese
expectations of an enshrined equality among nations, former U.S.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was principally concerned with the
emerging great-power rivalry against the Soviet Union, bowed to the
interests of Great Britain and other European imperialist nations in
[deferring]{.underline} talk of [universal self-government and
independence]{.underline}. As Harvard University professor Caroline
Elkins points out in her new work, Legacy of Violence: A History of the
British Empire, [Roosevelt]{.underline} wasted no time in the aftermath
of the charter, [saying]{.underline} that the [[promises]{.mark} made
to]{.underline} the [colonized [were aspirational]{.mark}]{.underline},
[merely]{.underline} "[[pronouncements]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[that
would **have to wait**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A [sense of the spirit in the halls of [Western]{.mark}
power]{.underline} in this moment [when]{.underline} a [new [global
order]{.mark}]{.underline} was being [[designed]{.underline}]{.mark} can
be [felt through]{.underline} the [words]{.underline} of one [of its
most important architects]{.underline}: economist John Maynard Keynes.
As delegates from 44 nations gathered in New Hampshire to design a new
international monetary system, Keynes bemoaned the presence of
representatives from what would soon become known as the third world. As
historian Vijay Prashad notes in his book [[The Darker
Nations]{.underline}]{.mark}: A People's History of the Third World,
Keynes [[denounced]{.underline}]{.mark} the composition of the delegates
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} "the **[most [monstrous
monkey-house]{.mark}]{.underline}** assembled for years" [[and
said]{.underline}]{.mark} the [representatives of the [poorer]{.mark}
and weaker [nations]{.mark}]{.underline} "[**clearly [have
nothing]{.mark}** [to contribute and will **merely encumber** the
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Within a few years, the two-track nature of the world being built would
become fully evident. The United States famously devoted billions of
dollars to rebuilding European economies after the devastation of World
War II. Left unaddressed though --- both at the time and indeed ever
since --- was the West's unacknowledged obligations toward the world's
newly decolonized countries. As I have argued in my own book, Born in
Blackness: Africa, Africans, and the Making of the Modern World, 1471 to
the Second World War, the extraction of wealth and labor from Africa
alone over a period of centuries played a central yet still largely
unacknowledged role in European prosperity in the modern age.

Indeed, the [[pillaging of Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} of human beings
[[created]{.underline}]{.mark} what we call "**[[the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Although few stop to define it these days,
this of course means the condominium between Atlantic-facing Europe and
that continent's colonies and, later, allies in the Americas. As I have
written, until the year 1820, four times as many people were brought to
the New World from Africa than from Europe, and it was the labor of
these enslaved millions of people --- producing commodities like sugar
and cotton on a vast scale, clearing lands, and performing all kinds of
other unpaid labor --- that made the American colonies profitable for
Europe and made the so-called Old World new and rich.

This may feel like ancient history to some, but the [**[subordination
of]{.mark} justice** for [the colonized]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
especially for peoples and lands subjected to slavery --- is of a piece
with every other chapter of history discussed here, and this topic
[[won't **magically go away** because people wish to **ignore
it**]{.mark} or find it intractable or bothersome]{.underline}.

In fact, the [current [structure]{.mark}]{.underline} of the United
Nations, [whose impotence in the face of]{.underline} a moral horror
like [Ukraine]{.underline} some bemoan today, [[is lodged
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**special rights** of a **select
few**]{.mark}]{.underline} through the U.N. Security Council. This
arrangement is little different from the arguments in the Wilsonian era
that the colonized were inadequately civilized to be granted full
rights.

The U.N. Security Council was democratized to some extent by China's
entry as a permanent member in 1971. Other than China though, whose size
made it difficult to deny, the U.N. Security Council is composed of
predominantly white nations whose history is bound up in imperial rule.
The United States is the only one with a very large population,
currently third in the world. Russia, whose economy is roughly the size
of Italy's, will soon drop out of the top 10 most populous countries.
France and Britain trail far behind. Where is India? Where is Africa,
whose Nigeria is projected to have more citizens than the United States
by the middle of this century and will likely trail only India and China
by 2100. Where is Brazil or Mexico or Indonesia?

In his book The World That FDR Built: Vision and Reality, historian
Edward Mortimer wrote, "[A [world war is]{.mark} like [a
furnace]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it [melts the world]{.mark}]{.underline}
down [[and makes it malleable]{.underline}]{.mark}," leading to major
changes in the subsequent order. Many people have begun to speak of the
invasion of [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in these terms --- as [a
[portal to a new]{.mark}]{.underline}, if as-yet undefined, [[global
order]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Few]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [have
[begun to address]{.mark}]{.underline} with any seriousness of purpose
or urgency [[the]{.mark} **unfinished business** of the major
[re-orderings]{.mark} of the 20th century]{.underline}, [[which
left]{.mark} the [people of the third world **completely out** of the
picture]{.mark}]{.underline}. Can this be justified on the basis of
civilization or race? Or is it a matter of raw wealth or sheer power in
which might is allowed to make right?

Putting morality aside, [[few]{.mark} of the **big
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} facing human life [in this century [are
amenable to being managed]{.mark}]{.underline} well [[on the basis of
**exclusion**]{.mark} **on a scale like this**]{.underline} --- [[not
prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark},
not global [[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}, not
[[migration]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[not]{.mark} **even [war and
peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

American Orientalism: The Discourse on \"The West and the Rest\"

Edward Said (1979) shatters the taken-for-granted status of colonial and
post colonial knowledge about the developing world with his analysis of
Orientalis As he notes, European intellectual, artistic, archeological,
and literary examin tions of - and claims about - the bodies and borders
conquered and mapp justified the necessity and endurance of colonial
European empires. Furth there is an internal consistency of the
Orientalist discourse, despite any lack correspondence with a \'\'real\"
Orient, in order to confer an objective and inno cent status to the
knowledge production that both prompted and rationalized the brutality
of imperialism (Said 1979:5-7). However, this does not mean tha
Orientalism is just a play of meanings and ideas, for, as constructivist
IR scho argue, **[the more we act toward an entity as if it has a
particular representation meaning, the more that entity can take on that
representation]{.underline}** (Wendt 19 Doty 1996). For example, [the
more European colonialists perceived colonial territories as incapable
of self-governing, the more Europeans treated the territories as in need
of governing]{.underline}. Indeed, [Orientalism is a \"Western style for
dominating, restructuring, and having authority over the
Orient\"]{.underline} (Said 1979 [acting \"dynamically along with brute
political, economic, and military rationales\"]{.underline} (Said
1979:12). Said (1979:12) also claims that [Orientalism has much less to
do with the \"Orient\" and much more to do with the making of \"our\"
world. Knowledge claims about the Other (the Orient/the East) actually
**cement way the Self** (Europe/the West) **sees and constructs
itself**.]{.underline} [The \"Orient\" - a mysterious, erotic, dark,
dangerous mass of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Arab, So Asian, East Asian
natives - is a deep and **recurring image** in **Western identity
making**]{.underline}. The impact of Said\'s work, particularly
Orientalism, on critical IR is threefold. First, it creates space for
critical IR scholars to examine representational prac- tices and
international hierarchy in international politics, in dialogue with
schol- ars in other fields, such as literary criticism, anthropology,
postcolonial thought, feminist studies, political geography, and others.
Said\'s contrapuntal analyses of culture, colonial discourses,
nationalism, power, and representational practices in his body of work
opens the way to explore the nuances, contradictions, and shifting and
hybrid contexts of Othering (Chowdhry 2007). [The Other is that through
which the subject is represented as **privileged and superior**, with
the Other being devalued, feared, reviled, even desired, in some way.
The Other stands as a potential disruption of the Self, but at the same
time]{.underline}, as critical IR theorist Campbell (1998b) points out,
[the Self cannot fully contain or \"resolve\" the **anxiety over** the
**difference** from or the encounter with the Other; **without the
production of this anxiety**, insecurity, and danger, statecraft and
**nation- making would have nothing against which to assert
themselves**]{.underline}. Indeed, [for the West, the encounters of
**slavery**, **colonialism**, and **genocide** have to be represented as
trysts with danger, backwardness, and ever-threatening barbarism -
anything but illegitimate violence - in order to **naturalize Western
superiority**]{.underline}. Second, the various debates about Said\'s
work have inspired and fortified cri- tiques of rationalist methodology
of mainstream IR scholars and of how their [**ontological presumptions**
about and methodological studies of the \"West\" and the \"rest\"
obscure more than they explain]{.underline} (Allain 2004; Chowdhry
2007). Third, the American variant of Orientalism allows for an analysis
of the discursive deployments in which (1) the United States assumes and
relie ical distinction between the United States and Others (Weldes
ter-Montpetit 2007); (2) [the United States employs authoritative claims
and representations about Others\' bodies, habits, be political
sensibilities, thereby justifying interventions, sanction within,
across, and outside of its borders]{.underline} (Persaud 2002); and (3)
[US foreign policy relies on a rationalist methodology consisting of
finding "evidence", such as reports and fact-finding missions, of
foregone conclusions about the Other the United States need to assert
its position]{.underline} (Tetreault 2006).

"NATO is not an organization, a force, or an alliance system that can be
defeated militarily." We have been stating this since the Russian armies
entered Ukraine.

[The world's plunge into **ever increasing darkness** and the fact that
the international working class movement has for a long time been **in
retreat** undoubtedly leads people to despair and the tendency to fall
for the first "remedy" they come across]{.underline}.

However [[the **surrender**]{.mark} [of societies to]{.mark}
**[primitive motives]{.mark}** [of defense]{.mark} or survival often
[leads to]{.mark} **[great disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Today the [[humanity is]{.underline}]{.mark} divided between those who
are [[waiting for the]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[civilized
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[to deliver a salvation from]{.mark}
the]{.underline} "**[[Russian barbarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and
those who hope that Russia under the leadership of the brave and clever
Putin will put an end to the US and NATO aggression and this is a bigger
problem than one might think.

This division is spread almost equally among all strata of the people
across all continents, in other words, [[the **working people**]{.mark}
and the **poor** [are attached to]{.mark} the **[recipes of
salvation]{.mark}** [that have **nothing in common**]{.mark} [with their
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

An abstract opposition to war has never prevented wars, but we have to
say that [the division]{.underline} we have pointed out [is [paving the
way for]{.mark} war, even a comprehensive]{.underline} **[[imperialist
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or let's just call it what it is, [[a **new
world war**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Some of those who took to the streets saying "No to War" today demand
that NATO take more effective steps against Russia. However, the Western
imperialist countries are already just one step away from an extensive
war effort.

Those who have been watching the events of the last few days unfold with
the mind-numbing glasses of the "division" I mentioned earlier may not
be aware of it, but [NATO is organizing an **incredibly intense**
attack, perhaps with a **psychological superiority**]{.underline} [it
has never had since its establishment]{.underline}.

[**German militarism**, which had been kept in check]{.underline} to a
certain extent by the Soviet Union and which began to recover rapidly
with the collapse of the USSR, [completely abandoned its
meticulous]{.underline} and "cowardly" [way of acting that it had for
decades. Many **US companies**, which have fattened up in the climate of
war, started the week with cries of joy]{.underline}. The Polish ruling
class, driven by a historical determination to serve NATO, have gained
more this past week than in the last 30 years. Even the Ukrainian
administration under the control of a fascist gang sees in itself the
right to act as the representative of the oppressed.

[The "**European project**]{.underline}", [which had lost credibility in
the eyes of the broad masses due to the economic crisis, the terrible
handling of the corona pandemic at the hands of the incapable
politicians, suddenly **regained credibility**]{.underline}.

[[Europe is the]{.mark} **home[land]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[class
struggles]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [the **ideological** and **political
balances** of the **world** are determined there]{.underline}. Pointing
out the importance of this geography, where the two world wars broke
out, does not mean surrendering to a European-centric point of view. On
the contrary, [it indicates the need for a period of
**struggles**]{.underline} [that will **radically change**]{.underline}
[the current status quo in Europe]{.underline}. Our side in this
struggle is the workers of the continent.

[The working masses in Europe]{.underline}, including Turkey, [have an
**obligation** to wage a more **effective struggle** against **NATO
aggression**, which is getting more **intense**]{.underline}.

As some people think, this obligation cannot be fulfilled as taking one
of the sides in that "division". NATO aggression cannot be repelled
either, by attributing a special intellect and depth to the Putin
leadership, which is looking for ways to defend the interests of
capitalist Russia. In any case, at no point in today's world order can
rational thought prevail. As [assessing US imperialism by looking at
Biden's pathetic image means assessing only a **part** of the
reality]{.underline}, assigning great meanings to Putin's strong leader
image would equally take us down the path of grave mistakes.

Today, [the [peoples]{.mark} of the world [cannot have an]{.mark}
"**[active]{.mark}**" [role in]{.mark} a [NATO versus Russia]{.mark}
polarization]{.underline}. It is of course absurd to equalize the sides
in this confrontation; despite all their internal contradictions, [[the
US, NATO]{.mark} and the European Union bloc [are the **primary
threat**]{.mark} [to humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the critically
important point is that almost all of [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark},
including Turkey, [[is under the **yoke**]{.mark} [of a pro-NATO **class
domination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It is necessary to determine priorities based on the conditions in each
country. Contrary to the claims of the NATO supporters who have now
started to make a lot of noise in Turkey, [it is the **US imperialism**
and NATO that threaten our people]{.underline}.

Against NATO aggression, which will become more critical in Turkey's
domestic and foreign policy with the latest moves, the only effective
and legitimate struggle is one that is waged on a class basis.

[[It would be a **historical defeat**]{.mark} for the workers of the
world [to line up behind]{.mark} the **struggle for [hegemony]{.mark}**,
which is [obscured by]{.mark} **[great power
chauvinism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[lies]{.underline}**,
**[occupation]{.underline}** [and which divides the capitalists into the
powerful and the downtrodden]{.underline}.

[Communists come from a tradition that **opposes** race- and
nation-based conflicts, and that stands for **class-based
conflicts**]{.underline}. This tradition has hitherto used the truth,
sense of justice and righteousness as its most important weapons;
adopted the sovereignty and independence of countries and opposition to
changing of borders by brute force as the most important principles of
the struggle against imperialism.

Today, in the face of increasing NATO aggression, only by acting on this
basis can we make the masses support the demand for Turkey's immediate
exit from NATO.

[[**US imperialism** and **NATO** cannot be defeated]{.mark} by a
confrontation [where peoples are]{.mark} **held down** as they **[line
up]{.mark}** [behind their own **ruling class**]{.mark}, or
[where]{.mark} **[deep social inequalities]{.mark}** in individual
countries [are lost in the]{.mark} **[primitive language]{.mark}** [of
geostrategy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Let's not forget that Yanukovych government, which was overthrown by the
Maydan Incidents of 2014 and fled to Russia [after the last]{.underline}
"[color revolution]{.underline}" [that made Ukraine a **fanatical
militant**]{.underline} [of US imperialism and NATO, with its policies
that **impoverished** the people, with its rotten structure that was
deep in **corruption**]{.underline}, deserved to be overthrown long time
ago not by the neo-Nazis or pro-Europe fascists but by a revolutionary
working class movement.

The ominous "color revolutions" that shaped Ukraine ten years apart are
the result of the division of people on the basis of being pro-Russia or
pro-Western. In Ukraine and Russia, however, the population is divided
into exploiters and exploited, as in the United States, Poland, Turkey,
and elsewhere.

[The day is the day to [push for]{.mark}ward [the]{.mark} **[organized
power]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark} **[working people]{.mark}** [against
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and the NATO members. [[This is the]{.mark}
**only [force]{.mark}** [against which]{.mark} the most advanced
[weapons]{.mark}, including **nuclear ones**, [will be **rendered
futile**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[There is no difference between **hoping for help** from the struggle
for hegemony in the **capitalist world** and placing hope in
the]{.underline} 6 parties that came together against the AKP
**[government]{.underline}**.

[Both are **projects of destruction** for the people]{.underline}.
[[While there is **still time**]{.mark}, [the people must **rise
up**]{.mark} for the emergence of an organized popular
struggle]{.underline}.

[The war in the Balkans is not about the plight of refugees but is part
of Nato's expansion. It wants to dominate the Balkans and eastern Europe
as well as control the oil rich areas of the Caspian Sea]{.underline}.
John Rees explains why. There are currently over 20 wars raging around
the globe. So why is Nato so concerned with the one in the Balkans? The
plight of the refugees is the stock pro-war answer. Yet there were 15.3
million refugees made homeless by war in 1995 alone. So why does the war
in Kosovo, where US military might alone is 99 percent greater than the
arms spending of the state it is fighting, command the attention of the
world's great powers? The causes of Nato's Balkan War cannot be found in
the Balkans alone. Neither can they be found in the events of the last
few months. The origins of the war are much wider and go back much
further than Serbia's relations with Kosovo. [To see the whole picture
we have to go back to the fundamental fact of European
history]{.underline} in the last decade, the fall of the Stalinist
states in 1989. [The end of these regimes, and German unification soon
after, gave all the institutions of international capitalism an
unrivalled opportunity to expand into central and eastern
Europe]{.underline}. International capital began to "cherry pick" those
sites and markets which were most profitable. Investment quickly
followed, which, though large in comparison to the capitals which made
it, was not large enough to sustain a turnaround in most of the east
European economies. The European Community also talked of eastward
expansion. But, in a Brussels bureaucracy which still regards Greek
membership of the EU as a mistake because the economy is insufficiently
prosperous, the integration of east European states was always more of a
carrot to encourage pro-market reform than an immediate policy goal. [So
it was that the fastest expansion into eastern Europe came from Nato.
"Nato", reports the International Institute for Strategic Studies, "has
confidently extended its collective defence provisions to three new
members of the former Warsaw Pact \... while the EU's enlargement
process remains mired in bickering over fundamental issues such as
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy."]{.underline} Historians of
the 1999 Balkan War will no doubt marvel at the fact that so little
comment has been made about the fact that, in the very month that the
war broke out, [Nato integrated Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary
into the alliance. The southern flank of Nato between Hungary and Greece
is now pierced by the states of the former Yugoslav]{.underline}ia. This
alone gives Nato a considerable strategic interest in controlling the
Balkans. But there is more at stake. The effect of Nato enlargement is
to swing the Iron Curtain to the east. Where once it used to divide
Germany, it now runs down the eastern borders of Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary. It ends at the borders of the former Yugoslavia.
The next three states to be considered for Nato membership are a former
republic of Yugoslavia itself, Slovenia, and Serbia's neighbours,
Romania and Bulgaria. Thus the whole ten year long process of Nato's
eastward push is now caught up with the fate of the Balkans in general
and the former Yugoslav states in particular. [The new Iron Curtain
between western and eastern Europe is not the end of the Balkans'
strategic importance for Nato]{.underline}. If we look along the
southern flank of Nato, through Greece and Turkey, we see how closely
the fate of this region is tied to another crucial area of post Cold War
instablity - [the arc of oil states running up from the traditional
spheres of western interest in Iran and Iraq to the Caspian Sea and the
newly independent states on Russia's southern rim. Just as Nato
expansion into eastern Europe was being celebrated at the alliance's
50th birthday party in Washington a few weeks ago, another pro-Nato
alliance was being constructed]{.underline} in the wings of that summit.
At the Washington meeting Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova
joined with Uzbekistan to form Guuam, a new alliance aimed at
strengthening the member states' economic and political ties with the
west. [Three of these states - Georgia, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan - only
pulled out of the Russian dominated Confederation of Independent States'
collective security pact this spring]{.underline}. Guuam has agreed low
level military cooperation but claims it is not a military alliance
aimed against Russia. But Guuam's formation comes hot on the heels of
the Ukrainian parliament's decision to rescind its previous order to get
rid of nuclear weapons, a direct result of the Balkan War. So it is not
surprising to find Russia's foreign minister asking, "How should we
understand the fact that this new regional organisation has been created
in Washington during a Nato summit?" An answer to this question was
provided by Eduard Shevardnadze, president of Georgia, who said, "When I
met Javier Solana \[Nato secretary-general\], I asked him, 'When will
you finally admit Georgia to Nato?' He whispered in my ear, but I can't
reveal what he told me." In all likelihood what Solana told Shevardnadze
was that Nato won't be signing Georgia up in the very near future. This
is because the main significance of the Guuam area for the western
powers is more economic than military at the moment. Guuam's main task,
according to the Financial Times, "is to develop the area's rich oil and
gas deposits to the exclusion of Russia". To this end, "aligning with
Guuam from the outside are Turkey, Britain and the US - nations that
have proved far more able than Russia to invest in and trade with the
region." There is indeed a rich prize at stake in the Caspian Sea
region. Its proven oil reserves are estimated at between 16 and 32
billion barrels, comparable to the US's reserves of 22 billion barrels
and more than the North Sea's 17 billion barrels. Total reserves could
be as high as 179 to 195 billion barrels, according to the US Energy
Information Administration. These reserves are all a long way from the
Balkans, but the routes by which the oil must come west are not. In
April a new pipeline was opened carrying Caspian Sea oil through
Azerbaijan and Georgia. The oil will continue its journey by tanker
through the Black Sea, the Bosphorus and on past the Turkish and Greek
coast. Other possible western pipeline routes lie through Turkey to the
coast near Cyprus or through the Ukraine, Bulgaria and Greece - which
are, respectively, a Guuam member, an aspiring member of Nato and an
existing Nato member. All these routes give the necessity of security in
the Balkans an additional direct economic importance to add to the
primary strategic concerns which stand behind Nato's war in the Balkans.
As US energy secretary Bill Richardson explained last November, "This is
about America's energy security \... It's also about preventing
strategic inroads by those who don't share our values. We are trying to
move these newly independent countries toward the west. We would like to
see them reliant on western commercial and political interests \...
We've made a substantial political investment in the Caspian and it's
important that both the pipeline map and the politics come out right."
It is the "pipeline map" to which Richardson refers that connects the
Caspian Sea oil reserves to the security of the area between Turkey,
Greece and the other Balkan states. There are, as the International
Herald Tribune points out, "profound economic and geopolitical
consequences" stemming from the decisions about the routes by which the
oil will come west: "Rivalries played out here will have a decisive
impact in shaping the post-Communist world, and in determining how much
influence the United States will have over its development." The
pipeline map [Geographical expansion is not the only way that Nato has
altered in the 1990s. It has now explicitly redefined its "strategic
concepts" so that it is no longer simply a defensive alliance, as it
claimed throughout the Cold War. All the old Cold War Nato practices
remain - including its commitment to "first use" of nuclear weapons if
it deems such use to be necessary. But immediately after the fall of the
Stalinist states in 1991, Nato redefined its aims so that "out of area"
operations became part of a new "strategic concept". At first this was
seen as primarily a "peacekeeping" role]{.underline}. But, reports the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, ["Nato's exclusive
command of the Implementation Force (IFOR) operations in Bosnia
completely changed this view." Thus the collapse of the east European
regimes and Nato's expansionism fuelled its concern with the Balkans;
and its experience in the Balkans fuelled its determination to use
military weight beyond its borders. At the Washington Summit, a Combined
Joint Task Force for rapid force deployment in "areas of crisis" was
grafted onto a revised Nato military structure]{.underline}. [The
results of these decade long trends are enormous. The Cold War structure
which underpinned the nuclear stalemate between the West and the Eastern
bloc has disappeared. This means that "hot wars" are no longer pushed to
the colonial and former colonial periphery of the system in the way that
they were during the Cold War.]{.underline} These [conflicts
continue]{.underline}, though they are fought less between national
liberation movements and colonial or neo-colonial regimes and more
frequently between politically independent states which can quickly move
from clients of the major powers to "rogue" or "terrorist" states if
their interests and those of the major powers diverge. Iran, Iraq and
Serbia are just the most prominent examples of the last ten years. [This
pattern is going to continue, if only because 75 percent of US arms
sales in the past five years have been to countries whose citizens have
no right to choose their own government.]{.underline} Even more
importantly, [the collapse of the Warsaw Pact has created a zone of
imperialist conflict stretching from Nato's new eastern border through
the Baltic states, eastern Europe and the Balkans, through to the
southern rim of Russia and the Guuam states.]{.underline} This
[economically weak and unstable region is now a major zone of rival
imperial claims. The Balkans have become a contested area once again
because the tectonic plates of the major powers now grind against each
other in this area,]{.underline} just as they did before the accident of
Cold War imperial geography and the long postwar boom gave them
temporary respite. The New World Order promised ten years ago will not
be delivered. [The imbalance between US military power and that of every
other state in the world, once touted as the guarantee of a more
peaceful world, now stands exposed as a source of greater
instabilit]{.underline}y. US military spending is greater than all the
military spending of the next 13 countries ranked beneath it. Yet the US
share of world trade and world manufacturing is substantially less than
it was during the Cold War. This is one central reason why [military
might is so often the policy of choice for the US ruling
class]{.underline}. The other reason is the economic enfeeblement of
Russia. But the policy of using this weakness to carry Russia
reluctantly along with Nato objectives has its limits, as the course of
the Balkan War so far shows. [Moreover, as Nato encroachment comes ever
closer to Russia's borders, the still enormous military machine of the
Russian state may once again begin to look to the country's leaders like
its one real asset in a threatening situation]{.underline}. When we see
the Balkan War in context it is no surprise to find that the 1990s have
already been one of the bloodiest since the Second World War in terms of
war deaths. Most of those killed have been civilians. Fifty years ago
half of war deaths were civilian. In the 1960s civilians accounted for
63 percent of war deaths, in the 1980s that figure rose to 74 percent,
and in the 1990s the figure is higher still. [Only the destruction of
the imperialist system will stop this carnage]{.underline}.

Discursive colonisation 1: NATO as perpetual peace In their well-known
book Hegemony and Socialist Strategy (2001) influenced by the
fundamental concepts of Lacanian psychoanalysis, Ernesto Laclau and
Chantal Mouffe argue that [discursive structures, including metaphors,
do not only, or even primarily, have cognitive or reflexive value. They
are first and foremost 'articulatory practice\[s\] which constitute and
organize social relations']{.underline} (Laclau and Mouffe, 2001, 96).4
In other words[, what we say and how we say it shapes what we are and
how we live]{.underline}. This is a [crucial insight in approaching the
way in which NATO membership has been presented by the political
elites]{.underline} to the Montenegrin population. Prototypical in this
respect is the speech given by the speaker of the Montenegrin Parliament
Ranko Krivokapic´ on February 25, 2014 at the conference devoted to the
discussion of the role of the Parliament in the so-called Euro-Atlantic
integrations (\"Krivokapic´\", 2014). It is indicative that this
conference was organised by a pro-NATO nongovernmental organisation
Center for Democratic Transition (CDT), which has, at least since the
early 2000s, been a recipient of USAID funding (USAID 2002 SEED Report).
The conference was sponsored by the German Embassy in Montenegro, which,
in addition to the US Embassy, has provided the most vocal diplomatic
support for Montenegro's NATO membership. In fact, the arrogantly
pro-NATO worded statements by various German and US ambassadors in the
10-year period since Montenegrin independence have been widely
interpreted as serious meddling into the internal affairs of a sovereign
state prohibited by both international and consular/diplomatic law
(\"Milacˇic´\" 2013; \"Dajkovic´\", 2015; \"Vucˇurovic´\", 2016). They
represent yet another aspect of [the neocolonial practices normalised by
the pro-NATO government]{.underline} of Montenegro. Krivokapic´'s speech
contains all the main elements constantly repeated in the pro-NATO
discursive interventions in Montenegro. The first is [the notion of the
supposedly inherent inability of the Balkan peoples]{.underline},
including Montenegrins[, to resolve their differences peacefully. In
other words, since they are not capable of making peace by themselves,
they need the permanent (military) presence of an external force of
restraint, that is, NATO]{.underline}. Krivokapic´ is very explicit
about this. In fact, in his speech, he [refers to NATO metaphorically as
'the messenger of peace' in the Balkans]{.underline}. Apart from the
fact that Krivokapic's [depiction of the Balkans as a 'wild and deadly'
place of instability is a commonplace in the Western European
stereotyping of the Balkans since the early nineteenth
century]{.underline} (as Vesna Goldsworthy has shown in her book
Inventing Ruritania \[1998\]), it is also [a sign of paternalistic
contempt]{.underline} for the Montenegrin population. Even though
Krivokapic holds the second highest political office in the state, he
has identified not with the people who elected him, but with the NATO
outsiders whose own geopolitical and economic interests he is
advocating. In this respect, the second important element of
Krivokapic´'s speech is his [use of the metaphor of the
'umbrella'.]{.underline} Having an umbrella, or being under an
umbrella[, signifies the necessity of being protected from the
elements:]{.underline} rain, hail, snow, etc. [In the geopolitical
sense, being under the NATO umbrella]{.underline}, according to
Krivokapic´, means that Montenegro will be [protected from all external
threats and risk]{.underline}s. However, as in many other pro-NATO
government statements, [these threats or risks are not enumerated or
even named]{.underline}. The public is not told who intends to harm
Montenegro, when, or how. This is [done intentionally in order to create
a general atmosphere of insecurity and fear which makes it easier to
push through NATO's militaristic geopolitical agenda]{.underline}. In
addition, Krivokapic´ is eager to convey to his [audience a sense of
inevitability about NATO membership in order to convince them that there
is no alternative to NATO and that all resistance is futile.
This]{.underline} is the third [element present in almost all pro-NATO
discourse]{.underline} in Montenegro. Specifically, Krivokapic´ claims
that [Montenegro is the 'last piece \[sic\] of the coast from Portugal
to Istanbul without the NATO umbrella, there exists no piece of land on
the coast of the Mediterranean, from this side \[sic\], that does not
have the NATO umbrella]{.underline}. That [puzzle must be
complete']{.underline}. Here once again Krivokapic´ approaches
Montenegro not from the viewpoint of an elected Montenegrin official,
but through the eyes of a NATO military strategist who is interested in
securing the territories and resources of the Mediterranean for the
control of the alliance and its power projection toward the East. For
Krivokapic´, [Montenegro is no longer a homeland, having a value in and
of itself, but becomes a mere pawn in the geopolitical chess game by the
antagonistic colonial powers which NATO must win at any price, i.e. 'the
puzzle must be complete'.]{.underline} What the urgency of completing
this 'puzzle' has to do with the lives of the ordinary citizens of
Montenegro, apart from putting them in danger, Krivokapic´ does not care
to explain. So far, then, we have extracted [three key elements of the
proNATO discursive structures: the stress on internal and external
political instability, the metaphor of the 'umbrella' (which sometimes
also appears as the metaphor of the 'family'), and the sense of
inevitability.]{.underline} In this way[, pro-NATO political figures
attempt to shape all aspects of mainstream political discourse in the
country.]{.underline} When this attempt is coupled with the financial
and logistical support coming into Montenegro from NATO member states in
both overt and covert manner, [the immensity of the challenge for
resistance becomes readily apparent.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC locates NATO as the pinnacle of civilization while characterizing adversaries of the West with divergent modes of thinking and being as "barbaric" and "irrational" -- the epistemological foundations of their scholarship are in conquest and colonization.

Discursive colonisation 2: NATO as civilisation Moreover, [pro-NATO
discourse has been able to appropriate the so-called modernity paradigm
for its purposes and present NATO]{.underline} membership [as the
ultimate proof of]{.underline} Montenegro's [political and economic
'development' and 'maturity'.]{.underline} This is most visible in the
public statements of Milo Djukanovic´, the long-time Montenegrin
authoritarian leader who is currently serving his 7th term as prime
minister (\"CG na pravilnom kolosjeku\", 2016). Since coming to power in
1989 on the wave of the nationalist revolts against the Yugoslav
Communist apparatus, Djukanovic´ has proven to be the ultimate political
'chameleon' of the Balkans. While in power, he amassed an immense
personal fortune by being involved in a whole series of illegal
activities (Kovacevic 2014; Nutall, 2016). It is only his diplomatic
immunity as the head of government that has blocked criminal court
proceedings in Italy in which there are allegations of the existence of
a secretive organised crime network under his personal control. However,
ever since the heavy involvement in the Balkans by the Clinton
Administration in the mid-1990s, Djukanovic´ has acquired many
high-level political friends in Washington. They include US
vice-president Joe Biden with whom Djukanovic´ meets and consults
regularly (\"Readout of VP's Meeting\", 2015). The same goes for the EU
leadership, as shown by Djukanovic´'s April 2016 press conference with
the president of the EU Council Donald Tusk in Brussels where Tusk
referred to him as 'dear Milo' (\"President Tusk and PM of Montenegro\",
2016).5 No wonder then that Djukanovic has completely identified with
the geopolitical agenda of the Western colonialist elites and their
neoliberal economic vision for the Balkans. He has incorporated their
most cynical, corrupt schemes in the running of the Montenegrin economy.
At the special gathering celebrating the 10th anniversary of
Montenegro's independence referendum on May 21, 2016, Djukanovic stated
that in Montenegro, the [divisions are not 'for NATO or against NATO,
but are civilizational and cultural']{.underline} (\"Zaustaviti
podjele\", 2016, emphasis added). This statement encapsulates the most
fundamental claim of pro-NATO discourse. It goes something like this:
[NATO represents the West, the West represents 'civilisation', therefore
NATO represents 'civilisation'. And, by extension, whoever advocates
NATO is 'civilised' and whoever is critical of NATO is 'primitive' and
'barbarian'.]{.underline} It is worth noting that, as explained in
detail by Larry Wolfe's seminal study Inventing Eastern Europe (1994),
[the representation of the West as 'civilised' and the non-West as
'barbarian' goes back to the eighteenth century and the period of the
Enlightenment in Europe.]{.underline} It can be traced back to the
writings and activities of the leading intellectual and political
figures of the times. These diplomats such the Count de Se´gur, the
French ambassador to Russia in the 1780s, and philosophers such as
Voltaire and Rousseau, saw so-called [Eastern (generally Slavic) Europe
as the West's 'inferior' other half, which they strategically used as
the measuring stick of what they considered their own educational and
cultural advancement.]{.underline} These claims had severe geopolitical
consequences. Just as, in his path-breaking 1978 book Orientalism,
[Edward Said argued was the case in the Middle East with regard to
British and French scholars and politicians, the claims by the
intellectuals of the Enlightenment were used to morally justify the
military attack and conquest of Eastern Europe by the West]{.underline}.
Two notable historical periods in which [the discourse of Western
'superiority' reached the highest pitch]{.underline} were those
preceding Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1814 and Hitler's invasion of
Russia in 1941. It is ominous that [contemporary NATO discourse uses
similar discursive structures directed against the same
target.]{.underline} That hardly bodes well for the future. In fact,
Djukanovic´ portrays himself as being in [the forefront of the NATO
struggle against the East (meaning Russia).]{.underline} He has
repeatedly and directly accused Russia of meddling in the internal
affairs of Montenegro with the aim of stopping NATO integration
(\"Djukanovic´ optuzˇuje\", 2015). The Russian government has denied the
charges (\"Moskva\", 2015). Further evidence that Djukanovic´ is
[rehashing centuries-old Western prejudices against other cultures and
ways of living and thinking]{.underline} is his [cynical claim that his
opponents base their claims on 'ignorance']{.underline} (\"Zaustaviti
podjele\", 2016). With a clear intent to demean and humiliate the
opposition, he says that [they need to be 'properly educated', which
will supposedly make them come to the realisation of just how much they
have been mistaken and how great NATO is in promoting democracy and the
rule of law.]{.underline} In the same way as the leading lights of the
Enlightenment, Djukanovic´ appropriates for himself and his point of
view the bully pulpit of apodictic knowledge and uses it to intimidate
everybody else. His [ultimate intention is to destroy any alternative,
non-colonialist political and geopolitical vision]{.underline} for
Montenegro [by discrediting its epistemological
foundations.]{.underline} Djukanovic´'s discourse is [a stark example of
the operation of arrogant political power as hegemonic
knowledge.]{.underline}

#### NATO is not a defense alliance but instead a social construction oriented towards the preservation of Western imperial order -- the technocratic rhetoric of deterrence is a guise for the political architecture of Western security that sustains its hegemony through the management of threats.

In a recent essay devoted to the symbolic character of nuclear politics,
Robert Jervis argues that [Western strategy in Europe after 1945 was not
primarily interested in the instrumental purposes to which Soviet force
might be applied]{.underline}. The concerns, rather, had more to do with
[allaying fears of vulnerability which attended the uncertainties of the
postwar order]{.underline}. \"Indeed, [when NATO was formed, the
American decision makers were preoccupied]{.underline} not with the
danger of Soviet invasion but [with the need for and difficulties of
European economic and political reconstruction]{.underline}.\" (Jervis,
1989:206). This suggests that [strategic debates derive their power from
their affinity with widely circulated representations of cultural and
political life]{.underline} (Shapiro, 1989). [Western military
strategy]{.underline}, despite [its focus on weapons and
technology,]{.underline} is no exception. It [draws its capital from its
ability to provide a sense of order and rational- ity to the
world]{.underline}. Classical strategists like Hedley Bull (1977),
Michael Howard (1984), Henry Kissinger (1954, 1965) and Hans Morgenthau
(1976) have continually argued that [alliances in general, and NATO in
particular, must articulate a specific form of cultural life and
preserve certain historical achievements. In this conservative tradi-
tion, the processes through which inter-state \"order\" and the
\"society\" of states are established are inherently
problematic.]{.underline} The conservatism consists in [assuming that
such \"order\" and \"structure\" are available and normatively worthy as
pursuits and that they are not to be achieved through narrowly
instrumental, weapons-techno- cratic approaches to security. A
genealogical account of alliance defense policy explores the practices
by which certain boundaries of political space became demarcated across
Central Europe.]{.underline} It explores, as well, the [forms of
identity which came to prevail over other possible forms that Western
politics-and global security practices-could have assumed.]{.underline}
Such an [analysis does not result in a singular master narrative, but
rather in an open, internally differentiated set of practices in which
elements of power are always in the process of being contestated and
rearticulated]{.underline} (Foucault, 1977; Der Derian, 1987; Ashley,
1987, 1988, 1989). [NATO as a political practice constructed a
particular architecture of global space]{.underline} (Dillon, 1989). But
that design was never according to a master plan, and it did not emanate
from some sovereign source of power. [NATO\'s success was due not to
having deterred Soviet aggression, nor to having successfully managed
repeated crises among its allies, but to having produced those various
allies in the first place.]{.underline} The account that follows is
somewhat at odds with those critical studies of NATO and Western
strategy that focus on armaments and the postwar world military order
(Senghaas, 1972; Kaldor, 1978, 1981; Luckham, 1987). In examining the
links be- tween the domestic armaments base and international relations,
these studies argue that [NATO occupies a hegemonic place among world
alliance systems and that its combined economic, military, and political
resources have endowed it with the privi- lege to disseminate
transnational infrastructures of rule throughout the postwar
multilateral system of Western-oriented trade.]{.underline} Such a
perspective on Western policy offers a more [critical and globalist
interpretation than traditionally realist, state- centered views that
have enjoyed widespread circulation among more conventional
political-military strategists]{.underline} (Gilpin, 1981; Kennedy,
1988). Yet both of these ap- proaches, the one radical, the other more
traditional, emphasize structural dimen- sions of global power and
impose a greater order and logic on world politics than can be
substantiated through a detailed examination\' of how an actual alliance
system functions.

[NATO is a relic of the cold war, it was initially formed as an alliance
of anti-communist countries. NATO has actively undermined the
sovereignty of many nations looking to delink themselves from global
capitalism and imperialism through military force and
invasion.]{.underline} The U.S. and NATO have been inserting themselves
into Ukrainian affairs for decades. [One recent declassified CIA
document dated July 13, 1953 described project AERODYNAMIC, stating "The
purpose of Project AERODYNAMIC is to provide for the exploitation and
expansion of the anti-Soviet Ukrainian resistance for cold war and hot
war purposes."]{.underline} Project AERODYNAMIC funded, and provided
equipment to multiple organizations who [sympathized with the Ukrainian
Nazi leader Stepan Bandera]{.underline}. Today Bandera sympathizers sit
in political office at all levels of government throughout Ukraine.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, [NATO encouraged former Soviet
territories to join them and created division amongst those who still
believed their quality of life was better with ties to Russia and those
interested in joining NATO. This resulted in civil wars throughout the
region, specifically in the Donbass region, a region in east Ukraine
that rejected the government installed by a U.S. coup in 2014. This coup
would lead to the resurfacing of many far right militias openly holding
neo-nazi values, such as the Azov Brigade]{.underline} who is the
primary militia fighting in the civil war against partisans in the
Donbass region and all who oppose the puppet government. The Ukrainian
government has since formally incorporated such militias into its
military. Presently, U.S. media is doing a great job of manufacturing
[consent. U.S. propaganda is extremely effective at shifting public
opinion to favor going to war, by purposely misleading and deceiving the
public.]{.underline} In the case of Ukraine, U.S. media is overlooking
the far-right and blatant neo-Nazi tendencies of popular movements that
the U.S. installed government has allowed to flourish. [A U.S. war with
Russia will not benefit the masses of innocent Ukrainian people who will
suffer in wartime. U.S. and NATO are instigating a war that ultimately
only benefits those who financially invest in war and will expand the
reach of NATO's imperialist projects]{.underline}. [Biden announced that
the U.S. and its NATO allies put "the mother of all sanctions" on Russia
which will choke out their economy and result in the suffering of
millions of people not only in Russia but throughout the
world.]{.underline} Special advisor to Joe Biden, John Gonzalez stated
"the \[sanctions\] are so robust that they will have an impact on those
governments that have economic affiliations with Russia, and that is by
design... Venezuela will begin to feel that pressure, Nicaragua will
feel that pressure, as will Cuba." [Economic sanctions are as brutal and
violent as guns and bombs, and some who have lived through both say the
sanctions were worse]{.underline}. [These sanctions will directly result
in the expansion of gas and oil infrastructure on Native lands here in
the U.S. because the U.S. is now offering domestic oil to replace
Russian oil that European countries were dependent on. Land permits have
already been increased under Biden, and multinational oil corporations
have their sights set on expanding their infrastructure in North
America, to support sanctions in Russia is to support further
destruction of Native lands here.]{.underline} Once again [the U.S.
proposes a war for profit, rising defense stocks have the richest
investors eager to promote yet another brutal war.]{.underline} This
comes back home in the form of [predatory military recruitment practices
which have always disproportionately targeted Native youth]{.underline}.
Today [Native people remain overrepresented in the U.S. military while
remaining one of the smallest populations. When Indigenous people are
the first to go to war for imperialist powers, we must demand an end to
imperial expansion everywhere]{.underline}. We invite [anti-war and
anti-imperialist coalitions to form and join upcoming calls for
international action]{.underline}. We say, [NO WAR, NO SANCTIONS, NO
ENLISTMENT & RECRUITMENT, U.S. OUT OF EVERYWHERE, DISMANTLE
NATO!]{.underline} These are our demands! It's not enough to be
anti-war, we must also be anti-Imperialists!

Discursive colonisation 3: NATO as future In addition to the pro-NATO
discursive structures that perpetuate the spatial and cultural aspects
of the colonisation of Montenegro, [there are also those that underscore
the temporal dimension]{.underline}. For instance, another high-level
member of the NATO lobby in Montenegro, the president Filip Vujanovic´,
frequently emphasises that [NATO stands for the 'prosperous
future']{.underline} of Montenegro (\"Vujanovic´\", 2014; \"NATO\"
2011). NATO membership will mean that Montenegro can [leave behind its
'past',]{.underline} which, just like Krivokapic´ and Djukanovic´,
Vujanovic´ portrays as [full of conflicts, and decisively enter the age
of political stability, rapid economic growth, and high standard of
living.]{.underline} In other words, Vujanovic´ [presents NATO as the
midwife of post-history.]{.underline} Once in NATO, the citizens of
Montenegro will live happily ever after. [It is]{.underline} no doubt
[laughable to attempt to present a brutal military alliance, known to
violate the basic principles of international law, as some kind of a
utopian panacea.]{.underline} However, Vujanovic´'s statement closely
follows [the conventional conceptualisation of progress founded on the
notion of linear time. This notion underwrites all major political
ideologies]{.underline} of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and so
there is both the Marxist and [NATO version of the end of
history.]{.underline} The propagandists of the Marxist period in the
recent Montenegrin past saw the end of history as the global triumph of
the working class, whereas the [NATO propagandists of today see it as
the establishment of a global NATO.]{.underline} In both cases,
Montenegro is seen as [having a duty to contribute its territory and
resources to the realisation of these 'messianic' projects.]{.underline}
What is problematic, however, is that nobody is asking the ordinary
Montenegrin citizens their opinion. Both the top-down Marxist and [NATO
projects deny them the agency of making political decisions]{.underline}
which will greatly impact their daily lives.

[Biden's]{.underline} diplomatic/military [initiative]{.underline} in
Europe this June was thus [aimed at **reestablishing

NATO, imperialist tool

In the post-World War II Cold War, the U.S. promoted and established
[NATO]{.underline} as [a weapon]{.underline}. [Its major
task]{.underline} was [to prevent **worker uprisings** in]{.underline}
Western European [countries]{.underline} like France, Italy and Greece,
[where there were strong]{.underline}, [pro-socialist]{.underline},
[working-class movements]{.underline}. Its other task was to confront
the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies.

At the time, the [U]{.underline}.[S]{.underline}. was [the **preeminent
imperialist power**]{.underline} and [built **command structures** into
NATO that **guaranteed** U]{.underline}.[S]{.underline}. [leadership of
**any actions**]{.underline}. Those structures remain.

In 1967 NATO provided the plans for a coup by Greek colonels that kept a
military dictatorship in that country for seven years.

The corporate media and the NATO powers describe NATO's history as
"defensive" against the Soviet Union. Truth is, the Soviet-led alliance,
the Warsaw Pact was established only in 1955 and was dissolved in 1991,
as was the Soviet Union itself. The U.S. set up NATO in 1949 and has
expanded NATO since the 1990s.

In 1999, as it was approaching its 50th anniversary, a U.S.-NATO bomb
and rocket campaign hit Yugoslavia for over two months, destroying
schools as well as chemical factories and eventually tearing Yugoslavia
apart.

NATO forces are still in Afghanistan. NATO helped the U.S. occupy Iraq
in the years after the 2003 invasion. NATO carried out the bombing and
destruction of Libya and played a role in the war against Syria.

While Biden was visiting Europe, NATO's "Defender Europe" war exercises
moved toward the Russian borders, and the "African Lion" exercises
scoured northern and western Africa. NATO's original 12 have now grown
to 30, most new members from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Far from being for defense, NATO aims at conquest.

Blinken, Burns and Austin

Biden's cabinet members running the imperialist state apparatus are
Antony Blinken at the State Department, William Burns at the CIA and
Lloyd Austin III at the Defense Department. Blinken and Burns are career
diplomats, and Austin a 41-year career officer who was a four-star
general when he retired, quite recently. All are trained in a Cold War
mentality --- which morphs easily into anti-Russia, anti-China policies.

[Normal **imperialist diplomacy**]{.underline} is [based on lies and
hypocrisy]{.underline}, [**flattery** and **bribes**]{.underline},
backed by force. Trump publicly demanded more military spending from the
European NATO leaders and then insulted them. As reported, [Biden spoke
softly and sweetly]{.underline}, which likely means Biden assured U.S.
allies they would get their share of the loot stolen from the world's
working class. No gang leader could do less.

Biden [urged]{.underline} the [Europeans to back him against Putin and
join]{.underline} with [U]{.underline}.[S]{.underline}. [initiatives
blocking Chinese economic successes]{.underline} in the world market.
Reports are that Biden offered Putin some concessions. Even if true,
these would be aimed at preventing Russia and China from allying against
the imperialist offensive.

[While Biden]{.underline} and his team [speak
**diplomacy**]{.underline}, [never forget that the dollar]{.underline},
the [Euro]{.underline}, the Japanese yen [and]{.underline} the
[**imperialist war machine** are lurking nearby to destroy]{.underline}
the [sovereignty of any existing independent nations and threaten
another]{.underline} Cold [War against China]{.underline} and/[or Russia
that could **explode** in a **hot war**]{.underline}.

\'Dialogue, Confidence, Understanding\'

Some critical comments on Claes\'s interpretation of \'Islamism\' were
less concerned with the content than with the diplomatic effects of the
statement. [NATO]{.underline} was at the time already
[attempt]{.underline}ing [to set up]{.underline} some [diplomatic
relations]{.underline} known as the \'Mediterranean Initiative\' which
[led to the invitation of five Southern countries]{.underline} (Egypt,
Israel, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia) to participate in a
\'Mediterranean dialogue\'. In November 1995, this invitation was also
extended to Jordan (Nordam, 1997).8 [The choice of countries already
constitutes a **forceful definition of Self and Other**: \"Each of the
six countries realizes that is was chosen largely because it is
perceived to be a moderate, Western-looking, constructive (as defined by
the West) participant in regional affairs\"]{.underline} (RAND 1998:57).
**[The deck is already stacked]{.underline}** [before the dialogue
begins:]{.underline} the [participant countries have to comply with
Western standards, their \'constructive\' nature assured]{.underline}.
At this moment the encounter involved [its first]{.underline}
[**imperial gesture:** NATO reserves the right to grant audience to a
sympathetic public in attendance only]{.underline}. One might then
surmise that NATO\'s policy towards the six chosen nations might be
characterized by a more amicable and dialogical attitude than Claes\'s
equation of \'Islamism\' and \'Communism\' suggests. [NATO\'s official
language might even be interpreted as saying that the countries south or
east of the Mediterranean Sea are part of the **\'European security
community\'**]{.underline}. Thus, the Final Communiqué of the 1996 NATO
Brussels Meeting states, \"We reaffirm our conviction that security in
Europe is closely linked with security and stability in the
Mediterranean, and that the Mediterranean dimension is consequently [one
of the various components of the European security
architecture]{.underline}\" (NATO, 1997b:33).

A slightly different language had been employed in the previous year,
when the North Atlantic Council expressed its \'conviction that security
in Europe is greatly affected by security and stability in the
Mediterranean\' (NATO, 1996:25). In order to promote that stability,
NATO pursues a \"dialogue, with the aim of fostering transparency and
achieving a better mutual understanding with the countries to our
South\" (NATO, 1996:25; emphasis added). And finally, NATO\'s Madrid
Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation from July 1997
states that the Mediterranean region merits great attention since
security in the whole of Europe is closely linked with security and
stability in the Mediterranean. The dialogue we have established with a
number of Mediterranean countries \... contributes to
confidence-building and cooperation in the region, and complements other
international efforts (NATO, 1997a:2; emphasis added). Despite the less
bellicose language, [even within]{.underline} this fo[rmulaic diplomatic
vocabulary we can]{.underline} still [discern the same discursive rules
apply]{.underline}ing as in Claes\'s more blatant statement. In both
versions, **[NATO \'pastes\' the South into the void]{.underline}**
[left by the demise of the Soviet Union as its constitutive Other,
reasserting a **Western identity** against a **re-constituted
antagonist**]{.underline}. To support this contention, we do not need to
surmise what NATO \'really\' wants to say here, although the barren
vocabulary certainly entices the critical reader to search for further
elaboration. Our critical hermeneutics may well stay on the surface of
the above statements, inquiring instead into what is presupposed in
them. Thus, our question should simply be: [what is to be assumed if
confidence has to be built, transparency to be created, a better mutual
understanding to be achieved? Obviously, these goals are only meaningful
if we assume the current lack of confidence and understanding, if we
assume the relations between the partners to be characterized by the
absence of sociality. NATO\'s attempt to mediate the encounter between
the West and the South is based on an interpretation of this encounter
as one **between aliens**, between cultures that are completely external
to each other]{.underline}. Mediation, after all, presupposes a prior
alienation. **[\'Southern\' identity]{.underline}** [in its different
expressions]{.underline} **[is thus externalized from the
West]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[rendered as
otherness]{.underline}**. The \'Mediterranean\' [becomes the **defining
line of division** through which these cultures are alienated and across
which their encounter is mediated.]{.underline}

Yet another angle is available for this critical reading. To refer to
the vocabulary of [**\'confidence building measures\'**
connects]{.underline} the situation in the Mediterranean [with the logic
of the cold war in Europe and a central diplomatic enterprise in the
management of the East-West antagonism]{.underline}. Confidence-building
(and later [confidence and security building]{.underline}) [measures
were a central element in the]{.underline} Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) process in the 1970s and 1980s and the
[attempt to create structures of political and diplomatic control over
the strategic antagonism between East and West.]{.underline}9 With the
East taken out of this context, [NATO conducts what amounts to a
**\'cut-and-paste\'** of the South into its place.]{.underline} While
sticking to our critical hermeneutics, we might nonetheless flesh out
[the \'identification\' of the South as a constitutive
Other]{.underline}. In November 1997, [the RAND Corporation presented an
\'authoritative study\' on NATO\'s Mediterranean Initiative to the
Alliance\'s top political and military authorities]{.underline}. Its
institutionalized intertextual relationship with NATO\'s discourse was
established through the Opening Speech by Secretary General Solana at
the RAND conference at which the report was submitted (Solana 1997c),
and a summary by the NATO Office of Information and Press in NATO Review
(de Santis, 1998:32). Among the many issues and topics of the report,
three aspects will receive particular attention here. Firstly, [the
report constitutes a paradigmatic case of **\'securitization\'** by
rendering a particular region \'accessible\' to the strategic gaze of a
military alliance]{.underline}.10 Secondly, [the RAND study\'s
\'problematization\' of the \'proliferation\' of Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMD) draws on and reproduces a specific mode of
differentiation between the West and the South which is deeply indebted
to \'orientalist\' clichés]{.underline}. Thirdly, [the resulting mode of
**exchange**]{.underline} (**[of information, trust, and
knowledge]{.underline}**) [is implicitly conceived as a hierarchical and
monological one]{.underline}. Overall, the report emulates and
reinforces NATO\'s imperial gesture in the Mediterranean Initiative.

Securitization, Proliferation, Information

The starting point for the RAND report is the growing importance of the
Mediterranean region for NATO and Europe after the end of the cold war.
Since the \'Eastern Front\' will most likely be stabilized and pacified
through the enlargement process, the Alliance\'s primary concern in
terms of \'security problems\' will have to be its Southern periphery
\-- the Balkans, the Mediterranean, and the Caucasus (RAND, 1998:xi).
The site vacated by the East, in other words, is now occupied by \'the
South\'. In a second move, the RAND authors qualify this apparent
isomorphism between the East and the South, pointing to the different
phenomena underlying the \'security problems\' in these areas. Here,
political, economic, and social instability are the main concerns of
local politicians, while migration, energy issues and cultural issues
extend beyond individual countries (RAND, 1998:3-5). Yet in a third and
final rhetorical move, RAND\'s narrative renders these different and
diverse problems relevant for the strategic gaze of a military
alliance.11 That is to say, **[NATO \'securitizes\']{.underline}** the
different **[social, political, economic, and cultural
issues]{.underline}** [by framing them within a]{.underline}
**[discursive context of]{.underline}** danger and
**[threat]{.underline}**, by [processing them through a conceptual
structure that renders them relevant for the strategic and diplomatic
practices of a security political agent like NATO]{.underline}. This is
above all accomplished by [designating the social, political, economic
and cultural issues as \'soft security\' problems]{.underline}.12
\"Indeed, [the **expansion of the security agenda** beyond narrowly
defined defense questions has been a leading feature of the post-Cold
War scene]{.underline} everywhere, and the Mediterranean is an example
of this trend\" (RAND, 1998:3). And as the NATO summary presentation
elaborates, \"the socio-economic developments referred to above may lead
to the Alliance\'s definition of security being subject to further
refinement for some years to come\" (de Santis, 1998:33).

A [closer look at the RAND study actually reveals that the
\'Mediterranean\' as a region itself is constructed through this
discursive securitization]{.underline}. The region is identified by
reference to such purported commonalities as lack of political
legitimacy, relentless urbanization, and religious radicalism. Moreover,
[the expanded reach of modern military and information systems links
these issues into one \'gray area of problems\' with the Mediterranean
at its center]{.underline}. [Read as straight-forward indicators of
danger]{.underline} and **[taken out of]{.underline}** their
**[respective]{.underline}** [socio-political and cultural]{.underline}
**[context]{.underline}**, [these issues constitute]{.underline}
defining markers of the \'Mediterranean\' region as [a field
of]{.underline} **[strategic knowledge]{.underline}**. [Securitization
in the NATO/RAND discourse]{.underline} accomplishes two related
objects. [Firstly]{.underline}, it [**alienates the identities of West
and South** only to mediate them in terms of danger and
insecurity]{.underline}. [It replaces the temporal
differentiation]{.underline} that was implied in the
\'development/underdevelopment\' discourse with [a **spatial,
geostrategic constellation**]{.underline}. Consequently, [it suggests
\'arms control\' and \'confidence building\' measures as the appropriate
means to mediate the divide]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, the
NATO/RAND narrative [makes the region **cognitively accessible** and
geostrategically **available** for the Alliance]{.underline}. Whatever
goes on in the region is [rendered a matter of concern for an alliance
that can muster an unequaled amount of **strategic violence** in order
to inscribe its own design onto the **map of global
politics**]{.underline}. The re-conceptualization of security to
encompass \'soft issues\' does not mean that NATO cannot identify
\'hard\' security problems. Above all the proliferation of Weapons of
Mass Destruction (WMD) features prominently with the NATO/RAND discourse
(NATO 1991; NATO 1998d; Solana 1997b; Solana 1997c).

David Mutimer (1997) has argued that the use of the metaphor
\'proliferation\' carries certain entailments. That is to say, it
structures our understanding and handling of the problem. In particular,
he refers to the \"image of a spread outward from a point or source\",
and the \"technological bias\" introduced in the discourse (Mutimer
1997:201-2). As concerns the first point, [\'proliferation\' presupposes
a center at which WMD are to be held and controlled, and from which
these weapons disseminate into the body of the international
society]{.underline}. To the extent that this process gets out of the
center\'s control, [certain measures have to be taken to \'suffocate\',
limit, or curb the \'spread\' of these weapons]{.underline}. As concerns
the second point, Mutimer (1997:203) points out the peculiar agency
implied in the concept: \"[Notice that the weapons themselves spread;
they are not spread by an external agent of some form - say, a human
being or political institution]{.underline}\". [The fact that a large
number of these weapons were actually \'spread\' by Western states is
consequently **hidden through this discursive structure**]{.underline}.
These points are also relevant for the Mediterranean Initiative. We can
add a third entailment to the list which appears through a critical
reading of the NATO/RAND narrative. As the RAND authors (1998:15)
observe, \"The mere existence of ballistic missile technology with
ranges in excess of 1,000 km on world markets and available to
proliferators around the Mediterranean basin would not necessarily pose
serious strategic dilemmas for Europe.\" In fact, we might even agree
with the neorealist proposition that \'more might be better\', above all
in terms of nuclear weapons. This is certainly the preferred solution of
John Mearsheimer (1990) for the stabilization of European political
order after the end of the cold war. After all, [conventional wisdom has
it that nuclear weapons and the threat of mutually assured destruction
preserved stability and peace during the Cold War]{.underline}. The
[RAND authors, however, fail to grasp the **irony** in their
identification of WMD proliferation, which ends up denying this central
tenet of cold war strategy]{.underline}. According to them, \"the WMD
and ballistic missile threat will acquire more serious dimensions where
it is coupled with a proliferator\'s revolutionary orientation. Today,
this is the case with regard to Iran, Iraq, Libya, and arguably Syria\"
(RAND, 1998:16).

[What preserved the peace during the cold war \-- mutual deterrence \--
is now **re-written as a strategic problem**]{.underline}: As a result
of proliferation trends, [Europe will be increasingly exposed to the
retaliatory consequences of U.S. and European actions around the Middle
East and the Mediterranean basin, including the Balkans]{.underline}.
\... As a political threat and a weapon of terror capable of influencing
the NATO decisionmaking during a crisis, their significance \[of
conventionally armed ballistic missiles\] could be considerable (RAND,
1998:16). Two implications of these arguments deserve elaboration.
First, [there is the **reversal** of the traditional relationship
between WMD and rationality]{.underline}. For what makes the presence of
WMD in the South so worrisome is the absence of the requirements of
reason and rationality. [Within NATO\'s discourse on the
South]{.underline}, \'revolutionary orientation\' accounts for the
undesirability of distributing these weapons to such unfit hands. [In
order to qualify for]{.underline} their [possession, reason and
rationality must be present \-- as they are obviously assumed to be in
the West]{.underline}. The discourse of proliferation [consequently
produces a third entailment by constructing the relationship between
West and South in **\'orientalist\' terms**]{.underline}. In this
rendition, [the South becomes the quintessential **antithesis of the
West**, the site of **irrationality, passion, and terror**]{.underline}
(Said, 1995). [Within this site, different rules apply, which are not
necessarily subject to Western ideals of enlightened
reason]{.underline}. \'Proliferation\' articulates [a hierarchical
structure in global politics]{.underline}, [with the West as
the]{.underline} **[privileged site]{.underline}** [of from which to
surveil, control, and engage the rest of the world]{.underline}. This
privilege is further dramatized in the above complaint about the
possibility of retaliation. [For the South to achieve the possibility of
influencing NATO decisionmaking is to violate the **epistemic
sovereignty** of the West. \'U.S. and European actions\' and
interventions have to be **unrestrained** in order to constitute proper
crisis management]{.underline}. **[NATO demands a docile
subjectivity]{.underline}** [and **accessible territory** from the
South]{.underline}, the latter\'s identity cannot be ascertained against
the West. Its arms have to be surrendered, its retaliatory capabilities
to be revoked.

[\'Information\' is the third mode besides \'Securitization\' and
\'Proliferation\' within which we can discern the subjugation of the
South to the strategic Western gaze]{.underline}. A central purpose of
the Mediterranean Initiative/Dialogue is to improve \'mutual
understanding\' and to \'dispel some of the misperceptions and
apprehensions that exist, on both sides of the Mediterranean\' (Solana,
1997a:5). And [both the RAND Corporation and NATO put some emphasis on
public information and perception. Yet the structure of this
relationship proves to be unbalanced and virtually
**unilateral**]{.underline}. As mentioned above, for NATO, the prime
task is above all the \"further refinement of its definition of
security\" (de Santis, 1998). [The general **identity of the South** as
a site of danger and insecurity is consequently **never in question**.
Western perceptions are never problematized. Knowledge of the South is,
it appears, a matter of matching more and better information with proper
conceptual tools.]{.underline}

[On the other hand, (mis)perceptions take the place of knowledge in the
South]{.underline}. NATO is perceived widely as a Cold War institution
searching for a new enemy. That is why the best course to change the
perception of NATO in these countries is to focus more on \"soft\"
security, building mutual understanding and confidence before engaging
in \"hard\" military cooperation. Measures should be developed with the
aim of promoting transparency and defusing threat perceptions, and
promoting a better understanding of NATO\'s policies and objectives (de
Santis, 1998:34). [To interpret political misgivings about NATO and its
post-cold war diplomacy as \'misperceptions\' which can be put straight
by \"educat\[ing\] opinion-makers in the
dialogue-countries\"]{.underline}(RAND, 1998:75) [tends to]{.underline}
**[naturalize]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[objectify]{.underline}** [the Western rendition of NATO\'s
identity]{.underline}. The possibility that from the perspective of the
\'Southern\' countries NATO\'s political and strategic design might look
quite different is lost in this narrative. [NATO\'s identity is
decontextualized and objectified, the productive role of different
cultural and strategic settings in the establishment of identities and
formulation of interests denied.]{.underline} [To maintain such a lofty
position becomes more difficult if we let]{.underline} the Mediterranean
[participants voice their concerns openly]{.underline}. Far from being
\'misperceptions and misunderstandings\', these countries\' less than
enthusiastic attitudes towards NATO are based on, for instance, the
establishment of powerful Western military intervention capabilities off
their beaches. Also, NATO\'s attempts to institutionalize a military
cooperation is interpreted as an attempt to gain a strategic foothold in
the region in order to monitor the flow of missile technology and the
possession of WMD (Selim 1998:12-14). In other words, we encounter
rather rational and reasonable security political and strategic
concerns. [The fact that NATO is unwilling or unable to acknowledge
their concerns once again demonstrates the \'imperial\' nature of the
purported dialogue]{.underline}.

In her exploration of Western representations of the South, Roxanne Doty
(1996:3) describes the relationship between these two subjectivities as
an \"imperial encounter\" which is meant \"to convey the idea of
asymmetrical encounters in which one entity has been able to construct
\'realities\' that were taken seriously and acted upon and the other
entity has been denied equal degrees or kinds of agency\". Her focus is
on an aspect of power which has received increasing treatment within
critical International Relations (IR) theory during the last years, that
is, the power to define and articulate identities and to determine the
relations between them. As was argued above, [the Western invention of
the South during the cold war can be interpreted as an **imperial
gesture**. The South was rendered into a **West-in-the-making**, with
its own distinguished historical, cultural, and social features reduced
to indicators of \'underdevelopment\']{.underline}. Ultimately, the
narrative proclaimed, [the South would become part of the Western
\'Empire\', the latter would be able to expand into \'barbaric\' areas
of the world]{.underline} \-- provided it could win the war against
Communism. [The end of the cold war saw this \'expansionist\' logic give
way to a exclusive posture]{.underline}. [The relations between the West
and the South are no longer mediated through time. Instead, a **spatial
differentiation now structures the imperial encounter**, the South is no
longer to be \'developed\' and \'Westernized\'. It is to be
**surveilled, controlled and disciplined**, its \'spillage\' of crisis
and instability to be **contained**.]{.underline}

NATO\'s Mediterranean Initiative is a cornerstone in this new rendition.
For while we so far cannot observe any direct military intervention by
the Alliance in the Mediterranean region, [NATO\'s discourse on the
South]{.underline} in general, and the Initiative in particular [render
it accessible and available for]{.underline} such [action]{.underline}.
**[Strategic knowledge]{.underline}** [is produced as an expression of,
and in anticipation of, strategic power. The]{.underline}
**[\'self-determination\' of NATO]{.underline}** [as a continuously
capable and competent military agent is effected through a discourse
that inscribes a particular, **securitizing**, strategic **order** upon
the South, positing it as a **site of danger, irrationality and
insecurity** against the West]{.underline}. In this context it is
interesting to observe the exclusion of states from the Mediterranean
Initiative that are not considered to be \'moderate, Western-looking
\[and\] constructivist\' (RAND 1998:57). This [differentiation between
insiders and outsiders appears to be based on]{.underline} the degree to
[which]{.underline} the respective [countries are willing to subject
themselves to the imperial encounter with the West, and to open
themselves to the **strategic gaze** and control of NATO]{.underline}.
The imperial encounter is then made possible and supported by what one
may call the Emperor\'s two bodies. [On one hand, the West appears as a
cultural identity among others, located in space]{.underline} [(North of
the Mediterranean)]{.underline} [and time (in the post-cold war
era)]{.underline}. In this sense, the West is [the entity that needs to
be protected from the dangers and threats which \'spill over\' from the
South]{.underline} [through]{.underline} adequate **[strategic
means]{.underline}**. [On the other hand, the West is presented as
a]{.underline} **[\'site of knowledge\']{.underline}**, [as the
source]{.underline} or author [of the proper and objective
\'world-picture\' that depicts the realities of post-cold war global
politics]{.underline}. In this sense, [the West becomes the]{.underline}
**[metaphysical grounds]{.underline}** [from which knowledge can be
gathered and disseminated]{.underline}. And **[in its]{.underline}**
different versions \-- **[securitization]{.underline}**, proliferation,
and information \-- [this knowledge draws on and reproduces this
metaphysics. There are consequently reasons to be skeptical about
NATO\'s ability to conduct a \'dialogue\' with an other it is unwilling
to listen to]{.underline}.

Discussions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s (NATO) role
after the end of the cold war predominantly focus on its adaptation to
the new security environment, [the]{.underline} redefinition of its
mission and the transformation of its military and political structures
(Gordon, 1997; Kay, 1998; Yost, 1998). While this kind of literature is
valuable in its own right, its **[underlying assumption]{.underline}**
[about the adaptive logic of NATO\'s post-cold war policies tends to
underrate the ability of the Alliance to actively shape the security
environment through its **discursive construction of security political
\'realities\'**]{.underline} [and the]{.underline} **[re-presentation of
its institutional identity]{.underline}**. At the same time, this
literature arguably underestimates the task confronting NATO. [The

to NATO in terms of adapting to a new reality, the features of which are
are supposedly as clearly discernable as the ones of the cold war
itself. Rather, its demise [challenges NATO]{.underline} (and other
international actors and institutions) [to articulate new and stable
**\'structures of meaning\'** which can render \"the unfamilar in the
terms of the familiar\"]{.underline} (Campbell, 1992:4) and [which make
it possible to **re-assume** political and military-strategic
**agency**]{.underline}. The purpose of this essay is to analyze the way
in which NATO is responding to these challenges. More specifically, it
addresses the problem of the Alliance\'s \'Western\' identity and the
strategies of inclusion and exclusion through which this identity is
re-defined and re-asserted after the disappearence of the constitutive
Other of the cold war, that is, the Communist \'East\'. At the same
time, the essay deals with NATO\'s search for new adversaries and
threats. These two issues, while often treated separately in the
literature, are in fact closely related. As Owen Harries (1993:42)
pointed out some years ago,

**[The political \'West\' is not a natural construct but a highly
artificial one]{.underline}**. [It took the presence of a
life-threatening, overtly hostile \'East\' to bring it into existence
and to maintain its unity.]{.underline} It is extremely doubtful whether
it can now survive the disappearance of that enemy. We need not take
Harries\' skepticism at face value in order to appreciate the
problematization of what the West actually is. Suffice it to state that
[matters of identity are intrinsically related to the problem of
difference and adversity. The articulation of a **Western
identity**]{.underline}, Harries\' argument suggests, [was made
possible, and depended upon the presence of a **hostile
\'East\'**]{.underline}. As Bradley Klein (1994:120-21) has argued, this
presence has allowed NATO to prevail and survive the many crises and
internal conflicts amongst its member-states. Already in the 1960s,
Henry Kissinger analyzed the effects of détente on alliance cohesion in
terms that anticipate to some extent the troubles NATO would face some
30 years later after the demise of the Warsaw Treaty Organization. As
the détente develops, the need to transform the Alliance from its
present defensive concept into a political arrangement defining itself
by some positive goals will grow ever more urgent. Defense against a
military threat will soon lose its force as a political bond.
[Negotiations with the East will prove corrosive unless they go hand in
hand with the creation of common political purposes and the institutions
to embody them]{.underline} (Kissinger, 1965:10).

In other words, [in the]{.underline} **[absence of a
\'life-threatening\' adversary]{.underline}**, [the West runs the danger
of disintegrating and dissolving]{.underline}. That NATO was able to
avoid this fate for forty years supports Klein\'s (1994:121) contention
that [the alliance strength rested on its ability to wed itself \"to the
defense of a distinctly modern, **Western, Atlantocentric cultural
project**\" which made it possible to deflect and **externalize** its
internal **contradictions and conflicts**]{.underline}. [If we
acknowledge this internal relationship between (stable) identity and
(hostile) difference, we can appreciate the paradox that the end of the
cold war presented a much more serious threat to NATO than the East-West
confrontation ever did]{.underline}. For the end of the cold war also
means that the unraveling of Cold War representations has raised for the
first time the fundamental issue of Western identity. It is no longer
clear who is to be legitimately incorporated within the space of modern
Western culture. \... Simply put the world under NATO\'s guidance is no
longer subject to containment. It\'s boundaries have now been eroded\...
(Klein, 1994:133). Consequently, [the West faces the problem of
\'self-determination\', of defining its identity and its borders against
the rest of the world]{.underline}. Self-determination is usually
assumed to contribute to peace in the international system. Thus, the
United Nations (UN) Charter states in Article 1, paragraph 2 as one of
its purposes, To develop friendly relations among nations based on
respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples. As this citation demonstrates, violence is conventionally
understood as violation of an existing (national) identity by an
external other (Vries and Weber, 1997:1). [Self-determination as \"the
right of a people to constitute itself in a state\"]{.underline}
(Encyclopædia Britannica Online) [presupposes that the identity of these
people is already established and that conflict is a external and
secondary to such identity]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} as the events
in the former Yugoslavia have demonstrated, [it is difficult to maintain
this assumption when conflict appears as an inherent part of the very
determination and assertion of identity]{.underline}. \"Determination of
the Self now reveals itself to be what it probably always has been:
determination of the Other\" (Vries and Weber, 1997:1). This is most
dramatically demonstrated in those cases in which **[the Self has to be
\'cleansed\' of ethnic and other \'impurities\'.]{.underline}**
[**Violence** is thus not necessarily solely attributable to the other,
but is rather **part and parcel of the process** through which
identities, collective or individual, are constituted and
maintained]{.underline} (Vries and Weber, 1997:2). The case of Bosnia in
this sense only demonstrates the relationship between violence and
identity in its most dramatic and disturbing expression. Yet as such, it
is simply the manifestation of a more general, ontological proposition.
[Any]{.underline} \"[operation of inclusion/exclusion is an act of
violence perpetrated upon the world and requires the support of a
certain amount of coercion]{.underline}\" (Bauman, 1991:2).
[If]{.underline} collectives such as nations, or [\'the West\' are
indeed \'imagined communities\' without any grounding in primordial,
quasi-natural identities, than their continued existence depends on a
constant effort to keep alive that imagination]{.underline} (Sloterdijk,
1998). **[Order has to be inscribed]{.underline}** [into the world as a
process of]{.underline} **[creative violence]{.underline}** [which
eliminates]{.underline} and overcomes the [ambiguity and
contingency]{.underline} that constantly works to undermine such
efforts.

Conventional wisdom holds that [[IR]{.underline}]{.mark} theory has
little to say about culture. After all, the argument goes, its dominant
schools of thought [[focus on]{.mark} struggles for **material
[power]{.mark}** [and treat actors as **self-interested
egoists**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [IR scholars talk about
[culture]{.mark} **all the time**]{.underline}. It
[[permeates]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[arguments

**modern [international order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, about [China as
a]{.underline} civilizational [state]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
about the fate of [the Arab Spring]{.underline}. And if discussions of
the Western nature of human rights aren't about culture, then what are
they about at all?

The real problem is that [IR scholars **cling stubbornly**
to]{.underline} a [view of culture]{.underline} that anthropologists and
sociologists [last took seriously]{.underline} between [the
**1930s**]{.underline} and 1950s. Indeed, when discussing culture,
[IR]{.underline} looks like [a **conservation zoo** for concepts **long
dead**]{.underline} in their natural habitats.

The [outdated [view]{.mark} sees [cultures as]{.mark}]{.underline}
coherent things: as [[tightly integrated]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[neatly
bounded]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and clearly
differentiated]{.underline}]{.mark}. They are **[causally
powerful]{.underline}**. [Culture makes individuals who they
are]{.underline} and [defines what they want and how they
think]{.underline}. And it is culture that [[undergirds **social
institutions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Cultural unity makes strong
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[cultural diversity is
**corrosive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For evidence of such views, look no
further than [Brexit]{.underline}, U.S. President Donald Trump's
"[**[M]{.mark}**ake **[A]{.mark}**merica **[G]{.mark}**reat
**[A]{.mark}**gain]{.underline}" campaign, Russian irredentism, and
Confucian nationalism in China.

Such [views have **long been rejected** in specialist
fields]{.underline}. [[Cultures are]{.underline}]{.mark} now seen as
[[heterogeneous]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[contradictory]{.underline}]{.mark}, [highly
[porous]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} **deeply [entwined]{.mark}**
and interrelated]{.underline}. In her celebrated 1986 article "Culture
in Action," Ann Swidler, the eminent Berkeley sociologist, put it this
way: "all real cultures contain diverse, often conflicting symbols,

[**[Decades of]{.mark} empirical [research]{.mark}** [sustains

[[at the level of **empires** and **international
orders**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Karen Barkey, Jane Burbank, Frederick
Cooper, Pamela Kyle Crossley, and many others have revealed the
heterogeneous cultural contexts in which such orders evolve.

Yet the [old]{.underline}, [discredited view of culture is **still
alive** in IR]{.underline}. And not just in little pockets. It is IR's

[**Decades of empirical research** sustains such understandings of

the heterogeneous cultural contexts in which such orders evolve.

Yet the [old]{.underline}, [discredited view of culture is **still
alive** in IR]{.underline}. And not just in little pockets. It is IR's
default conception across the discipline's rival schools.

[Realists]{.underline} are materialists at heart, yet they frequently
make [arguments]{.underline} that [rest on **cultural
assumptions**]{.underline}. They describe themselves as studying
[conflict groups]{.underline}, and when we probe the nature of these
groups, they commonly [appear as cultural units]{.underline}:
[nation-states with **national characters**]{.underline},
[identities]{.underline}, [and interests]{.underline}. The anarchic
international system gives states certain primary interests ---
principally survival --- but [national culture]{.underline} is commonly
seen as a [**key source** of]{.underline} other [interests]{.underline}.

Many realists admit that [today's international order rests on
legitimacy]{.underline} as much as material might. And when explaining
such legitimacy, they join others in [emphasizing **Western
civilization**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} is said to
[provide]{.underline} the [norms and values that inform and sustain
**modern institutions**]{.underline}. [For]{.underline} former Secretary
of State Henry [Kissinger]{.underline} and others, the [erosion of this
cultural foundation poses a **fundamental threat**]{.underline}. How can
"[regions with]{.underline} such [divergent cultures]{.underline},
[histories]{.underline}, [and traditional theories of order
vindicate]{.underline} the [legitimacy of **any common
system**]{.underline}?" Kissinger asked in his book World Order.

On the surface, it might seem like [**r**ational **c**hoice
**t**heory]{.underline} would have even less to say about culture than
realism. Yet culture enters rationalist arguments, too, in three ways:
[when adherents explain]{.underline} the [rational choice of
norms]{.underline}, when [they accommodate **cultural
preferences**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in their
[argument]{.underline} that [common knowledge is **essential** to
solving coordination problems]{.underline}. The last of these is
particularly interesting, as it is here that rationalists express a
version of IR's default conception of culture. Coordination problems
exist when actors have common interests but can only realize as much if
they coordinate their choices, usually without direct communication.

[To overcome **such problems**]{.underline}, [actors rely on **mutual
expectations**]{.underline}, and such expectations come [from common
knowledge]{.underline}: things I know, and you know, and we both know
that we both know. Rationalists see cultural norms, values, and
practices as a major source of such knowledge, and thus **[common
culture]{.underline}** is [important to solving]{.underline} the
[variety of **coordination problems** actors navigate every
day]{.underline}. Most rationalists focus on specific collaboration
problems and localized common knowledge, but others [make **larger
claims** about social order]{.underline}. Here the claim is a familiar
one: **[Culturally homogeneous societies, which they take as their
baseline, are more conducive to the solution of coordination problems
than diverse societies]{.underline}**.

It may seem unfair to expect realism and rational choice to be abreast
of current thinking on culture: It is not their game, after all. Yet
constructivism and the English School, both of which see culture as core
business, fare no better.

[Constructivism's core insight is]{.underline} that [shared
meanings]{.underline} --- ideas, norms, and values --- [make the social
and natural worlds knowable]{.underline}. Constructivists **[frequently
describe]{.underline}** such [meanings as]{.underline}
"[cultural]{.underline}." In principle, that tendency is entirely
compatible with current understandings of culture as heterogeneous and
contradictory. Yet the two main strands of constructivist research have
been largely deaf to such understandings.

The first strand focuses on [international norms]{.underline}: how they
emerge and how they shape the identities, interests, and behavior of
states and other actors. This [work disaggregates
**culture**]{.underline}, [breaking it]{.underline} up [into individual
norms and]{.underline} then [studying their **causal
effects**]{.underline}. But while culture is not treated as a coherent,
bounded whole, the [complexity in which individual norms]{.underline}
are [embedded]{.underline} is [neglected]{.underline}.

The second strand of research focuses on the [**institutional
foundations** of **i**nternational **r**elations]{.underline}, [most
notably]{.underline} the [origins of modern sovereignty]{.underline}. It
is here that the default conception of culture is most clear.
Constructivists identify [deep]{.underline}, [system-wide cultural
meanings]{.underline} and use these to [explain **key institutional
developments**]{.underline}. They see [international orders]{.underline}
as [founded]{.underline}, in part, [on]{.underline} what they call
[collective mentalities]{.underline} --- and when these change, so do
basic institutions. For example, my own early research attributes
variations in the basic institutional practices of different societies
to their different cultural understandings of the moral purpose of the
state.

The English School is noted for its trademark claim that states can form
international societies, not just international systems. That is, states
can come together over shared common interests to agree on common rules
and create institutions to uphold those rules. When asked what sustains
such a society, English School theorists offer two main answers. One is
pragmatic: States share basic interests in physical security, stable
territorial rights, and the keeping of agreements, and international
society is the best means to these ends. This is overlaid, however, by
an argument about the cultural prerequisites for international society.

Far from seeing culture as complex and contradictory, Martin Wight, one
of the school's founders, held in Systems of States that an
[international society]{.underline} "[will not come into being without a
**degree of cultural unity** among its members]{.underline}." [Modern
international society]{.underline}, he argued, [had]{.underline} its
[origins in European civilization]{.underline}, [and when decolonization
admitted]{.underline} a **[host of non-Western states]{.underline}**,
[international society]{.underline} had "**[outrun cultural and moral
community]{.underline}**." The idea that pragmatism could only ever
sustain a thin social order --- and that a [common culture]{.underline}
was [needed to undergird robust bonds]{.underline},
[institutions]{.underline}, [and practices]{.underline} --- focused much
of the school's post-decolonization research on the possibility of
international society in a culturally diverse world.

[IR's failure to integrate **contemporary conceptions** of
culture]{.underline} is more than an academic curiosity --- it [has
**far-reaching implications** for how we understand today's **global
politics of culture**]{.underline}. Take one critical issue: the [impact
of rising non-Western powers on the modern international
order]{.underline}. At present, [debate]{.underline} is [dominated by
**culturalists**]{.underline}, [who think]{.underline} that the [order
will **collapse** as]{.underline} its [Western **cultural foundations**
erode]{.underline}, and liberals, who deny that cultural differences
matter, holding that liberal institutions can accommodate states and
peoples of diverse cultural complexions.

[But what if we take seriously]{.underline} the [insight]{.underline}
that [there is **no such thing** as]{.underline} a [unified
culture]{.underline}, that all culture is complex and contradictory? We
would have to assume, first of all, that the modern order arose under
conditions of cultural diversity, not unity. And [we would]{.underline}
then have to [ask how]{.underline} these [heterogeneous conditions
shaped]{.underline} the [order's evolution and]{.underline}, in turn,
[how]{.underline} the [order's institutions]{.underline} were
[constructed to **govern** and **order** that diversity]{.underline}.

[Doing so]{.underline} would [bring]{.underline} the [conquest of the
Americas]{.underline}, the [Protestant Reformation]{.underline}, the
[post-Versailles division of Europe into **ethnically defined**
nation-states]{.underline}, [and decolonization into **new
focus**]{.underline}. Most importantly, it would lead us to ask not
whether sudden onset diversity will destroy a formerly Western order,
but whether [post-decolonization practices for governing global
diversity]{.underline} can [accommodate **new arrangements** of power
and expressions of **cultural difference**]{.underline}.

It is the somewhat gratifying lesson of Philip Tetlock's new book,
"Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?"
(Princeton; \$35), that people who make prediction their business ---
[[people who appear as experts on television]{.underline}]{.mark}, [get
quoted in **newspaper [articles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[advise
governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and businesses, and participate in
punditry roundtables --- [[are **no better** than the rest of
us]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[When they're wrong]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[they're **rarely held accountable**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} they [[rarely admit it]{.underline}]{.mark},
either. [[They insist]{.mark} that [they were]{.mark}]{.underline} just
off on timing, or blindsided by an improbable event, or **[[almost
right]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or wrong for the right reasons. They have
the same repertoire of self-justifications that everyone has, and are no
more inclined than anyone else to revise their beliefs about the way the
world works, or ought to work, just because they made a mistake. No one
is paying you for your gratuitous opinions about other people, but the
[[experts are **being paid**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Tetlock claims
that [[the better known and more frequently quoted they
are]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the **less reliable** their guesses about
the future are]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to be. The [[**accuracy** of
an expert's predictions]{.mark} **actually [has]{.mark}** [an **inverse
relationship**]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~his or her~~
\[[[their]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[self-confidence]{.underline}]{.mark},
renown, [and]{.underline}, beyond a certain point, [depth of
knowledge]{.underline}. People who follow current events by reading the
papers and newsmagazines regularly can guess what is likely to happen
about as accurately as the specialists whom the papers quote. [[Our
system of expertise is **completely inside out**]{.underline}]{.mark}:
it [[rewards **bad judgments** over good ones]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"Expert Political Judgment" is not a work of media criticism. [Tetlock
is a **[psychologist]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- he teaches at Berkeley
--- and his [[conclusions]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[based on a
**long-term study**]{.underline}]{.mark} that he [[began twenty years
ago]{.underline}]{.mark}. He [[picked two hundred and eighty-four
people]{.mark} who made their living]{.underline} "commenting or
offering advice on political and economic trends," [and]{.underline} he
[started [asking them to assess]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[probability]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[various things would or would
not come to pass]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[areas]{.mark} of the world [in which they
**specialized**]{.mark}]{.underline} and in areas about which they were
not expert. [[Would there be a nonviolent end]{.mark} to apartheid [in
South Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}? [[Would Gorbachev be ousted]{.mark}
in a coup]{.underline}? [[Would the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [go to war in the Persian Gulf]{.mark}]{.underline}?
[[Would Canada disintegrate]{.underline}]{.mark}? (Many experts believed
that it would, on the ground that Quebec would succeed in seceding.) And
so on. By the end of the study, in 2003, the
[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[made **82,361
forecasts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Tetlock also asked questions designed
to determine how they reached their judgments, how they reacted when
their predictions proved to be wrong, how they evaluated new information
that did not support their views, and how they assessed the probability
that rival theories and predictions were accurate.

Tetlock got a statistical handle on his task by putting most of the
forecasting questions into a "three possible futures" form. The
respondents were asked to rate the probability of three alternative
outcomes: the persistence of the status quo, more of something
(political freedom, economic growth), or less of something (repression,
recession). And he measured his experts on two dimensions: how good they
were at guessing probabilities (did all the things they said had an x
per cent chance of happening happen x per cent of the time?), and how
accurate they were at predicting specific outcomes. The results were
unimpressive. On the first scale, the **[[experts performed worse than
they would have if they had simply assigned an equal probability to all
three outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- if they had given each
possible future a thirty-three-per-cent chance of occurring. [Human
beings who spend their lives studying]{.underline} the state of the
world, in other words, [are [poorer forecasters than **dart-throwing
monkeys**]{.mark}]{.underline}, who would have distributed their picks
evenly over the three choices.

Tetlock also found that specialists are not significantly more reliable
than non-specialists in guessing what is going to happen in the region
they study. Knowing a little might make someone a more reliable
forecaster, but Tetlock found that [knowing a lot]{.underline} can
[actually make a person less reliable]{.underline}. "[[We
reach]{.underline}]{.mark} the point of [[diminishing marginal
**predictive returns**]{.mark} for knowledge **disconcertingly
quickly**]{.underline}," he reports. "In this age of academic
hyperspecialization, there is [[no reason]{.underline}]{.mark} for
supposing that contributors to top journals --- [distinguished political
scientists]{.underline}, [[area]{.mark} study
[specialists]{.mark}]{.underline}, [economists]{.underline}, and so on
--- [[are **any better** than]{.underline}]{.mark} journalists or
**[[attentive readers]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the New York Times in
'reading' emerging situations." And [[the more famous the forecaster the
**more overblown** the forecasts]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"[[Experts]{.underline}]{.mark} in demand," Tetlock says, "[[were **more
overconfident**]{.underline}]{.mark} than their colleagues who eked out
existences far from the limelight."

People who are not experts in the psychology of expertise are likely (I
predict) to find Tetlock's results a surprise and a matter for concern.
For psychologists, though, nothing could be less surprising. "Expert
Political Judgment" is [[just one of **more than a hundred studies**
that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[pitted experts against]{.mark}
**statistical**]{.underline} or **[[actuarial
formulas]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and in]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
[[all of those studies the people]{.underline}]{.mark} either do no
better than the formulas or [[do **worse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In one
study, college counsellors were given information about a group of
high-school students and asked to predict their freshman grades in
college. The counsellors had access to test scores, grades, the results
of personality and vocational tests, and personal statements from the
students, whom they were also permitted to interview. Predictions that
were produced by a formula using just test scores and grades were more
accurate. There are also many studies showing that expertise and
experience do not make someone a better reader of the evidence. In one,
data from a test used to diagnose brain damage were given to a group of
clinical psychologists and their secretaries. The psychologists'
diagnoses were no better than the secretaries'.

The experts' trouble in Tetlock's study is exactly the trouble that all
human beings have: [[we **fall in love** with our
hunches]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} we [really]{.underline},
[really hate to be wrong]{.underline}. Tetlock describes an experiment
that he witnessed thirty years ago in a Yale classroom. A rat was put in
a T-shaped maze. Food was placed in either the right or the left
transept of the T in a random sequence such that, over the long run, the
food was on the left sixty per cent of the time and on the right forty
per cent. Neither the students nor (needless to say) the rat was told
these frequencies. The students were asked to predict on which side of
the T the food would appear each time. The rat eventually figured out
that the food was on the left side more often than the right, and it
therefore nearly always went to the left, scoring roughly sixty per cent
--- D, but a passing grade. The students looked for patterns of
left-right placement, and ended up scoring only fifty-two per cent, an
F. The rat, having no reputation to begin with, was not embarrassed
about being wrong two out of every five tries. But Yale students, who do
have reputations, searched for a hidden order in the sequence. They
couldn't deal with forty-per-cent error, so they ended up with almost
fifty-per-cent error.

The expert-prediction game is not much different. When television
pundits make predictions, the more ingenious their forecasts the greater
their cachet. An arresting new prediction means that the expert has
discovered a set of interlocking causes that no one else has spotted,
and that could lead to an outcome that the conventional wisdom is
ignoring. On shows like "The McLaughlin Group," these experts never lose
their reputations, or their jobs, because long shots are their business.
More serious commentators differ from the pundits only in the degree of
showmanship. These serious experts --- [the [think tankers and]{.mark}
**area-studies [professors]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} not entirely out to entertain, but they are a
little [[out to **entertain**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} both [their [status]{.mark} as
experts]{.underline} and their appeal as performers [[require them to
predict futures that are **not obvious**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
viewer. The producer of the show does not want you and me to sit there
listening to an expert and thinking, I could have said that. The
[[expert]{.mark} also [suffers from **knowing too
much**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[the more facts an expert
has]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the **more
information**]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[available to be enlisted in
support of]{.underline}]{.mark} his or her
\[[[their]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[pet theories]{.underline}]{.mark},
and the more chains of causation he or she \[they\] can find beguiling.
This helps explain why specialists fail to outguess non-specialists. The
odds tend to be with the obvious.

Tetlock's experts were also no different from the rest of us when it
came to learning from their mistakes. Most people tend to dismiss new
information that doesn't fit with what they already believe. Tetlock
found that his experts used a double standard: they were much tougher in
assessing the validity of information that undercut their theory than
they were in crediting information that supported it. The same
deficiency leads liberals to read only The Nation and conservatives to
read only National Review. We are not natural falsificationists: we
would rather find more reasons for believing what we already believe
than look for reasons that we might be wrong. In the terms of Karl
Popper's famous example, to verify our intuition that all swans are
white we look for lots more white swans, when what we should really be
looking for is one black swan.

Also, people tend to see the future as indeterminate and the past as
inevitable. If you look backward, the dots that lead up to Hitler or the
fall of the Soviet Union or the attacks on September 11th all connect.
If you look forward, it's just a random scatter of dots, many potential
chains of causation leading to many possible outcomes. We have no idea
today how tomorrow's invasion of a foreign land is going to go; after
the invasion, we can actually persuade ourselves that we knew all along.
The result seems inevitable, and therefore predictable. Tetlock found
that, consistent with this asymmetry, experts routinely misremembered
the degree of probability they had assigned to an event after it came to
pass. They claimed to have predicted what happened with a higher degree
of certainty than, according to the record, they really did. When this
was pointed out to them, by Tetlock's researchers, they sometimes became
defensive.

And, like most of us, experts violate a fundamental rule of
probabilities by tending to find scenarios with more variables more
likely. If a prediction needs two independent things to happen in order
for it to be true, its probability is the product of the probability of
each of the things it depends on. If there is a one-in-three chance of x
and a one-in-four chance of y, the probability of both x and y occurring
is one in twelve. But we often feel instinctively that if the two events
"fit together" in some scenario the chance of both is greater, not less.
The classic "Linda problem" is an analogous case. In this experiment,
subjects are told, "Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken,
and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply
concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice and also
participated in antinuclear demonstrations." They are then asked to rank
the probability of several possible descriptions of Linda today. Two of
them are "bank teller" and "bank teller and active in the feminist
movement." People rank the second description higher than the first,
even though, logically, its likelihood is smaller, because it requires
two things to be true --- that Linda is a bank teller and that Linda is
an active feminist --- rather than one.

Plausible detail makes us believers. When subjects were given a choice
between an insurance policy that covered hospitalization for any reason
and a policy that covered hospitalization for all accidents and
diseases, they were willing to pay a higher premium for the second
policy, because the added detail gave them a more vivid picture of the
circumstances in which it might be needed. In 1982, an experiment was
done with professional forecasters and planners. One group was [[asked
to assess]{.mark} the [probability of]{.mark}]{.underline} "a [[complete
suspension of diplomatic relations between the U.S.
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark},
sometime in 1983," [[and]{.mark} [another group]{.mark}]{.underline} was
[asked to [assess]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[probability]{.underline}
[o]{.underline}]{.mark}[f]{.underline} "[a [Russian invasion of
Poland]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} a [complete suspension of
diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometime in 1983." The [[experts judged the
**second scenario** **more likely** than the
**first**]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though it required two separate
events to occur. [[They were **seduced**]{.mark} by the
detail]{.underline}.

#### IR studies is [intrinsically]{.underline} tied to hegemonic institutions, dictating the roles of war and security despite its [lack of explanatory power]{.underline} --- the denial of imperialism, climate change, racism, gendered violence, and nuclear war is only made possible through [corrosive nihilism]{.underline} that engineers new terrains to make US imperialism more [insidious]{.underline} and [lethal]{.underline}.

Because I wanted this book to inspire curiosity beyond the boundaries of
international relations (ir), I considered ignoring the field
altogether, removing all mentions of ir or ir theory. However, upon
closer reflection, I have decided to keep these references as I think
they are relevant for those outside the discipline and for those who,
like myself, often feel alienated within its disciplinary boundaries. In
the former case, it is important to know that, unlike some more humble
fields, [[ir]{.mark} has always [held itself to be a]{.mark} kind of
**[royal science.]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[Scholarship in
ir,]{.underline}** [particularly in the United States, is half research,
and half **biding time until you have the prince's ear.**]{.underline}
[The **hallowed names in the mainstream** of the field are still known
because they somehow **changed the behavior of their intended
clients**]{.underline}---those being [states, militaries, and
international organizations]{.underline}. Therefore, some attention to
[[ir]{.underline}]{.mark} is necessary because [it [has an
**all-too-casual relationship** with **institutional power**]{.mark}
that **directly impacts** the **lives of real people**, and ir is **all
too often lethal theory**]{.underline}.39 [As an American discipline,
the political economy of the field is impossible without Department of
Defense money, and its semiotic economy would be equally dwarfed without
contributory figures like Woodrow Wilson, Henry Kissinger, and Samuel
Huntington.]{.underline} The ubiquity of Huntington's "clash of
civilizations" thesis and Kissinger's particular brand of realpolitik
are undeniable throughout the field, as well as the world.40 Each, in
their own way, has saturated the watchwords and nomenclature of
geopolitics from an American perspective so thoroughly that both
political parties in the United States fight over who gets to claim the
heritage of each. Although many other fields such as anthropology and
even comparative literature have found themselves in the gravitational
pull of geopolitics, [[i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [is
meant to be scholarship as statecraft]{.mark} by other
means]{.underline}.41 That is[, ir was meant [to]{.mark} improve the
global order and [ensure the place of]{.mark} its guarantor, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates of America]{.underline}.42 Having spent
the better part of a decade listening to national security analysts and
diplomats from the United States, South Korea, Japan, Europe, China,
Brazil, and Russia, as well as military strategists around the planet, I
found their vocabulary and worldview strikingly homogeneous. If this
seems too general a claim, one should take a peek at John Mearsheimer's
essay "Benign Hegemony," which defends the Americanness of the ir
field.43 What is most telling in this essay is not a defense of the U.S.
as a benign hegemonic power, which Mearsheimer has done at length
elsewhere. Rather, it is his vigorous defense that as a field, ir theory
has done well by the world in setting the intellectual agenda for global
challenges, and for creating useful theoretical approaches to addressing
those problems. For Mearsheimer, the proof that American scholarly
hegemony has been benign is that there is nothing important that has
been left out. A quick scan of the last ten or twenty International
Studies Association conferences would suggest otherwise.
[[That]{.underline}]{.mark} [issues like [rape as a weapon of
war,]{.mark} [postcolonial violence, global racism, and climate change
are not squarely in the main of ir demonstrates]{.mark} just [how
benign]{.mark} American [scholarly heg]{.mark}emony [is
not]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one prominent anthropologist said to me at
dinner after touring the isa conference in 2014, "it was surreal, like a
tour through the Cold War. People were giving papers and arguing as if
nothing had ever changed." These same provincial scholars aspire and
succeed at filling the advisory roles of each successive American
presidency. [One cannot help but see a connection between the history of
the ir field, and the catastrophes of U.S. foreign policy during the
twentieth and twenty-first centuries]{.underline}. One could repeat the
words of the anthropologist I mentioned to describe the 2016
presidential campaign debates over the future of U.S. foreign policy: it
is as if "nothing had ever changed." And yet these [old white men still
strut around the halls of America's "best" institutions as if they saved
us from the Cold War, even as the planet crumbles under the weight of
their failed imperial dreams.]{.underline} If international relations
was meant to be the science of making the world something other than
what it would be if we were all left to our own worst devices, then it
has failed monumentally. [The United States is once again in fierce
nuclear competition with Russia. We are no closer to any significant
action on climate change. We have not met any of the]{.underline}
Millennium Development [Goals]{.underline} determined by the United
Nations [on eradicating poverty]{.underline}. [War and security are the
most significant financial, creative, social, cultural, technological,
and political investments of almost every nation-state on Earth. The
general intellect is a martial intellect. Despite all this failure,
pessimism does not exist in international relations,]{.underline} at
least not on paper[. The seething doom of our current predicament
thrives at the conference bar and in hushed office conversations but not
in our research]{.underline}. In public, [the darkness disavowed
possesses and inflames the petty cynicisms and hatreds that are often
turned outward at tired and predictable scapegoats.]{.underline} After
the fury of three decades of critique, [most [ir scholars]{.mark} still
[camp out]{.mark} either [on the **hill of liberal internationalism**
or]{.mark} in [the]{.mark} **[dark woods of]{.mark} political
[realism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Neither offers much that is new by way
of answers or even explanations, and [each]{.mark} dominant school has
[failed to account for our current]{.mark} apocalyptic
[condition]{.mark}]{.underline}. One is left wondering what it is
exactly that they think they do. [Despite the seeming opposition between
the two, one idealistic about the future of international order
(liberals) and the other self-satisfied with the tragedy of cycles of
war and dominance (realists), both positions are optimists of the
positivist variety. For both warring parties, **[ir optimism is
expressed through]{.mark} a [romantic empiricism]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
[For all those who toil away looking for the next theory of
international politics, order is out there somewhere, and dutifully
recording reality will find it---or at least bring us closer to its
discovery. For liberal internationalism, this will bring the
long-heralded]{.underline} maturity of Immanuel Kant's [perpetual peace.
For second-order sociopaths known as offensive realists, crumbs of
"useful strategic insight" and the endless details that amplify their
epistemophilia for force projection and violence capability represent a
potential "advantage," that is, the possibility to move one step forward
on the global political board game of snakes and ladders]{.underline}.
Still, [the cynicism of ir always creeps back in because the world never
quite lives up to the empirical findings it is commanded to
obey]{.underline}. Disappointment here is not without reason, but **[[we
cynically]{.mark} continue to [make the same policy
recommendations]{.mark}, [catastrophe after
catastrophe]{.mark}.]{.underline}** I have an idea about where ir's
recent malaise comes from. I think it is a moment, just before the
awareness of the Anthropocene, after the Cold War and before September
11, when the end of everything was only a hypothetical problem for those
of a certain coddled and privileged modern form of life. [The
catastrophe of the human predicament was that there was no catastrophe,
no reason, no generation-defining challenge or war. Now the fate of this
form of life is actually imperiled, and it is too much to bear. The
weird denial of sexism, racism, climate change, the sixth extinction,
and loose nukes, all by a field of scholars tasked with studying
geopolitics, is more than irrationalism or ignorance]{.underline}.44
This **[[animosity toward]{.mark} [reality is a deep]{.mark} and
corrosive [nihilism]{.mark}, a denial of the world]{.underline}**. Thus
[ir as a strategic field is demonstrative of a civilization with nothing
left to do, nothing left to destroy. All that is left is to make meaning
out of being incapable of undoing the world that EuroAmerican
geopolitics created. **Emo geopolitics is not pretty, but it is
real**]{.underline}. [The letdown, the failure, the
apocalypse-that-was-not finally arrived, and we are too
late.]{.underline} Still, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates of
America [continues to]{.mark} follow the advice of "the best and the
brightest," [test]{.mark}ing [the imperial waters, not]{.mark} quite
[ready to **commit**]{.mark} **out loud [to empire]{.mark}** but
completely [unwilling to abandon it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Stuck in
between, contemporary geopolitics---as curated by the United States---is
in a permanent beta phase. [**[Neuro-torture]{.mark}**, **[algorithmic
warfare]{.mark}**, [**drone strikes**, and **cybernetic
nation-building** are not means]{.mark} or ends [but]{.mark} rather are
[tests]{.mark}. Can a polis be engineered? Can the human operating
system be reformatted? [Can]{.mark} [**violence be modulated** until
**legally invisible while**]{.mark} **all the [more lethal]{.mark}**?
Each incursion, each new actor or actant, and **[new terrains from
brains to transatlantic cables]{.mark}**---all [find themselves part of
a **grand**]{.mark} [**experiment** to see if a **benign or at least
sustainable empire** is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is no
seeming regard for the fact that each experiment directly competes with
Thomas Jefferson's democratic experiment. [One wonders if freedom can
even exist anywhere other than temporarily on the fringe of some
neglected order. Is this some metaphysical condition of freedom, or is
the world so supersaturated with martial orders that the ragged edges
between imperial orders are all that we have left?]{.underline} It feels
like [freedom's remains persist only in the ruins of everything
else]{.underline}. [No space is left that can be truly indifferent to
the law, security, or economy. Such is the new life of a human in debt.
The social contract has been refinanced as what is owed and nothing
more: politics without equity. Inequity without equality. What about the
impending collapse of the post--World War II order, the self-destruction
of the United States, the rise of China and a new world
order?]{.underline} If humanity lasts long enough for China to put its
stamp on the human apocalypse, I will write a new introduction. Until
then, [[we live in the **death rattle of Pax
Americana**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While I think the totality of this
claim is true, I do not want to rule out that many of us throughout the
world still make lives otherwise. Many of us even thrive in spite of it
all. And yet, no form of life can be made that escapes the fact that
[everything can come to a sudden and arbitrary end thanks to the whim of
an American drone operator, nuclear catastrophe, or macroeconomic
manipulation like sanctions.]{.underline} There are other ways to die
and other organized forms of killing outside the control of the United
States; however, [no other single apparatus can make everyone or anyone
die irrespective of citizenship or geographic location]{.underline}. For
me, this is the most inescapable philosophical provocation of our moment
in time. [The haphazard and seemingly limitless nature of U.S. violence
means that even the [core principles of]{.mark} the great political
[realist concepts]{.mark} like order and national interest [are being
displaced by **subterranean violence entrepreneurs** that **populate
transversal battlefields,**]{.mark} security corridors, and border
zones]{.underline}.45 Mercenaries, drug lords, chief executive officers,
presidents, and sports commissioners are more alike than ever.46
Doomsayers like Paul Virilio, Lewis Mumford, and Martin Heidegger
foretold a kind of terminal and selfannihilating velocity for
geopolitics' technological saturation, but even their lack of
imagination appears optimistic. [American geopolitics does not know
totality or finality; it bleeds, mutates, and reforms]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the peril of biopolitics seems now almost
romantic]{.underline}. To make life live? Perchance to dream. [The care
and concern for life's productivity is increasingly subsumed by
plasticity---forming and reforming without regard to the telos of
productivity, division, or normative order.]{.underline} There are, of
course, still orders in our geoplastic age, but they are almost
unrecognizable as such. [When so many citizens and states are directly
invested in sabotaging publicly stated strategic ends, then concepts
like national interest seem equally quaint. [We are witnessing]{.mark}
creative and horrifying [experiments in the affirmative production of
dying]{.mark}, which also deprive those targeted and in some cases whole
populations from the relief of death]{.underline}. To follow Rucker, I
want to try to see the world for what it is. We can only say that
tragedy is no longer a genre of geopolitics. Tragedy redeems. [The
**occluded character of [contemporary]{.mark} [geopolitics]{.mark}**
shoehorned into [experience produces the feeling that there is]{.mark}
no relief, no [reason]{.mark}, no victory, no defeats, and no exit
within the confines of national security's constricted
world.]{.underline} This is not tragedy: it is horror. [We live in an
age of horror that, like the victims of gore movies who never quite die
so that they can be tortured more, furthers our practice of collective
violence and goes on for decades as a kind of sustainable
warfare]{.underline}.

#### IR theory is a [colonialist epistemic approach]{.underline} masked under the "[objectivity]{.underline}" of science and "[universality]{.underline}" of truth, created only to support the [global Western empire]{.underline}.

[Global coloniality privileges a Euro-North American-centric form of
humanity,]{.underline} at the expense of diminishing, dismissing and
**[obliterating]{.underline}** [anything else other than the Euro-North
American-centric civilisation, in the process making Euro-North
American-centric modernity a **global empire**]{.underline}. [The
politics of empire]{.underline} are problematic because they [set
precedence and justify and perpetuate global coloniality]{.underline}.
This is the conundrum that confronted and enveloped Libya in 2011 [with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)-led invasion]{.underline}
and which continues to entangle and disenfranchise the Libyan polity
today (2019), [hence the need for a **decolonial epistemic approach**
that seeks to re-humanise and affirm all forms of humanity]{.underline}.
This chapter seeks to disentangle and strips bare the [asymmetrical
global power structural configurations]{.underline} that the current
world order rests upon and which [are camouflaged in the so-called
**objectivity of science** and the skewed **universality of
knowledge**]{.underline}. [The current socio-economic-politico world
order is a creation and direct result of modern European thought and
civilisation]{.underline} [(**modernity**)]{.underline}. It was
scattered across the world through the violence of colonialism. [In
turn, colonialism produced global coloniality]{.underline}. The turning
point is that [global coloniality entraps humanity to a predetermined
reality modelled on Euro-North American-centric modernity]{.underline}.
Thus, [coloniality is limiting to and eliminates 'other' epistemological
creativities; it hinders 'other' ontological expressions of what
humanity is and could be 'other' than the predetermined Euro-North
American-centric form of being and knowledge]{.underline}. This logic
results in the social, political, economic and epistemic creation and
definition of the human and the non-human by 'other' human beings.
**[Modernity negates]{.underline}**, [forcibly condemns forms of
humanity found in the peripheries of EuroNorth American civilisation, to
non-humanity]{.underline}. Non-human beings are co[nsidered beings of a
lesser ontological value]{.underline} than humans of Euro-North American
ancestry. [Because there is no humanity in the peripheries of the
Euro-North American-centric world, any enterprise or innovation from the
zone of non-being cannot be good enough]{.underline} (Fanon). [**Libya**
could have not been successful, it could not have been an example of a
decolonial state, hence it had to fail because it threatened the
established Eurocentric world order]{.underline}.

Coloniality of Power and the Global Power Structural Configuration:
Unmasking the Politics and Philosophy of Empire

Epistemologically, this chapter seeks to unmask the fault lines of the
philosophy of the European-centric empire as implicated in the
generation of problems epitomised by the invasion of Libya in 2011 by
NATO forces. It seeks to do so, by exposing some myths that informed,
fueled and continue to precipitate global coloniality in the absence of
physical colonialism. Current international relations (IR) theories have
proven to be limited and unable to solve and eradicate this epistemic
challenge, partly because [dominant and traditional **IR theories** are
located in the very European modernity that they disguise and camouflage
in the purported **objectivity of science**]{.underline}. [The
philosophy of the Eurocentric empire universalised these particular
theories of IR by force (violence of colonialism) as they are part of
the modernity project of colonisation]{.underline} (Howe 1990: 677). The
chapter further aims to demonstrate the deficiency and [bankruptcy that
foregrounds traditional IR]{.underline} theories'
[assumptions]{.underline}, assertions and proclamations particularly
[that Western-centric IR theories are scientific, objective and
universally applicable or replicable]{.underline}. [Such proclamations
overlook the fact that these IR theories are located in particular
ecologies of Europe and therefore, are subjective]{.underline}. All
knowledge is particular and subjective to its ecology or locality. Since
1919, the official initial academic inquiry of IR as a discipline, [IR
theories have not adequately addressed what the discipline initially set
out to do---to curb and liquidate international conflict]{.underline}.
This suggests that [the]{.underline} **[epistemologies]{.underline}**
(particular epistemic ecologies and localities) [that have informed IR
theories]{.underline} to date are inadequate and [have reached
some]{.underline} sort of cul-de-sac, or a **[dead-end]{.underline}**.
These epistemologies [beg the question and engage **in circular
reasoning**]{.underline}. [This necessitates an **alternative frame of
reference**]{.underline}. Contingent upon Albert Einstein's idea that
insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a
different result each time, this chapter opts to engage a
non-conventional theory in the discipline of IR. As such, this work
advances the decolonial perspective as a possible solution to problems
caused by epistemologies located in the ecologies and localities of
Western, Euro-North American-centric modernity that purport themselves
as objective, scientific and universal. The chapter will unmask the
inadequacies of Euro-North American-centric modernity in the face of
mounting and current global problems, particularly those played out in
the field of international relations. IR as an academic discipline
started in 1919 at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now Aberystwyth
University), a year after the end of World War I (Ziegler 1987). This,
however, as Nyere (2014: 18) argues, "does not mean that intellectual
origins of political realism and liberalism only started in 1919". The
main objective and aim of IR theorising was solely to find peaceful
solutions to international disputes and therefore avert a similar
conflict to World War I. IR failed in that regard because just barely
after a decade, World War II started. Like the predecessor of the United
Nations, the League of Nations, IR as an academic discipline has failed
in achieving what it set out to do in the first place. Since 1945, the
end of World War II and the signing of the United Nations Charter in San
Francisco, USA, there has not been a single decade that the world has
not witnessed an international conflict or war (Bennet 1998: 7).
[Rational theories in the discipline of IR, such as
realism]{.underline}, liberalism, feminism, Marxism and constructivism,
[are]{.underline} expressive of ideas, concepts and views [located in
modernity]{.underline}. The ideas expressed in IR rational theories are
[embodied by scholars that are mainly located in modernity, particularly
from the Global North and reflect the rationale of **European
modernity**]{.underline}. [The major problem of modernity is the
inexplicable discrepancy and inconsistency between its rhetoric and its
lived reality, its **illusion vis-à-vis its essence**, particularly from
the experience of people of the **Global South** in general, but by
Africans in particular]{.underline}. As such, this chapter intends to
unmask the inadequacy of mainstream theories and lenses in explaining
the ghosts and blindspots of empire because these [ghosts and
blind-spots are born within the empire]{.underline}. [The
European-centric empire is **not** sufficiently **able** to be reflexive
on its theories and to see **beyond its assumptions** and
assertions]{.underline}. As such, this chapter suggests the need to
explore outside the lenses of established theory.

#### IR and international institutions are the [onset of colonialism]{.underline} meant to [circumscribe]{.underline} the [Eurocentric world order]{.underline}.

[The very idea of theory is Eurocentric]{.underline} and compels some
attention. [Theorising and epistemic enterprises that emanated from the
European civilisation regarded themselves as the **standard** and
**measure** with which every other theorising or epistemic enterprising
ought to refer to.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} **[further entrenched
Eurocentrism]{.underline}**. Consequently, Eurocentrism justified and
gave rise to European colonisation. [If Europe was the standard with
which all being and knowledge was to be modelled on]{.underline}, this
then justified, and suggested to Europeans, that [they ought to control
and order the whole world. This was the **onset of
colonialism**]{.underline}. Kissinger notes that [the contemporary world
order, which is Eurocentric and a creation of modernity, has attempted
to]{.underline} **[circumscribe the anarchical structure]{.underline}**
[in which]{.underline} **[international relations]{.underline}** [are
conducted]{.underline}. It does so [through]{.underline}
**[international relations theories]{.underline}** [and international
legal networks (international law), international organisational
structures]{.underline} (chief among them is the United Nations),
[international financial systems]{.underline} such as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG), these two [endorse
and sustain capitalism, and through establishing
conflict/dispute-resolution mechanisms as well as codifying the conduct
in war of warring parties, should war occur]{.underline} (Kissinger
2014: 7). In other words, there is an acceptance of [the status quo in
relation to the current world order]{.underline}, such that it [is
codified, legislated and institutionalised. But, why not abolish wars in
the first place or stop the domination of one civilisation by another
civilisation? The paradigm that presents war as an **acceptable means**
of dispute-resolution is problematic because the solution to this
paradigm is **violence**]{.underline}. One wonders therefore that, [is
the UN perpetuating coloniality of power in itself, or is the UN used as
an instrument to perpetuate coloniality of power by the Euro-North
American-centric modernity that has captured this institution for its
own agenda of domination?]{.underline} Worse still, [was there ever a
time when the UN was not captured by the Euro-North American-centric
modernity?]{.underline}

#### International relations erases the history of violence and exploitation which informed the making for the global order.

discussions of** **race**, gender, sexuality, **and class are**
**compelled to live outside** **the house or relegated to poorer
neighborhoods** in a gentrified international relations]{.underline}.
This is not to say that those outside the house or in poor neighborhoods
do not aspire to "theorize grandly about the world." On the
contrary---and much like Weber's claim with regard to queer
international relations---[they too are concerned]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} "**[classic IR themes]{.underline}** [such as
war]{.underline}, [security, sovereignty, intervention, hegemony,
nationalism]{.underline}, [empire, colonialism, and the general practice

(Weber, [2015](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0092),
p. 28). Yet, **[their]{.underline}** intellectual "**[starting
point]{.underline}**" [**is the particular positioned histories and

However, this disciplinary antagonism toward "the issue of
positionality" does not mean we can simply ignore its role in
international relations. Anthropologists have long argued that a
discussion on positionality is integral to any critical scholarly
engagement with the process of knowledge production. In fact, they would
question the very possibility of achieving (natural) scientific
objectivity in the social sciences
(Abu-Lughod, [1991](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0009);

Within international relations, feminist scholars have been at the
forefront of discussions on positionality. This concern with the
positioned and gendered nature of knowledge production in international
relations is evident, for instance, in the claim by Christine Sylvester
([1994](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0080))
that "the trouble with IR" is that even though the discipline claims to
be "gender blind" and "a realm of objective human knowledge," it is
largely a subjective retelling of men's perspectives on politics. This
is not to say women are absent. They appear as "visitors" of the
discipline and as companions of men. However, men have a secure home in
the discipline, whereas women are viewed as "suited for other places"
(Sylvester, [1994](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0080),
p. 4). V. Spike Peterson
([2004](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0064))
argues that the discipline has an overwhelming focus on "masculinist
constructs such as sovereignty, national security, and military
strength." Although "the main story" is often concerned with "what men
do," she proposes a shift in the disciplinary focus toward the
positioned histories and lived experiences of women as a way of
broadening the (overly masculine) conception of the global order
(Peterson, [2004](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0064),
p. 37). It is then in this sense that, in their introduction to Feminist
Methodologies of International Relations, Ackerly et al.
([2010](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0012))
underline that "feminist ontologies" lead to a much self-reflective
approach to the discipline. They make us rethink our theoretical and
methodological assumptions and include "personal and previously
invisible spheres" as locations rife with knowledge on international
relations (Ackerly et
al., [2010](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0012),
p. 7).

Evidently, an effort to formulate a feminist retelling of the main story
motivated Carol Cohn
([2006](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0030))
as she explored the deeply gendered U.S. national security discourses
with regard to "nuclear weaponry and strategy." And, while describing
the encounter between her particular positioned perspective as a
feminist international relations scholar and these discourses, she
wrote,

The manufacture and stockpiling of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons,
the quest for more "useable nukes" and more "survivable" weapons
delivery systems---all of it seemed so wildly irrational to me that I
was consumed by the questions: "How can they do this? How can they even
think this way?" Initially, those questions were more expressions of
moral anguish and political despair than anything I might have ever
thought of as "a good research question." However, the intensity of my
concern led me to take an opportunity to learn about nuclear weapons
from some of the men who make their living thinking about nuclear
weaponry and strategy. (p. 91)

The urge to broaden the conception of the global order through the
positioned realities of women was equally visible in Cynthia Enloe's
([1989](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0036))
iconic Bananas, Beaches and Bases as the very purpose of the text---that
is, to articulate a feminist view of international relations. Here,
Enloe reveals the varied positioned presence/absence of women as she
deliberates the implications of a European woman holidaying in Jamaica,
the reality that "governments look like men's clubs," and the absence of
women in the congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra Affair (p. 8).

[The introduction]{.underline} [of race]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
the [teaching]{.underline} of international relations [is]{.underline}
also [elaborative]{.underline} [of the positioned nature]{.underline}
[of knowledge production]{.underline} in the discipline. Undoubtedly,
[the **writings**]{.underline} of the (White) founding members [**were
rooted** in]{.underline} the **[perspectives]{.underline}** **[of the
White nations]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} were [explicit in their
support for]{.underline} ([White]{.underline}) [imperial
domination]{.underline} in international relations. [It was
then]{.underline} as [a critique of this positioned]{.underline} (i.e.,
White) [character]{.underline} of the discipline's intellectual
foundations [that]{.underline} [the revisionist founders]{.underline} of
international relations [sought to reconsider]{.underline} [the
rationale]{.underline} [of imperial domination]{.underline} and reveal
the impact of imperially formed racialized hierarchies on the lives of
the darker races. In this sense, [they sought to elucidate]{.underline}
[the darker races' experiences]{.underline} of [and perspectives
on]{.underline} a hierarchical [international
relations]{.underline}---[perspectives]{.underline} [that are otherwise
missing]{.underline} [in the discipline's conception of the
world]{.underline}. [The **color**]{.underline} **[line]{.underline}**
[**plays** an equally **pertinent** role in the present-day]{.underline}
workings of [international relations]{.underline},
[determining]{.underline} the (**[racialized]{.underline}**)
**[positionality]{.underline}** [of knowledge production]{.underline}.
Siba N. Grovogui
([2001](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0044))
argues this is most visible in the discipline's internalization of
certain discourses regarding the hierarchies that exist among
"civilizations, cultures and races." While elaborating this existing
hierarchy, in view of the West's relation with Africa, he then asks, How
did the "'West' become 'white'" and, with it, a personification of
"cultural adaptability, political competency, and ethical versatility"?
Similarly, [how did "'Africa' become 'black']{.underline} [and the
symbol of international dysfunction]{.underline}"? As an answer,
[Grovogui elaborates that this]{.underline} [**distinction functions**
**as a means to position African**]{.underline} [**as a "counterpoint to
the European trajectory**"]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, in doing so,
[justify Western authority]{.underline} [in determining the
rules]{.underline} [and norms of]{.underline} [international
politics]{.underline} (p. 427). Meera [Sabaratnam]{.underline}
([2020](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0070))
[was thus right to argue that]{.underline} [the positionality of
international]{.underline} [relations]{.underline} [was that of a White
discipline]{.underline}, [premised on a "set of]{.underline}
[epistemological tropes]{.underline}, locations, assumptions, [and
commitments that]{.underline} [naturalise racialised
accounts]{.underline}" [of the global order]{.underline} (p. 3).

Of course, in [any discussion]{.underline} [of racialized
positionalities]{.underline} in international relations, it [seems
instinctive to]{.underline} [treat disciplinary Whiteness]{.underline}
[as an outgrowth of individual identities]{.underline} and a reflection
of an author's "skin colour, conscious intentions or places of origin."
But [although]{.underline} [the individual is not
irrelevant]{.underline} in this discussion, [the concern
here]{.underline} [is]{.underline} rather [the way in which]{.underline}
[the individual is embedded in the]{.underline} [racialized "hierarchies
of the human]{.underline}" [and embodies an intellectual
"'standpoint']{.underline} [rooted in structural power]{.underline}"
(Sabaratnam, [2020](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0070),
p. 3). David Lake
([2016](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0059))
further elaborates this correlation between the hierarchies of humans
and one's racialized intellectual standpoint in view his own
positionality---namely as a White man, implicated in the development of
a White discipline. He argues that [**all theories** are **based on an
implicit expectation**]{.underline} "[about **how the universe**, social
life, or politics '**works'**]{.underline}" (p. 1113). As Lake then goes
on to explain, this intuitive understanding of the world is based on
lived experiences. But because [the overwhelming **majority**
of]{.underline} the international relations [**scholars are White
men**,]{.underline} the discipline's mainstream includes theoretical
approaches that primarily encapsulate the White, male lived experience
(pp. 1113--1114). Of course, in effect, [this]{.underline} also
**[excludes]{.underline}** [approaches]{.underline} [that illuminate the
**non-White lived experience**]{.underline} of the ways in which race
and racism continue to order the discipline and global politics.
Bringing this discussion to the classroom then, Vitalis
([2015](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0090))
proposes that this White, male-ness of the discipline's core has become
codified as international relations' "origin story," which is then
passed on to (White) graduate students as they are socialized into the
discipline through the various "rituals of PhD programs." Afterwards, as
"freshly minted PhDs and new assistant professors," they are keen on
remaining within the bounds of the discipline's mainstream. So, they too
pass on the same "story"---along with a White, male intuitive
understanding of how the world works---to "generations of undergraduates
who will become public intellectuals, politicians, and policymakers" (p.
6).

[With such a display]{.underline} [of]{.underline} disciplinary
[Whiteness]{.underline} in view---rooted not least in a particular
understanding of hierarchies of human---[it is not surprising
that]{.underline}, for example, [the Howard School is]{.underline}
[missing in international relations' origin story]{.underline}. It is
for the same reasons that international relations has entirely ignored
Native American perspectives on politics and Indigenous communities'
critique of settler colonial conceptions of democracy, sovereignty,
"rule of law," and "American exceptionalism"
(Ferguson, [2016](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0039),
p. 1029); or that even when discussions of race and racism were
momentarily revived in international relations in the 1970s, they
appeared in the works of African American and Afro-Caribbean scholars
rather those of their White counterparts
(Vitalis, [2015](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0090),
p. 13). [Who we are]{.underline}, [and **how we are positioned** in
racialized hierarchies]{.underline} that **[order global politics and
society]{.underline}**, evidently [positions that nature of the
knowledge that we produce. And, for the teaching of the field, this
discussion of positionality reveals that the foundational scholarly
norms and assumptions in international relations are hardly a given;
they are deeply contested]{.underline}
(Isaac, [2016](https://oxfordre-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/internationalstudies/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-666?rskey=rPTCRk#acrefore-9780190846626-e-666-bibItem-0054),

2016](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084)).
Moreover, 'in a historical sense -- and especially when seen from the
South -- the Cold War was a continuation of colonialism through slightly
different means. . . For the Third World, [the continuum]{.underline}
[of which the]{.underline} [Cold War forms]{.underline} [a part did not
start]{.underline} in 1945, or even 1917, [but in 1878]{.underline} --

imperialist powers']{.underline} ([Westad,

[takes us back to]{.underline} [the **future of America's
racist-colonial drive** in the 19th]{.underline} [and early]{.underline}
[20th centuries]{.underline} (see [Go,
2011](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084); [Hunt,
1987](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084)).
But [all of this]{.underline} necessarily **[flies under
neorealism's]{.underline}** ontological **[radar scanner]{.underline}**
[given its evacuation]{.underline} [of social process]{.underline}
[**through** its **reification** **of** the structural **logic of
anarchy that is coupled with** the deployment of the
**Eurocentric/racist method of 'analytical bifurcation'**]{.underline},
[**wherein** **racist-imperial processes** **are bracketed out** and
silenced in favour of **focusing** **solely** **on intra-Western white
activities** (]{.underline}[Go,

[This first move]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[complemented]{.underline} [by neorealism's second]{.underline},
[wherein]{.underline} [a **subliminal cultural-racist
theory**]{.underline} [is applied to analysing]{.underline}
[world]{.underline} [politics]{.underline}. Notable here is that
[European **empires**]{.underline} **[constituted]{.underline}**

[and, third,]{.underline} [Waltz's claim that]{.underline} [**sovereign
states** **are** the **dominant form** of polity]{.underline} [under
modern anarchy]{.underline} [**is undermined** **by** the presence of
**colonial hierarchy**]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}** [the very
recent era of **decolonization**]{.underline} [wherein]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [only]{.underline} [sovereign states that]{.underline}
[existed were Western]{.underline}. Accordingly, [Waltz's move serves to
let Western imperialism off the moral hook]{.underline}, thereby
[reflecting an 'epistemology of ignorance']{.underline} ([Sabaratnam,

2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084)).
Interestingly, we find an evacuation and naturalization of Western
empire in the classical realist work of Hans Morgenthau ([Hobson,
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):

(2014)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084) to
talk of 'imperial realism'.

By contrast, Robert [Gilpin's]{.underline} [neorealist]{.underline}
**[hegemonic stability theory]{.underline}** **[embraces]{.underline}**
[a **normative**]{.underline} (direct) **[imperialism]{.underline}**
[that is dressed up]{.underline} [in terms that]{.underline} [dare not
speak its name]{.underline} ([Hobson,
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
193--203). [**[Gilpin]{.underline}**
(1987)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084) **[differentiates]{.underline}**
[**hegemons** **from empires,**]{.underline} [**where the latter
exploit** non-Western]{.underline} [states]{.underline} [**while the
former help them** **through** the **hegemon's self-sacrificial
provision**]{.underline} [of global public goods]{.underline}. But
**[the paternalist sign]{.underline}** [of US hierarchical
hegemony]{.underline} **[is that it
supposedly uplifts states]{.underline}** around the world, [with East
Asian states]{.underline} [singled out as the most
egregious]{.underline} [and ungrateful free riders]{.underline} [that
benefit most from hegemonic largesse]{.underline}. Thus, what Gilpin
misses is that [**the conception of uplift** **reconvenes**]{.underline}
[**Britain's** paternalist-imperial **civilizing mission**]{.underline}
of the 19th century, though this elision is inevitable given that he
re-visions the British Empire as a benign liberal hegemon.
Significantly, Niall [[Ferguson]{.underline}
(2004)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084) [effectively
reconvenes]{.underline} [Gilpin's argument]{.underline}, [though he
talks explicitly]{.underline} [about the benign liberal
imperialism]{.underline} [of Britain and America]{.underline}. Moreover,
**[this benign conception]{.underline}** that **[reflects an
epistemology of ignorance]{.underline}** [**effectively boils off the
coercive side** **of empire**]{.underline} [in the subliminal
cultural-racist distillation process]{.underline}, [thereby
**providing** an **apologia for Anglo-Saxon imperialism**]{.underline}.

Similar [cultural racist logics]{.underline} [play out in
liberalism]{.underline} (see [Hobson,
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
216--222, 285--310). [While]{.underline} [the normative]{.underline}
(direct) [imperialist]{.underline} [posture]{.underline} that [is found
in John ]{.underline}[[Rawls's]{.underline}
(1999)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084) [The
Law of]{.underline} [Peoples]{.underline} [is a very obvious
example]{.underline} ([Hobson,
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
292--295), nevertheless [the hard test-case here]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [that of neoliberal institutionalism]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} received [wisdom is that **neoliberal
institutionalism**]{.underline} **[presents]{.underline}** [a genuinely
'universal']{.underline} [picture or **flattened ontology of all states
learning to cooperate** in order to]{.underline} [enhance their
gains]{.underline}. But it turns out that, in After Hegemony, [Keohane
(1984)](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084) confines
this process to Western states (as did Norman Angell before him).
Moreover, [**absent here is a historical-sociological**
**analysis**]{.underline} **[that would reveal the hierarchical-imperial
contexts]{.underline}** [**that** **have driven both Western
unity**]{.underline} ([Sabaratnam,
2020](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
25[) **and the global process by which unequal gains**]{.underline}
[**accrue to the West** **at the expense of the non-West**.]{.underline}
Paradoxically, constructivists critique neoliberal institutionalism for
its rational actor model by asserting that interests are not a priori
but are formed through socialization. However, a close reading of
Keohane's book reveals that it is Western norms and identity that
socialize Western states into cooperating ([Keohane,
1984](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
5--7, 43, 182). Accordingly, Keohane not only looks specifically at
Western states as the successful actors, but argues that they take
specifically Western cultural values such as democracy and liberal
capitalism to the table before they enter iterated prisoner's dilemma
games ([Keohane,
1984](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
182).

[One of several]{.underline} (direct) [neo-imperialist cues]{.underline}
in Keohane's work [emerges]{.underline} [from his approval of US
hegemonic]{.underline} [intervention]{.underline} and intervention by
international financial institutions in the Global South as a means of
extending complex interdependence across the world. But
[here]{.underline} the **[international financial
institutions]{.underline}** **[act as paternalist neo-imperial
vehicles]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** the cultural
**[conversion]{.underline}** [**of non-Western states** **along Western
neoliberal capitalist lines**]{.underline} [via]{.underline} the
[imposition of neoliberal conditionality]{.underline} and structural
adjustment programmes. Moreover, [the]{.underline} notorious
[resentment]{.underline} [that these programmes]{.underline}
[have]{.underline} [invoked]{.underline} [in many
non-Western]{.underline} [states]{.underline}, all of which disappears
in Keohane's analysis, [takes us back to the]{.underline} [future of the
'unequal treaties']{.underline} [that emerged under]{.underline}
[Britain's informal imperialism in the 19th century]{.underline}, much
as the paternalist role of the international financial institutions
finds its historical parallel with the League of Nations Mandate System
([Anghie,
2005](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
245--272). And, finally, Keohane's approval of Anglo-Saxon hegemony in
the 19th and 20th centuries returns us to the problems that I discussed
above vis-a-vis hegemonic stability theory (see also [Sabaratnam,
2020](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
18--19).

[A notable example]{.underline} [of an indirect imperialist approach
is]{.underline} [found]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the **[neoliberal
theory of globalization]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline}
**[rehabilitates]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} classical
**[liberalism]{.underline}** [of Adam Smith and]{.underline} [his
aversion to empire]{.underline} (e.g. [Friedman,
2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084)).
But there are three subliminal neo-imperialist cues here, the first
comprising [Friedman's
(2000](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
101--111) argument that **[non-Western states]{.underline}** [**have no
choice but to 'don the golden** **straitjacket'**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} **[requires]{.underline}** [them to
adopt]{.underline} **[Western neoliberal-capitalist
architectures]{.underline}**. Having to become Western means that the
theory smuggles informal imperialism in through the backdoor of its
Western universalism. Second, [by **subscribing** **to**]{.underline}
[the ontological proposition]{.underline} [that **'the world is
flat'**]{.underline} ([Friedman,
2007](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084)),
[the]{.underline} [neoliberal theory]{.underline} [of
globalization]{.underline} **[conjures]{.underline}** [**Western
imperial/**neo]{.underline}-[imperial **hierarchy**]{.underline} **[and
racial capitalism into thin air,]{.underline}** thereby [naturalizing
rather]{.underline} [than]{.underline} [problematizing these
phenomena]{.underline} via the epistemology of white ignorance. [And,
third, because]{.underline} [Friedman]{.underline} [focuses]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} [rational individuals whose interests]{.underline} [are
a priori]{.underline} [and whose social identity]{.underline} [is
irrelevant to]{.underline} [individual behaviour,]{.underline} racism
and racialized capitalism [are whitewashed from the global
economy.]{.underline}

[Surely]{.underline} **[constructivism]{.underline}**
**[fares]{.underline}** **[much better given its ability to highlight
international racial norms]{.underline}**? [Not]{.underline}
[only]{.underline} [has much of it ignored]{.underline}
[racism]{.underline} in world politics [but the few
constructivists]{.underline} [who]{.underline} have [considered it
argue]{.underline} that [racism]{.underline} [was left behind in world
politics]{.underline} [after 1945]{.underline} ([Finnemore,
2003](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084); [Klotz,
1995](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084)),
[much as imperialism]{.underline} [was]{.underline} [supposedly
outlawed]{.underline} [by the UN in 1960]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} **[whitewashing of racism]{.underline}** and
imperialism from modern world politics [not only **reflects**
the]{.underline} **[illusion]{.underline}** [**that** subliminal
**cultural racism projects** **but is also a vital**
**move**]{.underline} [**because it** **allows**]{.underline} [**liberal
constructivists to portray** Western]{.underline} [**humanitarian**
**interventionism**]{.underline} [and liberal
peacebuilding/state-building]{.underline} [**as a
non-racist/non-imperial project that** **saves oppressed non-Western
peoples**]{.underline}. [It is here]{.underline} that [we
encounter]{.underline} [a subliminal cultural-racist
paternalism]{.underline} [that presents the West as the white
saviour]{.underline} [of the inferior non-Western societies]{.underline}
-- thereby [rehabilitating]{.underline} [the 19th-century conception of
the white man's burden and the civilizing mission]{.underline} --
[and]{.underline} [where]{.underline} [the West is
(re)presented]{.underline} as the altruistic paternalist father of the
non-West ([Hobson,
2012](https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211061084):
302--305). Moreover, [in this liberal imaginary]{.underline} [of
ignorance,]{.underline} [**the notion that
peacebuilding/state-building** **is initiated as a means of eradicating
the threat** of the deviant non]{.underline}-[Western]{.underline}
[Other]{.underline} **[disappears from view]{.underline}**, [as does the
legacy of Western empire **that created some of the core problems** in
non-Western states **that** **prompted intervention in the first
place**]{.underline} (for further postcolonial critiques of liberal
constructivism, see [Sabaratnam,

### Link --- Binarism

#### [Binarism]{.underline} is the [cause]{.underline} of external conflict.

Chengxin **Pan 20**, Faculty of Arts and Education, Deakin University,
Australia, 2020, "Enfolding wholes in parts: quantum holography and
International Relations," European Journal of International Relations
2020, Vol. 26(S1) 14--38

This article situates itself between [the relational turn in IR and the
quantum turn in the social sciences]{.underline} (and lately in IR as
well). Between the two turns, [there has been a mutual neglect at the
expense of a better defined and more operationalizable relational
approach to IR]{.underline}. To address the gap, [this article has
outlined [a **quantum holographic ontology**]{.mark}, which stipulates
that [parts are **more than just parts**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
conventional sense of the word, [[but are]{.mark} specifically [enfolded
wholes]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Drawing on Bohm's insights into
wholeness and the implicate order, the article has introduced a set of
new conceptual tools to IR in general and to the relational debate in
particular, such as whole-part duality, enfoldment, unfoldment,
implicate order, and explicate order[. [These tools help us **rethink
IR**]{.mark} and many **dominant IR concepts** in some ontologically
innovative ways, including the need to take wholeness in IR **more
seriously**]{.underline}, a new emphasis on the holographic nature of
the state, and [the promises of this approach for **explaining and
mitigating** difference and conflict in IR theory and
practice]{.underline}. By way of conclusion, the article now briefly
considers two ethical implications of quantum holography for IR. First,
[t[he holographic being]{.mark}/becoming for "parts" [is]{.mark}
**immensely [empowering]{.mark}**, because [it reveals that]{.mark} the
[parts, or]{.mark} previously assumed [**individual "selves,"** are
never alone]{.mark} in a frightening state of nature; rather, [they are
**inescapably linked** to]{.mark} [and **sustained by the
whole/world**]{.mark}: indeed, their holographicity means that **they
are the whole/world**, [merely on smaller scales. This should
**transform**]{.mark} the way we think about [our **identity, interest,
and security** in a]{.mark} fundamentally **relational and
[positive]{.mark}** [way]{.mark}, because in a holographically related
world, [there can be no inherent]{.mark} "**Others" or "[external"
threats]{.mark}** [out there unless we]{.mark} **consciously or
subconsciously [divide the world]{.mark}** [in binary terms]{.mark} and
act accordingly]{.underline}. [Second, [holographic
being]{.mark}/becoming [entails]{.mark} holographic
[responsibility]{.mark}, which is an ethical commitment to the notion
and practice of responsibility for all. By all we mean [the
whole]{.mark} and its various "parts," [including the **smallest
"components**]{.mark}," such as corals and insects. To the extent that
they all **ultimately** share the same whole, all parts, large or small,
are real or **potential enfoldments** of the whole.]{.underline} Their
well-being, as an indicator of the well-being of the whole, matters to
the whole and to each of its parts. [Thus, responsibility for all means
"**care for all** and **do no harm**." In a holographically connected
world, harm to "others"]{.underline} (even the smallest "[others") means
inevitably harm to the whole, including the "self,"]{.underline} who
necessarily enfolds the whole: here the example of the microplastics
problem comes to mind. Cosmopolitanism has long held the idea that "harm
to individuals \[is\] a moral problem for the world as a whole"
(Linklater, 2002: 320), and quantum holography can enrich the relational
ontology of cosmopolitanism and at the same time help it move beyond its
narrow humanist focus.

### Link --- Constructivism 

#### Constructivism is [no better]{.underline} --- it relies on collective cultural mentalities to explain the world.

**Reus-Smit '19** --- Christian; Professor of International Relations at
the University of Queensland, in Brisbane Australia. March 21, 2019;
\"International Relations Theory Doesn't Understand Culture\"; *Foreign
Policy*; \[edited for ableist language\]
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/21/international-relations-theory-doesnt-understand-culture/>;
//CYang

It may seem unfair to expect realism and rational choice to be abreast
of current thinking on culture: It is not their game, after all. Yet
constructivism and the English School, both of which see culture as core
business, fare no better.

[[Constructivism's core insight is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[shared
meanings]{.underline}]{.mark} --- ideas, norms, and values --- [[make
the]{.mark} social and natural [worlds knowable]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Constructivists **[frequently [describe]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
[[meanings as]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[cultural]{.underline}]{.mark}." In
principle, that tendency is entirely compatible with current
understandings of culture as heterogeneous and contradictory. Yet the
two main strands of constructivist research have been largely deaf to
such understandings.

The first strand focuses on [[international norms]{.underline}]{.mark}:
how they emerge and how they shape the identities, interests, and
behavior of states and other actors. This [work disaggregates
**culture**]{.underline}, [breaking it]{.underline} up [into individual
norms and]{.underline} then [studying their **causal
effects**]{.underline}. But while culture is not treated as a coherent,
bounded whole, the [[complexity]{.mark} in which individual
norms]{.underline} are [embedded]{.underline} is
[[neglected]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The second strand of research focuses on the [[**institutional
foundations** of **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline}, [most notably]{.underline} the
[origins of modern sovereignty]{.underline}. It is here that the default
conception of culture is most clear. Constructivists identify
[deep]{.underline}, [system-wide [cultural meanings]{.mark}]{.underline}
and use these to [[explain]{.mark} **key [institutional
developments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They see [international
orders]{.underline} as [[founded]{.underline}]{.mark}, in part,
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} what they call [[collective
mentalities]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and when these change, so do basic
institutions. For example, my own early research attributes variations
in the basic institutional practices of different societies to their
different cultural understandings of the moral purpose of the state.

The English School is noted for its trademark claim that states can form
international societies, not just international systems. That is, states
can come together over shared common interests to agree on common rules
and create institutions to uphold those rules. When asked what sustains
such a society, English School theorists offer two main answers. One is
pragmatic: States share basic interests in physical security, stable
territorial rights, and the keeping of agreements, and international
society is the best means to these ends. This is overlaid, however, by
an argument about the cultural prerequisites for international society.

### Link --- Deterrence 

#### The 1AC is nuclear fetishism -- the logic of nuclear deterrence subjugates the global periphery.

abolish nuclear weapons and live with an increased risk of great-power
war and "nuclear breakout"? Both sides of this debate claim to have the
best solution to prevent nuclear war. Advocates of deterrence maintain
that a securely stored second-strike capability profoundly reduces the
possibility that global conflict will go nuclear. Disarmers disagree.
They argue that maintaining large nuclear arsenals greatly enhances the
chances of an intentional or unintentional nuclear attack; eliminating
nuclear weapons extends the timeline to a nuclear war, making it less
likely. Your own preference is probably linked to your perception of
these different costs and risks. As with most things in life,
[nuclear-related costs are not allocated evenly across the global
population.]{.underline} Although nuclear weapons are often thought of
as the great equalizer---no one is invulnerable to nuclear attack---[the
effects of maintaining a robust nuclear deterrent fall differently on
those at the core of the global nuclear order than on those who live at
the periphery]{.underline}. [Those at the periphery tend to absorb many
more of the costs associated with fabricating nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Yet [the nuclear order is largely
designed]{.underline} ([and enforced]{.underline}) [by those at its
center.]{.underline} In Nuclear Desire, Shampa Biswas asks what it would
it mean to listen to these voices from the periphery---those
economically dispossessed populations that postcolonial scholar Gayatri
Spivak conceptualized as the "subaltern" in her paradigm-shifting essay,
"Can the Subaltern Speak?" 1 According to Biswas, [the subaltern are
speaking, and what they are saying is that nuclear weapons not only
divert resources from "life-preserving and life-enhancing goals" but
have "left the planet littered with radioactive waste]{.underline}" (p.
26). Within the state-based international system, however, [subaltern
voices are not being heard. National-security priorities too often trump
the human-security concerns of vulnerable populations]{.underline}. Done
in the name of the state, the [manufacture and testing of nuclear
weapons---from uranium mines on Navajo Nation lands to nuclear tests in
the South Pacific and Kazakhstan---too often come at the expense of
local populations]{.underline} (p. 128). Listening to subaltern claims
to justice, Biswas concludes, is the path to peace (p. 198). Although
Biswas places listening to the subaltern at the center of her argument,
little space in the book is dedicated to outlining their claims to
justice or highlighting their voices. Instead, her book is a critical
analysis of the structures that prevent their claims from being heard.
The arc of Biswas's argument will be familiar to anyone experienced with
"defetishizing" critique---a method by which what is taken for granted
as timeless and natural is revealed as historically contingent and
socially constructed.2 This form of critique starts by questioning the
underlying assumptions that make power relations appear natural and
inevitable. In the case of nuclear weapons, [defetishizing critique
reveals how an **apolitical, technocratic approach** to reducing nuclear
danger **masks the economic and political interests** that drive the
proliferation of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Instead of advancing a
disarmament agenda, Biswas argues, [nuclear nonproliferation serves the
purposes of powerful states by maintaining a global hierarchy of nuclear
"haves" and "have-nots"]{.underline} (p. 73). The **[presumption that
nuclear weapons are necessary to maintain security through
deterrence]{.underline}** [precludes serious engagement with what it
would mean to abolish the current two-tiered structure of the nuclear
order]{.underline}. This is because **[technocratic experts "fetishize"
nuclear weapons]{.underline}** by ascribing their power to their
physical characteristics, most importantly their explosive yield, as
though they would have the same power as a deterrent irrespective of the
social context in which they are embedded. Properly understood, however,
these physical characteristics are what make nuclear weapons destructive
but not necessarily powerful. [It is the social process of nuclear
deterrence through which nuclear weapons accrue their power, as well as
their status as a special type of "luxury good" the possession of which
confers prestige. By revealing the social basis of their power,
defetishizing critique recovers space for political agency within the
debate about nuclear weapons by recasting nuclear deterrence as a
political choice that privileges the interests of some over others. If
instead of accepting the fetishized security logic that drives the
desire for nuclear weapons, one follows defetishizing critique to its
logical conclusion, the recommendation it yields is for nuclear
disarmament advocates to unmask the "larger social, political, and
economic relations that sustain the pursuit of nuclear
weaponry"]{.underline} (p. 133). Biswas argues that, for a couple of
reasons, [international relations (IR) scholars and policy experts
overlook these connections between the security interests at work in the
global nuclear order and the broader economic interests that drive
proliferation]{.underline}. First, there is a strong division of labor
between realist theories of international politics, which focus on
national security, and liberal institutionalist approaches, which tend
to take questions of economic cooperation as their central concern.
Despite the early promise of norms-based constructivist scholarship to
fill the gap, scholars still treat questions of international security
and international political economy separately, leaving multilateral,
security-oriented institutions, such as those that comprise the
nonproliferation regime, relatively understudied and poorly understood
(pp. 27--36). Second, [policy experts often take the regime at face
value. They assess the effectiveness of the nuclear nonproliferation
regime according to how successful it is at stopping (and eventually
rolling back) the spread of nuclear weapons, rather than asking broader
questions about the underlying interests it perpetuates]{.underline}
(pp. 63--74). In contrast, Biswas brings the connection between security
interests and economic interests into view by arguing that [focusing on
stated intentions obscures the nonproliferation regimes' greatest
effect: the perpetuation of global economic inequalities]{.underline}
(Chapter 1). Her critical approach is grounded in Foucauldian studies of
governmentality and conceives of power as "productive" as opposed to
"disciplinary." 3 [Productive power shapes people's conduct by enlisting
their participation in their own governance]{.underline}. Biswas argues
that, while the stated intention of the nonproliferation regime is to
halt the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states, with the
eventual goal of abolishing their existence, [the effect of this regime
is to extend the power and reach of those states at the top of the
global nuclear order at the expense of those at the
periphery]{.underline}.4 To put it bluntly, Biswas maintains that
[powerful states invoke the urgency of reducing the danger of nuclear
proliferation to diminish the salience of arguments about the political
and economic inequalities embedded in the nonproliferation
regime.]{.underline} When faced with the urgency of averting nuclear
catastrophe, she observes, economic inequality appears trivial in
comparison (p. 108). The result of Biswas's critique is a profoundly
different approach to disarmament than arguments for eliminating nuclear
weapons which highlight the dangers of nuclear war. The disarmament
movement's focus on the unspeakable or unimaginable dangers of nuclear
war too often has the perverse effect of invigorating the perceived need
for an effective nuclear deterrent (p. 131).5 In contrast, a
[defetishizing critique of the desire for nuclear weapons reveals how
the fear of future costs of nuclear war obscures and devalues the
current costs and risks born by those most vulnerable.]{.underline}
Nuclear Desire is one of the most comprehensive applications of a
critical methodology to the topic of nuclear weapons, and a welcome
contribution to the growing field of critical nuclear studies from a
postcolonial perspective. It is also an important contribution to the
wider debate about nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, and
critical intervention within the IR paradigm wars. Yet, Biswas's
application of the tools of defetishizing critique to questions of
nuclear politics does raise questions about what is new or different
about her argument relative to what has come before. Is the claim that
nuclear weapons are a fetish object anything more than an elaborate way
of saying that the Bomb is a status symbol? Is there anything novel
about describing prestige as a motivation for acquiring or retaining
nuclear weapons? While the idea that nuclear weapons function as a
symbol of status and prestige is not new, Biswas's engagement with [the
idea that nuclear weapons are fetish objects tells us something not only
about their function as a symbol of prestige, but also provides insight
into the mechanism by which they accrue their value]{.underline}.
Moreover, her identification of nuclear weapons as fetish objects goes
beyond arguments about prestige because it brings with it theoretical
and methodological tools that yield specific recommendations for
reforming the current nuclear order and open up new avenues of research.
Nuclear weapons, like all fetish objects, are desirable above and beyond
a straightforward assessment of their physical characteristics. A
defetishizing critique interprets this "excess" value as a symptom of an
underlying confusion about the source of their power. As Biswas puts it,
"A fetish \[emphasis in original\] is an object to which is ascribed
certain powers that are seen to emerge from its essential qualities
rather than the social relations and networks that bestow power on that
object" (p. 123). It is this distinctive form of misattribution, whereby
what is properly understood as a structural effect appears as to stem
immediately from one element of that structure, that is the essence of
fetishism. Nuclear [fetishism is characterized by a confusion between
the social value of the weapons' physical characteristics (their
use-value) and the value that arises from the system of shared meanings
rooted in the practice of nuclear deterrence (their "threat" or
"exchange-value"). A defetishizing critique of nuclear weapons reveals
their physical characteristics as essential to the process of
communicating a threat, yet ultimately irrelevant to ensuring
security]{.underline}. **[Nuclear deterrence is nothing more than an
economy of signs, or system of shared communication]{.underline}**. [It
is underwritten by reference to the materiality of nuclear
weapons---their use-value---but it is their ultimate unusability that
the system of deterrence is designed to preserve. It is only their role
within the semiotic system of signs, and not their physical use, that
delivers value, i.e., security.]{.underline} Yet we act as though this
value were an immediate feature of the weapons themselves (Chapter 3).
On Biswas's reading, this process of fetishization transforms nuclear
weapons into a luxury good. Quoting the sociologist Arjun Appadurai,
Biswas explains that luxury goods are "goods whose principal use is
rhetorical \[emphasis in original\] and social \[emphasis in original\]"
(p. 127). As with other luxury goods, [the possession of nuclear weapons
is highly restricted, the social message they communicate about
security, status, and modernity is complex, and their appropriate use as
a deterrent requires specialized knowledge]{.underline}. As luxury
goods, [nuclear weapons are national monuments of the modern nation
state and a symbol of status and prestige.]{.underline} Yet, at the same
time that Biswas's analysis adds depth to the idea that nuclear weapons
are a symbol of prestige, in emphasizing this as the apex of her
analysis she underplays what a defetishizing critique can achieve.
Biswas recognizes that nuclear weapons as fetish objects are not merely
symbols in the same sense that a flag is, since their meaning is not
derived through an association with something else.6 As Biswas, quoting
W.J.T. Mitchell explains, " they are magical objects that contain within
them their own principle of value" (p. 130). Thus, although fetish
objects can also function as symbols or idols of modernity, arguably,
that is not the only, or perhaps even primary, pay-off of understanding
their role as fetish objects (129--32). Once we accept that nuclear
weapons are fetishized, a range of questions opens about how states have
drawn on or manipulated the value of nuclear weapons beyond questions of
international standing and prestige. For instance, [nuclear fetishism
not only obscures the costs of developing and maintaining nuclear
arsenals, but also focuses attention on some aspects of their
materiality at the expense of others.]{.underline} The attribution of
their power to their explosive capacity distracts from the
characteristics that make them an appropriate carrier of social
value---namely, that, like money, they are scarce, durable, and
divisible. These aspects are what make them useful as bargaining chips
in international negotiations.7 A second possibility would be to argue
that [the interpretation of deterrence as a system of signs---in which
the material presence of nuclear weapons plays a communicative
role---could provide the foundation for a different vision of
disarmament, one predicated on "weaponless" deterrence]{.underline}.8

#### Discourses are bout nuclear deterrence and security are part of a legacy of techno-orientalist tropes that perpetuate neocolonialism.

This undertaking is critical especially at a time when the field of
International Relations is being critiqued for its Eurocentrism and
there is a resurgence of populist civilizational discourses juxtaposing
the West and the Rest. [This appears as an opportune moment in history
to accept the challenge of decolonizing practices of arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. It is not simply a cliché that [the field of
arms control and disarmament has long been defined and dominated by the
West's military superiority in arms.]{.underline} The struggle against
this dominance has been launched by critical security studies scholars
that question practices of Orientalism in warfare but refrain from
probing more specifically into the problem of weapons. [Postcolonial
interventions are an exercise in responsibility as they engage with
civilizational discourses of difference articulated in terms of race,
technology, law and culture. A study of the performative power of these
civilizational discourses of difference is critical to cultivate
understandings of not only how differences reinforce hierarchies but
also to generate reflexivity on the struggles for power, justice and
emancipation waged continuously by the subaltern.]{.underline} This
Special Issue of the Asian Journal of Political Science is an effort to
make more visible the engagement of postcolonial scholars with the
problem of arms control and disarmament. It is an effort to resist a
resurgent tide of dominant discourses seeking to constitute and
reconstitute the field of arms control and disarmament representing the
interests of the West to address problems of nuclear proliferation,
counterproliferation and nuclear terrorism. While these efforts have
their own niche in the field of security studies they cannot be guided
by assumptions representing the West as the vanguard of maintaining
order and stability in the international system. These [**dominant
representations** of the West as the guardian and custodian of the field
of arms control and disarmament have often **blighted and marginalized**
contributions of the Global South to weapons control]{.underline}. These
efforts have been further stymied and marginalized as some actors from
the Global South have striven to join the nuclear club and their
practices have been typologized as co-optation or imitation of the
behaviour of great powers in the international system. It is under these
circumstances that we invited scholars to not only acknowledge and build
upon the postcolonial legacies of Bandung and the Non-Aligned movement
but also further investigate and explore discourses on identity, power,
hierarchy, marginalization and interventions in an effort to decolonize
arms control and disarmament. We invited scholars to specifically engage
and reflect on the following questions: How do we as postcolonial
scholars make interventions in the field of security studies? What are
the postcolonial experiences in undertaking practices of arms control
and disarmament? How have these experiences contributed to
neocolonialism or decolonization of the field of weapons control? My
paper on Techno-Racial Dynamics of Denial and Difference in Weapons
Control initiates this dialogue. It [encourages scholars and
policymakers to critically reflect on the intersecting 'dynamics of
difference' and 'dynamics of denial' at play within the field of weapons
control.]{.underline} The paper explores at length the persistent
dynamic of difference between the Orient and the Occident that
encourages proliferation of discourses on modernity and stereotyping the
Other. It also questions **[spiralling dynamics of denial]{.underline}**
that **[vests its faith in practices of nuclearism]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [refuses to acknowledge the historical practices that
contributed to the marginalization of the Global South.]{.underline} [It
insists that the rhetorical deployment of nuclear apartheid within the
field of arms control and disarmament is no longer enough. It is
imperative that attention be focused on **practices of 'techno-racism'**
that are now more explicit, resurgent and circulating with their
emphasis on racial reductionism and technological determinism in weapons
control]{.underline}. This consideration is imperative as the memory of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki as victims of nuclear holocaust recedes and the
techno-racial line regulated by managerial practices of arms control and
disarmament is increasingly under duress. It questions whether only as
sacrificial victims of techno-racial violence can the voices of
subalterns make a claim and find resonance in the field of arms control?
Joining this conversation is Itty Abraham's paper, Decolonizing Arms
Control: The AfroAsian Legal Consultative Committee and the Legality of
Nuclear Testing 1960-64. This paper offers a revisionist view of the
history of the Cold War. Abraham insists that it is no longer acceptable
to view the complexities of decolonization as a 'sideshow' to the Cold
War between the two superpower protagonists. On the contrary he is
emphatic in his assertions that decolonization needs to be
conceptualized as a moment in history during which the developing
countries struggled for progressive change to constitute a pacific and
post-imperial world order. To substantiate these claims, Abraham,
demonstrates how [the postcolonial states resorted to deploying
international law as an interpretive tool that could help them to
collectively participate, modify and incorporate their needs in the
existing international order without exposing their material
weaknes]{.underline}s. He focuses on the legal maneuvers deployed by the
Asian African Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC) during the time frame
when the Partial Test Ban Treaty was being negotiated. The 1964 Report
of the AALCC documents how the Global South articulated two key
principles to oppose nuclear testing. The first principle is the
principle of abuse of rights and the second principle is one of absolute
liability. These principles were articulated as the countries of the
Global South debated the conditions under which nuclear testing could be
considered a 'nuclear wrong.' These powerful interventions from the
Global South could not be ignored as they served as forces of resistance
and also as allies of the superpowers shaping the discourse on nuclear
testing. It is important to acknowledge today how these interventions
made by the diverse grouping of the AALCC helps to balance the dominant
views on negotiating the PTBT and offers an insight into the
decolonizing practices pursued by the postcolonial states during the
Cold War era of arms control and disarmament. This is then followed by
Shampa Biswas and Chacko and Davis's articles exploring the
positionality of Iran and India respectively as representative
postcolonial states negotiating a nuclear order dominated by the West.
Shampa Biswas's paper, Iran vs 'The International Community': A
Postcolonial Analysis on the Iranian Nuclear Program undertakes a
postcolonial analysis of the hypervisibility of Iran in the media
coverage of the West from 2013-14. This was the time when a nuclear deal
was being negotiated between Iran and the international community led by
the US. In this article, Biswas raises some key questions: What made it
possible for the West led by the US to speak so expansively about it
being representative of the international community? What made it
possible for the US to hear the Iranians on their nuclear weapons
programme? What are the possibilities and limitations of nurturing
relationships of trust between Iran and the West? In addressing these
concerns Biswas's paper makes visible the Orientalist presuppositions
and civilizational terms of difference deployed during these
negotiations. She demonstrates how a series of Orientalist tropes
carefully sowed the seeds of deep suspicion and fear in the West against
an inscrutable Iran. She questions the trappings of dialogue that
appears to take place among sovereign equals but in which Iran appears
to be the supplicant striving to join the international community of
civilized states. This paper evokes a deep sense of pathos as it engages
with a contemporary civilizational narrative that obscures existing
asymmetrical relationships of global power and hierarchy. But Priya
Chacko and Alexander E. Davis are not content with demonstrating how
mainstream literature perpetuates Orientalist discourses. In their
paper, Resignifying 'Responsibility': Indian, exceptionalism and nuclear
non-proliferation, they insist on exploring the agency of India in
challenging and perpetuating these discourses. In this endeavour they
take recourse to Judith Butler's conceptualization of 'subversive
resignification' and deploy it to explore how India has successively
resignified the idea of state responsibility especially when it comes to
nuclear weapons. In a very interesting exercise, Chacko and Davis
articulate how the concept of state responsibility gets bifurcated by
two types of civilizational discourses. On the one hand [discourses on
standards of civilization emphasize state responsibility in terms of
compliance but on the other hand discourses on civilizational
exceptionalism emphasize state responsibility only in terms of state
propensity for moral behaviour]{.underline}. This important distinction
makes it feasible for a postcolonial state like India to emphasize and
differentiate its own exceptional civilizational status that is then
ironically acknowledged by the exceptional superpower, the US, to
willingly negotiate the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement (2005). Chacko
and Davis further argue that while India's **[subversive civilizational
mantra]{.underline}** might help it to climb the ladder of nuclear
hierarchy [it is achieved at the cost of a compromise with the dominant
meanings associated with understanding of power]{.underline}, **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**, [and **marginalized postcolonial
considerations** of ethics and morality. These compromises and
subversive acts of resignification cannot be easily copied and
reproduced but are very particular in terms of cultural inheritances,
political histories and contemporary needs.]{.underline} Similarly,
Matthew Bolton's paper, The'-Pacific' Part of the 'Asia-Pacific':
Oceanic Diplomacy in the 2017 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons, is a call for an engaged analysis of Pacific peoples' agency in
addressing the problem of nuclear weapons. It is sensitive in its
portrayal of racial and technological considerations and carefully
introduces the concept of 'resistance diplomacy.' This paper emphasizes
the humanitarian impact of nuclear testing in the Pacific and makes
visible how [political considerations of race and technology served as
important criteria for nuclear testing in these trust
territories]{.underline}. Bolton shares archival records of how imperial
powers such as the US, UK and France exercised colonial control and did
not hesitate to conduct nuclear tests. Bolton's purpose is then to go
further and demonstrate the struggle of the Oceanic people to organize
themselves against 'nuclear racism', offer themselves as a more humane
civilizational standard to be emulated, and insist that positive
obligations be included in the final text of the TPNW. This paper
provides critical insights into the particular role of Oceanic people
and their colonial legacy in negotiating the recently concluded Treaty
for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2017. These five scholarly
contributions to the Special Issue provide us with significant
postcolonial insights in addressing the problem of arms control and
disarmament. They articulate different intellectual and conceptual
frameworks and engage with problems of positionality in arms control and
disarmament. Both chronologically and thematically they cover the period
from 1945 to 2017 and address issues pertaining to use of nuclear
weapons, nuclear testing and negotiations of arms control and
disarmament agreements. In this undertaking they are acutely conscious
of the need for more historical engagement focusing on the agency of
actors from the Global South. They problematize [discourses on
technology, race, law, civilization and]{.underline} suggest how
[meanings associated with these concepts have been deployed and
re-deployed to craft strategies of resistance and emancipation by the
Global South.]{.underline} These papers astutely acknowledge the
asymmetrical relationships of power and recognize power as
performativity. They encourage scholars to think about the [intersecting
dynamics of difference and dynamics of denial]{.underline} that [are
woven together by civilizational considerations of race and
technology]{.underline}. These papers are not content to view subalterns
as victims and supplicants but as thoughtful agents that are
articulating discourses on rights, liability, morality and legal
obligations that can help reconstitute contemporary practices of weapons
control. Such reflexivity is imperative to constitute a post-imperial
and pacific international society. These [postcolonial efforts are only
preliminary efforts to decolonize the practices of arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. This Special Issue of the Asian Journal of
Political Science seeks to only re-ignite the dormant potential of
postcolonial studies to give a new life and meaning to moribund
practices of arms control and disarmament. In such a challenging
undertaking the invitation, support and coordination from the editorial
board of the Asian Journal of Political Science is to be much
appreciated. A special note of thanks to Runa Das for her support and to
all the contributors for their enriching and provocative contributions
without which this collective postcolonial effort at decolonizing
practices of arms control and disarmament would not have been possible.

[Most countries have chosen nuclear abstinence because of overwhelming
abhorrence of these most indiscriminately inhumane weapons ever
invented]{.underline}. Their non-use since 1945 is also largely
explained by the strong moral taboo. Recently, the Holy See (2014)
circulated an article arguing [it was time to question the for-mer
distinction between possession and use as the governing assumption of
ethical discourse on nuclear deterrence. A 'global ethic\...of
solidarity' points to a 'morally responsible global future' which can
only come from nu-clear abolition]{.underline}. As well as 'legal
obligations,' the disarmament treaties 'are also moral
com-mitments.['The **concept of nuclear deterrence** now '**works less
as a stabilising force** and more as an incentive for countries to break
out' of the Non-proliferation treaty (NPT]{.underline}). [The '**double
standard' in enforcing non-proliferation** on some and not others
'**undermines the universal-ity** on which the NPT was constructed.'
Be-cause of the known damage to civilians, nuclear deterrence rests on
shaky moral ground. And investment in nuclear weapons si-phons off
resources for poverty alleviation and development that 'is essential to
social justice.' The humanitarian impacts movement could be a precursor
to a growing defection from the NPT regime by frustrated non-nuclear
weapon states. Its factual premise is the lackof individual or
collective capacity to cope with the humanitarian impacts of a nuclear
war.]{.underline} From this, it follows that for the sake of humanity's
survival, nuclear weapons must never be used again under any
circumstances. And the only guarantee of non-use is total elimination
(NZ 2013). The initiative thus up-dates the old World Court project in
challeng-ing the IHL compliance of nuclear weapons use. Moreover, the
leaders of the nuclear-armed states have an ethical obligation to
in-form and educate their citizens about the reality of incapacity to
cope with the devastation of a nuclear war. If the consequences of a
nuclear war are systemic then decisions on arsenals, doctrines and use
cannot be solely a matter of sover-eign privilege. The same is true with
regards to the safety and security aspects of nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes. Because a bad accident in one country can have
horrific effects in neighbouring countries, they have the moral right to
have their voices heard in the decision to build and operate nuclear
plants to global safety standards: no incinera-tion without
representation. At which point do non-nuclear weapon states conclude
that defection from the NPT regime is likely to be politically
effective, is morally permissible and may well be the ethically
responsible course of action (Doyle 2009)---precisely the dilemma with
which the AU is grappling vis-à-vis the ICC?

As distinct from other peoples, most Americans do not recognize --- or
do not want to recognize --- that [the United States dominates the world
through its military power]{.underline}. Due to government secrecy, our
citizens are often ignorant of the fact that our garrisons encircle the
planet. [This vast network of American bases actually constitutes a new
form of empire]{.underline} --- an empire with a unique geography
unlikely to be taught in any high school classroom. Without grasping the
dimensions of this globe-girdling Baseworld, one can't begin to
understand the size and nature of our imperial aspirations, or the
degree to which a [new kind of militarism is undermining our
constitutional order. Militarism and imperialism are]{.underline}
Siamese twins [joined at the hip; each thrives off the
other]{.underline}. Already highly advanced in our country, [they are
both on the verge of a quantum leap that will almost surely stretch our
military beyond its capabilities]{.underline}, bringing about fiscal
insolvency and very possibly doing mortal damage to our republican
institutions. Unfortunately, the only way this is discussed in our press
is via reportage on highly arcane plans for changes in basing policy and
the positioning of troops abroad. And these plans, as reported in the
media, cannot be taken at face value. As a result, it's almost
impossible to assess the size, real value, or proposed reach of our
empire of bases. Official records on these subjects are misleading,
although instructive. [According to the Defense Department's annual
"Base Structure Report" for fiscal year 2003, which itemizes foreign and
domestic U.S. military real estate, the Pentagon currently owns or rents
702 overseas bases in about 130 countries and HAS another 6,000 bases in
the United States and its territories.]{.underline} Pentagon bureaucrats
calculate that it would require at least \$113.2 billion to replace just
the foreign bases --- surely far too low a figure but still larger than
the gross domestic product of most countries --- and an estimated
\$591,519.8 million to replace all of them. [The military high command
deploys to our overseas bases some 253,288 uniformed personnel, plus an
equal number of dependents and Department of Defense civilian officials,
and employs an additional 44,446 locally hired foreigners. The Pentagon
claims that these bases contain 44,870 barracks, hangars, hospitals, and
other buildings, which it owns, and that it leases 4,844
more]{.underline}. These numbers, although staggeringly large, do not
begin to cover all the actual bases we occupy globally. The 2003 Base
Status Report fails to mention, for instance, any garrisons in Kosovo
--- even though it is the site of the huge Camp Bondsteel, built in 1999
and maintained ever since by the Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown &
Root. The Report similarly [omits bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel,
Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, and Uzbekistan, although the U.S. military
has established colossal base structures throughout the so-called arc of
instability in the two-and-a-half years since 9/11.]{.underline} For
[Okinawa, the southernmost island of Japan, which has effectively been
an American military colony for the past 58 years]{.underline}, the
report deceptively lists only one Marine base, Camp Butler. In fact,
Okinawa "hosts" ten Marine Corps bases, including Marine Corps Air
Station Futenma, which occupies 1,186 acres in the center of that
modest-sized island's second-largest city. (Manhattan's Central Park, by
contrast, is only 843 acres.) The Pentagon similarly fails to note all
of the \$5-billion-worth of military and espionage installations in
Britain, which have long been conveniently passed off as Royal Air Force
bases. If there were an honest count, the actual size of our military
empire would probably top 1,000 different bases in other people's
countries, but no one --- possibly not even the Pentagon --- knows the
exact number for sure. One thing is certain, though; the number has been
distinctly on the rise in recent years. A Colonial "Footprint" Once upon
a time, you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting up
colonies. [America's version of the colony is the military base, and the
impact and reach of our colonial empire has become reduced to a single
word: Footprint.]{.underline} Of all the insensitive, if graphic,
metaphors we've allowed into our vocabulary, none quite equals
"footprint". Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Richard Myers
and senior members of the Senate's Military Construction Subcommittee
such as Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) are apparently incapable of completing a
sentence without using it. E[stablishing a more impressive footprint has
become central to the new justification for a dramatic enlargement of
our Baseworld empire in the wake of our conquest of Iraq.]{.underline}
The man in charge of this project is Andy Hoehn, deputy assistant
secretary of defense for strategy. He and his colleagues are supposed to
[draw up plans to implement President Bush's preventive war strategy
against "rogue states," "bad guys," and "evil-doers." They have
identified something they call the "arc of instability," which is said
to run from the Andean region of South America (read: Colombia) through
North Africa, across the Middle East to the Philippines and
Indonesia.]{.underline} This is, of course, more or less identical with
what used to be called the Third World --- and perhaps [no less
crucially it covers the world's key oil reserves]{.underline}. Hoehn
contends, "When you overlay our footprint onto that, we don't look
particularly well-positioned to deal with the problems we're now going
to confront." [In order to put our forces close to every hot spot or
danger area in this newly discovered arc of instability, the Pentagon
has been proposing --- this is usually called "repositioning" --- many
new bases, including at least four and perhaps as many as six permanent
ones in Iraq.]{.underline} A number of these are already under
construction --- at Baghdad International Airport, Tallil air base near
Nasariyah, in the western desert near the Syrian border, and at Bashur
air field in the Kurdish region of the north. In addition, we plan to
keep under our control the whole northern quarter of Kuwait --- 1,600
square miles out of that nation's 6,900 square miles.. [Other countries
mentioned as sites for what Colin Powell calls our new "family of bases"
include the impoverished areas of the "new" Europe --- Romania, Poland,
and Bulgaria; and the nuclear-armed antagonists Pakistan (where we
already have four bases), and India.]{.underline} Farther to the east,
[we have set our sites on Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and even, unbelievably, Vietnam. Morocco, Tunisia, and
especially Algeria]{.underline} (scene of the slaughter of some 100,00
civilians since 1992, when, to quash an election, the military took
over, backed by our country and France) are slated for bases in [North
Africa; in West Africa, Senegal, Ghana, Mali, and Sierra
Leone]{.underline} (even though it has been torn by civil war since
1991) are probable locations for future military 'colonies'. Most of
these new bases will be what the military, in a switch of metaphors,
calls "lily pads" to which our troops could jump like so many well-armed
frogs from the homeland, our remaining NATO bases, or bases in docile
satellites like Japan and Britain. To offset the expense involved in
such expansion, the Pentagon seems ready to close many of our huge Cold
War military reservations --- all part of Secretary of Defense
Rumsfeld's "rationalization" of our armed forces. In the wake of the
Iraq victory, the U.S. has already withdrawn virtually all of its forces
from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, in part to punish those nations for
failing to support our war in Iraq. South Korea, perhaps the most
anti-American democracy on Earth today, faces similar punishment. In
Europe, these plans include giving up several bases in Germany, also in
part because of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's defiance of Bush over
Iraq. Still, while there is every reason to believe [that the impulse to
create ever more lily pads]{.underline} in the Third World [remains
unchecked,]{.underline} there are several reasons to doubt that some of
the more grandiose plans, for either expansion or downsizing, will ever
be put into effect or. For one thing[, Russia is opposed to the
expansion of U.S. military power on its borders and is already moving to
checkmate American basing sorties into places like Georgia, Kyrgyzstan,
and Uzbekistan]{.underline}. The first post-Soviet-era Russian airbase
in Kyrgyzstan has just been completed forty miles from the U.S. base at
Bishkek, and in December 2003, the dictator of Uzbekistan, Islam
Karimov, declared that he would not permit a permanent deployment of
U.S. forces in his country even though we already have a base there.
Moreover, the Pentagon's planners do not really seem to grasp just how
many buildings the 71,702 soldiers and airmen in Germany alone occupy
and how expensive it would be to build even slightly comparable bases,
together with the necessary infrastructure, in former Communist
countries like Romania, one of Europe's poorest countries. It's also
clear that generals of the high command have no intention of living in
backwaters like Constanta, Romania, and will keep the U.S. military
headquarters in Stuttgart, while holding on to Ramstein Air Force Base,
Spangdahlem Air Force Base, and the Grafenwöhr Training Area. The
"Global Cavalry" [The models for all these new 'lily pads', according to
Pentagon sources, are the string of bases we have built around the
Persian Gulf in the last two decades in such anti-democratic autocracies
as Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. The
foreign policy sensibility behind the Baseworld expansion, meanwhile, is
already plain to see.]{.underline} In the words of the American
Enterprise Institute, home to the most hawkish of the Bush
administration's neoconservative core, [the idea is to create "a global
cavalry" that can ride in from "frontier stockades" and shoot up the
"bad guys" as soon as we get some intelligence on them]{.underline}. In
fact, [the "global cavalry" strategy promises to do the opposite. As the
prominent British military historian, Correlli Barnett, has observed,
the U.S. attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq only increased the threat from
al-Qaed]{.underline}a. From 1993 through the Sept. 11 assaults of 2001,
[there were five major al-Qaeda attacks worldwide; in the two years
since, there have been seventeen such bombings, including the Istanbul
suicide assaults on the British consulate and an HSBC Bank. Military
operations against terrorists are not the solution.]{.underline} As
Barnett puts it, "Rather than kicking down front doors and barging into
ancient and complex societies with simple nostrums of 'freedom and
democracy,' we need tactics of cunning and subtlety, based on a profound
understanding of the people and cultures we are dealing with --- an
understanding up till now entirely lacking in the top-level
policy-makers in Washington, especially in the Pentagon." In his
notorious "long, hard slog" memo on Iraq of October 16, 2003, Defense
secretary Rumsfeld wrote, "Today, we lack metrics to know if we are
winning or losing the global war on terror." Correlli-Barnett's
"metrics" indicate otherwise, but that's almost beside the point. The
"war on terrorism" is, at best, only a small part of the strategy behind
the Pentagon's Baseworld plans. The [real reason for constructing this
new ring of military installations along the equator is to expand our
colonial reach by reinforcing our domination of the world.]{.underline}

[The **discussion of weapons and their diffusion** generally follows the
state and the armies that use them. Always **starting with great
powers** and the **most "sophisticated" weapons**, studies of military
diffusion **chart the slow drift of devices to the periphery** as the
**technical knowledge** and **need or prestige of a weapon interacts**
with the **technological capability** and in some cases **cultural
values of a given state-military apparatus.** The structural features of
an agent, generally a state, either inhibit or induce the adoption of a
weapons or fighting technique]{.underline}.15 However, the accounts of
Emily Goldman and others break the technical object into software
(content) and hardware (form) and ignore the internal consistency that
makes a device "work." As is the case in particular of the ied, there is
nothing singularly in its design that would count as a trade secret or
invention. Instead, [we have to look elsewhere for the creativity and
intensity of the ied.]{.underline} Rather than the laboratory or the
inventor, [**the milieu or ecology of war** is itself a **source of
mutation and innovation**]{.underline}. No matter how much we revile the
cruelty and devastation of war, [it is a "**metamorphosis
machine**]{.underline}."16 [War is generative]{.underline}, in the sense
that [it complicates the boundaries of the human, and it insists on
distributive or assembled agency rather than the mythologies of great
leaders or inventors.]{.underline} To this end [it is necessary to think
about war's creative materiality beyond the simple divides of bullets
and bombs, or security studies, and bodies and rights, or human
security]{.underline}. Those are all materialities in their own right,
but their ways of understanding the world say little about either the
broader ecology or the other entities and assemblages that populate
war's ecosystem. After all, war has been creatively and formatively more
than human since the first rock or bone was picked up to extend the
striking power of the human arm or the first horse was mounted to shock
the enemy. [War did not "become" technological with the **predator
drone** and the **biopolitical intervention into the biome of the
soldier's body**. War has always been an assemblage of things of which
any particular human played only a linkage or fulcrum of a larger, more
heterogeneous order]{.underline}. So it is in this assembly that we can
look for the ied not as an object but as a partner with the humans that
reinvents and innovates their return to the field of battle. So humans
are not to be left out of this investigation. [It is the humans who are
confronted by a war of objects]{.underline}. The human body once
immersed in the thick of combat resembles few of its enlightenment
capabilities of reason or reflection; it is often the sinew between
objects and forces from adrenaline to body memory to the attachment of a
so-called suicide vest. [War is a highly dispersed and entangled set of
relations that are better described as a "continuous multiplicity" than
through essentialist representation of discrete agents, things, or
objects.]{.underline}17 So [while it is necessary in this case to take
an "object-oriented" approach, to see the world from the ied, we should
resist transposing the subject onto the object]{.underline}. It is, at
times, highly persuasive and therefore politically effective to
anthropomorphize objects, but it is equally valuable in the milieu of
war to objectify and then reassemble the operators---goats, mortar
shells, wheel barrels---in the complex relay of change and mutation that
makes the flow and tumult of war possible. We have to walk a fine line
between loosening the grip of anthropocentrism while still holding on to
the human element in the puzzle. [To go too far into the world of the
machine risks losing the rhythms and irruptions of war, an instrumental
and mechanistic account of things.]{.underline} Therefore we have to
focus on how [the **milieu of war and its attendant objects** are built
into the very **architecture and distributed in the economic flows that
war inhabits.** Economics here should be taken in its broadest sense of
oikos---the same root for both economy and ecology. Roads, bridges,
smuggling, dense urban zones, topographies of race, affect, sexuality,
postcolonial legacies, sacred attachment, then overrun by surplus
weapons, cell phones, garbage, and concrete all play their
part]{.underline}. **[The oikos]{.underline}**, once unrestricted,
[finds the **economy of war written** into the **very ground beneath our
feet**.]{.underline} It is here that the umwelt or lifeworld of war's
objects can be found.18 The ied is not merely the wires taken from any
number of sources, or its explosive "package" ranging from original
manufacture to the artifact of a forgotten war. Neither is the "device"
reducible to its "improvisor," the artisan who crafted its new
arrangement of receptors and detonation feedbacks. It is the strange
attraction or "prehension," as Alfred North Whitehead would say, of all
these things in their forces and arrangement. In Whitehead's words, "the
whole world conspires to produce a new creation. It presents to the
creative process its opportunities and its limitations."19 Like Darwin's
finches, [even within this narrow temporal and geographic corner of
warfare there are varied attributes and dif­ferent morphogenetic
histories for each subspecies]{.underline} of ied. Some perceive light,
heat, microwaves, sound waves, radio waves, and each an increasingly
precise modulation of the electromagnetic spectrum. [For detonation some
require the interplay or sequence of many of these modes of
communication. All require ways of being in the world, that is, ways of
fighting war for which disrupting the flow of goods and services is
strategically significant]{.underline}; ieds would not stop the
Ostrogoths of the sixth century or the Sioux Nation, nor would they be
that effective against the castles and fortified towns of the Middle
Ages. Despite the varied existence of caltrops and many other
"victim-operated weapons" throughout military history, the effectiveness
of the ied is intimate with the larger assemblage it is plugged into to
disrupt.20 [The depth of material conspiracy necessary for something
like an ied to emerge as an entity that can devastate the world's most
expensive military force compels those interested in the concept of war
to look more closely at well-worn typologies of technological
superiority as well as technological innovation, diffusion, and
deployment.]{.underline}21 The effect of such a rethinking is not merely
instrumental; it does not provide us with a new toolbox to better
predict or plan the prosecution of wars. Instead, [to foreground the
efficacy of things makes the global experience of military acid reflux
sensible, as in perceptible]{.underline}.22 This is how I read Stanley
Hoffmann's prescient warning in 1965 that [international
politics]{.underline} would [increasingly become "a global echochamber
of swarm-life."]{.underline}23 [Partitioning the sensible in favor of
the "things" of war shows the values of **national security doctrines
based on technological superiority and hegemony devaluing themselves as
the objects of war fight their way back into politics.** The varied
intensities or insistence of objects is not historical in the sense of
development]{.underline}; however, [there is something like a natural
history that has come to pass such that particular technical or machinic
objects make statements in more decisive ways]{.underline}. Gilbert
Simondon posits the technical object as one that must create and inhabit
its environment simultaneously. That is, [the **object cannot be
disassociated from its ecosystem** because each had to be virtually
implied in the other for the actual object to emerge.]{.underline} For
Simondon [this keeps open the space of invention without the "new" being
ex nihilo]{.underline}. As he puts it, [the technical object "is caused
by an environment which had merely virtual existence before the
invention. The invention happens because a jump is made and is justified
by the relationship which is instituted within the environment it
creates]{.underline}."24 The conditions of Hoffmann's echochamber or
what William Connolly calls [**a global resonance machine** require a
**processes of amplification and dispersal**, **intensification and
territorialization**.25 Parts of an assemblage become more vibratory,
singing with greater intensity]{.underline}, as in the case of American
evangelical Christianity entering into an unexpected relationship with
the crusaders of free market capitalism, or in the global feedback from
both sides of the supposed civilizational divide, each providing
sustenance to the other as in Connolly's example.26 This raises the
question: what is an amplifier? W. Ross Ashby, one of the founders of
Cybernetics, describes an amplifier as "a device that, if given a little
of something, will emit a lot of it. . . . Such devices work by having
available a generous reservoir of what is to be emitted, and then using
the input to act as controller to the flow from the reservoir. . . . It
works by supplementation."27 [What is the reservoir war draws upon?
Surplus weapons, postcolonial injustice, nationalist affect, or just
rage can all be drawn into amplification]{.underline}. As [amplification
is not just a linear increase, it can result in qualitative
changes.]{.underline} Amplification of rage can transform discontent
into a change in voting preference; what in chemistry is called a phase
transition like the movement from solid to liquid or, more rarely and
surprisingly, when matter skips states and jumps from solid to the
excited molecules of a gas; from discontent directly to revolt. Manuel
DeLanda explains that the extrapolation of physical phase properties to
human endeavors allows more fluidity and creativity in the nonlinear
history of human development than the "stages" often presumed by
development economists or archaeologists. Humanity in its relationship
to the environment has "solidified" and "liquefied" at dif­ferent rates
and times; "in other words human history did not follow a straight line,
as if everything pointed toward civilized societies as humanity's
ultimate goal."28 [This is how machinic statements
proceed---amplification or incipient elements lured into actuality by
any number of irritants or perturbations, that is, resonances or loose
relations that draw upon the abundant resources at hand, intensifying or
amplifying the otherwise imperceptible assemblage]{.underline}. [And an
ecosystem is the medium or milieu that this amplification reverberates
through. An ecosystem and its study---ecology---represents a concept for
understanding the profound **entanglement of objects** that make
**immanent creativity possible** at every level of the
system.]{.underline} In the same moment that thought thinks,
[ecologically there must be some conceptual disaggregation of
assemblages from environmental changes in intensity; differing folds or
relations of entanglement become relativized such that disequilibrium,
the engine for dynamism, is impossible---everything is
everything]{.underline}. Guattari playfully refers to the danger of a
pulsating undifferentiated substance as "cosmic pulp"---in fact at the
cosmic scale it may be pulp.29 But this is of little use to those of us
slogging our way through space-time at the scale of human organic life.
Local changes in equilibrium, intensifications, are vital to human
experience and efficacy in the world. Therefore [the anthropocentrism of
some forms of connection, change, and event are necessary for limiting
or territorializing zones of entangled matter such that they are
perceptible to an embodied, mortal species such as humans.]{.underline}
This is what, I think, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari mean by a
science: the [positing of functives, constituting a molar perspective
for the study of local orders and emergent ecologies such as
war]{.underline}.30 [The territorialization of spacetime into particular
geographies of interest or study is the work of a function or, in the
philosophical register, a concept.]{.underline} In this case [the
concepts of assemblage and ecosystem allow for the pulling apart of the
world such that a difference in organization is perceptible and a milieu
or medium can be at least temporarily diagrammed to show the movement or
change in the organization of an ied without losing that this is
something we can call an ied]{.underline}. So we need consistency for a
technical object but we will not find a "condition of possibility" that
we would want to call a cause. We are trying to describe the ied and
milieu but not its cause. Instead of looking for the ied's cause, my
metaphysical wager is that [orders, while not obeying laws of
conformity, cluster or are attracted to particular lures or transient
forms over periods of time.]{.underline} The important point here is
[the instance that **abstract machines are created and transitory**,
this description resists the stasis of eternal forms or Platonic ideals.
The **vulnerability of abstract machines** as well as their contingency
upon their **incorporation in concrete assemblages** leave the
**universe open ended rather than finite and repetitive or merely
combinatorial.**]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari refer to these as
abstract machines, which they define as follows: "[The abstract machine,
or machines, is effectuated in forms and substances, varying states of
freedom. But the abstract machine must first have composed itself, and
have simultaneously composed a plane of consistency. Abstract, singular,
and creative, here and now, real yet nonconcrete, actual yet
noneffectuated]{.underline}."31 This allows for there to be a "point" to
naming something or identifying it without the necessity or permanency
of identity. The space of possibility for the ied is a kind of strange
attractor that traverses quantum, micro, meso, and cosmic scales,
illustrating what Deleuze and Guattari call refrains, the lures of these
strange abstract machines. Unlike theorists of identity or form, Deleuze
and Guattari leave open the possibility that [the creative advance at
any level could also deterritorialize a given refrain, leading a new or
differently creative thing to diverge from what came before
it.]{.underline} So we are looking for consistency but not permanence.
In Connolly's description of consistency, "[each level and site of
agency also contain traces and remnants from the levels from which it
evolved, and these traces affect its operation.]{.underline}"32 This
does not mean the world is all flux and therefore impenetrable to
thought and investigation. It means we ought not be too disappointed if
the concepts we generate have a limited or even fleeting shelf life. So
orders? Yes. One order? No. Therefore, [real creativity, extending well
beyond the human estate, has room to breathe.]{.underline} Why does a
seemingly simple and technical device require so much theoretical or
even metaphysical footwork? In part because ieds do not continue at a
single pace, experience, or rhythm of duration. This is why, to some
extent, jieddo's attempts to settle on categorical and bounded
definitions of ieds obfuscate more than they reveal. [Land mines,
discarded bomblets, unexploded ordinances, victim-operated weapons,
victim rage, exclusionary urbanization, permanent genetic damage passed
from generation to generation, e-wasted dumping, cheap arms sales,
racial formations, resource extraction---all exhibit dif­ferent temporal
flows and variably transversal connections that can become an
ied.]{.underline} And [the conflict or war that lured it into existence
can dissipate and then reemerge days, months, years, decades, or even a
century later]{.underline}. Five still-armed and dangerous American
Civil War mines were unearthed and detonated in 1965 outside Mobile,
Alabama.33 [**The milieu of war** often **lingers, mutates, and
reemerges** with **differing levels of intensity** long after "sustained
combat" has ended]{.underline}. It is from the betwixt-between that
something like an ied can emerge. It assembles in a maelstrom of decades
of electronic garbage dumping, the accumulation of mines from past wars,
new and old antagonisms, and stop/start development projects responsible
for a morass of paved roads. All of this raises the question of the
relation between the part and the whole. If **[causality is not a
sufficient category]{.underline}**, then is an ied a subset of war? Is
it part of the assemblage of war? [Certainly the **ecology of war** is
**populated by heterogeneous assemblages** made of people, affects,
guns, hills, culverts, streets, mines . . . And those objects are
transversally entangled in spacetime. But what is the nature of such
entanglements? How do we account for things as assemblages without
losing either their distinctiveness as objects or their functions in
larger machines?]{.underline}

#### [Nuclear miscalculation is driven by imperial capitalist politics -- any analysis of the US-Russia antagonism must decenter the "danger of the arms race" and pose the question of nuclear strategy as an ideological phenomenon.]{.underline}

These paradoxes are not unintelligible. Behind Thompson\'s theoretical
construct lies a number of very understandable political motivations. To
depict the exterminist contamination as omnipresent is to dramatize the
dangers of war with the most urgent and mobilizing of tocsins. To
represent the sources of exterminism as a medley of involuntary or
atomized forces, on the other hand, is to avoid the great divisive
breach of class analysis and social identification of political
opponents, and with it the risks of ideological hostilities incompatible
with an irenic movement. To refuse investigation into the origins of the
Cold War is to forestall the possibility of differential judgement of
the two sides to it, that would be internationally even less ecumenical.
A benign sleight of hand, of a kind familiar --- perhaps inherent --- in
the discourse of all peace movements, is visible here. Yet the real
history of our time still require its answers. These answers have
political consequences, for peace and for socialism. In what follows, I
shall argue that [the Cold War in its wider sense is not an arbitrary or
anachronistic feud staged essentially in Europe, but a rationally
explicable and deeply rooted conflict of opposing social formations and
political forces, whose principal centre of gravity has been for some
thirty years now the Third World]{.underline}. That conflict would have
existed and developed into a Cold War, even if nuclear weapons had never
been invented. [The Bomb has shaped and misshaped its
evolution]{.underline}, and may yet put an end to it altogether. But it
is not i[ts spring. That lies in the dynamic of class struggle on a
world scale. The rationality of the conflict derives from the
incompatible interests of the major actors in it.]{.underline} Thompson
contests this rationality, on the grounds that a drift towards common
extermination cannot be in any side\'s interest. But, of course, this is
not the first time in history that a discrepancy has opened up between
rational interest and irrational outcome. What typically lies between
the two is the recurrent historical phenomenon of class error, for which
Marxists always need to make theoretical allowance. [Class
interest]{.underline}, as Hamza Alavi has pointed out, [should be
conceived not as a source of its own objective, correspondent
expression, in an a priori adequacy of means to ends, but rather as the
social basis of calculation of the agent concerned, that includes in its
very definition the possibility of miscalculation in a world of
antagonistic action and reaction.]{.underline}5 [In the age of the
hydrogen bomb, such miscalculation could indeed lead to mutual
annihilation. I]{.underline}n that sense, Thompson\'s [warnings of the
possibility of accidental triggering or faulty escalation need no
further justification]{.underline}; the fear of these must haunt any
sober peace movement today. The limitation of \"Notes on Exterminism,\"
[however, is that in concentrating so much moral and mental attention on
the irrational and inertial dangers of the arms race, it tends to ignore
the deliberate and dynamic calculations of nuclear politics. The result
is to sidestep consideration of how the Bomb functions as a central
instrument of power in an age of revolution.]{.underline} But to [pose
the question of nuclear strategy as politics --- and not bureaucratic
inertias --- it is necessary to retrieve all those
categories]{.underline} that Thompson sets to one side as
\"irrelevant\": [conjuncture and crisis, origin and purpose, classes and
modes of production.]{.underline} Indeed, to get at the deep structures
of the Cold War we may need to dismantle the concept of exterminism.

#### US-Russia nuclear posture cannot be analyzed through the lens of military strategy but rather operates primarily on the level of ideological reproduction -- miscalculation is a product of social compulsions that only the alt solves.

**Davis '17** \-- (Mike Davis, 8-1-2017, \"Nuclear Imperialism and

What ultimately confers cohesion on the different components of
exterminism is the bipolar confrontation itself. Thompson clearly hints
that [if the Cold War did not exist, it would have had to be invented
--- since it provides the indispensible basis for domestic
unity.]{.underline} It is [the mirror-image demand of internal hegemony,
expressed through ideology, in both the United States and the Soviet
Union that sanctions, reproduces, and addicts the social formation to
exterminism.]{.underline} \"Symmetry,\" in Thompson\'s usage, thus has
two meanings. First it refers to the situation in which state power in
each bloc has become the raison d\'être of its opposite via the
permanent brandishing of the Bomb. Secondly it indicates an actual
homology between the bureaucratic and military structures of Cold War
mobilization in the USSR and the United States. Taken as a whole, [this
portrait of hypermilitarized establishments imposing domestic order by
gearing up for an apocalyps]{.underline}e is not unlike Daniel Yergin\'s
explanatory scheme of the dialectic between the American \"national
security state\" and the Soviet \"total security state.\" The
difference, of course, is that Thompson takes the possibility of the
apocalypse far more seriously than Yergin or the Harvard History
Department. Finally, Thompson expects [the actual slippage towards
exterminism to come not from politics as we might expect --- that is,
from field of forces that must be analysed in terms of origins,
intentions or goals, contradictions or conjunctures\" (which he
discounts) --- but from the \"messy inertia\" of the weapons systems
themselves. Thus he points to \"pressures from the laboratories,\"
\"impatience amongst the war gamers,\" \"the implacable upwards creep of
weapons technology,\" or the \"sudden hot flush of ideological passion\"
as its most likely immediate triggers.]{.underline} The specific
scenarios of exterminism that he evokes tend towards either a Dr
Strangelove or a latterday Sarajevo. [In the first case, an accident ---
a computer malfunction, a paranoid airforce general, or perhaps only a
low-flying formation of seagulls --- trips the wire, disconnects the
fail-safe mechanism and vapourizes the Northern hemisphere. In the
second scenario --- where analytic disputation is more possible ---
elaborate nuclear threats and linkages between conventional warfare and
nuclear warfare have been emplaced as safeguards or signals to
intimidate the enemy; the \"enemy,\" however, is not intimidated
(perhaps miscalculates) and the mad roulette of deterrence spins to a
final halt at mutual assured destruction.]{.underline} This deeply
pessimistic projection, on the other hand, coexists with a diagnosis
that also points in a quite opposite direction. For, as we noted above,
in Thompson\'s account exterminism is not only a fatal inertial thrust
towards the end of Northern civilization, it is also, more hopefully, a
formation in some sense external to and separable from the rival social
systems which confront each other today, even if at present it prevails
within both of them. This side of Thompson\'s analysis enables him to
[imagine the possible dismantling of the \"deep structures of the Cold
War\"]{.underline} without the simultaneous dismantling of the deep
structures of capitalist ownership or, for that matter, of bureaucratic
domination. This vision finds its fullest and most generous expression
in his recent pamphlet Beyond the Cold War. Its intellectual foundations
are also there most clearly exposed. For in this text, [the Cold War
today --- no longer just the arms race --- is seen as a literally
purposeless mechanism reproducing itself, whose only function is its own
self-perpetuation. \"What is the Cold War now about? It is about
itself.\"1 No longer in any sense a rationally intelligible conflict, it
is compulsive \"habit\" or \"addiction\" --- if one materially supported
by the sectional interests of \"the military-industrial and research
establishments of both sides, the security services and intelligence
operations, and the political servants of these interests,\" and
psychologically sustained by the need for internal bonding within
American and Soviet societies, achieved by the mutual exclusion of a
paradigmatic Other. J]{.underline}ust because of this, \"a revolt of
reason and conscience,\" in the name of a common \"human ecological
imperative,\" could bring the Cold War to an end. The evidence of this
revolt is the growth of the peace movements in Europe. For it was there
that the Cold War started, and it is there that it could be overcome.
\"The Cold War can be brought to an end in only two ways: by the
destruction of European civilization, or by the reunification of
European political culture.\"2 Such a reunification would involve a
detente of peoples rather than of states, unfreezing the glaciated
divide between Western and Eastern Europe. But it would not necessarily
abolish the principal economic or social structures of either. \"Immense
differences in social system would remain.\" But across them would now
move \"the flow of political and intellectual discourse, and of human
exchange.\" As their rigid ideological and military guards came down,
\"the blocs would discover that they had forgotten what their adversary
posture was about.\"3

International Relations," European Journal of International Relations

According to the holographic worldview, [[the universe is "an]{.mark}
**undivided and [unbroken whole]{.mark}**[" which is enfolded into
parts]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, the [division within]{.mark} as well
as between [society and nature is "a **crude abstraction**]{.mark} and
**approximation**]{.underline}" (Bohm, 1980: 158, emphasis in original;
see also Barad, 2007: 24--25). In his book Wholeness and the Implicate
Order, [Bohm expressed a [pressing concern]{.mark} with the tendency [to
divide]{.mark} and **subdivide [the world]{.mark}** [into]{.mark}
essentially **[different units]{.mark}** or groupings: IR scholars are
no stranger to the tendency described by Bohm. [The world,]{.mark}
apparently [organized into **sovereign states**, appears to be]{.mark}
as **[fragmented]{.mark}** as ever, further [compounded]{.mark} today
[by]{.mark} the rise of **[nationalism]{.mark}, populism**, and identity
politics, as well as by the socalled return to geopolitics or even the
Cold War. A]{.underline}ll these fragmentations and conflicts in IR seem
to conform with the Newtonian ontology of things. However, what is
revealed in this orthodox ontology is merely the explicate order of IR,
whose implicate order and implicate relations have yet to be adequately
understood and theorized. Bohm's insights into holographic relationality
lay an important foundation for such theorizing in IR. As will be
illustrated below, the Bohmian holographic theory can give IR, among
other things, a stronger ontological commitment to whole and wholeness,
a more holographic relational conception of parts such as states, and a
novel account of differences as contingent and spatio-temporally
situated unfoldments of holographic parts. Wholeness and the study of IR
[The concept of wholeness is central to Bohm's ontological
interpretation of quantum theory]{.underline} (Bohm, 1980; Bohm and
Hiley, 1993; Zinkin, 1987: 6). [Despite a growing effort to include a
wider array of issues and factors, IR still has a rather "weak sense of
a social whole]{.underline}" (Albert and Buzan, 2013: 121). Even as IR
scholars focus on "macrolevel" factors such as international political
systems, international structures, international societies, world
systems, and global networks, [these systemic factors are at best
particular **structural abstractions** of world politics, such as
anarchy, the distribution of capabilities, and international norms and
rules]{.underline}. [While these [systemic]{.mark} or structural
[features are **part and parcel** of the whole]{.mark}, ontologically
[they are often seen as]{.mark} either **mere [external]{.mark}** [and
causal **determinants** of state behavior]{.mark}, or **ultimately
[reducible]{.mark}** [to parts]{.mark} (e.g. states, material resources,
or ideas),15 rather than as the whole in the **holographic sense** of
the word]{.underline}. By whole we mean the entirety of space, time, and
the information, relations, structures, processes, movements, and
parts/agents contained within that all-encompassing space-time. [[In the
IR context, the whole]{.mark} goes well beyond states and the totality
of their interactions. It [embodies]{.mark} the whole [**social and
ecological** systems as well as their]{.mark} **explicate and [implicate
relations]{.mark}** both between and [embedded within]{.mark} their
constituent "[parts]{.mark}]{.underline}." Such "parts" may include
regions, states, societies, cultures, religions, peoples, economies,
markets, goods, histories, ideas, emotions, materials, creatures, and
natural phenomena. Of course, what exactly makes up the whole for IR
cannot be exhaustively tallied a priori, because by definition such a
task is impossible in any given space-time. But the point is that
[wholeness should be given a higher ontological priority in
IR]{.underline}. Just as trees do not grow as assemblages of previously
separate branches, leaves, and roots, [[the world does not **start off**
with]{.mark} merely **fragmented** parts and preexisting **[sovereign
states]{.mark}** which then come together to form a global
system]{.underline}; it is the other way round: [[the whole
**permeates**]{.mark} through the parts [and forms the]{.mark} essential
**relational conditions** under which [parts]{.mark} emerge and
exist]{.underline}. This approach makes it imperative for IR to look for
relations in much broader contexts which otherwise have been invisible,
understudied, or artificially carved up by mainstream IR. To advocate
for wholeness does not mean always privileging "macro-level" issues at
the global level. In any case, [whole-part or [macro-micro issues
are]{.mark} **always [already entangled]{.mark}** and co-emergent
(Wendt, 2015: 257). Micro parts and issues, precisely because they are
microscopic, may be **particularly prone** to be **diffusely spread and
enfolded** into various parts of the whole]{.underline}. As a result,
micro parts simultaneously develop an emergent, holographic property of
the whole. [The fact that [the **tiny coronavirus** can be]{.mark}
quickly [enfolded]{.mark} into almost every corner of the whole world
and turn global life upside down [illustrates the part-whole
entanglement]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we dismiss its holographically
holistic nature and impact at our own peril. To further illustrate,
often traditionally considered outside the purview of IR, [[micro
issues]{.mark} or events [such as]{.mark} music (Gienow-Hecht, 2015),
sports (e.g. **[ping-pong diplomacy]{.mark}**), the [Chernobyl]{.mark}
disaster (e.g. the collapse of the Soviet Union, van der Veen, 2013), a
flight school in Florida (e.g. 9/11), US subprime mortgage crisis,
[**Fukushima**, Wikileaks]{.mark}, melting polar ice caps, [a **Tunisian
street vendor**]{.mark} (e.g. the Arab Spring and the Syria
conflict]{.underline}) [and now even COVID-19 [may be]{.mark} all in
various ways "**[localized]{.mark}" holographic
[instantiations]{.mark}** [of the wholes]{.mark}. As such, [they]{.mark}
can and do [play an important part in]{.mark} both **reflecting** and
**[shaping the whole]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially in the form of
some unexpected events and surprising turns, such as the end of the Cold
War, 9/11, the global financial crisis, the rise of Donald Trump, and
the current global pandemic. True, some of those "micropolitical" issues
have begun to attract IR's attention (Kertzer, 2017; Solomon and Steele,
2017), but [overall the discipline lacks an **explicit** and
**holographic ontological** and conceptual foundation for a more
systematic engagement with the duality of whole-part]{.underline}. Of
course, we cannot deal with "the whole of reality all at once" (Bohm,
1980: 2; see also Wendt, 1999: 14). Often it is necessary to take things
"apart" and analyze them as if they were separable units. But it is
important to always remember the "as if" caveat, lest we reify them as
something objectively autonomous. It is also worth remembering that
ontologically international relations are always a holographic part of
bigger wholes, not closed or autonomous systems or units in and of
themselves. In this context, a [**[quantum holographic]{.mark}**
perspective [becomes **imperative**]{.mark} especially [in the
face,]{.mark} for example[, of]{.mark} the increasingly apparent
**human-nature holographic entanglement** as evidenced by mounting
"**local" [environmental crises]{.mark}** and their implications for
[**economic development**, international conflict, and **planetary
survival**]{.mark}. Contrary to the [prevailing IR approaches]{.mark}
that continue to [subordinate environmental issues to a **state-centric
framework** and a "**national economic" imperative**]{.mark} (Saurin,
1996), a quantum holographic approach has the potential to **bridge**
the **ontological and conceptual division** between the parts and the
wholes.]{.underline}

Analysis," International Affairs and Global Strategy, Vol.27, 2014.

Uncertainty, as noted earlier, is one of the key features of quantum
mechanics. It [holds that no matter how carefully we observe, even with
adequate knowledge of initial conditions, we can never objectively
understand a physical reality]{.underline}. Applying the concept to
politics, Cioffi-Revilla defines uncertainty as the "lack of sureness or
absence of strict determination in political life"44 Rathbun furthers
that "information is ambiguous because the world is complex and can only
be approximated and partially understood due to cognitive
limitations."45 He therefore sought to explain the element of
uncertainty within mainstream IR theories. For realists, it is
experienced in fear of each other's intention, while rationalists try to
cope with uncertainty through international institutions charged to
monitor and signal benign intent. For constructivists, uncertainty stems
from an assumption that states are uncertain about action to take when
norms as defined by identity are absent. Then cognitivists argue that
uncertainty emanates from the confusion caused by the complexity of
international politics as well as mental limitations of statesmen. 46
Assessing uncertainty from the quantum mechanical framework, we begin
with Heisenberg who is arguably the first to introduce the principle.
From his perspective, [we cannot completely describe an object since we
cannot simultaneously describe its momentum and position with
exactitude. [The more]{.mark} accurately [we understand **position**,
the less]{.mark} accurately [we understand]{.mark} the
**[momentum]{.mark}, vice versa**]{.underline}. [As such, it **becomes
impossible** to predict the **destination** of a moving object since we
cannot **accurately determine** its position and momentum at the same
time]{.underline}. From quantum mechanical thought, this is may be due
to hidden variables and/or non-locality. Non-locality describes the
possibility of a quantum state to interact with another quantum state of
the same pair, even when separated by large distances without an
established means of communication. [By position we refer to the
**location** of an object relative to a **reference point** while
momentum is taken to mean the measure of the motion of an object
relative to its mass and velocity]{.underline}. Position in theoretical
physics is synonymous with the condition of a State prior to an action
or event being analysed. By condition we mean the geographic and
politico-economic structure of a State. [In the same vein, the foreign
policy action of a State in a given case, accounts for momentum in
physics. Therefore, by directly applying Heisenberg's argument to
foreign policy analysis, [it is impossible to]{.mark} **completely
[understand]{.mark}** foreign policy [behaviour of a State **by merely
understanding** its condition]{.mark} prior to the behaviour being
analysed]{.underline}. Also, it is impossible to predict the outcome of
a given foreign policy behaviour. This explains why despite efforts to
predict the outcome of a given foreign policy behaviour, mainstream
approaches to foreign policy analysis have routinely fallen short in
this regard. [[A good example]{.mark} showing the compatibility of
Heisenberg's uncertainty in foreign policy analysis [could be found in
the]{.mark} recent [Arab Spring]{.mark}. An understanding of the
socio-political landscape of the Arab world had led [scholars of
different]{.mark} schools to [conclude that democracy was]{.mark}
essentially [incompatible]{.mark} with the Arab world. However, [at the
outbreak]{.mark} of the region-wide uprising, [scholars began to
**foretell democratization**]{.mark}. Soon, [scholars began to **make
reversals** in]{.mark} their [predictions]{.mark}, such that it **is no
longer fashionable** to equate the Arab uprising with
democratization.]{.underline} What is deducible from this instance is
that, in agreement with Heisenberg's uncertainty, [[it is impossible
to]{.mark} understand the present and [predict]{.mark} the future [by
simply understanding **initial conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
position is also understood by recalling that whereas the [[Cold
War]{.mark} engaged IR scholars in a war of paradigms, **[none of the
theories]{.mark}** and models [**predicted** the end]{.mark} of the
conflict.]{.underline}47 [[Schrodinger's **wave equation**]{.mark}
furthers our understanding of the **compatibility of quantum
mechanics**]{.underline} with foreign policy analysis. Inferring from
his postulation, it is impossible to understand the totality of a
State's foreign policy behaviour. Rather, [[every State possesses
**every possible**]{.mark} theoretical [element]{.mark} that can be
attributed to a State's foreign policy]{.underline}. For instance,
before observation is made, every state is weak and strong at the same
time; aggressive and accommodating; cooperative and competitive.
However, [[upon observation, the observer **interferes** with
reality]{.mark} such that the condition of [the State aligns with **the
premonition**]{.mark} of the observer/analyst. Thus, [we are
**uncertain** of a State's]{.mark} foreign policy [behaviour **until**
we decide to observe]{.mark} and/or analyse]{.underline}. [Upon
analysis, our [uncertainty is substituted by the '**creation' of
reality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is at this point therefore that the
foreign policy analyst relinquishes every claim to objectivity, having
created the reality s/he claims to analyse. Relating the foregoing to
Bohr's contribution to Quantum Mechanics, [[the]{.mark} foreign policy
[analyst can]{.mark} no longer [be regarded as an]{.mark} **impartial
observer** but as an **[active participant]{.mark}**. The instrument
with which s/he assesses a phenomenon directly interacts with the
physical object being observed to influence the result
obtained]{.underline}. Consequently, we could safely assume that if no
one was observing, then nothing would be existing. Then, should we now
assume that occurrences in international politics are the creation of
analysts? To a large extent, [the answer weighs to the affirmative and
accounts for why certain state and non-state actors, cognizant of this
fact, have immensely invested towards gaining the attention of
observers/analysts. **[Terrorist organizations]{.mark}** routinely [post
videos of **violence**]{.mark} on the internet [for analysts to
'**create' their existence**. States]{.mark} **regularly
[release]{.mark}** [videos]{.mark} and images of **military drills** and
military **hardware**. The essence is [to gain attention of **analysts**
who would]{.mark} therefore '**[create' the desired
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, [terrorism is **non-existent**
until it is so **designated**]{.mark} by analysts. More so, [war
is]{.mark} simply [what analysts]{.mark} and observers **[make of
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to the foregoing[, quantum
mechanics gives us insight in **understanding causation**. This is
chiefly in its **notion of interconnectedness** which carries
potentially **far-reaching implications** for foreign policy
analysis]{.underline}. According to Senge, et al, we are now aware that
interconnectivity is the organizing principle of the universe.48 The
universe is interconnected in a complex web or relationships such that
we cannot adequately understand a physical reality without acknowledging
its web of relationships. However, this aspect of the universe was
ignored by the Newtonian scientists perhaps as a result of the
pervasiveness of relationships which can sometimes fade into the
background so that "only the apparently separate 'things' of the world
are noticed."49 If objects are interconnected within the universe, do we
then assume same for humans and States? Of course, yes. This is largely
because humans as well as States share the same feature with all other
objects: wave-particle duality. As particles they have form, boundaries,
and identity while as wave, they possess an unstructured potential
which, according to Zohar, spreads out across the boundaries of space,
time, choice and identity.50 Therefore, State and non-State actors, as
applicable to other objects, are interconnected or better still
entangled in a complex manner that makes it particularly tasking if not
impossible to accurately assess foreign policy behaviour. From the
foregoing, it could be assumed that quantum mechanics emphasizes what we
cannot do over what we can do. How does it then help our understanding
of foreign policy? The answer is not far-fetched. [[By identifying
**what we cannot** do]{.mark}, [quantum mechanics saves us from]{.mark}
raising [**false alarms** and]{.mark} making [**erroneous claims**.
It]{.mark} rather [makes case for]{.mark} **intellectual
[diligence]{.mark}** [by encouraging **cross-paradigmatic approach** to
foreign policy]{.mark} analysis. It underscores that **[no single
theory]{.mark}** or approach to **foreign policy analysis** [is on its
own **adequate**]{.mark} for foreign policy analysis. Thus, by engaging
all possible approaches, the analyst increases the proportion of
objectivity in his/her analysis.]{.underline}

Control of Knowledge and Subjectivity

Ramose (2003) argues that [the rationale that European colonialism
operated on was]{.underline} an unsubstantiated [belief that Africans,
among other non-European races, were not rational beings]{.underline}
hence, they were [not entitled to]{.underline} what rational beings
claimed as their [entitlement and rights]{.underline}. He argues that:
One of the bases of colonisation was that the belief 'man is a rational
animal' was not spoken of the African, the Amerindian, and the
Australasian. Aristotle's definition of man was deeply inscribed in the
social ethos of those communities and societies that undertook the
so-called voyages of discovery---apparently driven by innocent
curiosity. But it is well known that these voyages changed into violent
colonial incursions. It seems then that the entire process of
decolonisation has, among others, upheld and not jettisoned the
questionable belief that 'man is a rational animal' excludes the
African, the Amerindian, and the Australasian. (Ramose 2003: 1) What
Ramose manages to reveal is that [the]{.underline} **[imaginary right
and exclusive claim]{.underline}** [to rationality]{.underline} by
Europe(ans) [is only realised because of]{.underline} **[material
power]{.underline}** [fashioned to **guard and preserve the myth that
Africa is unable to rationally construct knowledge**]{.underline}. The
power of the gun is what Europe used to scatter its patterns, templates,
designs and standards across the globe. [Power]{.underline} in European
terms [is tantamount to instruments of control emitted by
violence.]{.underline} [This imaginary exclusive right to
rationality]{.underline} by Europe(ans) has [wide-ranging and extensive
implications for knowledge production about Africa by
Africans.]{.underline} This is meant [to cast doubt and reinforce the
modern bias on Africa and other non-European races;]{.underline} it is
also meant [to make the non-European doubt themselves as to their
capacity to rationalise, think and philosophise]{.underline}.
[**European** imagination, and hence **modernity**, "is doubtful
\[that\] Africans are wholly and truly human beings" and it questions
the Africans' capacity to philosophise]{.underline} (Ramose 2003: 5).
The pattern that European imagination implanted in the mind of the
African is to doubt herself and himself. This pattern is relatable to
what Mudimbe (1987: 2) called the "organising structure" and what wa
Thiongó (1981: 94) called the "organising principle". This chapter adds
the 'ordering structure' to the long-standing patterns of control that
European civilisation subjected Africa to. [The self-doubting African
cannot and is not meant to know or produce knowledge about
\[theirself\]]{.underline} ~~herself and himself~~, [let alone
\[their\]]{.underline} ~~her/his~~ [surroundings and
localities]{.underline}. [Europeans]{.underline}, as are self-acclaimed
exclusive recipients of rationality, have thus [put themselves on
a]{.underline} **[pedestal of knowledge production]{.underline}**, [and
at the]{.underline} **[apex of]{.underline}** correct and therefore
**[truthful knowledge]{.underline}**. [There is an]{.underline}
**[underlying attitude]{.underline}** [that exudes itself as though
Europeans were the only race and civilisation that holds and embodies
the truth]{.underline}. [As a result, an African's right to knowledge is
contingent upon a "passive as well as uncritical assimilation" of the
knowledge produced in Europe for Europeans]{.underline} and the whole
world (Ramose 2003: 2). [Africans are then supposed to faithfully
implement the knowledge that is constructed, defined and designed
"outside Africa"]{.underline} (ibid.). **[Coloniality of
knowledge]{.underline}** [therefore refers to the]{.underline}
**[Euro-North American intellectual thought]{.underline}** [as the
referral point upon which]{.underline} **[all other
epistemologies]{.underline}** and knowledges [are judged]{.underline}
against. [As an epistemological movement]{.underline}, "[it has always
been]{.underline} **[overshadowed by hegemonic Euro-north
American-centric intellectual thought]{.underline}** [and social
theories]{.underline}" (Ramose 2003: 2). [Knowledge production, and the
capacity to think and generate is a preserve of Euro-North
American-centric modernity resulting in the creation of "border
thinking"]{.underline} (Arturo Escobar in Mignolo 2001: 179). The
thinking is [located in the Euro-North American civilisation, beyond
that geography, there exist no rationality. Such is the thinking of
Euro-North American-centric civilisation]{.underline}.

### Link --- Realism 

#### Realism and rational choice theory explains the international system as only being sustained by Western cultural [norms]{.underline} and [values]{.underline} --- this advances a social agenda in favor of [ethnonationalism]{.underline} and fascism.

[[Realists]{.underline}]{.mark} are materialists at heart, yet they
frequently make [[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[rest on
**cultural assumptions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They describe themselves
as studying [[conflict groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, and when we probe
the nature of these groups, they commonly [appear as cultural
units]{.underline}: [[nation-states with **national**]{.mark}
**characters**]{.underline}, [[identities]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
interests]{.underline}. The anarchic international system gives states
certain primary interests --- principally survival --- but [national
[culture]{.mark}]{.underline} is commonly seen as a [**key
[source]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} other
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Many realists admit that [[today's international order rests on]{.mark}
legitimacy]{.underline} as much as material might. And when explaining
such legitimacy, they join others in [[emphasizing **Western
civilization**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} is
said to [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[norms and values that
inform]{.mark} and sustain **[modern
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} former
Secretary of State Henry [[Kissinger]{.underline}]{.mark} and others,
the [[erosion of this cultural foundation poses a **fundamental
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. How can "[[regions
with]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[divergent
cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}, [histories]{.underline}, [and traditional
theories of order [vindicate]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[legitimacy of
**any common system**]{.underline}]{.mark}?" Kissinger asked in his book
World Order.

On the surface, it might seem like [**[r]{.mark}**ational
**[c]{.mark}**hoice **[t]{.mark}**heory]{.underline} would have even
less to say about culture than realism. Yet culture enters rationalist
arguments, too, in three ways: [when adherents explain]{.underline} the
[rational choice of norms]{.underline}, when [they accommodate
**cultural preferences**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in their
[[argu]{.mark}ment]{.underline} that [[common knowledge]{.mark} is
[**essential** to solving coordination problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The last of these is particularly interesting, as it is here that
rationalists express a version of IR's default conception of culture.
Coordination problems exist when actors have common interests but can
only realize as much if they coordinate their choices, usually without
direct communication.

[To overcome **such problems**]{.underline}, [actors rely on **mutual
expectations**]{.underline}, and such expectations come [from common
knowledge]{.underline}: things I know, and you know, and we both know
that we both know. Rationalists see cultural norms, values, and
practices as a major source of such knowledge, and thus **[[common
culture]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [[important to]{.mark}
solving]{.underline} the [variety of **[coordination]{.mark} problems**
actors navigate every day]{.underline}. Most rationalists focus on
specific collaboration problems and localized common knowledge, but
others [[make **larger claims** about social order]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Here the claim is a familiar one: **[[Culturally homogeneous
societies]{.mark}, which they take as their baseline, are [more
conducive to]{.mark} the [solution of]{.mark} coordination [problems
than diverse societies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Prefer Hybrid IR instead of static realism -- it reorients politics away from one of anarchy to the developing of marginalized first foreign policy.

[Social science **knowledge production**]{.underline} around security
[remains highly **Eurocentric**]{.underline}, [often 'shaped by specific
cultures of thought]{.underline}, **[self-perpetuated]{.underline}**
**[epistemological superiority]{.underline}**, **[and codified academic
practices']{.underline}**.59 [This]{.underline} Eurocentric
[bias]{.underline} [constitutes]{.underline} [**a major barrier** to
**dispassionate** knowledge generation]{.underline}, [leading to
the]{.underline} [misrepresentation of **white security as global
security**]{.underline}; and by extension the politics of identity,
which lies at the core of that bias, is occluded. In this context,
Africa is particularly disadvantaged, as most scholarship that seeks to
construct and mediate its conflicts is ungrounded and unrepresentative.
The dominance of whiteness that is integral to such knowledge production
results in a narrow and often parochial European perspective that is
projected as universal. While taking cognizance of the geocultural
diversity of 'Africa', which is highly dynamic, a more fundamental
question about such methodological whiteness relates to the sources for
the generation of the knowledge relating to Africa. Several contentions
exist about what sources are available and necessary in presenting an
African episteme that routinely overlooks orality as a credible source.
[Presenting an African]{.underline} [episteme]{.underline} [of
alternativity]{.underline} [must]{.underline} necessarily [recognize
**orality** **as a credible source of knowledge**]{.underline}. That
acknowledgement of orality as a dependable source for structuring an
African episteme was famously dismissed by Hugh Trevor-Roper, later Lord
Dacre of Glanton, who asserted that: 'Perhaps in the future there will
be some African history to teach. But at present \[the 1950s\] there is
none, or very little: there is only the history of Europeans in Africa.
The rest is darkness.'60

Trevor-Roper's contemptuous approach sought to consign Africa to the
peripheries of history by overlooking the ways in which orality and oral
traditions permeate every aspect of society, politics and everyday life.
Hegel made similar trivializing conclusions about Africa. According to
Kwame Anthony Appiah, in Hegelian thought, '[Africa was tropical Africa,
black Africa, tribal Africa, Africa without written
records]{.underline}'---a place that [Hegel]{.underline} had [dismissed
as not being a 'historical continent']{.underline} in his Philosophy of
History. 61 Orality, however, presents 'a body of knowledge' that forms
the basis for the African community in thinking about the present, and
moves beyond what E. H. Carr aptly captured as 'the fetishism of
documents'.62

Such [fetishization]{.underline} effectively [ignores African
insecurities]{.underline} [as they are experienced by]{.underline}
[social groups]{.underline} and communities [across the
continent]{.underline}. [The **absence of African
insecurities**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [mainstream]{.underline}
[security knowledge]{.underline} [attracts critical
questions]{.underline} [about the relevance of such
knowledge]{.underline}, [given the **insufficiency of conventional
IR**]{.underline} and SS as neutral [sites for knowledge]{.underline}
[production]{.underline}, knowledge dissemination and policy-making [on
African security]{.underline}. **[To counter Eurocentrism]{.underline}**
and therefore become relevant in African contexts, [IR]{.underline} and
SS [discourses need]{.underline} **[to break with the
stranglehold]{.underline}** [of the colonial]{.underline}
[past]{.underline} that is still present in European policy circles---as
in the following quotation from a speech by the former French president,
Nicolas Sarkozy: The tragedy of Africa is that the African man has never
really entered history. The African peasant has known only the eternal
renewal of time via the endless repetition of the same actions and the
same words. In this mentality, where everything always starts over
again, there is no place for human adventure nor for any idea of
progress.63

[This anachronistic trope]{.underline} [and the other **Eurocentric
perspectives** discussed]{.underline} [earlier **invisibilize**
**African agency**]{.underline} [and **embedded resources**]{.underline}
that [have potential for **regenerative**]{.underline}
**[responses]{.underline}** [to the security challenges facing African
states]{.underline} and their societies. Thus, [an episteme of
alternativity]{.underline} [appears]{.underline} [necessary in order to
decolonize security]{.underline} [knowledge]{.underline} and its impact
on policy-makers [by helping to **establish an 'alternative'
epistemology**]{.underline} of IR and SS that is genuinely global,
**[inclusive and universal.]{.underline}**

[The episteme of alternativity]{.underline} [refers]{.underline} to 'the
extent to which knowledge production endeavours to offer [**conceptual
and practical** **alternatives**]{.underline} [for addressing
current]{.underline} [problems]{.underline} [and]{.underline}/or for
[achieving normative]{.underline} [and political goals]{.underline} and
practical solutions [via **deconstructive**]{.underline} and
reconstructive modes of **[critique']{.underline}** **[or
inquiry]{.underline}**.64 An episteme of alternativity is, therefore,
[an intellectual device]{.underline} [embedded]{.underline} [in critical
discourses]{.underline} [to enable]{.underline} the
[identification]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[transformation]{.underline} [of problems]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
the [basis of alternative interpretations]{.underline} and strategies in
order to expand the possibilities **[for freedom and
emancipation]{.underline}**.65 Related to the episteme of alternativity
are 'alternative discourses', conceived as the set of discourses
developed in opposition to conventional Eurocentric social science.
[This]{.underline} [set]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[discourses]{.underline} [represents]{.underline} ['**a revolt against
"intellectual imperialism**]{.underline}"' in the sense
[that]{.underline} it [constitutes]{.underline} [an
ideational]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [intellectual]{.underline}
[setting]{.underline} in the ongoing [struggle]{.underline} [against
neo-colonialism and racism]{.underline} [**in** both **intellectual and
policy spaces**]{.underline}.66 Similarly, alternative discourses
challenge the racially slanted division of labour in the social
sciences, within the political economy of knowledge and in the
corresponding [hegemonic structuring]{.underline} [of knowledge
generation]{.underline}, which **[ignores orality as a credible
source.]{.underline}**

The idea of alternativity or alternative discourse is linked to
'alternative interpretations and strategies, based on normative
commitments that differ from those articulated, or discoverable, in
discourses or social arrangements in question, to facilitate the
emancipation of subaltern social forces'.67 Thus, rather than
constituting a single totalizing perspective, alternativity as an
episteme serves as an ontological and epistemological site, first, for
debunking entrenched knowledge deriving from path dependence, slavery,
coloniality or the continuing entrapment in Eurocentrism of scholarly
and policy discourses; and second, for the constitution or recognition
of alternative knowledge and experiences that solve scholarly and
practical problems. [The process of deconstruction]{.underline} [and
reconstruction of knowledge]{.underline}, therefore,
[requires]{.underline} [a focus on **surrounding**]{.underline}
**[subnational]{.underline}**, national and regional
**[historical]{.underline}** **[experiences and cultural
practices]{.underline}** in order [to build situated
alternatives]{.underline} [or contextually grounded
knowledge]{.underline} [that enhance freedom and
emancipation]{.underline}.68

While emphasizing the crucial role of 'alternatives', alternativity as
an episteme does not imply the wholesale rejection of western
scholarship or the replacement of concepts and categories used in
western social science with non-western ones. Rather, it encourages
thinking in eclectic or universal terms in order to decolonize knowledge
through the integration of experiences and perspectives originating from
the non-West into IR and SS discourses and theorizing.
[Thus]{.underline} the **[first stage]{.underline}** in generating
alternative discourse [**is to identify** and]{.underline} [expose
**Eurocentrism** or Orientalism]{.underline} [and]{.underline} their
[implications for spaces formerly]{.underline} [colonized by
Europeans]{.underline}. In relation to security in particular, these
phenomena can be traced to the 'omnipresence of statist assumptions'
still prevalent in SS.69

This is typical of traditional IR theories such as realism, which
perceives security as a derivative of power.70 [The perception of
security]{.underline} as a function of power [is based on the
logic]{.underline} of **[anarchy]{.underline}** [and on the
assumptions]{.underline}, first, [that **political
differences**]{.underline} and economic disputes [within the state are
**always addressed authoritatively**]{.underline}, [and
second]{.underline}, that **[threats to]{.underline}**
[security]{.underline} [**will always originate from outside in the form
of state aggression**. The **insufficiency** **of this
perspective**]{.underline} [when applied to the context]{.underline} [of
Africa]{.underline} or current global challenges, including
environmental stresses and strains as well as health pandemics such as
Ebola and COVID-19, **[seems obvious]{.underline}**.71 [In Africa, it is
the dynamics of **state**--**society**]{.underline} relations [that are
critical to understanding security]{.underline}. In other words, the
relationship between the state and its citizens, [in terms of **state
action and or inaction**]{.underline} and the corresponding social
responses, [has been important in shaping security outcomes on the
continent]{.underline}. [The dominant statist assumption]{.underline}
that [underpins the Weberian state is therefore at]{.underline}
[variance]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the [underlying realities of
the African context]{.underline}, [where security]{.underline} policy
(or, for that matter, security governance) [is an outcome of the
**intermingling of multiple orders**]{.underline} [that are **linked to
both state and non-state actors** within a framework of
hybridity.]{.underline}

The concept of [**hybrid** **security** orders]{.underline} [is an
evolving perspective]{.underline} that has the potential to elaborate
and complement IR and SS theorizing about security, as it **[offers a
perspective]{.underline}** **[outside]{.underline}** [the conventional
**western**]{.underline} **[assumptions]{.underline}** and points of
reference. The concept is emerging as an alternative framework to the
legal-- rational approach to politics and security which, while
intrinsic to the state-centric logic of IR and SS, hardly reflects the
lived experiences of most people outside the OECD states, often
portrayed as the model against which the degree of state functionality
and stability is judged.72 [It reflects]{.underline} the ways in which
[the interplay between different actors and]{.underline} [institutions,
across the formal/informal divide]{.underline}, shapes the sites where
security is conceived, negotiated, enacted and re-enacted. [As a
non-state-centric approach]{.underline} [to security
governance]{.underline}, [hybridity]{.underline} [has been defined as
'**the mult**iple]{.underline} **[sites of political
authority]{.underline}** and governance [where security is
enacted]{.underline} and negotiated', including 'the multiple ways
traditional, personal[, kin-based or clientelistic logics]{.underline}
[interact]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [modern]{.underline},
imported, or [rational actor logics]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
[shifting historical conditions]{.underline} [of particular national and
local contexts']{.underline}.73

Thus, [unlike the **Weberian** state]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
**[monopolizes]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [**legitimate** use of
**violence**]{.underline} in order [to provide security]{.underline} and
other public goods, [the African state]{.underline} must **[share the
function of]{.underline}** **[security governance with other
actors]{.underline}**, each of which may be perceived as legitimate and
authoritative in its own right. While the Weberian or western security
logic, which underpins the state fragility discourse, might identify the
diffusion of power and authority over the apparatus of violence as a
malady that needs to be cured in order to assure security, hybrid
political orders conceive of the diversity of actors within the security
arena as a source of strength and resilience in a context where the
state has very limited reach and barely permeates its territorial
peripheries[. **A limited state presence**]{.underline} or
state-delivered security **[does not]{.underline}**, however, [imply a
**return to** the **Hobbesian**]{.underline} [state]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [nature]{.underline}, [as securitization
theory]{.underline} and its underlying methodological whiteness logic
[suggest]{.underline}. This is because there exist a plethora of
[pre-colonial structures]{.underline} and institutions
[organized]{.underline} [around clan heads]{.underline}, chiefs, queen
mothers, [traditional priests]{.underline} [and secret societies that
continue to maintain law and order]{.underline},74 [particularly in
relational communities]{.underline} where members sharing a common sense
of identity/kinship, language, religion and norms place strong emphasis
on the values of collectivism, rather than individualism.75 Nor are
statutory institutions necessarily the preferred forum for seeking
justice and the resolution of political differences. Research suggests,
for instance, that more than 80 per cent of day-to-day disputes in
Africa are resolved through non-statutory mechanisms.76

In Liberia, for example, people in relational [communities]{.underline}
[generally]{.underline} have a preference for [out-of-court settlement
of]{.underline} [disputes]{.underline}, airing their grievances and
seeking redress through indigenous structures, perceiving the police and
the statutory courts as an 'enemy' and a 'breeding ground for conflict
in the community'.77 [This is because the retributive
justice]{.underline} [delivered by statutory]{.underline} courts often
carries the potential to distort and [undermine the interlocking web of
economic,]{.underline} [political, social and strategic
interdependence]{.underline}, such that relational disharmony ensues.
[The purpose of justice in such communities]{.underline}, therefore, [is
not to punish in the punitive]{.underline} [sense]{.underline}
traditionally upheld in western jurisprudence, [but to achieve
'an]{.underline} [outcome]{.underline} [that both sides accept as a fair
basis]{.underline} [for resettlement]{.underline} and the restoration of
the unity and harmony that have been disrupted. Reconciliation is a
cardinal principle of the settlement of disputes entrenched in
communities across Africa.'78

**[The point is not to romanticize]{.underline}** or idealize
[indigenous mechanisms of justice]{.underline}, security or conflict, as
they are often no more effective than statutory institutions beyond the
specific confines of relational communities [in which they
hold]{.underline} [force]{.underline}. Indeed, [they come with multiple
problems]{.underline}, [including their patriarchal
hierarchies]{.underline}, which provide the basis for the exclusion of
women and young people from processes of decision-making, and their
tendency to gloss over people's fundamental human rights and to corrode
the legal--rational basis of the state. In fact, [uncritical
preoccupation]{.underline} [with the 'traditional'
'obscures]{.underline} [the potentially regressive]{.underline} [and
violent features of governance beyond]{.underline} [the margins of the
state']{.underline}.79 [The fact remains,]{.underline} however, [that
**these non-state entities** exist empirically]{.underline} [with **huge
influence on security governance**]{.underline},
[particularly]{.underline} [when the state is **unable** or
unwilling]{.underline} [to deliver basic]{.underline} [public
goods]{.underline}, a rather common feature of the African state.
[These]{.underline} [entities]{.underline} [support]{.underline} [the
state and complement its institutions]{.underline}, [**enhancing the
overall resilience** of the system]{.underline}. They should be seen not
as mechanisms to be supplanted within the ideational and material
context shaped by methodological whiteness, in which context the African
state continues to suffer from a legitimacy deficit, but as possessing a
positive potential as agents of security governance, which can be
harnessed to provide the state with a modicum of resilience.

[Recognizing hybridity]{.underline} as an aspect of alternativity [can
enhance the policy relevance of]{.underline} [research]{.underline} [and
knowledge production]{.underline} in IR and SS, particularly as 'the
boundaries between state and non-state security institutions have eroded
to the point where they have become almost indistinguishable and their
personnel are virtually interchangeable'.80 [Hybridity
therefore]{.underline} [provides]{.underline} a **[veritable
laboratory]{.underline}** [and a perspective]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} not only **[can complement]{.underline}** and
elaborate [IR]{.underline} and SS [knowledge]{.underline} [generation
and policy articulation]{.underline}, [but **can improve the**
**security experiences** **and well-being of people in Africa and**
**beyond**, as they are recognized as both objects and subjects of
security with agency.]{.underline}

[This is]{.underline} particularly [evident]{.underline} [in
**methodological whiteness**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
**[whitewashes]{.underline}** [how **race**]{.underline}, [**as** a
**generative** and structuring device]{.underline}, [has been
intrinsic]{.underline} [to knowledge production]{.underline} and the
manner in [which]{.underline} this [influences]{.underline} [ways of
making sense of the]{.underline} [world]{.underline}. [Methodological
whiteness]{.underline}, according to Bhambra, [represents]{.underline}
[a way of reflecting]{.underline} on [the world that fails]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [acknowledge]{.underline} [the role]{.underline}
[played by race]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [the very structuring of
that world,]{.underline} and of the ways in which knowledge is
constructed and legitimated within it. [It **fails** to
**recognise**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [**dominance** of
'**Whiteness'**]{.underline} [as anything other]{.underline} [than the
standard state]{.underline} [of affairs]{.underline} [and treats a
limited perspective]{.underline}---that [deriving from White
experience]{.underline}---[as a universal perspective]{.underline}.21

Thus, [methodological whiteness]{.underline} [reflects]{.underline} a
denial of [the centrality of identity politics]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [the construction]{.underline} [of the global power
structure]{.underline} [that the West constituted]{.underline} [for
itself]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} [**single-image** **mode of
worlding**]{.underline} or world-making clearly [shows]{.underline} [the
reluctance of IR scholarship]{.underline} [to go beyond the **popular
Westphalian model**]{.underline} [to expose]{.underline} the role played
by **[slavery and empire]{.underline}** in the merger of the world [as a
single political unit]{.underline}---let alone the extent to which these
historical processes structured human relationships and continue to
organize the modern world.22

Howell and Richter-Montpetit suggest that [the concept of '**human'** is
a constituted]{.underline} [effect]{.underline} [of the **enslavement of
'others'**]{.underline} and their concomitant rendering into things or
subjects [who]{.underline} [were never considered]{.underline} [as
'(fully) human']{.underline} [in the first instance]{.underline}.23
[This]{.underline} mode of signification [represented]{.underline} [the
'Black or savage Other']{.underline} [as the foil against]{.underline}
[which]{.underline} the idea of '[humanity']{.underline}
[takes]{.underline} on meaning. [The configuration of]{.underline} [the
world]{.underline} and the organization of human relationships within it
[is]{.underline}, therefore, [a product of racism and
colonialism]{.underline}. [The structuring effect]{.underline} of race
[is]{.underline} manifest [in]{.underline} [most western
scholarship]{.underline}, including Samuel Huntington's influential 'The
clash of civilizations'. According to Huntington, a civilization is 'the
highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural
identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other
species'.24 [While]{.underline} [identifying civilization]{.underline}
[as marking the boundary]{.underline} [between]{.underline} '**[humans'
and 'other species']{.underline}**, [Huntington]{.underline}
[casts]{.underline} [doubt]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the possibility
of [an African civilization]{.underline}. In his assessment of
international events and processes following the termination of the Cold
War, Huntington claimed that world politics would be shaped largely by
the interactions among 'seven or eight major civilizations', which he
identified as 'Western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu,
Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African civilization'.25

This account demonstrates how white biases intrude on scholarly
reasoning in the hegemonic production and reproduction of the world and
on the place accorded to Africa within it. Not only does Huntington's
account signify the continuous reinvention of Africa, which is
invariably represented as occupying the bottom link of the human 'Chain
of Being; that is, on a rung of the ladder lower than that of all',26
his scepticism regarding whether or not Africa constitutes a
civilization, which, according to him, distinguishes humans from other
species, recalls how chattel slavery 'dehumanized' black Africans,
rendering them into things, the property of the European slave master.
The process of dehumanizing, in turn, stripped Africans of voice,
submerging and silencing them, thereby enabling Europe, which ostensibly
was more articulate and possessed of the finer forms of reason and
morals, to arrogate to itself the role of the creator of 'truths' and
the ultimate judge of morals and virtues. Such perspectives have also
been informed by the absence of both comprehensive documented accounts
and holistic archaeological evidence that shed light on Africa in past
times, thereby leaving the reconstruction of Africa's past and its
historical scholarship to western scholars, who have tended to ignore
orality as a tool for reconstructing the past.27

Thus, as well [as writing the]{.underline} [history of
'man']{.underline} [from its own perspective]{.underline},
[Europe]{.underline} also [**downgraded** the markers of
knowledge]{.underline} [for others to the '**status of folklore, myths
and shamanism'**]{.underline}, **[distinguishing]{.underline}**
[them]{.underline} **[from]{.underline}** the '[**rational'**,
'**logical'** and '**objective'** approaches]{.underline} to knowledge
production [that were deemed hallmarks of European
civilization]{.underline}.28 [Methodological whiteness]{.underline}, by
implication, [is intrinsic]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the process of
[determining the very nature]{.underline} [of]{.underline} that [which
is just]{.underline}, [right and morally permissible]{.underline}. Not
even the construction of such seemingly inclusive concepts as
cosmopolitanism and universalism are devoid of political effects, as
they were characterized by the exclusion of non-European voices,29 and
by the omission of slavery. Even Immanuel Kant---who is widely
considered the prophet of normative universalism and moral
cosmopolitanism30---ironically omits the institution of slavery from
most of his major treatises on love, humanity and solidarity, while
writing at a time when 'slavery was both the reality and the most potent
metaphor for the absence of liberty'.31 The contradictions and limits
within Kantian thinking, and its links to colonialism and practices of
racialization, undermine the acclaimed universalism of Kant's law of
hospitality.

Thus, [despite]{.underline} [the]{.underline} much-vaunted
[claim]{.underline} [to objectivity in social science]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [representation]{.underline} [of social science
concepts]{.underline}, [methods and knowledge as
race-neutral]{.underline}, [figures]{.underline} [such as]{.underline}
[Huntington and Kant]{.underline} [exemplify]{.underline} [the way in
which race is]{.underline} [integral to knowledge
generation]{.underline} [and the manner]{.underline} in
[which]{.underline} [the process]{.underline} [of knowledge
production]{.underline} [is an outcome of underlying]{.underline} [power
relations]{.underline}.32 [Their]{.underline} hegemonic
[construction]{.underline} [of knowledge shows]{.underline}
[how]{.underline} **[methodological whiteness]{.underline}**
[**interferes** **with scholarly reasoning**]{.underline},
**[constraining]{.underline}** the potential for [**dispassionate
knowledge** **generation**.]{.underline} At the same time,
[methodological]{.underline} [whiteness]{.underline} [shows]{.underline}
[how]{.underline} the [occlusion of race]{.underline} [and
coloniality]{.underline} [remains]{.underline} [a **constitutive**
**element**]{.underline} **[of]{.underline}** the **[IR]{.underline}**
and SS [disciplines]{.underline} as well as of the very construction of
the subjects and objects of security in world politics. **[The process
involves]{.underline}** the [**accentuation** of certain
facts]{.underline}, which is also [known as '**presence'**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [**omission or suppression** of
others]{.underline}, **[through]{.underline}** a process of
'**[erasure']{.underline}**, [in discussions of world
politics]{.underline}. In other words, [the absence]{.underline} [or
erasure of race is]{.underline} [deployed]{.underline} either [to make
'becoming]{.underline} [like Europe a moral imperative']{.underline},33
or, [through]{.underline} [colonially]{.underline} [scripted
imageries]{.underline}, [to dismiss African agency]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thereby to [justify and perpetuate European
paternalism]{.underline} on the continent. The proclivity of
methodological whiteness to generate biased characterizations and
interpretations of African people and their insecurities means that gaps
often exist between what is captured in IR and SS knowledge as 'truths'
and what actually pertains on the ground. This raises fundamental
questions about the relevance and validity of truth claims in ongoing IR
and SS scholarly and policy discourses in relation to states and
societies in Africa.

Moreover, [the constitutive character of]{.underline} [race]{.underline}
[means]{.underline} that the [dominance of whiteness
manifests]{.underline} [itself]{.underline} [even when]{.underline}
[western academics]{.underline} and policy professionals [make conscious
efforts]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [leave]{.underline} many of their
[biases at the door]{.underline}.34 In other words, [even when western
scholars]{.underline} [seek]{.underline} [to be]{.underline} kind and
[sympathetic]{.underline} towards people in the non-West[, they often
struggle]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [overcome]{.underline} the
structures of [coloniality]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} political and cultural [instruments]{.underline} [that
have excluded colonized]{.underline} [people]{.underline} [from
knowledge-forming]{.underline} [and decision-making]{.underline}. It is
for this reason that [Wallerstein]{.underline} [concludes]{.underline}
that a majority of **[critical social science]{.underline}**
[literature]{.underline} [**ends** **up reproducing tropes of
Eurocentric bias**]{.underline} in its analyses.35

Howell and Richter-Montpetit demonstrate this systematically by showing
how Foucauldian security studies and the Copenhagen School's
securitization theory, which purport to serve as crucial correctives,
end up reaffirming Eurocentric thought in security discourses.36 They
show how the use of [racially coded concepts]{.underline} [project
Europe]{.underline} [as **the apex of civilization**]{.underline}
[while]{.underline} [locating]{.underline} [the modern-day
equivalent]{.underline} [to Hobbes's '**state of nature'**]{.underline}
[in the former colonial spaces in Africa]{.underline}. The Copenhagen
School's securitization theory,37 which otherwise reflects a clear
methodological rigour in IR and SS theorizing, and openly recognizes
race as a problem, has been exposed by Howell and Richter-Montpetit as a
theory constituted by and steeped in racism. They identify in
securitization theory an idea of 'civilizationism' which comprises
'racist (theoretical) perspectives' rooted in three basic assumptions:
(1) Civilizations can, and ought to, advance, and some (western)
civilizations are more 'advanced'; (2) civilizational progress is not
only technological and material, but political and moral; and (3) the
'underdevelopment' of certain civilizations represents a problem for, or
threat to, developed ones.38

[These]{.underline} [assumptions]{.underline} [combine]{.underline} with
[methodological whiteness]{.underline} [and 'antiblack
racism']{.underline} [to distinguish between]{.underline} [politics and
security,]{.underline} or [politicization]{.underline}, [which signifies
reasoned]{.underline} or civilized [dialogue]{.underline} engaged in by
Europe/the West, [and securitization,]{.underline} [which is
represented]{.underline} [as coming with potential
degeneration]{.underline} [into a racially scripted imagery of an
uncivilized 'state of nature',]{.underline} located mostly in African
settings. Securitization, therefore, serves as a justification for
breaking 'normal' political rules.

[The pervasive nature]{.underline} [of]{.underline} methodological
[whiteness]{.underline} [means]{.underline} that [its **pernicious**
effects]{.underline} [are]{.underline} also **[traceable]{.underline}**
[to **even** scholarly]{.underline} [works]{.underline} [**by** many
**southern or non-western thinkers**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
[happens]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the process of
internalization or ['**internalized Orientalism'**]{.underline}
[where]{.underline}by [people]{.underline}, including scholars and
policy-makers, **[develop a feeling of inferiority]{.underline}** [or
self-hatred]{.underline}, [while]{.underline} [identifying]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the [radically]{.underline} [different]{.underline}
[ideas]{.underline} [handed over by the former
colonizers]{.underline}.39 Through this process, [black
people]{.underline} [come]{.underline} [to share in the **false
belief**]{.underline} that [they are **inferior**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the [white]{.underline} [colonizers]{.underline}.40
[This]{.underline} [distorted image]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline}
**[manifest]{.underline}** [as an outcome of the **psychological
dimensions of colonization**]{.underline}, made [possible]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} the [imposition of the colonizer's
systems]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [language, culture, religion and
education]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} cultural
[processes]{.underline} [converge]{.underline} [to develop in the minds
of]{.underline} [the colonized]{.underline} [the corrupted
belief]{.underline} that [they are culturally inferior to
whites]{.underline} [and]{.underline} others, [resulting]{.underline}
[in a sense of shame and self-contempt that]{.underline} [leads to a
feeling of hopelessness]{.underline} and [**a desire to think and behave
like Europeans**.]{.underline}41 As consequence, the West comes to serve
as the point of reference not only for the former colonizer, but also
for the postcolonial states and their citizens. When complemented by
internalization or internalized Orientalism, methodological whiteness
ossifies, becoming all the more resistant to change. [The received
wisdom]{.underline} [that represents the West as the producer of
security knowledge]{.underline}, on the one hand, [and]{.underline}
[Africa]{.underline} [as the consumer of security
knowledge]{.underline}, on the other, [has much to do with the **failure
to recognize** the role played by **race in the construction of the
world**]{.underline} and the production of knowledge within it.

[These]{.underline} unequal [relations]{.underline} also [**underpin and
sustain** the political economy]{.underline} [of knowledge
production]{.underline},42 [and]{.underline} the [current balance
of]{.underline} [power]{.underline} [between scholars in the
West]{.underline} [and their]{.underline} [counterparts]{.underline} [in
the global South]{.underline}, [resulting]{.underline} in what Alatas
terms '[academic dependency']{.underline} in the social sciences.43 In
this relation of dependency, [**the building and testing of**
**theory**]{.underline}, as well as methodological innovations, [**are**
considered legitimate]{.underline} [**tasks of** scholars in **the
global North**]{.underline}, [while]{.underline} **[scholars in the
developing world]{.underline}** [are consigned]{.underline} [to the
collection of **empirical data**.]{.underline} The nature of this
division of labour implies that theoretical and methodological
innovation remains a major challenge for African scholars, who must meet
western standards of knowledge production and of what constitutes
legitimate knowledge. As a result, [African scholars are often
**under-represented**]{.underline} [in most top international
peer-reviewed journals]{.underline} in the social and physical sciences.
[This power imbalance has had implications]{.underline} [for policy
articulation]{.underline} [and ownership in Africa, in the sense that
security policy]{.underline} [around such issue areas as security sector
reform]{.underline}; [disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; and

[The]{.underline} **["China threat"]{.underline}** mentioned so often by
U.S. officials in all quarters of Washington D.C. [is a different kind
of projection of power---a **psychological projection** of the coming
end of the U.S.' ability to dictate global affairs without any
significant challenge.]{.underline} [The United States, unlike China,
has little to offer Africa or the rest of the Global South]{.underline}.
U.S. share in the global economy has shrunk and the economic crisis
precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic will only accelerate this trend.
Many nations in [the Global South]{.underline}, especially African
nations, [have experienced generation after generation of poverty and
underdevelopment under the U.S.-dominated financial arrangements of the
IMF and World Bank]{.underline} . [U.S. imperialism has deployed much of
its military arsenal to Africa and Asia to **arrest the possibility** of
South-South cooperation replacing U.S. and **Western
domination**]{.underline}. The U.S. ruling class is not in complete
agreement over how to carry out the related tasks of containing China
and suppressing the self-determination of African nations. Former
president Barack Obama [expanded]{.underline} the U.S. Africa Command
([AFRICOM]{.underline}) to all but a single African country principally
[to gain political and military influence over African governments and
persuade them over time to reject China.]{.underline} [AFRICOM's
growth]{.underline} also [aligned with the]{.underline} Obama
administration's "[Pivot to Asia]{.underline}," [which ultimately laid
the basis for the massive militarization of the Asia
Pacific]{.underline} that Trump now oversees. [**China's containment**
was primarily regarded as a project of military coercion where nations
in Africa and Asia would bow to the dictates of the United States
without needing to engage in direct conflict with China.]{.underline}

"The U.S. share in the global economy has shrunk." Large sections of the
Pentagon were not satisfied with this strategy. [Out of the lust for a
more confrontational approach with China came the strategy of "Great
Power competition."]{.underline} [This strategy did not neglect the
"Pivot to Asia" but rather buttressed the military encirclement of China
with a host of maneuvers]{.underline}. Even more military assets have
been shifted to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, once called the Pacific
Command, to the point of potentially [draining AFRICOM of its own
military resources]{.underline}. This [would]{.underline}, as AFRICOM
Commander General Stephen Townsend pointed out in his testimony to the
Senate Armed Services Committee, [leave the U.S. vulnerable to losing
access to rare earth minerals and other vital resources on the continent
that "America needs."]{.underline} [The disagreement within the military
industrial complex over how to best contain China is a matter of form,
not substance]{.underline}. **[Full-spectrum Dominance]{.underline}**
[is where the entirety of the U.S. political and military apparatus has
reached a uniform consensus. China and Africa are thus not only
connected by their hundreds of billions worth in trade arrangements but
also by their shared experience as **targets of
imperialism**]{.underline}. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command is currently
in possession of over half of all U.S. military assets with more coming.
Four hundred U.S. military bases surround China in countries such as
Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. colony of Guam . While AFRICOM may be
partially reduced to strengthen the U.S.' military presence in the
Asia-Pacific, there is no doubt that the U.S. will continue to undermine
African sovereignty and use China, and to a smaller degree Russia, as
justification.

The last and perhaps most important point I want to make is that [the
struggle for self-determination of oppressed nations is always an
ideological struggle]{.underline}. [**Full-spectrum Dominance is a
racist project**. U.S. and Western media portray Africa and China in
much of the same light. Africa is portrayed as a chaotic and backward
continent where corruption is endemic and inherent to political life.
Africans need the U.S. military to be safe and secure from
themselves]{.underline}. [China]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is the
chief "authoritarian" country in the world]{.underline} for its supposed
suppression of Muslims in Xinjiang, protestors in Hong Kong, and,
according to the Economist , people in mainland China by way of its
campaign to alleviate poverty. [Asia therefore needs the U.S. military
to be safe and secure from China. These **jingoistic portrayals of China
and Africa provide fertile ideological ground for the U.S. empire to
maintain and expand military operations under the guise of stamping out
terrorism or countering the "China threat."**]{.underline}
"Full-spectrum Dominance is where the entirety of the U.S. political and
military apparatus has reached a uniform consensus."

The [transformation of Africa into a terrain for U.S. militarism has
also brought about an ideological shift in the U.S. from a white savior
industrial complex attitude of charity to a return of the **White Man's
Burden** mentality of re-civilizing the continent through
force]{.underline}. Just as we know AFRICOM to be a coordinated military
assault in the broader project of U.S.-led neocolonialism in Africa, [so
too is the U.S.' military buildup in the Asia-Pacific part of a broader
project to establish U.S.-compliant governments in Asia, including
China. China is no longer just a convenient scapegoat for the hollowing
out of the U.S. economy. **Lockheed Martin and Raytheon** directly
**fund think-tanks** like the Austrailian Strategic Policy Institute to
**villainize China** so that the U.S. can ban their social media apps,
close their consulates, and sanction Chinese government officials in the
name of the U.S.' military strategy of Great Power
competition]{.underline}. A key task in developing a united movement to
eradicate U.S. military expansionism in Africa and in Asia is to be very
clear about its severe consequences for the future of humanity at large.
[The U.S.-led overthrow of Libya in 2011 paved the way for the death and
displacement of millions in Africa and the Middle East, as well as an
explosion in the expansion of AFRICOM. U.S. attempts to gain political
and military control of the **Asia-Pacific** means that nations in the
region will be subject to the **same** economic and political
development **model employed in Africa**]{.underline}. [China and Africa
are targets of the same criminal system that produces conditions of
economic and political instability all over the world.]{.underline} And
while the U.S. would be foolish to provoke a hot war with China,
anti-imperialist forces the world over must understand that to leave the
cause of peace and self-determination up to the aggressors is akin to
political suicide

#### Representations of China as a threat justify U.S imperialism and the progress of Western racial superiority.

For years, indeed [since]{.underline} [the period of the]{.underline}
**[Enlightenment]{.underline}** (seventeenth to eighteenth century),
[the European]{.underline} [perception]{.underline} [of other
cultures]{.underline} [had been **framed** by a]{.underline} [grand
**narrative** of human **progression**]{.underline} [where the
**West**]{.underline} [was seen as]{.underline} [representing the **apex
of human evolution**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} belief [was
**central** to the social **Darwinian** theory]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [the social sciences]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
[provided]{.underline} the [ideological]{.underline} [**justifcation**
for **colonialism** and global **empire**]{.underline}
**[building]{.underline}** \[6\]. [The idea of **racial** and cultural
**diferences**]{.underline} [as a **basic tenet of** social
**discourse**]{.underline} [has **prevailed** over]{.underline} [the
years as a way of framing social change and **human
conflict.**]{.underline} A prominent case of this strand of view is
Huntington's notion of 'clash of civilizations' and his division of the
world into separate and competing civilizations \[7\]. Huntington argues
that [Western civilization]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [**naturally
dominant** and]{.underline} [remains]{.underline}
[distinctive]{.underline} [from other cultures]{.underline}:
[European]{.underline} [communities]{.underline}...[will share cultural
features]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [distinguish them from Arab or
Chinese communities]{.underline}. Arabs, [Chinese and
Westerners,]{.underline} however, [are not part]{.underline} [of any
broader cultural identity]{.underline} \[8\].

In his work on 'Orientalism', Edward Said, a critic of Huntington,
critically examines how the West has reimagined, reconstructed and
culturally reframed 'the Orient' as a means of pacifcation,
domestication, subjugation and domination \[9\]. [The orientalization of
others]{.underline} [has been a feature of European
perception]{.underline} [and representation of colonial]{.underline}
[and post-colonial]{.underline} [societies]{.underline} \[10\].
[This]{.underline} is part of a [broader narrative of racial
hierarchy]{.underline} [which **ranks 'other' societies as inferior**
and the West]{.underline} [as the **indisputable force**
for]{.underline} [human **civilization**]{.underline} **[and
progress]{.underline}** \[11\]. [The '**civilizing mission'** became a
part of European **capitalist imperialism**]{.underline}
[via]{.underline} its many constituent agencies such as [Christianity,
liberalism, **racial superiority**, science and **military
intervention** \[12\].]{.underline}

This broad theme of image making to frame and defne others is the
central focus of this paper. It focuses primarily on the historical
roots of Sinophobia, the racialized construction of Chinese threat. [The
**perception** of an **aggressive Chinese state**]{.underline},
[potentially hegemonic Chinese culture]{.underline} [and expansionist
economic interests]{.underline} through the Belt and Road initiative
have all **[contributed to]{.underline}** the [construction]{.underline}
[of an **imagery**]{.underline} [which is both **racialized** **and a
leverage** **for geopolitical** and strategic
**contestation**]{.underline}. Racialized framing works both ways.
Chinese nationalism and anti-foreigner perception have been documented
and goes back into history \[13, 14\]. While a lot have been written
about Sinophobia, this chapter is more concerned with its history and
how it has evolved over the years to better understand some of the
implicit racialized underpinnings of contemporary geopolitics,
especially the growing anti-China narratives amongst the Western powers
such as the USA and Australia.

A dominant feature of contemporary Pacifc geopolitics is the way China
is demonized by the 'Western' powers such as Australia, the USA, France
and New Zealand as illegitimate intruders into a part of the world which
Australian prime minister, Scott Morison, referred to as 'our own
backyard' \[15\]. Referring to a move it attempted to sponsor to
investigate the origin of COVID-19, the Australian prime minister
insinuated that the 'West' should show solidarity and decisiveness
against China's 'imperial power' and 'bully' tactics \[16\].

[Sinophobic narrative]{.underline} has [morphed]{.underline} [into an
**everyday political cliché** as a result of repetitive enunciation over
time]{.underline}, [its role in geopolitical and ideological
leveraging]{.underline} [runs deep into]{.underline} [the realm of
cultural and racial prejudice]{.underline} to the extent that
geopolitical paranoia [has 'blended neatly with]{.underline} [thoroughly
racialized forms]{.underline} [of Western knowledge
production']{.underline} \[17\]. The [Sinophobic narratives and
manoeuvrings]{.underline} by the USA, France and Australia in the Pacifc
today [have **deeper racial and historical roots**]{.underline} [which
can be traced back to the Western powers']{.underline} [fear and
**demonization of China** in the nineteenth century when global colonial
interests began in]{.underline} [earnest as well as the international
transportation and treatment of]{.underline} [Chinese
labourers]{.underline} and how these [shaped racial
perceptions]{.underline} \[18\]. **[Sinophobia]{.underline}** was a
convenient ideological **[tool]{.underline}** [to justify **capitalist
penetration of China** and the transportation]{.underline} [and
exploitation of **cheap Chinese labour**]{.underline} [to other parts of
the world.]{.underline} Today, [Sinophobic sentiments form a
**justifcatory geopolitical narrative** for Western powers]{.underline}
and this is certainly the case [in the Pacifc region]{.underline},
[which has been an arena of big power contestation for much of the
twentieth century.]{.underline}

The colonial history of anti-Chinese geopolitical narratives has evolved
over the years and strands of this racialized perception continue today
in both explicit and implicit forms since the European imperial
penetration of China during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
[These **racialized** **imageries** were used to]{.underline}
[**justify** **extraction** of Chinese labour]{.underline}, [resources,
land **and control of its market**]{.underline}. Colonial expansion and
capitalist penetration were symbiotic processes \[12\]. This was a
similar story throughout the world where European colonialism needed to
justify their economic and political conquest by framing the colonized
as readily exploitable subhumans with lower levels of intelligence and
culture \[19\]. [This]{.underline} [trend continues]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [is part of **global geopolitics**]{.underline} [where
subconscious cultural]{.underline} [and **racialized bias**]{.underline}
**[underpins security and developmental narratives]{.underline}**
\[20\]. Western perceptions of non-Western states are often coloured
with a sense of 'otherness', diference and even superiority-inferiority
relationship. In the Pacifc, this was characteristic of Western
perception of the Soviet Union during the Cold War and of China in the
post-Cold War era. Overall, this paper makes the assertion that the
Sinophobic narratives which help to define Pacific geopolitics in the
contemporary era have deeper historical roots which are linked to the
racialization of imperial conquest and exploitation in the last three
centuries.

### Link --- China --- Cyber Threat

#### Depicting China as a [cyber-threat]{.underline} is an [Orientalist demarcation]{.underline} that renders China [uncivilized]{.underline} and in need of [US intervention]{.underline}.

China as thief: cyber battles

The [construction of China as potential **enemy Other** takes on an
additional hue when we look at]{.underline} the [depictions of China's
**cyber activities**---China moves from cheat to]{.underline} a more
malicious cousin, [the thief.]{.underline} The United States first
focused on issues of "cyber warfare" in the mid-2000s to late 2000s, but
at the time, the trope associated with China was not necessarily that of
thief. In the mass news media, [a]{.underline} **[militaristic
lens]{.underline}** [framed much of the discussion, depicting China as a
rule breaker flouting international norms and thus posing a security
threat]{.underline}. For example, a Los Angeles Times article
highlighted that ["China in the last year has developed ways to
infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the world in what
U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially dangerous
military capability, according to a Pentagon report"]{.underline}
(Barnes, 2008). China is even placed in relation to al-Qaeda:
"Cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to
U.S. national security than Al Qaeda and other militants that have
dominated America's global focus since Sept. 11, 2001, the nation's top
intelligence officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013). This
juxtaposition with al-Qaeda only served to heighten the military valence
of China's cyber activities, and a push to prepare for such a threat.
Indeed, in the words of Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL): "The threat, to be
sure, is real---and, we cannot allow ourselves to grow complacent ..."
(Nelson 2008). Snowden's revelations of [US spying on China]{.underline}
in June of 2013 [drastically changed the shape of the
discussion]{.underline} however. Snowden demonstrated that **[the
NSA]{.underline}** **[(1)]{.underline}** [had two data centers in China
from which it had been inserting spy software]{.underline} into
vulnerable computers; **[(2)]{.underline}** [targeted the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, public officials, businesses, and
students;]{.underline} **[(3)]{.underline}** [hacked mobile
phones;]{.underline} and **[(4)]{.underline}** in 2009, [hacked the
Pacnet headquarters in Hong Kong]{.underline}, which runs one of the
biggest regional fibre-optic networks. In response to Snowden's
revelations, a spate of articles compared the United States' and China's
hacking, displaying a range of attitudes from journalists---some
espoused that both countries demonstrate equivalent transgressive
behavior, while [others argued that China has crossed the line into more
aggressive hacking that goes beyond the United States' more **benign
"preemptive" hacking**.]{.underline}

The [latter attitude indicates the resilience of tropes of
the]{.underline} **[Yellow and Red Perils]{.underline}**, [a China whose
inherent ideological and cultural differences with the West makes it a
threat]{.underline}. The different lenses through which journalists and
pundits viewed China's spying in comparison with that of the United
States further [invoke]{.underline} this **[Orientalist
demarcation]{.underline}**. An article in The Washington Post thus
contrasts China's behavior against that of [the United
States]{.underline}, which [merely seeks "to examine huge amounts of
communication metadata around the world to look for trends" and "to
preempt some threat against the U.S." China]{.underline}'s spying is
described, [however]{.underline}, as ["infiltrating almost every
powerful institution in Washington, D.C.," "breaking into major news
organizations," "stealing sensitive military technology,"]{.underline}
and ["stealing]{.underline} so much [intellectual property]{.underline}
that China's hacking has been called the 'greatest transfer of wealth in
history'["]{.underline} (Fisher, 2013). Drawing in particular on
incendiary words like "stealing" and "infiltrating," this article
distinguishes China as a sneaky thief. US journalists and pundits, in
charging China with stealing economic resources, have [further
solidified the demarcation of China as an inferior and dangerous
Other]{.underline}. A well-circulated quote by national security pundit
Adam Segal stated, "The problem is we're not talking about the same
things ... We're trying to make a distinction between cyber economic
espionage and normal political-military espionage. The Chinese don't
make that same distinction" (Bengali & Dilanian, 2015). [By portraying
China as unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between economics
and national security]{.underline}, Segal suggests [China's thievery is
connected to a more fundamental character flaw---China is unable to
grasp proper civilized norms.]{.underline} Similarly, US official
response has been that China's view of data collection as a sovereign
right has rendered them essentially different from the United States and
by implication, the civilized world. That Chinese governmental espionage
involves the collection of economic intelligence that is shared with
Chinese companies further departs from civilized norms. Michael Rogers,
Director of the National Security Agency thus explained that "they
clearly don't have the same lines in the sand, if you will, with that
regard" (Bennett, 2015). [Historically, US depictions of China as
uncivilized have occurred whenever China has gained power or threatened
US interests. The narrative of China as a sort of child following in the
United States' footsteps on the path to modernity has proven exceedingly
popular]{.underline} since World War II and [frames the US approach to
China as a potential ally and resource who at the same time may **never
be civilizable**]{.underline} (Kim, 2010; Vukovich, 2012). [In
this]{.underline} **[Orientalist narrative]{.underline}**, [China's
journey to modernity is always understood as precarious
and]{.underline}, moreover, [subject to US vigilance]{.underline} as to
whether it meets the appropriate benchmarks. The title of an editorial
in The Washington Post epitomizes current iterations of this sentiment
and the ease with which [Orientalist imagery can be invoked to portray
China's path to modernity as needing US guidance when China falls out of
line]{.underline}: "The US Needs to Tame the Cyber-Dragon: Stronger
Measures are Need\[ed\] to Block China's Economic Espionage \[emphasis
mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs to Tame," 2013). In reality, US vigilance can
be attributed to the concern since the end of the Cold War, that a
"sleeping giant" able to challenge US global hegemony is awakening (Kim,
2010).

Thus, the [cultural work done by portrayals of China as unable to adhere
to civilized norms]{.underline} serve to [bolster the image of China as
perpetually unprepared to be a responsible member of the international
community]{.underline}. In fact, [this narrative]{.underline} of China's
thievery **[serves to persuade]{.underline}** [the American public that
China is a threat]{.underline} to the international community. One Wall
Street Journal journalist perfectly echoes this sentiment: A China that
leads the world in the theft of intellectual property, computer hacking
and resource nationalism will prove extremely destabilizing. If it
continues on this course, Beijing should not be surprised if other
countries begin to band together to collectively counter some of the
more harmful implications of China's rise. A better outcome for all will
be for China to embrace its responsibilities to help lead the world ...
(Metzl, 2011) This article, although hopeful that China may at some
future point become a responsible global actor, even leader, ultimately
reifies the notion that an increase in China's global power is always
suspect.

### Link --- China --- IR

#### Assertions of realism and liberalism [recreate]{.underline} the Aff's conflict scenarios. [Only]{.underline} the alternative provides a [sufficient]{.underline} frame to [form]{.underline} policy solutions.

Chengxin **Pan 22**, Faculty of Arts and Education, Deakin University,
Australia, 2022, "Chapter 10: China's Rise as Holographic Transition: A
Relational Challenge to International Relations' Newtonian Ontology,"
China's Rise and Rethinking International Relations Theory, page 210-233

[A [China]{.mark} that holographically emerges out of the contemporary
globalized world **[cannot be]{.mark} adequately [understood]{.mark}**
[by theories]{.mark} that are still [based on **the Newtonian
ontology**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which treats]{.mark} states like
[China as]{.mark} ontologically **separate and [distinct]{.mark}**.
In]{.underline} opening up a new ontological perspective, [this chapter
now turns to a brief examination of why mainstream IR theories,
particularly [**realism and liberalism**, need to be
rethought]{.mark}]{.underline}. [First, [realism]{.mark}, and **power
transition theory** in particular]{.underline} (Tammen and Kugler, 2006;
Lai, [2011), [have]{.mark} almost completely [overlooked China's]{.mark}
**contemporary [holographic transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Analysts
from those perspectives routinely see in China the rise of a Nazi
Germany-like great power, but the world in which China has been rising
has largely moved on from the one in which Nazi Germany emerged.
[[The]{.mark} current [international system is]{.mark} more
'**[regime-intensive']{.mark}** than the period during which Europe and
the United States came into **prominence**]{.underline} (Lanteigne,
2005: 32). Western theorists may have good reason to draw upon past
European and American experiences to fear the prospect of China adopting
its own 'Monroe Doctrine' or falling into the 'Thucydides Trap'
(Allison, 2017). [What [they fail to]{.mark} adequately
[appreciate]{.mark} is that [the whole]{.mark} from which China has
emerged [has]{.mark} now [become]{.mark} **quite [different]{.mark}**
(Wang, 2013).]{.underline} The holographic relational perspective does
not necessarily mean that China's rise or 'Chinese' relationality will
be peaceful (Shih, 2016: 687). Hard power still matters in contemporary
world politics, and realism remains part and parcel of China's strategic
thinking[. Hence, despite the existence of a holographic world[, if
Chinese leaders behave as if they live in a **Newtonian world**]{.mark}
of mechanistic relations, then the **earlier-mentioned [fears]{.mark}**
[of China may be **warranted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic, rising [**antiglobalization sentiment** and]{.mark}
increasing **global [trade tensions]{.mark}**[, the shift to]{.mark}
more [emphasis on domestic circulation]{.mark} in China's 'dual
circulation' economic strategy [seems to signal the **winding back** of
its]{.mark} holographic [engagement]{.mark} with the world]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, a couple of points are worth noting here. One is that
there is some Chinese recognition, at both scholarly and official
levels, of the world as a cosmopolitan whole (for example in terms of
'the community of common destiny'), and of the holographic entanglement
that there is something of each in the other (ni zhong you wo, wo zhong
you ni) (Xi, 2015). [Whether Chinese foreign policy]{.underline} (for
example the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI[)) will live up to such
rhetoric remains to be seen]{.underline}, but at least such
understanding could help underpin a consistent policy of opening up.
Another point is that [China's holographic relational being/becoming is
by definition **relational and reciprocal**]{.underline}. Given that how
its significant 'Others' behave constitutes part of China's holographic
whole[, [the dominance of **a zero-sum**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[**non-holographic way** of understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
dealing with China from **the 'outside' world** [is likely to produce a
China that is]{.mark} similarly **[uncompromising and
assertive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi
was quoted as saying during his discussion with US Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, 'China will consider how to engage with the U.S. side
based on the U.S. attitude towards China' (Reuters, 2021). Second, while
[[liberal scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} do pay close attention to
China's transformation and socialization (Economy and Oksenberg, 1999;
Johnston, 2008), [they also [fail to recognize]{.mark} that its
[transformation]{.mark}/socialization [is fundamentally
**holographic**]{.mark} **and multidirectional**]{.underline}, [[rather
than **linear**]{.mark} or unidirectional]{.underline}. Some liberal
thinkers are right that it would be illogical and extremely difficult
for today's China to overturn the international capitalist order
(Ikenberry, 2008); after all, China is already a holographic part of
that order and so turning against that order would mean turning against
itself. Still, [many tend to misconstrue its holographic transition as
reducible to **Westernization** or **democratization** in the Western
image]{.underline} (Gilley, 2004; Hutton, 2006; Kristof, 2013), [while
forgetting that the [**sources** of]{.mark} holographic
[influence]{.mark} on China [are **global**, rather than]{.mark} merely
'[Western']{.mark}]{.underline}. The global whole in which China exists
and evolves includes also the 'nonWestern' world as well as 'Chinese'
history and tradition (or what Wang Jisi calls 'historical China', see
Chapter 6). [[To ignore]{.mark} those connections and [their **complex
impact** on China]{.mark} is to [**miss** a significant aspect of
China's]{.mark} rise that does not fit well with the **liberal
narrative**]{.underline}. Furthermore, even as China has absorbed many
'Western' influences (bearing in mind that there is nothing purely
Western to begin with, as Hobson \[2004\] points out), [such outside
influences, once transmitted into China, may undergo further local
**holographic transition** of their own by taking on some 'Chinese'
characteristics]{.underline} (Pan, 2012: 116--17). Also, as China's
power grows and its relations further expand (such as through the BRI),
it is certain to once again become a major source of holographic
transition for other countries, just as it once was, particularly
through its tributary system, in which the participation of the
'barbarians' was in part to 'come and be transformed' (lai-hua)
(Fairbank, 1942: 132). Thus, China's rise is both an object and an agent
of holographic transition. To sum up, [both [the '**identity'** of China
and]{.mark} its **[implications]{.mark}** for the world [are inherently
**complex**]{.mark}**, dynamic and indeterminate**. As a case of
holographic transition, [China's rise defies the **binary scenarios**
of]{.mark} either [a **hegemonic challenge**]{.mark} to the
Western-dominant order [or a **linear integration**]{.mark} into it
(]{.underline}see also Chapter 9). [With China unable to meet the
liberal expectation, there has now been growing disillusionment with,
and **renewed realist fear** of, it in recent years]{.underline} (Pan,
2012: Chapter 7; Campbell and Ratner, 2018). China's rise does pose many
profound challenges, whether economically, politically, normatively or
environmentally. But such challenges, despite their apparent 'Chinese'
symptoms, often have their holographic origins in the world. Thus,
without denying Chinese responsibility or agency, [[**to effectively
deal** with those]{.mark} challenges [requires us to see them]{.mark}
also [as]{.mark} **global and [holographic challenges]{.mark}** [that
cannot be reduced to]{.mark}, let alone solved as, [uniquely Chinese
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Global problems demand global public
policy and cooperative solutions. As such, the United States' focus on
'Chinese' imports, for instance, as the cause of its job-loss problem
misses the point. Similarly, [[attempts to contain China are **unlikely
to be effective**]{.mark} given that [China's]{.mark} very [being has
been]{.mark} **embodied and [embedded]{.mark}** [in **holographic
relations**]{.mark} with the global whole, with which we are all
**inextricably entangled and implicated**.]{.underline}

The relationship of the United States and People's Republic of China
(China) is arguably one of the most important in this century. [The
ability of the United States and China to maintain a cooperative
relationship will shape]{.underline}, to a large extent, [outcomes on
key global issues such as the stability and growth of the global
**economy**, **resource scarcity**, **climate change**, and the
non**prolif**eration of **weapons of mass destruction**]{.underline}.
Since President Nixon's policy of constructive engagement over four
decades ago, the strategic partnership of the two has grown to an extent
unimaginable back in 1972. The alignment of strategic interests between
the two has led to policies of undeniable mutual benefit to date---on
one hand, China's access to world markets has allowed its economy to
grow at impressive rates; on the other hand, this growth has helped to
sustain US spending and thus, its maintenance of global hegemony.1 In
recent years, **[however]{.underline}**, [sharp disagreements have
surfaced]{.underline} on numerous fronts, and the United States has
sought to maintain dominance in the partnership. [One of the mechanisms
that have facilitated this, we argue, is the construction of China
via]{.underline} long-standing [**Orientalist tropes** that, at once
flexible and durable, are easily mobilized and adapted for strategic
political ends]{.underline}. As formulated by foremost scholar Edward
Said (2014), [depictions of the "Orient" have served as **ideological
tools**]{.underline} aiding empires since the late 18th century---first
the British and French, subsequently, the United States. [The role of
knowledge production in the **colonial project**]{.underline}, which
Said termed "Orientalism," [has relied primarily on producing images of
the "Orient" in dualistic terms that serve to affirm **Western cultural
superiority**]{.underline}---for example, [in depicting the "Orient" as
backward, the West becomes civilized;]{.underline} in casting the former
as superstitious, the latter becomes scientific; [in describing the
former as **irrational**, the latter becomes **rational**;]{.underline}
in representing the former as archaic, the latter becomes modern; [in
fashioning the former as evil, the latter becomes good;]{.underline} in
painting a picture of the former as violent, the latter becomes
peaceful. [The affirmation of Western superiority and concomitantly, the
cultural and moral inferiority of the "Orient," have served to **justify
Western expansion** and global control over **lands**, **peoples**, and
**resources**.]{.underline}

Western construction of the cultural and moral inferiority of China has
had a long history and includes an array of portrayals that can be read
in light of specific European and US colonial aims. These include images
of China as exotic and immoral in the 1700s, as a cunning and diabolical
"Yellow Peril" in the late 1800s, as a freedom-loving and
democracy-loving "China Mystique" during World War II, and as an
ideological, economic, and military "Red Peril" during the Cold War
(Kim, 2010; Leong, 2005). Since the end of the Cold War and the
definitive establishment of US global hegemony, [China has vacillated in
the US imaginary]{.underline} between the latter two positions, viewed
at times [as a little brother following imperfectly the path toward
modernity, at times imperiling the world order]{.underline} (Kim, 2010;
Vukovich, 2012). This ambiguity continues to occur through the present
day and, in light of China's rise as a global power since the late
1990s, [China is increasingly portrayed, not necessarily an enemy, but
**always a potential one**.]{.underline} [This]{.underline}
**[construction of China]{.underline}** [as a potential enemy Other
reflects the relationship of mutual interdependence carefully cultivated
by many US administrations at the same time that it functions to justify
the **paternalistic monitoring** and **policing of China** to ensure
that China never overtakes the United States on the world
stage]{.underline}. With this frame in mind, we examine the
recapitulation of Orientalist tropes in the post-Cold War context,
focusing, in particular, on representations and language used in US news
media and political rhetoric.

Orientalism and its perpetuation of [the West and the United States'
ability to **selectively narrate history** enables the all-but-complete
**erasure of oppositional perspectives**]{.underline} like Uchida's
[from universal perception]{.underline}. Professor and historian Takeya
Mizuno examines the erasure of accounts oppositional to official
narratives of Japanese American internment as a response to national
security concerns or Japanese Americans' supposed predisposition to
commit acts of espionage, writing that the [mass incarceration of
Japanese Americans in West Coast internment camps marks a "dark spot in
the history of press freedom]{.underline}, too["]{.underline} (Mizuno's
emphasis, 205). Mizuno posits that while interned Japanese Americans
were allowed to have their own newspapers, "these publications were
subject to either 'censorship' or 'supervision'," and that "in December
1941, the Japanese American community... \[had\] more than two dozen of
vernacular newspaper on the West Coast alone. Only 6 months later,
however, none of them existed due to the Army's mass exclusion orders"
(205). Mizuno's research and exploration of [Japanese American
censorship in the wake of Pearl Harbor helps to further expose the
problematization inherent in Orientalism---and the way Orientalism aided
white America's desperate self-preservation---in the aftermath of the
Pearl Harbor attacks]{.underline}. Not only had American Orientalism
enabled white officials' mass imprisonment of innocent Japanese
Americans but had also [permitted the]{.underline} **[erasure of
accounts]{.underline}** [depicting Japanese American innocence and,
inversely, white America's wrongdoings and penchant for anti-Asian
sentimentality.]{.underline} Throughout American history, **[the West's
ability to construct and conceptualize "the Orient"]{.underline}**
"[politically, sociologically, militarily, ideologically,
scientifically, and imaginatively]{.underline}" (Said 2) [in any
instance that white Americans]{.underline} and American [officials
perceive as a threat to **American white supremacy** has promoted
several times over]{.underline} the comprehensive [**ostracism**
and]{.underline} often **[violent oppression]{.underline}** [of Asian
and Asian American populations]{.underline}. In early 1942, the effects
of Orientalism and Orientalist conceptualizations of Japanese Americans
were felt at home: for Japanese Americans, perhaps the greatest impact
of their internment post-Pearl Harbor was a harsh wakeup call. Despite
"significant economic losses of income and property... for which they
were not fully compensated" (Shoag & Carollo 8), the hardest pill for
Japanese Americans to swallow in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor was the
realization that, despite their citizenship or allegiance, [white
America's best-interests always come first, especially when white
Americans believe that their **geographic preeminence** or supremacy is
**under threat**]{.underline}. [Orientalism, coupled with the white
supremacy inherent in the American enterprise, has enabled the
comprehensive ostracism of Asian Americans]{.underline} at home in the
U.S. [and the widespread oppression of]{.underline} Southeast, East, and
South-central [Asian populations]{.underline} [abroad]{.underline}.
Twenty years after white officials adapted Japanese American populations
across the West Coast into a singular caricature---that of a
"saboteur"---American Orientalism would promote a new adaptation of
Lee's "Oriental" figure: the "warmongering Oriental." Just as American
officials perpetuated imagery of Japanese Americans as spies and
saboteurs in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attacks to justify the
incarceration of these populations at home, [the West's cultural
domination of "the Orient" would enable the U.S. to ensure the
prominence of images of "Orientals" as warmongers to **justify** the
**U.S.' military involvement**]{.underline} abroad two decades later.
This time, however, America's ability to rely on long-held [Orientalist
conceptualizations]{.underline} of the East and a majority population
keen to maintain American white supremacy [would ensure an even more
violent oppression and dehumanization of Southeast Asian
populations---the next supposed threat to white Americans' cultural,
racial, geographic, and imperial superiority and influence]{.underline}.

#### Their representations are a [desperate desire]{.underline} to distinguish the Self from the '[Oriental']{.underline}, [romanticizing]{.underline} the East as a [dangerous]{.underline} yet [exotic]{.underline} Other.

Examining Said and Lee's works in tandem allows for a comprehensive
overview of how **[Orientalism]{.underline}** [and conceptualizations of
Asians and Asian Americans as "Orientals"]{.underline} have
[provide]{.underline}d [an underlying framework for widely perpetuated
and generalizing Asian and Asian American prejudice]{.underline} in the
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the introduction to Orientalism, Said
writes that [the problematization inherent in
Orientalism---historically---is that the Western world, by generalizing
this region of the world as simply "the Orient," has effectively
**produced** the Middle East "politically, sociologically,
**militarily**, ideologically, **scientifically**, and
**imaginatively**"]{.underline} (2). As Said explains, [by constructing
and producing these]{.underline} perspectives and [narratives on "the
Orient" and]{.underline} by ["setting itself off against the Orient as a
sort of surrogate and even underground self," Western culture has
effectively and continually "othered" "the Orient," **romanticizing** it
in the minds of Westerners as **exotic**]{.underline} and as existing in
stark contrast to the western social, economic, philosophical and
political experience (20). This has [thus allowed the West to
historically **dominate, restructure, and possess** a sort of
constructive authority over the Orient]{.underline}. Two decades into
the twenty-first century, [Orientalism still enables the West to impose
an appropriative violence on the East]{.underline}. According to Said,
the West's largely **[unchallenged generalizations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[perceptions]{.underline}** [of the
Orient]{.underline} and belief that these ideas could and can be
propagated with "very little resistance" on the Orient's part [is what
allows Orientalism to have such]{.underline} a "[durability]{.underline}
and...strength" [as well as enables perpetuation]{.underline} of the
notion [that there is a great difference between Americans ("us") and
"them" or "all 'those' non-Europeans"]{.underline} (7). Specifically,
Said writes that: Orientalism was [ultimately a]{.underline}
**[political vision of reality]{.underline}** [whose structure promoted
the difference between the familiar]{.underline} (Europe, the West,
"us") [and the strange]{.underline} (the Orient, the East, "them"). This
vision in a sense created and then served the **[two worlds thus
conceived]{.underline}**. Orientals lived in their world, "we" lived in
ours.... A certain freedom of intercourse was always the Westerner's
privilege; because his was the stronger culture, he could penetrate, he
could wrestle with, he could give shape and meaning to the great Asiatic
mystery. (43-44) Essentially, [it is]{.underline} **[Western
hegemony]{.underline}** [which allows for the widespread]{.underline}
and widely accepted [manipulation of Western perceptions of "the
Orient," thus **enacting a violence on the East** via the West's
generalizations, appropriation and narrow interpretations of the
cultures that exist in this part of the world]{.underline}, largely for
the Western world's own understanding, benefit, and consumption. Lee's
Orientals explores the reasoning [behind]{.underline} the West and
**[white America's desperate desire]{.underline}** [to uphold their
historical stranglehold on perceptions and conceptualizations of "the
Orient."]{.underline} In the introduction to his book, Lee notes that
racialized and stereotypical **[representations]{.underline}** [come
about to perform]{.underline} "**[ideological tasks]{.underline}**"
(12). ["The Oriental," a caricature inclusive of all
"Oriental"]{.underline} populations, Lee writes, "[appears in various
guises throughout American culture... \[and\] is embedded in the
discourses of race, gender, class, and sexuality in
America]{.underline}" (12). The [fluidity of the Oriental as a
caricature allows]{.underline} dominant Western and white [American
culture to readapt images]{.underline} of the Oriental [depending on the
particular]{.underline} "**[cultural crises]{.underline}** in American
society that give rise to... representations of the Oriental." These
"deployments," according to Lee, come "in the wake of economic change,"
any which spurs on "profound effects on the structures, relations, and
meaning of families, gender, and race" in the United States (11). Lee
explores, for example, adaptation of the Oriental into an outwardly
menacing figure: as a threat to the native white laborer's preeminence
in the late nineteenth century. The propagation of imagery and rhetoric
in the American southwest depicting industrious Asian Americans and
laborers as the "harbingers of industrial wage slavery," according to
Lee, "disrupted the mythic narrative of westward expansion" (9) and
Americans' concepts of manifest destiny---ideas firmly rooted in notions
of American white supremacy and imperialism. Lee also notes how, in
response to the perceived threat of Chinese and Asian Americans to white
American laborer's preeminence, Chester A. Arthur signed 1882's Chinese
Exclusion Act into law. Later, Lee describes popular imagery of
Southeast Asian populations perpetuated in the wake of the Vietnam War.
Lee writes that, "The received wisdom of the Vietnam War narrative is
that America's defeat in Southeast Asia was brought about by a faceless
and invisible Asian enemy" (11). Consequently, in the war's aftermath,
in the dystopic narrative of white America's decline, Asian Americans
came to be depicted as hidden and more discreet "agents of foreign or
multinational capital" and interference (11). Both of these historical
[adaptations of the Oriental figure]{.underline} and any of the numerous
adaptations that have characterized other "perilous periods" [in white
America's history of **desperate self-preservation** have all
contributed to one overarching narrative: a narrative presenting white
America and American industrialism and imperialism as, ultimately,
victims of Asian and Asian American industriousness, sexuality,
intelligence, and assimilation]{.underline}. Historical reactions to the
Oriental figure, including those barring Asian Americans from
"immigration, citizenship, and participation in American society and
culture" (13), Lee explains, have ultimately culminated in a dramatic
transition: in the past century, [narratives of Asians and Asian
Americans as threats to America's racial and class purity have evolved
from a simple series of myths into a **perceptible reality** for white
Americans]{.underline}. Nearly 150 years after Chester Arthur signed the
Chinese Exclusion Act into law, white Americans again demonstrated their
ability to reduce Asian populations to [a]{.underline} **[singular image
embodying a newly evolved threat]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} their
[way of life]{.underline}. Two decades into the twenty-first century,
white Americans, seeking to put a face to their fears in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, effectively readapted the Oriental (and "the Orient"
itself) into embodiments of disease. As Andrea Kitta's Kiss of Death
notes, perpetuation of these images of Asians and Asian Americans as the
embodiments of disease and of the COVID-19 pandemic invariably leads to
narratives of the "diseased outsider" (27). For context, Kitta
references the Ebola outbreak in the early 2010s, for example, which
likewise had "strong associations with locations" (27). Kitta notes
that, in the aftermath of the disease's outbreak, many Americans feared
for the security of their "physical, social, or political boundaries"
(28) and were quick to pin blame for the epidemic's origins and the
disease's spread on anyone white Americans felt could be categorized
under the broad, indistinguishable moniker of "African." Nearly a decade
later, many Americans have taken up this same habit, broadly classifying
Asian and Asian American populations as inherent threats for spreading
COVID-19, even if there is no reason to suspect they have at all played
a role in the disease's outbreak or spread beyond judgments made based
on these individuals' perceived ethnic, racial, or national identities.

The West's unofficial selectivity when it comes to the popularization of
Vietnam War narratives is an extension of Orientalism and Western
cultural hegemony. During the war---and particularly in its
aftermath---popular American media rapidly readapted the Oriental's
image. While at first the U.S. perpetuated images of North Vietnamese
and other Southeast Asian populations as vicious warmongers as a means
of justifying America's continued imperialist war effort, [the U.S.'
defeat at the hands of the North Vietnamese]{.underline} ultimately
[inspired the cultivation of a new image: one of "a **faceless and
invisible Asian enemy**, aided and abetted by an American
counterculture... like the now-mythic Viet Cong, \[one\] everywhere
invisible and powerful"]{.underline} (Lee 11). Like other historical
adaptations of the "Oriental" figure, [white America's]{.underline}
**[paranoid perpetuation]{.underline}** [of this image of Orientals as
invisible albeit vicious warmongers is a reflection of the U.S.'
enduring habit of **self-victimization**]{.underline}. [White Americans'
conceptualizations of Southeast Asian populations as a singular,
"invisible" entity to perpetuate its own victimized image is indelibly
tied to white Americans' enduring pursuit of self-preservation and---by
extension---**preeminence**]{.underline}. More than two decades after
constructing images of Japanese and other Asian Americans as Axis double
agents "predisposed... to the commission of acts of espionage and
sabotage" (Irons x), white Americans and officials downplayed the U.S.'
defeat in Vietnam by perpetuating images of an overly powerful and
"invisible" enemy. This was done in order [to redirect attention to a
supposedly more pressing narrative: that of the defeated, victimized
American soldier---]{.underline}his innocence forcibly relieved of him
in the jungles of Vietnam, his mind traumatized by images of death, gore
and of war. Inevitably, this perpetuated the premise that the most
tragic narrative of Vietnam was that of an American soldier leaving
behind a "healthy civilian environment to become immersed in a war that
leaves him physically or psychically wounded," thus [idealizing "the
myth of American innocence and benevolence"]{.underline} in Vietnam
[while irrefutably dehumanizing the North Vietnamese]{.underline}
(Rollins 422). This idea [perpetuated the false notions that American
soldiers were the greatest victims]{.underline} of Vietnam and that the
Vietnam War simply represented Vietnam's rejection of American democracy
and freedom, opting instead to embrace leadership by a chaotic,
helpless, and violent communistic regime instead. These **[narratives of
American victimization]{.underline}** [at the hands of a chaos-loving,
unstoppable, unseeable and therefore inherently unbeatable
enemy]{.underline} were perpetuated in the United States postVietnam to
**[save face]{.underline}** [in the aftermath]{.underline} of a war that
"set the U.S. economy on a downward spiral... left America's foreign
policy at least temporarily in disarray... \[and\] divided the American
people as no other event since their own Civil War a century earlier"
(Herring 104). Notably, [even decades after the war,]{.underline} these
[narratives of American victimization]{.underline} have managed to
[maintain an unparalleled cultural supremacy]{.underline}. Speaking on
the U.S.' selective memory and on the longevity and continued
perpetuation of these myths of the "battered American" and "warmongering
Oriental," author and professor Yen Le Espiritu wrote in 2008 that:
Today, more than thirty years after the fall of Saigon... Public
recollections of the Vietnam War---"the war with the difficult
memory"---often involve the organized and strategic forgetting of the
Vietnamese people... The controversial Vietnam War Memorial... provides
a pointed example of this "forgetting." Framed within the nationalist
context of the Washington Mall, the memorial must "forget" the
Vietnamese and "remember" the American veterans as the primary victims
of the war. (1701-1702) Such [dehumanizing images]{.underline} of the
North Vietnamese were---and continue to [persist
as]{.underline}---[products of exclusion]{.underline}. While the West
continues to inundate popular media and perception with images of the
battered American soldier, viewers and readers alike are left to "fill
in the gaps" by conjuring up juxtaposed images of a boastful North
Vietnamese army to contrast with those of the bested and battered armed
forces of the U.S.

Imagine a futuristic city where robots prevail. [Since the]{.underline}
**[advent of imperialism]{.underline}**, [this futuristic and otherly
view has]{.underline} often [served as the **popularized** Western
conception of Asia]{.underline}. This concept is [known as]{.underline}
**[Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}**, a phenomenon [that primarily
dominates discourse surrounding]{.underline} media [portrayals of East
Asia]{.underline}. According to journalist George Yang in Wired
Magazine, [Techno-Orientalism]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
**[creates an ideology of the Asian "Other,"]{.underline}** [rests on
Western logic of the East as a **technological threat** to the
world.]{.underline} [With Beijing's technological rise in an
increasingly globalized world, Techno-Orientalist frameworks have now
become **fundamental** to specifically describing China]{.underline}.
Plan A Magazine's Lily Luo writes that the term "Techno-Orientalism" was
originally coined by Asian scholars like David Roh, Greta Niu and Betsy
Huang. These scholars perceived Techno-Orientalism as the projection of
historical Orientalism, or what Khan Academy's Nancy Demerdash describes
as the "conception of an 'Orient' that was rooted in incivility." [Under
the futuristic gaze of Techno-Orientalism, East Asians are not only
conceived of as a]{.underline} **[racialized source of
fear]{.underline}**, [but also a source of]{.underline} **[technological
fear]{.underline}**. In other words, the technological advancements of
East Asian countries were [perceived as a threat to the global
order]{.underline}. Today, Techno-Orientalism is [most evident
in]{.underline} the [Western]{.underline} media's [coverage of China,
which]{.underline} often [reflects]{.underline} what Yang describes as
"**[Western anxieties about the East]{.underline}**." ["China's
dystopian tech could be contagious," reads a 2018 headline from The
Atlantic. The word **"contagious" implicitly** projects the notion that
China's technology is somehow **diseased**, evoking imagery of illness
and a plague --- racialized elements]{.underline} that Yang states were
[formerly attributed to Chinese immigrants building the United States's
Transcontinental Railroad back in the 19th century.]{.underline}

The article goes on to describe China's "social credit" system and its
effects as a method of "social control" with "teeth." The element of
"teeth" provokes a more physical understanding of China's technological
capabilities. Instead of directly analyzing the mechanics of the system,
the article employs metaphors that conjure up negative connotations of
fear and violence. Another headline for a 2019 article in The American
Conservative demonstrates a similar concept: "George Orwell's Dystopian
Nightmare in China." The featured image displays a large cartoon of
Chinese President Xi Jinping looming over ordinary citizens and handing
them numbers intended to dictate their identities. The article cites the
Orwellian vision of the world --- particularly Social Psychologist Erich
Fromm's afternote about the dangers of men becoming machines ---
implying that this is what China has become. The issue is not endemic to
a few articles or a handful of media organizations and publications. In
a 2018 op-ed in Bloomberg, Cathy O'Neil argues that the United States
must take an active stand against the surveillance state with the
headline: "Want to See Your Dystopian Future? Look at China." For The
New York Post, a headline reads: "China's 'social credit' system is a
dystopian nightmare." [This angled coverage of China, unintentional or
not, falls prey to a certain **dehumanizing rhetoric** in which the
Chinese people are viewed as constant victims of a dystopian, futuristic
state]{.underline}. In the process of shedding light on how China's
technological advancements may strip humanity away from Chinese
citizens, an important topic that deserves coverage and criticism,
[Western media coverage paradoxically falls victim to the same trope:
implying that Chinese people are mindless robots at the mercy of a
technological villain]{.underline}.

It is necessary, though, to acknowledge that criticism of
Techno-Orientalist sentiments pervasive in Western media is not based on
the assumption that such articles are not credible. In fact, it is
because these articles are so well-written and well-researched on a
topic that merits global attention that [it becomes even more essential
to understand how]{.underline} **[racialized ideals]{.underline}**
[manifest in **complex ways within**]{.underline} contemporary media
**[discourse]{.underline}** --- even in the small ways, like headlines,
images and adjectives. [This problem becomes]{.underline}
**[cyclical]{.underline}**, especially because so many articles cite the
ideas mentioned by others. This may explain how the media tends to
exacerbate Sinophobia. Often, [Western media's hegemonic mindset
regarding Beijing prizes competition over collaboration]{.underline}.
[This undermines a positive diplomatic relationship between the United
States and China and, more critically, a **nuanced** American
understanding of Chinese people, culture and values]{.underline}. When
evaluating how Techno-Orientalism has shaped internalized conceptions of
China, [it is critical to be rhetorically careful]{.underline} and to
distinguish between hard evidence and Western interpretations of that
evidence. These [interpretations appear to be motivated by **hegemonic
fears** of Asian countries achieving unprecedented progress and
**subverting colonialist paradigms**]{.underline}.

Some years ago, Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri suggested that while
not always visible in the social practices of everyday European life,
the racist foundation for European fascism was still present, safely
confined to a space in the European psyche, but always ready to explode
in what he called a "racist delirium." Today, [white workers and the
middle classes in]{.underline} Europe and in [the United States,
traumatized by the new realities imposed on them by the **decline of the
Western imperialist project** and the turn to neoliberalism, are
increasingly embracing a **retrograde form of white supremacist
politics**]{.underline}. This dangerous political phenomenon is
developing in countries throughout the European Union and in the United
States. Just recently, the [National Front, a racist, authoritarian
party that labored on the fringes of French politics for years, has
emerged]{.underline} as one of the dominant forces. The [Tea Party in
the United States, Golden Dawn in Greece, the People's Party in Spain,
the Partij Voor de Vrijheid in the Netherlands---in these and other
countries, a transatlantic, radical racist movement is
emerging]{.underline} and gaining respectability. [The hard turn to the
right is **not a surprise** for those of us who have a clear-eyed view
of **Euro-American history and politics**]{.underline}. In all of the
20th century fascist movements in Europe, [two elements combined to
express the fascist project: 1) The rise of far-right parties and
movements as the political expression of an alliance of **authoritarian,
pro-capitalist class forces** bankrolled by sections of the capitalist
class and constructed in the midst of **capitalist crisis**; and 2)
racism grounded in **white supremacist ideology**]{.underline}. The
neo-fascism that is now emerging within the context of the current
capitalist crisis on both sides of the Atlantic has similar
characteristics to the movements of the 1930s, but with one
distinguishing feature. The targets for racist scapegoating are
different. The targets today are immigrants: Arab, Muslim and African in
Europe; and Latinos as well as the never-ending target of poor and
working-class African Americans in the United States. What makes the
rise of the racist radical right even more dangerous today is that it is
taking place in a political environment in which traditional anti-racist
oppositional forces have not recognized the danger of this phenomenon
or---for strategic reasons---have decided to downplay the issue. That
strategy has been tragically played out in the "immigrant rights"
movement in the United States.

The brutal repression and dehumanization witnessed across Europe in the
1930s has not found generalized expression in the United States and
Europe, at least not yet. Nevertheless, [large sectors of the
U.S.]{.underline} and European left [appear to be unable to recognize
that the **U.S./NATO/EU axis** that is committed to maintaining the
**hegemony of Western capital** is resulting in dangerous
**collaborations with rightist forces** both inside and outside of
governments]{.underline}. The **[manufactured crisis]{.underline}**
[with Russia over the issue of Ukraine is a case in point]{.underline}.
[The incredible recklessness and outrageous opportunism of the
U.S./NATO/EU axis in **destabilizing Ukraine**---knowing that the
driving forces on the ground were racist, neo-Nazi elements from the
Right Sector and the Svoboda party---demonstrated once again the lengths
this axis is prepare to go **to achieve its geo-strategic objective** of
full-spectrum economic and political **global domination**]{.underline}.
Yet, strangely, not only did many radicals in the United States and
Europe not see the potential threat this situation represented---they
seemed unable to penetrate the simplistic cold-war propaganda that
suddenly re-emerged to frame events in Ukraine. Instead of being
concerned that---as a direct consequence of U.S. actions---a government
came to power in Europe that, for the first time since the 1930s,
included ultra-nationalist, racist neo-Nazis in key positions, [the left
along with the general population allowed the corporate media and U.S.
propagandists to **turn the narrative** away from U.S./EU
destabilization of Ukraine **to Putin's supposed expansionist
aspirations**.]{.underline}

The ease in which the corporate media was able [to]{.underline} flip
that script and **[make Putin the new face of evil]{.underline}** has
been truly astonishing. And the fact that that narrative was [embraced
by most liberals and large sectors of the white left in the United
States]{.underline} only affirmed that---[having abandoned class
analysis and anti-imperialism, and never really having understood the
insidious nature of white supremacist ideology---the U.S. left has **no
theoretical framework** for apprehending the complexities of the current
period]{.underline}. The inability to extricate itself from the
influences of white supremacist ideology has to be considered one
explanation for the strange positions taken by large sectors of the
white liberal/left over the last few years. [How else can one explain
the bizarre incorporation of the **discourse of** **"humanitarian
intervention"** and the obscenely obvious **racism of the
"responsibility to protect"**?]{.underline} [Could it be]{.underline}
that many white radicals have fallen prey to the subtle and
not-so-subtle [racial appeal to a form of **cross-class white solidarity
in defense of "Western values,"** civilization and the prerogative to
determine who has the right to national sovereignty, all of which are at
the base of the rationalization of the "responsibility to protect"
asserted by the white West?]{.underline}

The apparent **[incapacity]{.underline}** of white leftists [to
penetrate and understand the cultural and **ideological** impact of
white supremacy and its powerful **effect on their own consciousness**
has weakened and deformed left analysis of U.S. and European **foreign
policy initiatives**]{.underline}. [It has also resulted in the
U.S]{.underline}. and European [left taking political positions that
either objectively **championed U.S./NATO imperialist aggression** or
provided tacit support for that aggression though
**silence**]{.underline}. As a consequence of the abandonment of
anti-imperialism and an active class-racial collaboration with the
Western bourgeoisie, [an almost insurmountable chasm has been created
separating the Western left from its counterparts in much of the global
South]{.underline}. Instead of more resolute anti-imperialist
solidarity, broad elements of the [white left in the United
States]{.underline} and Europe have [consistently aligned themselves
with the policies of the U.S/NATO/EU axis that supports right-wing
forces from Ukraine to Venezuela]{.underline}. **[Exaggeration, racial
paranoia, and an overly simplistic]{.underline}** and divisive---even
"racist"---[assessment of the liberal/left will be the
charge]{.underline}. We accept those charges. We accept them because we
know they will come. [For those of us living outside the walls of
privilege who must nevertheless accept the realities of the
colonialist/imperialist-created global South, we don't have the luxury
of comforting illusions]{.underline}. Our **[lived
experiences]{.underline}** [negate the]{.underline} **[false
history]{.underline}** [of Europe's benevolent
civilization]{.underline}. We see developing in Europe and in the United
States the very real possibility of a left-right racial convergence
fueled by crisis, leftist ideological confusion and what appears to be
[a mutual commitment to maintaining the global structures of white
supremacy]{.underline}. [Understanding the]{.underline} **[violent
history of the Western project]{.underline}** [and the pathological
nature of white supremacy, we are forced to see with]{.underline}
**[crystal clarity]{.underline}** [that within the context of the
volatile economic and social conditions in Europe, giving legitimacy to
neo-fascist forces like the ones in Ukraine might just be the fuel
needed to ignite that racist, fascist delirium Berneri referred
to]{.underline}.

#### Fears of Russia are just western ploy for imperialism 

Gary **Leupp 22**, professor of History at Tufts, 3-5-2022, \"Putin,
Lenin, Imperialism and the (Real) History of Ukraine,\"
https://portside.org/2022-03-05/putin-lenin-imperialism-and-real-history-ukraine,
jy

All this was delivered in a tone of such indignant solemnity and moral
authority that I imagine most people believed it. The fact of the matter
was that [Moscow---having repeatedly expressed alarm at NATO's
relentless expansion]{.underline} towards its border from 1999, having
declared in 2008 [that]{.underline} the inclusion of [Georgia and
Ukraine]{.underline} in NATO [was a "**red line**"]{.underline} issue,
having faced with frustration the U.S. announcement immediately
thereafter that Ukraine and George would both join regardless of
Moscow's feelings about the matter, having made its point clear in the
brief invasion of Georgia in 2008 (to end talk of Georgian membership),
having watched a U.S.-backed coup topple a president friendly to Russia
replacing him with a pro-NATO cabal---was re-annexing Crimea (not just
Russian from 1783 to 1954, but still Russia's main naval port, then on
lease from Crimea, and coveted by NATO) and supporting separatists in
the primarily Russian speaking population in the Donbass region
primarily to prevent further NATO expansion.

[In the **real world**, NATO is **front and center here**. In the world
of **imperialist propaganda**, NATO has **nothing to do with
it**]{.underline}, Russia's stated concerns are ridiculous, and anyway,
every country has the right to join a defensive alliance!

Now [we hear from the same tired old anchors]{.underline} and their
guests (former State and "Defense" Department officials, "senior foreign
correspondents," [and imperialist propagandists]{.underline} still in
demand despite their rich histories of disseminating lies), the updated
version of [the official line]{.underline}. It goes [something
like]{.underline} this[: Russia has crossed a red line!]{.underline} It
has invaded a sovereign country! Because Putin wants to revive the
Russian Empire! (Often this gets rendered "Russia has invaded AGAIN"
affording the commentator the opportunity to explain why the bloodless
annexation of Crimea was ALSO an invasion. So too the Donbass
assistance.)

In the real world, the U.S. has acted in the world since the collapse of
the Soviet Union, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the collapse of what
Washington perceived as the global communist movement, with an effort to
encircle Russia with the most horrifically threatening military force in
world history. It has expanded NATO in the absence of any real threat to
itself from 16 to 28 members, bordering Russia on the Baltic coast and
threatening to encircle it entirely. It has used NATO to pursue wars in
Serbia, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria, in the last case illegally
intervening in a failed effort to gain control over a longstanding
Russian ally.

[**No one** in their right mind can suggest that **Russia holds a
candle** to the **U.S. in imperial arrogance**]{.underline}. Certainly
not in this century.

In the real world, [Biden]{.underline} became president [determined
to]{.underline} both [**reassert U.S. "global leadership"** and to
**continue NATO expansion**]{.underline}. His campaign literature in
2020 reminded us that he believed in the cause. And it was clear he had
a particular interest in drawing Ukraine in, which meant convincing
Germany and other unenthusiastic NATO members to agree that Ukraine had
cleaned up its corruption sufficient to get the nod. He sent his
secretary of state Anthony Blinken, who as Biden's foreign policy
advisor had urged him in 2002 to support Bush's war on Iraq, to persuade
the Germans that their gas pipeline to Russia threatened NATO unity!
Meanwhile, U.S. puppet and NATO secretary-general Stoltenberg visited
Kyiv to assure Ukraine that it will, indeed, be admitted to NATO. And
the arms flowed into Ukraine.

Putin considered all this more threatening than ever. He amassed a force
on the Ukrainian border. Biden sought to rally the European allies in a
common response. While he warned of an imminent invasion, allies
reflecting on recent history expressed some skepticism, and several
leaders in their differing ways sought to arrange a peaceful solution.
But there was never a question of withdrawing the offer to Ukraine or
accepting a freeze of NATO expansion. Russian leaders complained that
they were speaking to the deaf, or that the two sides were speaking
different languages. The Russians were talking about their security, and
need to defend their borders; the U.S. president was talking about his
right to expand the alliance as he pleased.

For the U.S. media, what [we see]{.underline} here is [a **clearly drawn
conflict**]{.underline} [between **Good and Evil**]{.underline}, or in
Blinken's schoolmarmish conception "Democracy versus Autocracy." What [I
see]{.underline} is **[two evils]{.underline}**, neither of them
democratic, [locked in a conflict over the more powerful evil's lust for
**further expansion**]{.underline}. Both evils have their controlled
news media and means to shape public consciousness.

The Russian media is promoting what the U.S. media depicts as a
thoroughly distorted view of Ukrainian history. Without lingering on the
credentials of the CNN reporters to discern distortions in anybody's
history, let's look at what Putin has said. (I confess I haven't seen a
transcript, perhaps a sign that the speech may not contain some of
what's been reported; the bourgeois press manufactures quotes all the
time. Lots of people still think the Iranian president Ahmadinejad said,
"We will wipe Israel off the map!" if you can imagine.) This is what I
gather it included.

Putin apparently stated that Ukraine has never been a real state. This
is not true. It would be fair to say that Ukraine is not a state of
great antiquity, like England since 927, France since 987, Russia since
862. It was settled by Celtic and Germanic peoples before it became the
heart of a Turkic empire called Khazaria in the eighth century. Its
ruling elite embraced Judaism as the national faith while the Byzantine
Empire promoted Orthodox Christianity and Byzantine Jews settled in
large numbers in the empire. The Khazar Empire fell in the tenth century
as the Slavic-Scandinavian Rus established their capital in Kyiv. Four
centuries later Moscow became the capital of the Russian state.

In the interim, Kievan Rus collapsed during the Mongol invasions, and
what is now Ukraine was divided among the Golden Horde, the Crimean
Tartars, and the Lithuanian-Polish state. The latter portion became,
through a treaty in 1654, a province of Russia. After the Russian
Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks recognized the province as a state, a
soviet socialist republic, expanding its borders to include much
territory inhabited by Russian-speaking Russians. The Crimean Peninsula
was turned over to Ukraine by Russia when they were both with the USSR,
in 1954.

Ukraine has been inhabited and crisscrossed by Scythians, Celts,
Germanic peoples, Huns, Khazars, Mongols as well as Slavs. Given its
history of incorporation into different states, it has regions with
large German or Hungarian populations. Unless one considers the
Polish-Lithuanian dependency a state, or the Russian province of Ukraine
an independent state, the first independent Ukrainian state---or at
least the closest approximation of an independent state so far---was the
Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Russia demanded that Ukraine be
considered an independent state on the world stage; it held a separate
UN seat. With Belarus it was one of the closest SSRs to Moscow, and most
hesitant to withdraw from the union when Boris Yeltsin unilaterally
dissolved it by pulling Russia itself out. Once established in its
current configuration, Ukraine agreed to abandon its nuclear arsenal; it
also agreed to a long-lease arrangement with Russia involving the vital
Crimean naval base.

When Putin points to this history or at least aspects of it, he is not
churning out lies at the level of the dutiful U.S. TV journalist who
told us about Saddam Hussein's involvement in 9-11; Iran's plans to
build nuclear weapons; or the threat of imminent genocide in Kosovo,
Libya, or Syria. But he is distorting and oversimplifying to pooh-pooh
Ukrainian nationalism in general and to facilely associate it with
fascism. Thus he describes the current invasion as a "denazification"
operation, while the talking heads in this country ridicule the
accusation.

In the real world, Ukrainian fascist movements exist and were surely on
display in the Maidan coup in 2014. They played a key role in the
violent overthrow of an elected government, under Victoria Nuland's
watchful eye. There remains much support in some quarters for the
wartime nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who espoused a fascist
ideology and helped round up Jews in Ukraine for the Nazi death camps.
Anyone paying attention realizes that there are fascist elements in the
military (the entire Azov Battalion) and that fascist parties, while
small and with little electoral influence, have been able to stymie the
implementation of the now-defunct Minsk Accords. So, yes, there is a
fascist movement in Ukraine and it has a long history.

But the resistance movement in Ukraine looks like something else. And
it's making it look like Putin is exaggerating the fascist issue, real
though it is, to evoke Russian memories of the Great Patriotic War
(1941-1945), also known as the Anti-Fascist War. Crucial battles in this
war were fought on Ukrainian soil, where some local communities sided
with the fascists and embraced the Nazis' Russophobia. Putin wants to
essentialize Ukrainians as tending towards fascism, now working in
tandem again with Russia's enemies. This effort could well backfire
among Russians who realize that Ukrainians are divided politically and
ideologically among themselves and in any case undeserving of Putin's
characterization.

The most interesting element in Putin's presentation is the idea that
Lenin and the Communists---whom he has made it clear he despises, as he
plays the part of a true son of the Russian Orthodox Church---are
responsible for the terrible error of creating a Ukrainian state in the
form of the old Ukrainian SSR! That, he suggests, was the origin of the
current problem. Lenin, in his condemnation of tsarist Russia as "a
prison house of nations," in his commitment to proletarian
internationalism, and to the self-determination of nations, foolishly
allowed a Ukrainian republic to form. This state could, according to the
Soviet constitution, depart from the union if it ceased to serve its
needs. Thus Putin explains the origin of the problem.

In the real world, Putin's former boss Boris Yeltsin led Russia when it,
not Ukraine, left the USSR. The Supreme Soviet confirmed the legality of
the withdrawal, as it had approved the departure of the Baltic SSRs.
Ukraine was left with no alternative but to declare its own
independence. Affected simultaneously by the same confusing process,
Russians and Ukrainians retained amicable relations; the mere fact of
new mutual independence was not a great problem for the relationship.
Relations only deteriorated when, from around 2005, Ukrainian leaders
requested NATO membership. In 2010 an anti-NATO president was
democratically elected; the U.S. State Department oversaw a massive
regime change effort to depict him as corrupt, anti-EU, impeding
"Ukrainian's European aspirations." It succeeded in ousting him, and to
some extent also succeeded in portraying the Maidan putsch, to the
people of this country, as a democratic mass movement against a corrupt
Russian puppet.

That Putin is a shameless, amoral mythmaker is not the issue. Nor even
is his anti-communism. [If we dwell of the evil he represents, we risk
uniting with the **shameless, amoral mythmakers around
Biden**]{.underline}. We risk succumbing to the simplistic Blinken
concept of the world (no advance over George W. Bush's "you're for us or
against us" biblical nonsense) as one divided between Good ("Democracy")
and Evil ("Autocracy") and to the conclusion that to combat the latter
we must unite with the former.

[Lenin]{.underline} were he alive today [would]{.underline} no doubt
[point out that **Russia** today, as well **as the U.S**., is a
**capitalist-imperialist country**]{.underline}. He would promote (as he
did during World War I) a strategy of "revolutionary defeatism," based
on the expectation that defeat in war would weaken the (current Russian)
bourgeois state, allowing for a workers' revolution. He would urge the
same for the Ukrainian workers of all nationalities. He would warn as he
did against "Great Russia chauvinism." Putin, again, rejects all this.
He is a Russian nationalist with (very traditional) Russian anxiety
about border security. (If you ask why it is traditional, 1. look at a
map; 2. read Tolstoy's War and Peace.) He is despicable, but his demand
that NATO ceases expansion is as eminently reasonable and Biden's desire
to expand it seems crazier by the day.

How should a Marxist see this situation? [The principle
contradiction]{.underline} here [is certainly **not "democracy" versus
"autocracy,"**]{.underline} although it's telling that the opinion
shapers need to speak in such primitive terms, as though addressing a
third-grade civics class. [It is the desire of the post-Cold War USA to
**maintain and expand its "full-spectrum dominance"**]{.underline} [as
the planet's **sole superpower**]{.underline}, able to use it's
terrifying military resources, [control over the world banking system,
access to private communications everywhere, manipulation of the flow of
information and all the resources available to prevent the emergence of
any rival]{.underline}---versus the post-Cold War Russia, again a
capitalist power, driven by the same basic imperatives as the U.S. and
similar toolbox of devises to pursue its "national interests" (which are
now, of course, Russian bourgeois interests).

Repeat: it's not Democracy, led by the Leader of the Free World, versus
Autocracy, led by Putin (or Putin and Xi, or Putin, Xi and the new
Iranian leader). No. [It's an **expanding capitalist-imperialist
superpower**, one of the most racist, oppressive, and violent countries
on earth, **hell-bent on expansion at Russia's expense**, versus a
middling capitalist-imperialist power hell-bent on stopping
NATO]{.underline}'s expansion to its borders.

Rather like the U.S. would be hell-bent on preventing the Warsaw Pact,
when there was such a thing, from expanding to include Mexico and
Canada. If you are looking for truly appropriate analogies, linger on
that one.

The worst thing that might happen---it is in fact happening already---is
for leftists of shallow understanding [to]{.underline} conclude that, in
this one instance, yes, we should support the mounting sanctions,
rejoice at the suspension of Nord Stream II, [endorse the shipping of
more weapons]{.underline} including those from Germany. Because Russia
is the aggressor here! [Such thoughts]{.underline}, reflecting no
knowledge of (real) historical context, [are **as dangerous as the
invasion itself**]{.underline}.

[Unity with]{.underline} Biden, who has supported every
**[NATO]{.underline}** war, plus the war on Iraq based on lies, who
refuses to even think about a world without an expanding NATO, [versus
Putin]{.underline} who has ([understandably]{.underline}!)
[protested]{.underline} with mounting intensity [NATO]{.underline}'s
expansion to surrounding European Russia, [is **impossible** for a
Marxist or **any consistent anti-imperialist**]{.underline}. Not that we
say, "A plague on both your houses," since we wish nobody an epidemic.
We should say[: the workers of the world **HAVE no
country**]{.underline}. When we do, we can talk about defending it.

I do hope that, and would not be surprised if, Putin's attack on Lenin
has provoked some outrage among Russians who continue to read Lenin's
works. Such as "The Right of Nations to Self-Determination" (1914), "On
the National Pride of the Great Russians" (1914), and "The
Ukraine"(1917). In the latter essay, Lenin wrote:

> ...Ukrainian people do not wish to secede from Russia at present. They

Russia's revolutionary democrats, if they want to be truly revolutionary
and truly democratic, must break with that past, must regain for
themselves, for the workers and peasants of Russia, the brotherly trust
of the Ukrainian workers and peasants. This cannot be done without full
recognition of Ukraine's rights, including the right to free secession.

We do not favour the existence of small states. We stand for the closest
union of the workers of the world against "their own" capitalists and
those of all other countries. But for this union to be voluntary, the
Russian worker, who does not for a moment trust the Russian or the
Ukrainian bourgeoisie in anything, now stands for the right of the
Ukrainians to secede, without imposing his friendship upon them, but
striving to win their friendship by treating them as an equal, as an
ally and brother in the struggle for socialism.

Putin has attacked this view, and specifically the "Communist" view of
the right of self-determination. He employs a few facts (such as
Ukraine's historical absorption into larger entities) to deny
Ukrainians' national identity, treating them paradoxically as both a
sub-category of Russians and ridden with Russophobic neofacists. Here he
is the one who sounds fascist, while Biden poses as the decent defender
of the "rules-based world order." That's the order Russia has supposedly
threatened more than the U.S. has done since the commencement of
post-Cold War NATO expansion in 1999, the same year the U.S. and NATO
waged a criminal war on Serbia to create a new state in open defiance of
all those rules. But in fact the U.S. has been the aggressor here,
Russia the threatened party, for a quarter-century. NATO expansion has
proceeded in the dark, well below the radar of public concern or
interest. Now finally it becomes the subject of discussion because Putin
made it so.

[But **now**, you say, is not the best time to condemn NATO. We'll be
called **treasonous**]{.underline}. But no; [now that the issue is on
the table, this **could be a teaching moment**]{.underline}. We could
say, "Well, this time, at least, America's on the right side!" But it's
not. [It's trying to **salvage an ongoing project**, and]{.underline},
whatever happens, this round, [prepare for a grand **conflict to
come**]{.underline}, by further [binding Germany to its diktat, wooing
Finland and Sweden into NATO, stationing more troops in Poland and
Romania, etc.]{.underline} What we should say is: [This is **all about
imperialism**, and NATO expansion **as a tool of U.S. imperialism**. It
is also about]{.underline} Russian chauvinism, but more about [very real
Russian security concerns]{.underline}. And about rage that Russian
protests have only met with smirking references to the right nations
have to make their own alliances.

The best thing we can do to support the Ukrainian people (excepting the
fascist element, including the Azov Battalion) is to demand "our"
country keep its hands off Ukraine, stop interfering in its affairs,
permanently end NATO enlargement, and withdraw the invitation to Ukraine
to join. One should also demand the removal of warmonger Victoria
Newland (also known as "Fuck the EU!" Vicky) from her State Department
post. As for the Russian people, let us wish them well in organizing
against their own oppression avoiding any association with U.S. regime
change efforts.

Recall that the U.S. LOVED Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, as Russia slipped
into abject misery under oligarch capitalism. Recall how Clinton
arranged for an IMF loan to secure Yeltsin's victory in a 1996 election
it appeared a "Communist" would win. Yeltsin, who bombarded the Russian
parliament building when the Duma refused to dissolve at his order, was
Washington's idea of a fine Russian partner, who would protest only
meekly when Clinton expanded NATO and used NATO to aerially bombard the
first European city so attacked since 1945. (Why do I mention this?
Because reporters now keep saying that the Russian bombing in Ukraine is
the first. They lie. In fact, the bombing of Ukraine is in a way a
response to the earlier bombing of Serbia.)

What the U.S. cannot tolerate in Yeltsin's successor is his persistent
opposition to NATO expansion. Thus he is depicted as an autocrat (such
as U.S. allies who fit the bill are not), a moral monster (such as the
Saudi crown prince is not), a fountain of corruption secreting away
billions. He was not so depicted when he offered to permit NATO to
transport weapons through Russia to Afghanistan in 2002. He became a
villain when he began to sharply protest NATO expansion, and has been
vilified all the more after each measured response to that expansion.
For the left to join the chorus now would make us like the "socialist"
French and German legislators who voted war credits to their respective
governments in 1914, abandoning any pretense of proletarian
internationalism and lining up behind their bourgeoisie. Three years
later Lenin published his famous pamphlet, "Imperialism, the Highest
Stage of Capitalism," noting the shamelessness of the Second
International and its failure to grasp that modern wars are waged by
competing capitalist blocs, in which the workers have no stake but are
pitted against one another by state forces using coercion, nationalism
and fear.

[We remain in the]{.underline} historical [era of capitalist
imperialism. This is **not a time** to **make peace with it**. Our task
in this country is]{.underline} [to **defeat our ruling
class**]{.underline}, and nobody else's, surely not in tandem with a
president every bit as cracked and dangerous as the Russian leader.

[of its role as an apprentice]{.underline} [of the West is]{.underline}
[imperative]{.underline} [for the West **own
identity-building**]{.underline} [as a **benign** hegemon]{.underline}
[devoted to socialising and]{.underline} [**civilising** for **common
good**]{.underline}. Andrius Kubilius, a member of the European
Parliament and the former Prime Minister of Lithuania, argued for a
combination: "The new EU strategy towards Russia should entail three
elements---deterrence, containment and transformation" (Kubilius, 2021).
[The inferior "Other"]{.underline} [often]{.underline} [plays the dual
role of]{.underline} [both a **backward people and as an existential
threat**]{.underline} (Linklater, 2005). Case in point, Hitler's
propaganda against the Jews were defined by two distinct styles of
language---either "scornful derision" of the inferior race or
"panicstricken fear" of their threat to civilisation (Klemperer, 2006:
162). [Russophobia]{.underline} has similarly **[produced
two]{.underline}** **[depictions in the language over the past
500]{.underline}** **[years]{.underline}**---**[disdain for Russians as
an uncivilised and backward people, and simultaneously an immense
threat.]{.underline}** Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it
was common to argue that despite Russia's "syndrome of backwardness", it
representts a threat to international security (Snyder, 1994: 181).

Consequently, [propaganda]{.underline} [can produce]{.underline} what
Orwell referred to as **[doublethink]{.underline}**, [which is the act
of]{.underline} [accepting two **contradictory** beliefs
**simultaneously**]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} [is depicted as
hopelessly]{.underline} [weak]{.underline} [and lingering
towards]{.underline} [collapse, and]{.underline}
[simultaneously]{.underline} [an all-powerful threat]{.underline}
[responsible **for** **nearly all of the West's problems**]{.underline}.
US Senator John McCain argued that "Russia is a gas station masquerading
as a country" that is crippled by corruption and authoritarianism,
although it is also a country that can mastermind a great conspiracy of
influencing almost every election and referendum across the West.
[Scornful derision]{.underline} [is expressed towards]{.underline}
[Russia's hopeless economy]{.underline} [the size of the
Italian]{.underline} [economy]{.underline} [and its military
budget]{.underline} [being less than 10% of]{.underline} [NATO's
military budget]{.underline}, [yet]{.underline}
[simultaneously]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[panic]{.underline}**
**[stricken]{.underline}** [**fear** of Russia]{.underline} [conquering
Europe **requires**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Western
bloc]{.underline} [to continuously]{.underline} [increase its
**military**]{.underline} **[spending]{.underline}**, [end economic
reliance]{.underline} [on Russia and]{.underline} [rediscover solidarity
against the Russian menace]{.underline}. During the Russian Duma
elections, some media reports argued that Russia has no democracy, yet
in the breath celebrated that Putin's United Russia party lost many
seats in the Duma. [During the tensions]{.underline} [between
**Ukraine**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} [in
2021/22]{.underline}, [the Ukrainians]{.underline} [were **portrayed**
**as brave,** united and capable of **destroying the Russian invading
forces**, while **other reports there were warnings** that the large
hordes of **Russian troops** on the Ukrainian border **could overwhelm
the poor Ukrainians** within a few days or hours.]{.underline}

#### Constant securitization destroys the ability for adequate cooperation

Towards the end of the Cold War, [the necessity of]{.underline}
**[russophobia]{.underline}** **[became]{.underline}**
**[evident]{.underline}** [as reduced tensions]{.underline} [with the
Soviets became]{.underline} [a threat to the West]{.underline}. Some
argued that Gorbachev's policies towards the West were insincere.

Although, [irrespective of sincerity]{.underline}, [the Soviet peace
offensive]{.underline} [threatened the entire foundation of
solidarity]{.underline} [with the West as an in-group]{.underline} [by
altering its relationship]{.underline} [with the Soviets as the
out-group]{.underline}. Critics argued that the principal policy of the
Soviets was to reduce the American presence in Europe and sow divisions
to increase Moscow's influence (Gelman, 1987). Gorbachev's "peace
offensive" was thus met with profound scepticism as it reduced European
dependence on the US and it undermined Western solidarity and thus the
balancing of the Soviet Union.

The [reactions]{.underline} [to Gorbachev's]{.underline}
[peace]{.underline} [offensive]{.underline} [was similar]{.underline}
[to that of the Soviet]{.underline} [peace offensive]{.underline} after
Stalin's death in 1953---[when Moscow made concessions]{.underline},
[walked back its rhetoric]{.underline} of world revolution, [and called
for peaceful]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline}
[resolution]{.underline} with the West. [The efforts were]{.underline}
largely [denounced]{.underline} [by the US as "peace
propaganda]{.underline}" **[aimed to sow divisions]{.underline}**,
**[prevent]{.underline}** **[rearmament]{.underline}** **[and create the
image of the Soviets as a proponent of peace]{.underline}**. US
Secretary of State Dean Acheson criticised that "the Russians have
sought to 'monopolize' the dove of peace" (Brooks, 2000: 6). Thus, the
mere call for peace threatened the dichotomous stereotype of the benign
US versus the belligerent Soviet Union.

[When the Cold War finally came to an end,]{.underline} [the obvious
question for scholars]{.underline} [of propaganda]{.underline} [should
have been how the fierce propaganda]{.underline} [throughout the Cold
War would undermine a]{.underline} [post-Cold War
settlement]{.underline}. During the Cold War, Solzhenitsyn had expressed
concerns that the anti-communist propaganda had become interchangeable
with antiRussian propaganda. [Solzhenitsyn]{.underline} had
[advocated]{.underline} that [the US should also label]{.underline}
[Russia as a "captive nation]{.underline}" [and a victim of
communism]{.underline} rather than a benefactor as it would generate
sympathy for the Russians, [create a common opposition to
communism]{.underline}, [and lay the foundation for a harmonious
peace]{.underline} [once communism collapsed]{.underline} (Lapidus,
1984). However, the US strategy for "captive nations" was a Cold War
propaganda strategy to use ethnic nationalism to divide and destabilise
the multi-ethnic Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (Lapidus, 1984). Thus, the
preference for portraying the Soviet Union as a manifestation of Russian
imperialism would result in the continuation of containment after the
Cold War by fuelling ethnic nationalism and mobilise US sentiment
against post-communist Russia.

[A workable peace]{.underline} after the Cold War [was obstructed by
making NATO an]{.underline} [insurance policy]{.underline} [against
future conflicts with Russia]{.underline}. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright confirmed the insurance policy logic in a testimony to the
Senate Armed Services Committee in April 1997: "[On the offchance that
in fact Russia doesn't work]{.underline} out the way that we are hoping
it will... [NATO is there]{.underline}" (Carpenter & Conly, 1998).
Former US Secretary of State James [Baker]{.underline} (2002)
[acknowledged that NATO had become "an insurance policy]{.underline}
[against resurgent]{.underline} and possibly virulent [Russian
nationalism"]{.underline}. Baker warned against the approach of
**[preparing NATO]{.underline}** **[for a future conflict]{.underline}**
**[with Russia as it would become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.]{.underline}** When Russia eventually responded to these
security challenges, [**NATO could denounce** **Russia** as aggressive
and threatening]{.underline}, [**thus** gradually **returning to its
official mission of containing Russia.**]{.underline}

There was initially an overwhelming consensus among US policymakers
after the Cold War that NATO expansion would poison the relationship
with Russia and reignite a conflict (Grayson, 1999). After significant
lobbying, the consensus shifted under the ideological argument that NATO
had converted itself into a peaceful community of democracies. Beneath
the new branding of NATO, there was nonetheless recognition for the
implied continued mission of containing Russia (Grayson, 1999;
Mandelbaum, 1995). Even hawks, such as Richard Pipes signed a statement
by the Coalition Against NATO Expansion (CANE), which recognised that:
[By its nature]{.underline}, [a military alliance is]{.underline}
**[directed against someone]{.underline}**. [The geography
of]{.underline} [NATO expansion makes its target clear]{.underline}:
**[Russia]{.underline}**\... **[The proposal to expand NATO
tosses]{.underline}** **[it away by telling Russia in unmistakable terms
that it remains excluded from the community of Western
nations\...]{.underline}** \[**[Russia\] will remember]{.underline}**,
**[and ultimately, she will react]{.underline}**, either [**from** a
position of renewed **strength** **or out of desperation.** The last
great **unfinished business** of the 20th century **is the reintegration
of Russia with the West.**]{.underline} **[With the proposal to expand
NATO, we have turned our back on it. (CENA, 1998)]{.underline}**

[NATO's messaging to Russia]{.underline} [was characterised]{.underline}
**[by a contradictory approach of reassurance and
deterrence]{.underline}**. **[NATO]{.underline}**
**[reassured]{.underline}** [**Russia** **it was not considered a
threat**]{.underline} [and was]{.underline} [not the target of
NATO,]{.underline} **[although simultaneously deterring]{.underline}**
**[Russia]{.underline}** [by cautioning]{.underline} that
[NATO]{.underline} [would be turned against]{.underline} [Russia if it
chose the wrong]{.underline} [path]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline}
(2010) [defined this insurance]{.underline} [policy]{.underline}:
"[because Russia's future]{.underline} [policies]{.underline} [toward
NATO remain difficult to predict]{.underline}, [the **Allies** **must**
**pursue** the goal of **cooperation**]{.underline} while also guarding
against the possibility that Russia could decide to move in a more
adversarial direction".

As Russia is presented with the dilemma of being an apprentice or threat
to Western civilisation, [**the West** **had to respond** **with**
**strategic ambiguity.**]{.underline} [Attempting]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} simultaneously [civilise]{.underline} [and contain
Russia]{.underline} [demanded strategic ambiguity]{.underline} in the
1990s [as Russia had to internalise]{.underline} [the notion of the
West]{.underline} [as a benign hegemon in order]{.underline} [for Russia
to accept its role as a political]{.underline} [object]{.underline}.
[Russia **could not be defined** **as a threat** and openly contained,
**yet Russia could not be disconfirmed** **as a threat** as it would
undermine the security guarantees to the Central and Eastern European
allies.]{.underline}

**[Russia]{.underline}** [raising the security concerns]{.underline} [of
an expanding military alliance]{.underline} [and **being excluded**
**from Europe reaffirms Russia's backwardness**]{.underline} **[and made
NATO expansion even more necessary]{.underline}**. [NATO]{.underline}
had [transformed itself into]{.underline} [a community of liberal
democratic values]{.underline} [and NATO's failure to expand was a
great]{.underline} [danger as it would reaffirm the Soviet]{.underline}
[propaganda]{.underline} [that NATO is an offensive military
alliance]{.underline} [rather than a defensive alliance:
"]{.underline}If Russia's rulers have no revanchist aspirations, they
have no reason to resent NATO's inclusion of the new democracies" (Will,
1996). Kennan, the author of the Long Telegram of 1946 and architect of
the containment policy against the Soviet Union, lived well after the
collapse of the Soviet Union and was exasperated that the containment
policy would continue against post-Soviet Russia. In an interview with
Friedman (1998), Kennan lambasted the "ill-informed" Senate debates that
demonstrated "so little understanding of Russian history and Soviet
history", which subsequently resulted in the decision to expand NATO: I
was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying
to attack Western Europe. Don't people understand? Our differences in
the cold war were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are
turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless
revolution in history to remove that Soviet regime. Of course there is
going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then \[the NATO expanders\]
will say that we always told you that is how the Russians are \-- but
this is just wrong.

Bloc discipline within an alliance requires the continuous elevation of
an external threat to perpetuate the dividing lines between the in-group
and the out-group. [The endurance of anti]{.underline}-[Russian
propaganda]{.underline} [therefore]{.underline} [requires]{.underline}
**[the creation of a Russian threat]{.underline}** [when it is
insufficient or absent]{.underline}. In Italy, [the US pursued
clandestine]{.underline} [stay-behind operations]{.underline} [after
the]{.underline} [Second World War]{.underline} under the codename
Operation Gladio lasting until 1990, [in which the CIA and
NATO]{.underline} **[conducted false-flag terrorist
attacks]{.underline}** [that could be blamed on red]{.underline}
[brigades]{.underline} (Ganser, 2005). Such staybehind
[operations]{.underline} also [existed in other Western European
states]{.underline}, and the European Community (1990) [acknowledged
that Western intelligence]{.underline} [agencies in collaboration with
NATO]{.underline} "**[were involved in serious cases of terrorism and
crime" against]{.underline}** **[the populations of
Western]{.underline}** **[Europe]{.underline}**. **[The US planned
similar false-flag operations within its own territory.]{.underline}**
Case in point, the US Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff proposed Operation Northwoods in 1962, in which the [US
government]{.underline} [would commit acts of terrorism]{.underline}
[against American civilian]{.underline} and military
[targets]{.underline} **[to blame them on the Cuban
government]{.underline}** (Nelson, 2001). Declassified documents also
reveal that the US sought to acquire an authentic Soviet aircraft or
manufacture a replica to stage "a provocation operation in which Soviet
aircraft would appear to attack US or friendly installations to provide
an excuse for US intervention" (US National Archives, 1962: 2).

[**The** similar **need** **to uphold solidarity**]{.underline} [and
bloc discipline]{.underline} [made **empathy towards
Russia**]{.underline} **[problematic]{.underline}** after the Cold War.
Dissenting from the West and US leadership is labelled as a threat to
alliance solidarity, which enables Russia to divide the West. **[The
framing of alliance solidarity to shield against the Russian threats is
central to obtaining compliance by allied states.]{.underline}**

[Seeking order]{.underline} in chaos [is **an evolutionary instinct**
in]{.underline} [human]{.underline} [nature]{.underline} [that
**developed for survival**]{.underline}. [The process]{.underline} [of
creating order]{.underline} [entails]{.underline} [discovering patterns,
however, perceiving patterns, where they do not exist,]{.underline} [is
the]{.underline} **[source of paranoia and conspiracy
theories]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} eventually **[unravels order
and the internal]{.underline}** **[cohesion]{.underline}** of the
in-group.

[Propaganda]{.underline} [**can unravel order** if artificial
patterns]{.underline} [are created]{.underline} to the extent it
decouples from reality. [Apophenia]{.underline} is defined as the
proclivity for "**[unmotivated seeing of connections]{.underline}**" [in
random]{.underline} [data or events]{.underline}, which [**fuels
paranoia** when these]{.underline} [connections]{.underline} [are traced
back to a hidden authority]{.underline} (Conrad, 1958).
[Governments]{.underline} **[can fuel psychotic]{.underline}**
**[disorder and conspiracy theories]{.underline}** in the population by
continuously escalating paranoia about the Other, the out-group
contrasted to the in-group (Popper, 1966).

**[Ideological conformity]{.underline}** can [produce collective
self]{.underline}-[delusion by **inoculating**]{.underline} the **[group
from hard facts]{.underline}**. [Propaganda develops
**dichotomous**]{.underline} **[stereotypes]{.underline}** [and thus
**radicalise opinions**]{.underline} [by eliminating middle]{.underline}
[ground]{.underline}. Albert Maysles famously said that "tyranny is the
deliberate removal of nuance". Hannah Arendt (1951: 474) similarly
cautioned that "the selfcompulsion of ideological thinking" disconnects
people from reality and opens the door to totalitarianism: [The ideal
subject of totalitarian rule is]{.underline} [not the convinced
Nazi]{.underline}... [but people]{.underline} [for whom the]{.underline}
[distinction between fact and]{.underline} [fiction]{.underline} (i.e.,
the reality of experience) [and the distinction]{.underline} [between
true and false]{.underline} (i.e., the standards of thought) [no longer
exist.]{.underline}

[Propaganda]{.underline} in its excesses [diminishes]{.underline} [the
ability to]{.underline} [reflect on **internal problems**]{.underline},
[which continues to]{.underline} [weaken]{.underline} **[the political
culture and trust in Western societies]{.underline}**. [A key strength
of open societies]{.underline} [is the ability to **air their
problems**]{.underline} [to **correct**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[improve]{.underline}**, as [opposed to closed societies]{.underline}
[that suppress]{.underline} [their problems and thus create a **rot

### Link --- Ukraine

#### Imperialism was the [reason]{.underline} for the war in Ukraine --- war is an [inevitable result]{.underline} of the affirmative's politics.

**Svensson '22** --- Niklas Albin; Swedish journalist and media
personality. March 18, 2022; \"How western imperialism prepared the
ground for the conflict in Ukraine\"; *Socialist Appeal*;
https://www.socialist.net/how-western-imperialism-prepared-the-ground-for-the-conflict-in-ukraine.htm;
//CYang

[Contrary to]{.underline} the [assertions of **western
propaganda**]{.underline}, the [war in Ukraine is]{.underline} not the
result of Putin's mental state, but is the [product of **belligerent
aggression** by US imperialism and NATO]{.underline}. [They are
responsible for]{.underline} the [current catastrophe]{.underline}.

As the Russian army continues to shell the cities of Ukraine, the
[western press and politicians]{.underline} are [doing]{.underline}
their [utmost to conceal]{.underline} the [role of western
imperialism]{.underline} in the disaster. [Far from being]{.underline} a
**[neutral party]{.underline}**, the [West]{.underline} have been
[provoking the conflict for their **own imperialist
reasons**]{.underline}.

As bombs and rockets fall on Ukrainian cities, workers around the world
are naturally appalled at the death and destruction caused by the
Russian invasion. However, the role that the West has played in this
conflict is never explained.

If we think about it for a minute, it is [clear]{.underline} that the
[war in Ukraine is not]{.underline} just a war [between Ukraine and
Russia]{.underline}, [but a **proxy war** between the
western]{.underline} allies [and Russia]{.underline}. There is no doubt
whose side the West is on. For the past few years, the Ukrainian
military has been armed and trained by NATO countries.

Today, Ukraine is seeing its war effort bankrolled by the EU and the US.
They are sending both weapons and money in an unprecedented way. Germany
has broken its long-standing rule of not sending arms. The House of
Representatives recently approved \$13bn to Ukraine, and so on.

We might ask: [where was this money when Ukraine]{.underline} was [in
the midst of a **devastating economic crisis**]{.underline}? Now they
are at war, it is clearly considered money well spent. When the mass of
Ukrainians faced poverty and destitution, that wasn't so much the case.
The fact that [western arms manufacturers are making **huge
profits**]{.underline} out of this, is the icing on the cake.

[What good will this support do]{.underline}? [Very little]{.underline}.
If it has its intended consequences, [it will **prolong the
war**]{.underline}, but at a devastating cost.

Of course, it won't be politicians, journalists, and CEOs in the US or
Western Europe who face this devastation, but the millions of Ukrainians
who are having their homes and livelihoods destroyed. The Russian army
will clearly level Ukraine's cities to the ground before they allow the
country to join NATO.

European workers will also feel the pinch, with skyrocketing energy
prices. This is not to mention the workers and poor of Egypt and
Lebanon, who are massive consumers of Russian and Ukrainian wheat. Yet,
as US President [Biden]{.underline} and UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss
[made clear]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} "[a **price worth
paying**]{.underline}". Of course, that's [easy for them to
say]{.underline}.

[For]{.underline} the countries of [NATO]{.underline}, [there is an
**important principle** at stake]{.underline}: [keeping Ukraine firmly
in their]{.underline} sphere of [influence]{.underline} and not allowing
Russian interference. This is [tied up in **flowery phraseology** about
sovereignty]{.underline} and self-determination. [But behind beautiful
phrases]{.underline}, as is so often the case, [lie **imperialist
interests**]{.underline}.

Promises made

The root of this conflict can be traced back to the collapse of the
Soviet Union. At the time, the Warsaw Pact was in force throughout
Eastern Europe. The pact had been created specifically to counter the
inclusion of West Germany into NATO.

Soldiers of the Soviet Union were stationed throughout Eastern Europe
--- on the one hand as a guarantee against a western attack; and on the
other as a means of securing the control of the state bureaucracy in
Moscow over the nations of Eastern Europe.

By 1989, however, the pact was falling apart. The capitalists of the
West saw a massive opportunity for new profitable investments all over
Eastern Europe, including in Russia itself, as a result of the return to
capitalism, which was on the cards in the region. They were very keen to
keep the army of the Soviet Union from intervening to reverse the
process.

The state bureaucracy of the Soviet Union had used its troops to
suppress the revolutionary movements in Hungary in 1956 and in Prague in
1968. At that time, political revolution, rather than the restoration of
capitalism, was on the agenda. But there was nevertheless a fear among
capitalist politicians that the army would once again intervene.

In the military establishment, there was strong support, not for
socialism of course, but for the prestige of the military of the Soviet
Union and the Warsaw Pact.

The West, therefore, promised a number of things to the leaders of the
Soviet Union. In particular, it promised not to expand NATO. George Bush
Sr. made a promise to Gorbachev not to take advantage of the various
movements in Eastern Europe to harm Soviet security interests in 1989.
At the time of German reunification in 1990, this became a particularly
sensitive question.

The West German Foreign Minister Genscher gave a speech where he said
that in order not to harm Soviet security interests, NATO should rule
out "expansion of its territory to the east, i.e. moving closer to
Soviet borders".

A treaty on German unification --- signed by the two German republics,
the Soviet Union, France, United Kingdom, and United States ---
stipulated that, although the new United Germany was free to join NATO,
after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany (GDR), no
foreign troops would be stationed in the former GDR.

Throughout the process, the western powers were very aware that the
acceptance of the Soviet Union was conditional on assurances as to the
intentions of the West vis-a-vis the Eastern European countries.

On 9 February 1990, US Secretary of State James A. Baker made the offer
to Gorbachev that NATO would not expand one inch eastward, if the Soviet
Union accepted that the new United Germany would join NATO.

On the following day, West German Chancellor Kohl promised Gorbachev
that "NATO should not expand its scope". And the promises continued
throughout 1990 and the following year.

In March 1991, just a few months before the Warsaw Pact was dissolved
British Prime Minister John Major told Gorbachev that, "we are not
talking about the strengthening of NATO"; and on the question of NATO
expansion that, "nothing of the sort will happen". The Warsaw Pact was
duly dissolved on 1 July 1991.

The National Security Archive of George Washington University compiled a
number of documents that show the flurry of diplomatic activity designed
to offer assurances to the Soviet leaders, called NATO Expansion: What
Gorbachev Heard. They really leave no room for doubt about what was
promised at the time. But the promises were broken a few years later.

The plunder of Eastern Europe

The oligarchy in Russia that was being created out of the plundering of
state assets was not yet strong enough to assert itself. The economy was
in free fall, and the resistance of the working class hadn't yet been
fully overcome. Russia in the 1990s became a playground for the new
oligarchs and western finance capital.

The personification of this process was President Yeltsin, who leaned
heavily on the West in order to maintain his rule. If Gorbachev was
trying to balance between market reforms and the old planned economy,
Yeltsin became the face of open counter-revolution and market reform.

At crucial points, the West stepped in to reinforce his position
vis-a-vis protesting workers and a wing of the bureaucracy that still
hadn't completely gone over to capitalism.

Even when Putin was positioning himself to take over from Yeltsin, he
leaned on the West, including public meetings with Tony Blair and
others. He was intended to be their new man in Moscow. The restoration
of capitalism up to this point had meant the subservience of Russia to
western imperialism.

The [West]{.underline} was [pushing its influence into Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. The [working class]{.underline} in the region had
been [thoroughly **demoralised** and **atomised** by]{.underline} the
process of [capitalist restoration]{.underline}. They [were ripe for
**exploitation**]{.underline}, [and western capital moved
in]{.underline} to do just that.

German capital played a big role in this, becoming a key player in the
economies of Eastern and Central Europe, as well as in the Balkans. In
the process, it played a decisive role in the reactionary break-up of
Yugoslavia.

Swedish finance capital took over banking in the Baltic States (Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania). Industries throughout Eastern Europe were gobbled
up by European companies, particularly the ones that were in a good
state. The German car producer Volkswagen took over Škoda, etc. But
these new acquisitions remained vulnerable to a Russia that was starting
to find its feet.

The war in Chechnya, where Russia brutally suppressed the local
independence aspirations, was a sign that Russia wasn't quite the
pushover it used to be. The war also formed a crucial component in
Putin's presidential campaign.

He styled his presidency as one of revival, including the reintroduction
of the national anthem of the Soviet Union (with new, nationalist,
lyrics).

Broken promises

If the Russian oligarchs were the big gangsters, the little gangsters of
Eastern Europe that had become rich on the back of the firesale of state
assets were now worried about their bigger neighbour to the east. Formal
inclusion in the western sphere of influence was an attractive option.

In short order, between 1999 and 2004, most states of the former Warsaw
Pact were incorporated into NATO. The inclusion, in particular of the
Baltic States, brought NATO right up to the borders of Russia.

Now, US troops could be readily deployed right on the borders of Russia,
some two hours drive from St. Petersburg; although in order to reduce
the amount of provocation, no US troops were deployed at that stage. The
US was, for now, sticking to that part of the agreement that stipulated
that there would be no permanently stationed troops east of Germany. But
this wouldn't last, as we shall see.

Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton's Secretary of State, related the
Russian opinion of this at the time (1998): "\[Russian president\]
Yeltsin and his countrymen were strongly opposed to enlargement, seeing
it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability and moving Europe's
dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated."

About the same time, NATO conducted a 78-day bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia (Serbia), which caused enormous economic damage.

In a lecture on the 2014 crisis in Ukraine, Professor John Mearsheimer
of the University of Chicago explained the significance of this: "NATO
not only intervened in the affairs of a non-NATO country, but took sides
against the Serbs, allies of the Russians, and did so without United
Nations Security Council approval."

This was followed by interventions in **[Kosovo]{.underline}**, where
[Russian armoured units had a stand-off with NATO troops]{.underline};
**[Afghanistan]{.underline}**, where the [US spuriously
triggered]{.underline} the mutual defence [**a**rticle
**5**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline}, more recently,
[Libya]{.underline}.

The implication was clear, [NATO wasn't]{.underline} just a **[defensive
alliance]{.underline}**, [but something]{.underline} that could be [used
by the West to further]{.underline} their [interests against
Russia]{.underline}.

Russia draws a line in the sand

NATO continued its programme of expansion. In 2008, a summit took place
in Bucharest where a declaration was adopted. Contrary to the wishes of
Ukraine and Georgia, the two countries weren't immediately approved for
membership.

Nevertheless, the declaration clearly stated that: "NATO welcomes
Ukraine's and Georgia's Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in
NATO. We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO."

In response to this declaration, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister
stated: "Georgia's and Ukraine's membership in the alliance is a huge
strategic mistake which will have the most serious consequences for
pan-European security."

Putin called NATO membership of Georgia and Ukraine a "direct threat" to
Russia.

In a leaked cable on February 1, 2008, the US ambassador to Moscow
explained the Russian position:

"5. (C) Ukraine and Georgia\'s NATO aspirations not only touch a raw
nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about the consequences
for stability in the region. Not only does Russia perceive encirclement,
and efforts to undermine Russia's influence in the region, but it also
fears unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences which would seriously
affect Russian security interests. Experts tell us that Russia is
particularly worried that the strong divisions in Ukraine over NATO
membership, with much of the ethnic-Russian community against
membership, could lead to a major split, involving violence or at worst,
civil war. In that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to
intervene; a decision Russia does not want to have to face." (Cable:
08MOSCOW265_a)

Around the same time, the US was toying with the idea of setting up a
missile defence system in Poland. The Polish government was pushing for
this, not so much because it would have protected Poland from missiles,
but because it would have established a permanent military presence of
the US in the country.

The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in July 2008 --- using
the same words as Putin had in January --- stating that if the project
goes ahead, "we will be forced to react not with diplomatic, but with
military-technical methods". The Polish project was supposedly
defensive, and not directed against Russia, but that was just words.

The question of the positioning of missile systems has a history. The US
and their allies like to pretend that posting of US soldiers or missiles
in Eastern Europe is not an aggressive move at all.

But the US has long held the Monroe doctrine, declaring the whole of the
Americas a no-go zone for other imperialist powers. We don't have to
imagine what the US would have thought if one of their adversaries were
to put troops and missiles in, let's say, the Caribbean.

We already know what their reaction would have been. During the Cuban
Missile Crisis, the US threatened nuclear war over the presence of
Soviet missiles and troops on Cuba. One could imagine what they would
have said if the Chinese placed troops and missiles in Cuba or in Mexico
today.

The [**continued provocations** of NATO pushed Russia]{.underline} and
Putin [to draw a line in the sand]{.underline}. They utilised the
unresolved conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia to [launch an
invasion of Georgia]{.underline}.

The war lasted 12 days, and ended with Georgia being forced to accept
the de facto independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Although this
was never part of the formal agreement, it also effectively prevented
Georgia from continuing its path to NATO membership.

This could have been the end of it, but the West had not yet given up
its hopes of expanding its sphere of influence. Certain concessions were
indeed made; the Polish missile base plan was dropped, for example.
However, another serious flashpoint was to occur in Ukraine --- a
flashpoint which was really the prelude to the present war.

The Maidan movement

In 2013, Ukrainian President Yanukovich was negotiating trade agreements
with Europe. Yanukovich played the role of attempting to balance between
Russia and the West. He had negotiated an association agreement with the
EU, but this threatened Ukraine's relationship with Russia.

Putin opposed the association agreement, correctly seeing it as an
attempt to pull Ukraine closer into the orbit of the EU. Oligarchs from
Eastern Ukraine sided with Putin, fearing the loss of the Russian
market. Putin instead offered trilateral negotiations between the EU,
the IMF, and Russia, but such an offer was rejected by the EU.

This was clearly a take-it-or-leave-it question for the EU, which was
not keen on supporting the ailing Ukrainian economy. Its promise of
\$1bn was paltry, and would have done little. Russia was offering
\$15bn. No wonder Yanukovich went with the latter.

Angela Merkel commented on the Russian opposition to the deal that "the
Cold War is over". But the actions of both the Russian government and
the West proved that the opposite was the case. She further remarked to
Yanukovych that they "had expected more" from him.

For some time, the association with the European Union had been dangled
by the West as a carrot. The promises of easy access to the labour
market in the West, investments, etc., led a layer of the population to
come out onto the streets in favour of the agreement in November 2013.
This was cultivated by EU leaders.

As would be shown by subsequent events, the EU had no intention of
providing Ukraine with full EU membership. They were happy to peel
Ukraine away from Russia, even at the cost of civil war. But they did
not want to provide any serious support.

Even now, the EU leaders are opposed to Ukraine joining, however the EU
Parliament votes. If Ukraine was to join the EU, they would have access
to the EU budget and visa-free travel. This, the EU leaders are not the
least bit interested in.

However, as the protests developed, they were happy to defend the right
of Ukraine to join the EU. The German Foreign Minister, Westerwelle,
said that the rallies in support of the accession agreement showed that
"the heart of the Ukrainian people beats in a European way". But this
didn't mean that they would be allowed to join the EU.

As the protest developed, the US got involved. On 3 December White House
Press Secretary Jay Carney stated:

"Violence and intimidation should have no place in today's Ukraine. We
continue to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian people to achieve a
prosperous European democracy. European integration is the surest course
to economic growth and to strengthening Ukraine\'s democracy."

But the more aggressive wing of the US bourgeois wanted to go still
further. Senator John McCain made several bellicose statements and
visited the Maidan protests, giving a speech there on 15 December. A
coup was being prepared.

An audio recording of a conversation between the US Secretary of State
and the US ambassador to Ukraine was posted on Youtube, most likely by
Russian intelligence. It is clear evidence that the US was involved in
planning the removal of Yanukovych.

The aim of the US involvement was clear: install a government friendly
to the West that would sign the EU accession agreement and continue to
advocate for Ukraine's inclusion in NATO.

It's doubtful whether the intention was ever to let them join, but they
certainly aimed to continue dangling the hope of economic prosperity (in
the form of EU membership) and military security (in the form of NATO
membership) in front of the eyes of the Ukrainians.

The coup duly took place on 22 February 2014. The new regime wasted no
time in proclaiming their anti-Russian intentions. The day after, 23
February, the Ukrainian Parliament repealed Russian minority language
laws. One month after the coup, they signed the accession agreement.

In the process of mobilising against Yanukovich, the imperialists and
the pro-western Ukrainian oligarchs revived the ghost of the
Nazi-collaborating fascist groups of the Second World War, and neo-nazis
provided the shock battalions of the Maidan protests.

As we have seen, the new regime incorporated the legacy of the Nazi
collaborators in its institutions, including the chant "Glory to
Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!", which even became the official chant of
the Ukrainian army. Disgustingly, it has also been taken up by western
liberals over the past few weeks.

The reaction of Putin and the Russian government was predictably
hostile. The new government posed a threat to the Russian naval base in
Sevastopol, in particular. And within a month, Putin had annexed Crimea
to secure Russian access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

He also backed --- initially reluctantly, and eventually forcefully ---
the separatist rebels in the Donbas, particularly on the two occasions
when it looked like the Ukrainian army was about to defeat them.

Ironically, the achievement of the Ukrainian nationalist movement has
been the loss of three important regions of Ukraine. All this was
clearly encouraged, from start to finish, by the US; and also, somewhat
more reluctantly, by the EU.

NATO's continued meddling

In 2017 and 2020, NATO added two more countries that were formerly part
of the Russian sphere of influence to its alliance: Montenegro and
Macedonia. In and of itself, these additions were not decisive. But they
demonstrated that NATO was prepared to continue its expansion, even
possibly to Ukraine.

The [US]{.underline} and the EU [continued to incite Ukraine against
Russia]{.underline}. They were encouraged to [break the Minsk II
agreement]{.underline}, which the Ukrainian nationalists had opposed
from the start. New drones were provided to Ukraine by Turkey, and the
[US]{.underline} were [supplying Javelin **anti-tank
missiles**]{.underline}. Basically, they were preparing for another
offensive in the Donbas.

As late as January this year, the secretary of Ukraine's National
Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, declared:

"The fulfilment of the Minsk agreement means the country's destruction.
When they were signed under the Russian gun barrel --- and the German
and the French watched --- it was already clear for all rational people
that it's impossible to implement those documents."

The Ukrainian government continued its hostility towards the
Russian-speaking minority. In 2019, Zelensky introduced a language law
mandating the use of Ukrainian language in the service industry and for
tuition in schools.

It was now punishable by law for a waiter to greet someone in Russian,
unless the customer had specifically requested this. Similarly, schools
that had been conducting their tuition in Russia were now banned from
doing so. It was yet another provocation against the Russian minority
--- and Russia.

And the pressure was kept up. In the spring of 2021, [NATO
held]{.underline} a [**massive exercise** called]{.underline} '[Defender
Europe 2021]{.underline}', including manoeuvres in all the Baltic States
and Poland. Ukraine was one of 26 participating countries.

According to the US army, the exercise "demonstrates our ability to
serve as a strategic security partner in the western Balkans and Black
Sea regions while sustaining our abilities in northern Europe, the
Caucasus, Ukraine and Africa". Basically, all the areas that Russia and
the West are disputing.

[NATO]{.underline} would, of course, [claim this was not
hostile]{.underline} to Russia. [But]{.underline} their [exercises were
about as]{.underline} '[friendly]{.underline}' [as]{.underline} the
[Russian exercises in Belarus]{.underline} before the invasion. The
exercises also included US B1 bombers skirting Russian airspace, pushing
Russia to scramble fighters in response.

In the summer of 2021, the British government also sent a warship, HMS
Defender, into Russian territorial waters, south of Crimea. They were
there to "make a point", which was that Britain does not recognise
Crimea as Russian, referring to it as "Ukrainian waters".

In October, the [US]{.underline} once again [flew bombers around Russian
airpsace]{.underline}, this time in the Black Sea. Then, in September,
[under the guise of]{.underline} '[Partnership for Peace]{.underline}',
NATO held exercises in Ukraine involving US troops.

Furthermore, NATO countries undertook an effort to train the Ukrainian
armed forces. Using the Yavoriv Military Training ground, between Lviv
and the Polish border --- also known by the Orwellian name of the
International Center for Peacekeeping and Security --- since 2015, NATO
trainers have been shaping the Ukrainian army to NATO standards,
including the neo-nazi batallions which are part of the National Guard.
This is the military base which was destroyed by Russian bombardment on
12 March.

The whole intention of these exercises, flights, training, etc., is
clear. NATO was not even that circumspect about it. They wished to prove
their willingness to move troops in Eastern Europe, to prepare for war
with Russia, and to support Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.

Of course, as events have shown, [NATO has no intention of **actually
fighting** a war]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} they [wanted to send a
signal]{.underline}.

Zeeshan Aleem, a columnist at MSNBC expressed it pretty well: "By
dangling the possibility of Ukraine's NATO membership for years but
never fulfilling it, NATO created a scenario that emboldened Ukraine to
act tough and buck Russia --- without any intention of directly
defending Ukraine with its firepower if Moscow decided Ukraine had gone
too far."

Professor Maerskheimer put it rather more bluntly back in 2015: "The
[West is leading Ukraine down the **Primrose Path** and]{.underline} the
end result is that [Ukraine is going to get wrecked]{.underline}." He
added:

"What we're doing is encouraging the Ukrainians to play tough on Russia.
What we're doing is encouraging the Ukrainians to think that they will
ultimately become part of the West because we will ultimately defeat
Putin and we will ultimately get our way."

The [end result of **playing hardball** with Russia is]{.underline} that
[Ukraine is now being **destroyed**]{.underline}.

Whether western leaders like Biden and Johnson actually imagined that
Russia would invade Ukraine, we cannot know --- but they were clearly
prepared to risk it.

They were on their high horse throughout the autumn and the winter,
defending Ukraine's right to join NATO, much as they had been defending
Ukraine's right to join the EU. Or maybe, more specifically: their right
to apply to join --- because so far there is no plan of actually giving
them membership of either organisation.

Who is responsible?

With over two million refugees fleeing the country, and with most of
Ukraine's cities under siege and bombardment, many are asking
themselves: who is responsible for this?

The West blames Putin, speculating that he may have gone mad. But if you
look beyond the headlines, this [conflict]{.underline} is [only the
rising to the surface of]{.underline} the [antagonism between Russia
and]{.underline} the countries of [NATO]{.underline}.

[Western imperialism]{.underline} has been [constantly attempting to
**push forward**]{.underline} the [boundaries of NATO]{.underline} and
the EU. When it has done so, Russia has persistently explained that this
was unacceptable. It even threatened to use force.

When threats weren't successful, the Russians actually used force, as in
Georgia, in the conflict in Donbas, and in Syria. It was abundantly
clear that Russia was prepared to use military measures to enforce its
interests.

The [West]{.underline} probably didn't know how far they could push
Putin. But they were [prepared to gamble with]{.underline} the [lives of
the **Ukrainian people**]{.underline} that Putin was bluffing. They
[**persistently provoked** Russia]{.underline}. And now the people of
Ukraine are paying the price.

This winter, the US could have offered some concessions. The truth of
the matter is that the US and the EU were not ready to give Ukraine
formal status in NATO or the European Union. They had no such
intentions. Something could have been agreed. Putin was asking for
assurances in writing, as verbal ones seem to have little value.

Instead, Biden, Johnson, and Macron got on their high horse, talking
about 'Ukrainian sovereignty', 'their right to join NATO', etc. They
were also urging the Ukrainian government to take a hard line. "Go
ahead, we're behind you" was the message. This, far from reassuring the
Russians, was likely to have made them rather more concerned.

Only Macron and Scholtz seem to have had second thoughts, fearing the
cost of millions of refugees, the bill for the reconstruction of
Ukraine, and, of course, the threat to the European oil and gas
supplies.

The West's attitude was, and continues to be, that they're prepared to
fight to the last drop of blood for Ukraine's right to join NATO --- the
last drop of Ukrainian blood, that is.

There is, of course, nothing progressive about the Russian invasion. The
talk about fighting Nazis, although undoubtedly quite popular in Russia,
is merely a smokescreen. The effect of this invasion is, at least
temporarily, to strengthen reactionary forces on all sides. It also
threatens to foment deep divisions between Russian and Ukrainian
workers.

Nonetheless, [to see this as]{.underline} just a [Russian invasion of
Ukraine is **quite wrong**]{.underline}, [and serves to cover
up]{.underline} the [role]{.underline} that [NATO played and continues
to play in **stoking up tensions**]{.underline}. Far from being a
defensive alliance, it is an alliance primarily directed against Russia
in Eastern Europe, which continues to push its boundaries closer and
closer.

[NATO]{.underline}, as well as the EU, is [a means of furthering
**western interests** in Eastern Europe]{.underline},
[against]{.underline} those of [Russia]{.underline} --- [and
China]{.underline}, if it comes to that.

The [war in Ukraine]{.underline} is precisely [about]{.underline} the
[level of influence that NATO]{.underline} countries --- primarily the
US, Britain, France and Germany --- are [to have over
Ukraine]{.underline}. As the [alliance]{.underline} is [unwilling to
commit its own troops]{.underline} to the fight, it is therefore being
[played out as a **proxy war**]{.underline} between the Russian army and
the Ukrainian army, [funded and supplied by NATO countries]{.underline}.

From this, we can also deduce that [this is]{.underline} not at all [a
war]{.underline} about Ukraine's 'right to self-determination', or its
'sovereignty', but [about **which imperial power** should dominate
it]{.underline}. Is Ukraine to be under Russian domination or western
domination? Or can they carve up some kind of deal about the mutual
exploitation of the country?

They failed to resolve this question through diplomatic means, and so
now they are attempting to settle it through the force of arms. As
Clausewitz said: "[War is the **continuation of politics**]{.underline}
by other means."

#### [American imperialism]{.underline} is the [taproot]{.underline} of the Ukraine war. Absent the alternative, [nuclear war]{.underline} is [inevitable]{.underline}.

The war in Ukraine is a multi-dimensional disaster, which is likely to
get much worse in the foreseeable future. When a war is successful,
little attention is paid to its causes, but when the outcome is
disastrous, understanding how it happened becomes paramount. People want
to know: how did we get into this terrible situation?

I have witnessed this phenomenon twice in my lifetime---first with the
Vietnam war and second with the Iraq war. In both cases, Americans
wanted to know how their country could have miscalculated so badly.
Given that the United States and its NATO allies played a crucial role
in the events that led to the Ukraine war---and are now playing a
central role in the conduct of that war---it is appropriate to evaluate
the West's responsibility for this calamity.

I will make two main arguments today.

First, [[the United States is]{.mark} **principally
[responsible]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **[causing]{.mark}** the
[Ukraine]{.mark} crisis]{.underline}. [This is not to deny]{.underline}
that [Putin **started** the war]{.underline} and that he is responsible
for Russia's conduct of the war. Nor is it to deny that America's allies
bear some responsibility, but they largely follow Washington's lead on
Ukraine. [My **central claim** is that the United States has pushed
forward policies toward Ukraine that Putin and other Russian leaders see
as an **existential threat**, a point they have made repeatedly for
**many years**]{.underline}. Specifically, [I am talking about
[America's **obsession**]{.mark} [with]{.mark} bringing Ukraine into
NATO and [making it a **Western bulwark**]{.mark}]{.underline} on
Russia's border. The Biden administration was unwilling to eliminate
that threat through diplomacy and indeed in 2021 recommitted the United
States to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Putin responded by invading
Ukraine on February 24th of this year.

Second, [the Biden administration has reacted to the outbreak of war by
**doubling down** against Russia. Washington and its Western allies are
committed to **decisively defeating** Russia in Ukraine]{.underline} and
employing comprehensive sanctions to greatly weaken Russian power. [[The
United States is not]{.mark} seriously [interested in finding a
**diplomatic** solution]{.mark} to the war, [which means the war is
likely to]{.mark} **[drag on]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} months if not [[years]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In the process, [Ukraine, which has already **suffered grievously**, is
going to experience even **greater harm**]{.underline}. In essence[, the
United States is helping lead Ukraine down the **primrose
path**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [there is a **danger** that [the war
will **escalate**]{.mark}, as [NATO might get **dragged in**]{.mark}to
the fighting [and **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** [might be
used]{.mark}. We are living in **perilous times**]{.underline}.

Let me now lay out my argument in greater detail, starting with a
description of the conventional wisdom about the causes of the Ukraine
conflict.

The Conventional Wisdom

[It is widely]{.underline} and firmly [believed]{.underline} in the West
[that Putin is **solely responsible**]{.underline} for causing the
Ukraine crisis and certainly the ongoing war. [He is said to have
**imperial ambitions**]{.underline}, which is to say he is bent on
conquering Ukraine and other countries as well---all for the purpose of
creating a greater Russia that bears some resemblance to the former
Soviet Union. In other words, Ukraine is Putin's first target, but not
his last. As one scholar put it, he is "acting on a sinister, long-held
goal: to erase Ukraine from the map of the world." Given
[[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} purported goals, it makes perfect sense
for Finland and Sweden to join NATO and for the alliance to increase its
force levels in eastern Europe. **[[Imperial
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, after all, must be contained.

[While this narrative is repeated over and over]{.underline} in the
mainstream media and by virtually every Western leader, [[there is **no
ev**]{.mark}**idence** [to support it]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the
extent that purveyors of the conventional wisdom provide evidence, it
has little if any bearing on Putin's motives for invading Ukraine. For
example, some emphasize that he said that Ukraine is an "artificial
state" or not a "real state." Such opaque comments, however, say nothing
about his reason for going to war. The same is true of Putin's statement
that he views Russians and Ukrainians as "one people" with a common
history. Others point out that he called the collapse of the Soviet
Union "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century." Of course,
Putin also said, "Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart.
Whoever wants it back has no brain." Still, others point to a speech in
which he declared that "Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia
or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia." But as he went
on to say in that very same speech, in reference to Ukraine's
independence today: "Of course, we cannot change past events, but we
must at least admit them openly and honestly."

To make the case that Putin was bent on conquering all of Ukraine and
incorporating it into Russia, it is necessary to provide evidence that
first, he thought it was a desirable goal, that second, he thought it
was a feasible goal, and third, he intended to pursue that goal. [There
is no evidence in the public record that Putin was **contemplating**,
**much less intending** to put an end to Ukraine as an independent state
and make it part of greater Russia]{.underline} when he sent his troops
into Ukraine on February 24th.

In fact, [there is **significant evidence** that [Putin recognized
Ukraine as]{.mark} an **[independent]{.mark} country**]{.underline}. [In
his]{.underline} July 12, 2021, [article about Russian-Ukrainian
relations]{.underline}, which proponents of the conventional wisdom
often point to as evidence of his imperial ambitions, [he tells the
Ukrainian people]{.underline}, "[You want to establish a state of your
own: you are welcome]{.underline}!" [Regarding how Russia should treat
Ukraine, he writes]{.underline}, "[There is only one answer: with
respect]{.underline}." He concludes that lengthy article with the
following words: "And what Ukraine will be---it is up to its citizens to
decide." It is hard to reconcile these statements with the claim that he
wants to incorporate Ukraine within a greater Russia.

In that same July 12, 2021, article and again in an important speech he
gave on February 21st of this year, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts
"the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of
the USSR." He reiterated that same point for a third time on February
24th, when he announced that Russia would invade Ukraine. In particular,
[he declared that]{.underline} "[It is not our plan to occupy Ukrainian
territory]{.underline}" [and made it **clear** that he respected
Ukrainian sovereignty, but only **up to a point**]{.underline}:
"[[Russia cannot feel **safe**]{.mark}, develop, and exist [while facing
a **permanent threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
the territory of today's [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}." In essence,
[Putin was **not interested** in making Ukraine a part of Russia; he was
interested in making sure it did not become a
"**springboard**]{.underline}" [for **Western aggression** against
Russia]{.underline}, a subject I will say more about shortly.

[One might argue that Putin was lying about his motives]{.underline},
that he was attempting to disguise his imperial ambitions. As it turns
out, I have written a book about lying in international politics---Why
Leaders Lie: The Truth about Lying in International Politics---and [[it
is **clear**]{.mark} to me that [Putin was **not
lying**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For starters, [one of my **principal
findings** is that leaders **do not lie much** to **each
other**]{.underline}; they lie more often to their own publics.
[Regarding Putin,]{.underline} whatever one thinks of him, [he does not
have a **history** of lying to other leaders]{.underline}. Although some
assert that he frequently lies and cannot be trusted, [there is **little
evidence** of him lying to **foreign audiences**]{.underline}. Moreover,
[he has **publicly spelled out** his thinking about Ukraine on
**numerous occasions**]{.underline} over the past two years [and he has
**consistently emphasized** that his principal concern is **Ukraine's
relations** with the West, especially **NATO**]{.underline}. [He has
never once hinted that he wants to make Ukraine part of
Russia]{.underline}. [If this behavior is all part of a **giant
deception** campaign, it would be without precedent in recorded
history]{.underline}.

[Perhaps [the **best indicator**]{.mark} that Putin is not bent on
conquering]{.underline} and absorbing [Ukraine [is the]{.mark}
**[military strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} Moscow has employed from the
start of the campaign. The Russian military did not attempt [to conquer
all of Ukraine]{.underline}. That [would have required a **classic
blitzkrieg** strategy that aimed at **quickly overrunning** all of
Ukraine]{.underline} with armored forces supported by tactical airpower.
That strategy was not feasible, however, because [there were **only**
190,000 soldiers in [Russia's invading army]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark}
**[far too small]{.mark}** a force [to]{.mark} **[vanquish]{.mark}** and
**occupy** Ukraine, which is not only [the]{.mark} **[largest
country]{.mark}** [between the **Atlantic Ocean** and
**Russia**]{.mark}, but also has a population over **40
million**]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, the Russians pursued a limited
aims strategy, which focused on either capturing or threatening Kiev and
conquering a large swath of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine.
In short, Russia did not have the capability to subdue all of Ukraine,
much less conquer other countries in eastern Europe.

As Ramzy Mardini observed, another telling indicator of Putin's limited
aims is that [there is no evidence Russia was preparing a puppet
government for Ukraine]{.underline}, cultivating pro-Russian leaders in
Kyiv, or pursuing any political measures that would make it possible to
occupy the entire country and eventually integrate it into Russia.

To take this argument a step further, [Putin and other [Russian
leaders]{.mark} surely [understand]{.mark} from the **Cold War** that
[occupying counties]{.mark} in the age of nationalism [is]{.mark}
invariably [a prescription for]{.mark} **[never-ending
trouble]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Soviet experience in
**Afghanistan** is a **glaring example** of this
phenomenon]{.underline}, but more relevant for the issue at hand is
Moscow's relations with its allies in eastern Europe. The Soviet Union
maintained a huge military presence in that region and was involved in
the politics of almost every country located there. Those allies,
however, were a frequent thorn in Moscow's side. The Soviet Union put
down a major insurrection in East Germany in 1953, and then invaded
Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 to keep them in line. There
was serious trouble in Poland in 1956, 1970, and again in 1980-1981.
Although Polish authorities dealt with these events, they served as a
reminder that intervention might be necessary. Albania, Romania, and
Yugoslavia routinely caused Moscow trouble, but Soviet leaders tended to
tolerate their misbehavior, because their location made them less
important for deterring NATO.

What about contemporary Ukraine? It is obvious from Putin's July 12,
2021, essay that he understood at that time that Ukrainian nationalism
is a powerful force and that the civil war in the Donbass, which had
been going on since 2014, had done much to poison relations between
Russia and Ukraine. He surely knew that Russia's invasion force would
not be welcomed with open arms by Ukrainians, and that it would be a
Herculean task for Russia to subjugate Ukraine if it had the necessary
forces to conquer the entire country, which it did not.

Finally, it is worth noting that hardly anyone made the argument that
Putin had imperial ambitions from the time he took the reins of power in
2000 until the Ukraine crisis first broke out on February 22, 2014. In
fact, the Russian leader was an invited guest to the April 2008 NATO
summit in Bucharest where the alliance announced that Ukraine and
Georgia would eventually become members. Putin's opposition to that
announcement had hardly any effect on Washington because Russia was
judged to be too weak to stop further NATO enlargement, just as it had
been too weak to stop the 1999 and 2004 waves of expansion.

Relatedly, it is important to note that NATO expansion before February
2014 was not aimed at containing Russia. Given the sad state of Russian
military power, Moscow was in no position to pursue revanchist policies
in eastern Europe. Tellingly, former U.S. ambassador to Moscow Michael
McFaul notes that Putin's seizure of the Crimea was not planned before
the crisis broke out in 2014; it was an impulsive move in response to
the coup that overthrew Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. In short NATO
enlargement was not intended to contain a Russian threat but was instead
part of a broader policy to spread the liberal international order into
eastern Europe and make the entire continent look like western Europe.

It was only when the Ukraine crisis broke out in February 2014 that the
United States and its allies suddenly began describing Putin as a
dangerous leader with imperial ambitions and Russia as a serious
military threat that had to be contained. What caused this shift? This
new rhetoric was designed to serve one essential purpose: to enable the
West to blame Putin for the outbreak of trouble in Ukraine. And now that
the crisis has turned into a full-scale war, it is imperative to make
sure he alone is blamed for this disastrous turn of events. This blame
game explains why Putin is now widely portrayed as an imperialist here
in the West, even though there is hardly any evidence to support that
perspective.

Let me now turn to the real cause of the Ukraine crisis.

The Real Cause of the Trouble

[[The]{.mark} **tap[root]{.mark}** of the crisis [is the]{.mark}
**American-led** [effort]{.mark} [to make Ukraine a]{.mark} **Western
[bulwark]{.mark}** [on Russia's borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. That
strategy has three prongs: integrating Ukraine into the EU, [turning
Ukraine into a pro-Western **liberal democracy**]{.underline}, [and
**most importantly**, incorporating Ukraine into **NATO**]{.underline}.
[The strategy was set in motion at NATO's annual summit in]{.underline}
Bucharest in April [2008, when the alliance announced that
Ukraine]{.underline} and Georgia ["will become members]{.underline}."
[[Russia]{.mark}n leaders responded immediately with
**outrage**]{.underline}, making it clear that [they [saw this]{.mark}
decision [as an **existential threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and they
had no intention of letting either country join NATO. [According to a
respected Russian journalist, Putin "**flew into a rage**]{.underline},"
[and warned that]{.underline} "[if Ukraine joins NATO, it will do so
without Crimea and the eastern regions. It will simply **fall
apart**]{.underline}."

William Burns, who is now the head of the CIA, but was the US ambassador
to Moscow at the time of the Bucharest summit, wrote a memo to
then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that succinctly describes
Russian thinking about this matter. In his words: "[Ukrainian entry into
NATO is the brightest of **all red lines**]{.underline} [for the Russian
elite]{.underline} ([not just Putin]{.underline}). [In more than two and
a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from
knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin's
**sharpest liberal critics**, I have yet to find anyone who views
Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a **direct
challenge**]{.underline} [to Russian interests]{.underline}."
[NATO]{.underline}, he said, "[would be seen]{.underline} ... [as
throwing down the **strategic gauntlet**]{.underline}. Today's **[Russia
will respond]{.underline}**. [Russian-Ukrainian relations will go into a
**deep freeze**]{.underline}\...[It will create fertile soil for
**Russian meddling** in]{.underline} Crimea and [eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}."

Burns, of course, was not the only policymaker who understood that
bringing Ukraine into NATO was fraught with danger. Indeed, at the
Bucharest Summit, both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy opposed moving forward on NATO membership for
Ukraine because they understood it would alarm and anger Russia. Merkel
recently explained her opposition: "I was very sure ... that Putin is
not going to just let that happen. From his perspective, that would be a
declaration of war."

The Bush administration, however, cared little about Moscow's "brightest
of red lines" and pressured the French and German leaders to agree to
issuing a public pronouncement declaring that Ukraine and Georgia would
eventually join the alliance.

Unsurprisingly, [the American-led effort to integrate Georgia into NATO
resulted in a war between Georgia and Russia]{.underline} in August
2008---four months after the Bucharest summit. Nevertheless, the United
States and its allies continued moving forward with their plans to make
Ukraine a Western bastion on Russia's borders. These efforts eventually
sparked a major crisis [in]{.underline} February [2014]{.underline},
after [[a **US**-supported]{.mark} [**uprising** caused Ukraine's
**pro-Russian** president]{.mark}]{.underline} Viktor Yanukovych [[to
flee]{.mark} the country]{.underline}. He was replaced by pro-American
Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. [**[In response]{.mark}**, [Russia
seized Crimea]{.mark} from Ukraine]{.underline} and helped fuel a civil
war between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government in the
Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.

One often hears the argument that in the eight years between when the
crisis broke out in February 2014 and when the war began in February
2022, the United States and its allies paid little attention to bringing
Ukraine into NATO. In effect, the issue had been taken off the table,
and thus NATO enlargement could not have been an important cause of the
escalating crisis in 2021 and the subsequent outbreak of war earlier
this year. This line of argument is false. In fact, [[the Western
response]{.mark} to the events of 2014 [was to **double
down**]{.mark}]{.underline} [on the existing strategy [and draw
Ukraine]{.mark} **even [closer]{.mark}** to NATO. [The alliance began
**training**]{.mark} [the Ukrainian military]{.mark}]{.underline} in
2014, [averaging **10,000** trained troops annually over the next eight
years]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} December [2017, the Trump
administration decided to provide Kyiv with]{.underline} "defensive
**[weapons]{.underline}**." [Other NATO countries soon got into the
act]{.underline}, shipping even more weapons to Ukraine.

[Ukraine's military also began participating in **joint military
exercises** with NATO forces. In July 2021, Kyiv and Washington
co-hosted Operation Sea Breeze, a naval exercise in the Black Sea that
included navies from 31 countries and was **directly aimed** at
Russia]{.underline}. [Two months later in September 2021, the Ukrainian
army led Rapid Trident 21]{.underline}, which the U.S. Army described as
an "annual exercise designed [to enhance
**interoperability**]{.underline} among allied and partner nations, to
demonstrate units are poised and ready to respond to any crisis." NATO's
effort to arm and train Ukraine's military explains in good part why it
has fared so well against Russian forces in the ongoing war. As a
headline in The Wall Street Journal put it, "The Secret of Ukraine's
Military Success: Years of NATO Training."

In addition to NATO's ongoing efforts to make the Ukrainian military a
more formidable fighting force, the politics surrounding Ukraine's
membership in NATO and its integration into the West changed in 2021.
There was renewed enthusiasm for pursuing those goals in both Kyiv and
Washington. [President [Zelensky]{.mark}, who had never shown much
enthusiasm for bringing Ukraine into NATO]{.underline} and who was
elected in March 2019 on a platform that called for working with Russia
to settle the ongoing crisis, [**reversed course** [in]{.mark} early
[2021]{.mark} and not only **[embraced]{.mark}** [NATO expansion]{.mark}
but also adopted a **hardline approach** toward Moscow]{.underline}. He
made a series of moves---including shutting down pro-Russian TV stations
and charging a close friend of Putin with treason---[that were sure to
**anger** Moscow]{.underline}.

President [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}, [who moved in]{.underline}to the
White House [in January 2021, had long been committed to bringing
Ukraine into NATO and [was also **super-hawkish**]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}ward [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, on June
14, 2021, NATO issued the following communiqué at its annual summit in
Brussels:

We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine
will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan
(MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of
that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each
partner will be judged on its own merits. We stand firm in our support
for Ukraine's right to decide its own future and foreign policy course
free from outside interference.

[On September 1, 2021, Zelensky visited the White House, where Biden
made it clear that the United States was]{.underline} "**[firmly
committed]{.underline}**" [to]{.underline} "**[Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic
aspirations]{.underline}**." [Then on November 10, 2021]{.underline},
Secretary of State Antony [Blinken]{.underline}, and his Ukrainian
counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, [signed an important
document]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} "[US-Ukraine **Charter** on
Strategic Partnership]{.underline}." [The aim of both
parties]{.underline}, the document stated, [is to]{.underline}
"[underscore]{.underline} ... [a commitment to Ukraine's implementation
of the deep and **comprehensive reforms**]{.underline} [necessary for
**full integration**]{.underline} [into European and Euro-Atlantic
institutions]{.underline}." That document explicitly builds not just on
"the commitments made to strengthen the Ukraine-U.S. strategic
partnership by Presidents Zelensky and Biden," but also reaffirms the
U.S. commitment to the "2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration."

In short, [there is **little doubt** that starting in early 2021 Ukraine
began **moving rapidly** toward joining NATO]{.underline}. Even so, some
supporters of this policy argue that Moscow should not have been
concerned, because "NATO is a defensive alliance and poses no threat to
Russia." But that is not how Putin and other Russian leaders think about
NATO and it is what they think that matters. There is no question that
Ukraine joining NATO remained the "brightest of red lines" for Moscow.

To deal with this growing threat, Putin stationed ever-increasing
numbers of Russian troops on Ukraine's border between February 2021 and
February 2022. His aim was to coerce Biden and Zelensky into altering
course and halting their efforts to integrate Ukraine into the West. On
December 17, 2021, Moscow sent separate letters to the Biden
administration and NATO demanding a written guarantee that: 1) Ukraine
would not join NATO, 2) no offensive weapons would be stationed near
Russia's borders, and 3) NATO troops and equipment moved into eastern
Europe since 1997 would be moved back to western Europe.

[Putin made **numerous public statements** during this period that left
**no doubt** that he viewed NATO expansion into Ukraine as an
existential threat. Speaking to the Defense Ministry Board on December
21, 2021, he stated]{.underline}: "what they are doing, or trying or
planning to do in [Ukraine]{.underline}, is not happening thousands of
kilometers away from our national border. It [is on the **doorstep** of
our house]{.underline}. They must understand that [we simply have
**nowhere further to retreat** to]{.underline}. Do they really think we
do not see these threats? Or [do they think that we will just stand
**idly watching** threats to Russia emerge]{.underline}?" [Two months
later at a press conference on February 22, 2022, **just days** before
the war started, Putin said]{.underline}: "[We are **categorically
opposed**]{.underline} [to Ukraine joining NATO because this poses a
threat to us]{.underline}, and we have arguments to support this. I have
repeatedly spoken about it in this hall." He then made it clear that he
recognized that Ukraine was becoming a de facto member of NATO. [The
United States and its allies, he said,]{.underline} "[continue to
pum]{.underline}p the current Kiev [authorities full of **modern** types
of **weapons**]{.underline}." He went on to say that [if this was not
stopped, Moscow]{.underline} "[would be left with an 'anti-Russia'
**armed to the teeth**]{.underline}. [This is **totally
unacceptable**]{.underline}."

Putin's logic should make perfect sense to Americans, who have long been
committed to the Monroe Doctrine, which stipulates that no distant great
power is allowed to place any of its military forces in the Western
Hemisphere.

I might note that in all of Putin's public statements during the months
leading up to the war, there is not a scintilla of evidence that he was
contemplating conquering Ukraine and making it part of Russia, much less
attacking additional countries in eastern Europe. [Other Russian
**leaders**]{.underline}---[including the **defense minister**, the
**foreign minister**, the **deputy foreign minister**, and the Russian
**ambassador to Washington**]{.underline}---[also emphasized the
**centrality** of NATO expansion for causing the Ukraine
crisis]{.underline}. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point
succinctly at a press conference on January 14, 2022, when he said,
"[[the **key to everything**]{.mark} [is the **guarantee**]{.mark} [that
NATO will not expand]{.mark} eastward]{.underline}."

Nevertheless, [the efforts of]{.underline} Lavrov and
[Putin]{.underline} to get the United States and its allies to abandon
their efforts to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's border
**[failed completely]{.underline}**. Secretary of State Antony [Blinken
responded]{.underline} to Russia's mid-December demands by simply
saying, "[There is **no change**]{.underline}. There will be no change."
[Putin then launched an invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine to eliminate
the threat he saw from NATO.

Where Are We Now & Where Are We Going?

The Ukraine war has been raging for almost four months I would like to
now offer some observations about what has happened so far and where the
war might be headed. I will address three specific issues: 1) the
consequences of the war for Ukraine; 2) the prospects for
escalation---to include nuclear escalation; and 3) the prospects for
ending the war in the foreseeable future.

[This war is an **unmitigated disaster** for Ukraine]{.underline}. As I
noted earlier, Putin made it clear in 2008 that Russia would wreck
Ukraine to prevent it from joining NATO. He is delivering on that
promise. Russian forces have conquered 20 percent of Ukrainian territory
and destroyed or badly damaged many Ukrainian cities and towns. More
than 6.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country, while more than 8
million have been internally displaced. Many thousands of
Ukrainians---including innocent civilians---are dead or badly wounded
and the Ukrainian economy is in shambles. The World Bank estimates that
Ukraine's economy will shrink by almost 50 percent over the course of
2022. Estimates are that approximately 100 billion dollars' worth of
damage has been inflicted on Ukraine and that it will take close to a
trillion dollars to rebuild the country. In the meantime, Kyiv requires
about \$5 billion of aid every month just to keep the government
running.

Furthermore, there appears to be little hope that Ukraine will be able
to regain use of its ports on the Azov and Black Seas anytime soon.
Before the war, roughly 70 percent of all Ukrainian exports and
imports---and 98 percent of its grain exports---moved through these
ports. This is the basic situation after less than 4 months of fighting.
It is downright scary to contemplate what Ukraine will look like if this
war drags on for a few more years.

So, what are the prospects for negotiating a peace agreement and ending
the war in the next few months? I am sorry to say that I see no way this
war ends anytime soon, a view shared by prominent policymakers like
General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the JCS, and NATO Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg. [The main reason for my pessimism is that both Russia
and the United States are **deeply committed** to winning the war and it
is **impossible** to fashion an agreement where **both sides
win**]{.underline}. To be more specific, [[the **key** to a
settlement]{.mark} from Russia's perspective [is making Ukraine a
**neutral state**]{.mark}]{.underline}, ending the prospect of
integrating Kyiv into the West. But that outcome is unacceptable to the
Biden administration and a large portion of the American foreign policy
establishment, because it would represent a victory for Russia.

Ukrainian leaders have agency of course, and one might hope that they
will push for neutralization to spare their country further harm.
Indeed, Zelensky briefly mentioned this possibility in the early days of
the war, but he never seriously pursued it. There is little chance,
however, that Kyiv will push for neutralization, because the
ultra-nationalists in Ukraine, who wield significant political power,
have zero interest in yielding to any of Russia's demands, especially
one that dictates Ukraine's political alignment with the outside world.
The Biden administration and the countries on NATO's eastern
flank---like Poland and the Baltic states---are likely to support
Ukraine's ultra-nationalists on this issue.

To complicate matters further, how does one deal with the large swaths
of Ukrainian territory that Russia has conquered since the war started,
as well as Crimea's fate? It is hard to imagine Moscow voluntarily
giving up any of the Ukrainian territory it now occupies, much less all
of it, as Putin's territorial goals today are probably not the same ones
he had before the war. At the same time, it is equally hard to imagine
any Ukrainian leader accepting a deal that allows Russia to keep any
Ukrainian territory, except possibly Crimea. I hope I am wrong, but that
is why I see no end in sight to this ruinous war.

Let me now turn to the matter of escalation. It is widely accepted among
international relations scholars that [[there is a **powerful
tendency**]{.mark} [for protracted wars to escalate]{.mark}. **Over
time**, other countries can get **dragged in**to the fight and the level
of violence is likely to increase. The potential for this happening in
the Ukraine war is **real**]{.underline}. [[There is a
**danger**]{.mark} that [the United States and]{.mark} its [**NATO**
allies]{.mark} will [get]{.mark} **[dragged in]{.mark}**to the
fighting]{.underline}, which they have been able to avoid up to this
point, even though they are already waging a proxy war against Russia[.
There is also the possibility that **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}
[might be used]{.underline} in Ukraine [and that might even lead to a
**nuclear exchange** between **Russia** and the **United
States**]{.underline}. The underlying reason these outcomes might be
realized is that the stakes are so high for both sides, and thus neither
can afford to lose.

As I have emphasized, Putin and his lieutenants believe that Ukraine
joining the West is an existential threat to Russia that must be
eliminated. In practical terms, that means Russia must win its war in
Ukraine. Defeat is unacceptable. The Biden administration, on the other
hand, has stressed that its goal is not only to decisively defeat Russia
in Ukraine, but also to use sanctions to inflict massive damage on the
Russian economy. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has emphasized that
the West's goal is to weaken Russia to the point where it could not
invade Ukraine again. In effect, the Biden administration is committed
to knocking Russia out of the ranks of the great powers. At the same
time, President Biden himself has called Russia's war in Ukraine a
"genocide" and charged Putin with being a "war criminal" who should face
a "war crimes trial" after the war. Such rhetoric hardly lends itself to
negotiating an end to the war. After all, how do you negotiate with a
genocidal state?

American policy has two significant consequences. For starters, it
greatly amplifies the existential threat Moscow faces in this war and
makes it more important than ever that it prevails in Ukraine. At the
same time, it means the United States is deeply committed to making sure
that Russia loses. The Biden administration has now invested so much in
the Ukraine war---both materially and rhetorically---that a Russian
victory would represent a devastating defeat for Washington.

Obviously, both sides cannot win. Moreover, there is a serious
possibility that one side will begin to lose badly. [[If]{.mark}
**American policy succeeds** and the **[Russians are losing]{.mark}** to
the Ukrainians on the battlefield, Putin might turn to **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} [to rescue the situation]{.underline}. The U.S.
Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, told the Senate Armed
Services Committee in May that this was one of the two situations that
might lead Putin to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. [For those of you
who think this is unlikely]{.underline}, please remember that [NATO
planned to use nuclear weapons in **similar circumstances** during the
Cold War. If [Russia]{.mark} were to employ nuclear weapons in
Ukraine]{.underline}, it is impossible to say how the
[Biden]{.underline} administration would react, but it surely [[would be
under **great pressure**]{.mark} to retaliate, thereby [raising the
possibility of]{.mark} a **[great-power nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is a perverse paradox at play here:
[the **more successful** the United States and its allies are at
achieving their goals, the more likely it is that the war will **turn
nuclear**]{.underline}.

Let's turn the tables and ask what happens if the United States and its
NATO allies appear to be heading toward defeat, which effectively means
that the Russians are routing the Ukrainian military and the government
in Kyiv moves to negotiate a peace deal intended to save as much of the
country as possible. In that event, there would be great pressure on the
United States and its allies to get even more deeply involved in the
fighting. It is not likely, but certainly possible that American or
maybe Polish troops would get pulled into the fighting, which means NATO
would literally be at war with Russia. This is the other scenario,
according to Avril Haines, where the Russians might turn to nuclear
weapons. It is difficult to say precisely how events will play out if
this scenario comes to pass, but there is no question there will be
serious potential for escalation, to include nuclear escalation. The
mere possibility of that outcome should send shivers down your spine.

There are likely to be other disastrous consequences from this war,
which I cannot discuss in any detail because of time constraints. For
example, there is reason to think [the war will lead to a **world food
crisis** in which many millions of people will die]{.underline}. The
president of the World Bank, David Malpass, argues that if the Ukraine
war continues, [we will face a global food crisis that is a]{.underline}
"**[human catastrophe]{.underline}**."

Furthermore, relations between Russia and the West have been so
thoroughly poisoned that it will take many years to repair them. In the
meantime, that **[profound hostility]{.underline}** [will fuel
**instability** around the globe]{.underline}, but especially in Europe.
Some will say there is a silver lining: relations among countries in the
West have markedly improved because of the Ukraine war. That is true for
the moment, but there are deep fissures below the surface, and they are
bound to reassert themselves over time. For example, relations between
the countries of eastern and western Europe are likely to deteriorate as
the war drags on, because their interests and perspectives on the
conflict are not the same.

Finally, the conflict is already damaging the global economy in major
ways and this situation is likely to get worse with time. Jamie Diamond,
the CEO of JPMorgan Chase says we should brace ourselves for an economic
"hurricane." If he is right, these economic shocks will affect the
politics of every Western country, undermine liberal democracy, and
strengthen its opponents on both the left and the right. The economic
consequences of the Ukraine war will extend to countries all over the
planet, not just the West. As The UN put it in a report released just
last week: "[The **ripple effects** of the conflict are extending human
suffering **far beyond its borders**]{.underline}. The war, in all its
dimensions, has exacerbated a global cost-of-living crisis unseen in at
least a generation, compromising lives, livelihoods, and our aspirations
for a better world by 2030."

Conclusion

Simply put, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine is a colossal disaster,
which as I noted at the start of my talk, will lead people all around
the world to search for its causes. [Those who believe in **facts** and
**logic** will **quickly discover** that the United States and its
allies are **mainly responsible**]{.underline} for this train wreck.
[The]{.underline} April 2008 [decision to bring Ukraine and Georgia into
NATO was **destined** to lead to conflict with Russia]{.underline}. The
Bush administration was the principal architect of that fateful choice,
but the Obama, Trump, and Biden [administrations have **doubled down**
on that policy at every turn and America's allies have **dutifully
followed** Washington's lead]{.underline}. Even though Russian leaders
made it perfectly clear that bringing Ukraine into NATO would be
crossing "the brightest of red lines," the United States refused to
accommodate Russia's deepest security concerns and instead moved
relentlessly to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia's border.

[[The]{.mark} **tragic [truth]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} that [if the West
had not pursued NATO expansion]{.mark} into Ukraine[, it is
**unlikely**]{.mark} [there would be a war in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} today and Crimea would still be part of
Ukraine. In essence, [Washington played the **central role** in leading
Ukraine down the **path to destruction**.]{.underline} History will
judge the United States and its allies harshly for their remarkably
foolish policy on Ukraine. Thank you.

[This description seems to suggest that the study of war's ecology ought
to be a question of political economy]{.underline}, given the arms
market, the growth of cities, and the burgeoning slums. However, [it is
not the arms that are sold and purchased that have altered the outcome
of two major wars but the weapons left behind, the actual surplus from
previous wars that then combined with the deluge of electronic waste
shipped, dumped, and smuggled throughout the Global South. It is also
not the]{.underline} overpopulated struggling cities of the [Global
South pumping out billion-dollar military platforms or invading nations
halfway around the world.]{.underline} Political economy thought in
traditional terms is ill-equipped to deal with the far-from-equilibrium
systems of global life. After all, economic explanations of urban growth
failed to predict the dramatic increases in urban size and slum
intensity. The prevailing wisdom of development economics was that the
persistent and intensifying economic decline since the 1970s experienced
throughout the developing world would slow the growth of cities.47 The
exact opposite has occurred. In fact, as jobs and economic opportuni-
ties have diminished substantially along with the buying power of wages
in cities throughout the Global South, the number of people relocating
to cities has spiked upward, seemingly undeterred by the economic
conditions. Paul Virilio makes a compelling case that these newly
emergent megaslums ought not be called cities or even really urban. They
are makeshift settlements whose only apparent similarity to earlier
settlements called cities is the density of population. The ultracity,
as Virilio calls it, does not follow the rhythms or any organizational
structure we would commonly call urban. In many cases the megaslums have
a kind of persistent temporary status. This is seemingly a contradiction
in terms but one that aptly describes the situation in which many of the
slums began as refugee camps or emergency living facilities and, while
outlasting their temporary or emergency expectations, still have
extraordinarily transient populations as well as a nearly continuous
rate of creation and destruction as the result of attempts by the state
to raze settlements and the often fragile structural integrity of shacks
and shanties. Virilio uses the phrase revolution de l'empart massif to
describe the conflicting movements of internalization and exclusion.48
Mike Davis argues that austerity measures, wars, and the general failure
of cash crops and resources in export-based development models have
created a kind of perfect storm for the displacement and relocation of
rural populations to urban centers.49 Some of these factors are within
the traditional jurisdiction of economics; however, none represents a
smooth relation between economic indicator and outcome. Therefore it is
useful to restore oikos to its larger purview that supersedes economy,
to return to ecology all of its political, material, and historical
inflections. [The presence of traditional military resources such as
tanks and fighter jets that would be used to judge the material power of
opponents in conflicts is no more indicative of outcomes]{.underline}
than economic growth is predictive of urbanization[. In these
calculations, tanks and planes would be quantified to make judgments
about military strength that small arms and abandoned mines would
no]{.underline}t. For instance, by traditional judgments of material
power, Saddam Hussein was better armed and prepared for war in 1991 and
therefore stronger than in 2003. However, the first Gulf War was a
resounding success by military standards because Saddam Hussein fought
the coalition forces using a large stockpile of weapons and training
received from the licit and illicit Western and Soviet arms markets.
[Technological assistance referred to in the U.S. budget as "security
assistance" involves a very dif­ferent flow of goods and services than
the emergent objects of waste and surplus that form the milieu of the
ied and the seemingly insignificant trade in small and light
arms]{.underline}. [When states play by the norms and procedures of
modernist warfare, a quantity theory of war is operative and exhibits
relatively predictable outcomes.]{.underline} J. F. C. Fuller coined
this phrase to describe the mobilization and execution of nationalist
war under the power of steam. For Fuller, [a **new episteme of military
thinking** emerges from an assemblage of mass nationalism, gunpowder,
steam engines, communication lines, and capitalist economies, such that
"it is war that shapes peace, and armament that shapes
war."]{.underline}50 [To have more of something, a quantitative
advantage, the units being measured have to be interchangeable or
roughly isomorphic]{.underline}. If the application of force by
opponents is similar in kind, then the quantity of force applied in the
form of bullets, tanks, and bombs may determine the outcome of war. In
the case of the first Gulf War, quantity was on the side of the
coalition forces even though the Iraqi military was well armed. The
[current conflict]{.underline} in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan,
however, [is intensively and extensively asymmetrical---not in the sense
that it is uneven, as is often the understanding of this term, but in
the sense that there is a mismatch or incommensurable difference between
the resources and tactics of each side.]{.underline} James Der Derian
refers to this mismatch of contemporary global politics as
heteropolarity rather than multipolarity as the poles are
compositionally nonidentical.51 The [forces being mobilized are not
comparable at the level of tactics, organization, or
agenda.]{.underline} Therefore, [quantity is not predictive of the
outcome]{.underline}. In fact, [quantity is not
quantifiable]{.underline}. Clausewitz calls this the impossibility of
polarity in war that results because there is seldom anything
approaching equilibrium.52 So [to say that the U.S. military possesses
more tanks]{.underline} than the Taliban or Pashtun fighters [is
true]{.underline}, as neither possess any armored vehicles. But [that
accounting of relative strength would only be relevant if both sides
were fighting a tank war]{.underline}. For example, ieds could be
counted and compared, say, to their kissing cousins the "smart mines."
However, that would tell us little about the possible outcome of the
conflict. [The United States could possess twice as many mines as its
competitors and the uncertainty would still persist.]{.underline} In
part [this is because of the differential flows and organizations of the
opposing forces. The United States relies on major roads that can
accommodate large caravans of trucks and vehicles. Without a nearly
constant flow of goods and soldiers, the U.S. military would
starve]{.underline}. Therefore, ieds consistently do damage because
convoys, whether for supply or patrols to ensure the passage of
supplies, are highly susceptible to disruption. And that vulnerability
is not reversible. [Understanding this asymmetry requires understand-
ing the assemblages of things that organize the differing lifeworlds
spanning the theater of operations.]{.underline} While it may be
impossible to exhaust the census of "things" or give a causal accounting
of all the objects that make up a milieu, [the multiplication of objects
that take part can provide a foothold for navigating the emergence and
recurrence of conflicts.]{.underline} The improvised explosive device is
exceptional for this pursuit because its recurrence, mutation, and
advance have ravaged the roadways and urban corridors of the present
U.S. occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan despite the best efforts of the
dod to target the supplies used to construct ieds and the initiatives to
track down and eliminate the humans who build them. According to a 2010
report in The Guardian, ieds have accounted for nearly half of all
combat deaths and half of all casualties in Iraq and 30 percent of
deaths and 50 percent of casualties in Afghanistan.53 Since the \$30
billion counter-ied effort began in Afghanistan, the number of lethal
ieds has tripled. It should be mentioned that the numbers of civilians
killed by these machines is difficult to measure, but estimates suggest
that numbers exceed U.S. combat deaths of all kinds.54

Marx on colonialism and anti-colonial struggles

Marx analyzed capitalism in Britain for his major work because data on
the country's industrial system was rich and accessible, and because it
was where capitalism was most highly developed at the time. However,
Marx was clear that British capitalism was not confined to Britain, and
that the object of study was Britain as a capitalist and colonizing
power. British industrial capitalism was advanced because of its stature
as a colonial power.

Marx's critique of political economy showed how the prevailing ideas of
colonialism were reactionary and not in the interests of British
workers. For example, he noted how British colonies like Ireland could
be utilized for excess labor-power and how wage laborers can't be free
while slavery exists. Most famously, he wrote that British capital was
accumulated through "conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder," and more
specifically through national and international debts, "the discovery of
gold and silver... the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines
of the aboriginal population," and "the conquest and looting of the East
Indies" \[3\].

The study that examines the political economy of Britain ends with a
chapter on colonialism because Marx knew that, while [**capital's
[contradictions]{.mark}** couldn't be solved **without revolution**,
they [could be]{.mark} **pushed back** and [**displaced**
through]{.mark} **intensified [colonial
expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, [Marx's theory]{.underline}
of value [was a **global theory of value**]{.underline}, as [value
necessarily expands and requires capitalist powers to engage in
**colonial**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, later, **[imperialist
practices]{.underline}** \[4\]. Colonialism is explicitly mentioned, for
example, as a process that can counter the tendency for the rate of
profit to fall \[5\].

Moreover, Marx even acknowledged that uprisings in the colonized world
could spark workers' uprisings in the colonial motherland. During the
Taiping Rebellion in China--which Marx supported wholeheartedly--he
wrote:

> "It may seem a very strange, and very paradoxical assertion that the
> next uprising of the people of Europe, and their next movement for
> republican freedom and economy of government, may depend more probably
> on what is now passing in the Celestial Empire" \[6\].

Even during Marx's time, what we today call [the Global
South]{.underline}--including Africa, Asia, and Latin
America--[were]{.underline}, along with oppressed nations in the North,
[exploited for the enrichment of the **colonizing capitalist
states**]{.underline}.

From colonialism to imperialism

Yet it wasn't until after Marx died that the shift from colonialism to
imperialism began. Marx died in 1883, just before the 1884 Conference of
Berlin rapidly accelerated the transition to a global imperialist order.
Less than 20 years later, the imperialist powers had terrorized,
plundered, and looted almost all of Africa, stripping away long
histories of self-governance.

For a definition of imperialism, we have to turn to Lenin, who can help
us understand what imperialism really is, and why it isn't an adjective
that describes particular policies of certain administrations, but
instead refers to a particular stage of capitalist development. Lenin
distinguishes imperialism from colonialism in the following manner:

> [[The]{.mark} **characteristic [feature]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
> period under review [[is the]{.mark} **final [partition of the
> globe]{.mark}**]{.underline}---final, not in the sense that a
> repartition is impossible; on the contrary, repartitions are possible
> and inevitable---but in the sense that the [colonial policy of the
> capitalist countries has **completed the seizure of the unoccupied
> territories**]{.underline} of our planet. For the first time the world
> is completely divided up, so that in the future **[only redivision is
> possible]{.underline}**, i.e., [territories can only pass from one
> "owner" to another]{.underline}, instead of passing as ownerless
> territory to an "owner" \[7\].

Imperialism began when the [colonizing]{.underline} powers [had already
divided the world between themselves. [The **only way** to
expand]{.mark}]{.underline} from that point on [[was to]{.mark}
re-**[divide]{.mark} the colonial [territories]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark}
**inevitably [meant war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such redivisions were at
the roots of the First and Second World Wars.

Imperialism: Capitalist wars and revolutionary solutions

"[Imperialism]{.underline}," Lenin wrote, "[is the **highest stage**
in]{.underline} the development of [capitalism]{.underline}" \[8\]. This
means there is no separating imperialism from capitalism: [one is a
stage within the other.]{.underline}

[Capitalism has]{.underline}, since its birth, [used]{.underline} legal
and extralegal [violence to accumulate wealth]{.underline} in the hands
of the capitalist class [through]{.underline} a process called primary
**[accumulation]{.underline}**. Within England, one of capitalism's
first acts was expropriating peasants from their land, forcibly
converting them into wage laborers and transforming their means of
subsistence into commodities they had to purchase. Such dispossession
was carried out by state and individual terrorism. The colonized world
suffered a similar yet sharper fate, as we saw Marx describe above.

Writing during the beginning of World War I, Lenin wrote that
"capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a definite and very
high stage of its development, when certain of its fundamental
characteristics began to change into their opposites" \[9\].
"Economically," he writes, "the main thing in this process is the
displacement of capitalist free competition by capitalist monopoly"
\[10\]. Gone were the (brief) days when small businesses competed with
each other in limited markets. Instead, [capital was
**centralized**]{.underline} in fewer and fewer hands. "[Capitalism has
grown into a world system of colonial oppression and of the **financial
strangulation**]{.underline} of the overwhelming majority of the
population of the world [by a handful of **'advanced'
countries**]{.underline}," Lenin wrote \[11\]. Their "booty" accrues to
a handful of [imperialist powers]{.underline} "who [are drawing the
whole world into **their war over the division of their
*booty***]{.underline}" \[12\].

Some thought that the tendency toward monopoly would result in one
single company for every industry, which would represent a limit to
capitalism within capitalism. Yet during economic crises and due to
state intervention, such monopolies never cohered. Today, major
[corporations and financial institutions]{.underline}, largely located
in the Global North, [have conglomerated]{.underline} and vertically
integrated to the extent that [a handful of monopolies dominate the
**entire international economy**]{.underline}. To be sure, they're often
separate entities, but they're united by finance and the state. Lenin
referred to the then-new phenomenon of the merging of industrial and
banking capital as "finance capital," a form of capitalism that is still
dominant today.

Because of this drive toward monopoly, [[capitalism **cannot be
reformed**]{.underline}]{.mark} into a peaceful regime. [Capitalism [can
**never become anti-imperialist**]{.mark}]{.underline}, non-imperialist,
or, to use the phrase of Lenin's target, Karl Kautsky, "ultra" or
"super-imperialist." Kautsky believed that the [territorial
[expansion]{.mark} of capitalism [had **reached its
limits**]{.mark}]{.underline} and that [[the]{.mark} **only
[solution]{.mark}** was [for]{.mark} the **powerful [nations]{.mark}**
[to form a **bloc**]{.mark} **and establish an
equilibrium**]{.underline}. Lenin said this state was merely a "truce"
between wars.

Governments of imperialist countries act in the interests of these
monopolies, using their armies and militaries to pursue their
objectives. [[The]{.mark} U.S. [military is an **extension**]{.mark}
**of capital's drive to constantly conquer new markets and resources**,
[even]{.mark} **when it creates them [through destruction]{.mark}**[.
It]{.mark} goes to war to [compete with **other**]{.mark} **imperialist
[rivals]{.mark}** for markets and resources, [to keep]{.mark} rising
capitalist [powers **in their place**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to oppress
independent and socialist nations, to find new markets, resources, and
springs of profit, and to mitigate against worker rebellions at home.

When Israel bombs Palestine or the U.S. launches airstrikes against
Syria, sanctions Venezuela, or blockades Cuba, [[these are not
**individual policy**]{.mark} **decisions**]{.underline}, nor are they
the result of any single politician's mindset. [[These are]{.mark}
**economically [necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **structural
features**]{.mark} **of capitalism** [that **cannot be
reformed**]{.mark} **away**]{.underline}. To be sure, [there
is]{.underline} a great deal of **[debate]{.underline}** within the U.S.
political and military establishments [over what **particular policies
to pursue**]{.underline}, means to deploy, and objectives to attain at
particular junctures. [Yet, the consensus remains: the U.S. won't accept
**any challenge**]{.underline} [to its imperialist
dominance]{.underline}.

[[The only solution is the overthrow of]{.mark} **capitalist
[imperialism]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[building of
[socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By its very definition, [[imperialism
**needs** to dominate]{.mark} **[every market]{.mark}**, raw material,
natural resource, and worker on the planet.]{.underline} The tactics it
deploys to do so are varied, ranging from sanctions and blockades to war
threats, bombing campaigns, and all-out regime-change operations. The
[U.S. remains the primary imperialist power, although its dominance is
**increasingly contested**]{.underline} by other countries that are
merely trying to rise within the capitalist order. The People's Republic
of [China]{.underline}, however, [constitutes a]{.underline} serious
[threat]{.underline} to imperialism [insofar as it works to provide an
alternative to U.S. domination for underdeveloped
countries]{.underline}.

Today as in Lenin's time, [the **global antagonism** between
**imperialist and oppressed nations** reverberates and **structures our
world and our struggles**]{.underline} \[13\].

Conclusion: Proletarian internationalism

In reality, it is the workers and oppressed who are powerful. We are the
ones who will take power out of the hands of monopolies and turn it over
to the toiling masses through revolutionary struggles.

Here [in the United States, it is the duty of]{.underline} all
progressive and [revolutionary people to **strike imperialism at its
heart**. Ending imperialism in the U.S. will mean
liberation]{.underline} not only for us, but also [for oppressed peoples
**around the world**]{.underline}, for they would be able to exercise
their right to self-determination without interference. The Cuban people
could build socialism without blockades from the US; Korea could reunite
once again without threat of U.S. military intervention; Palestine would
be free from U.S.-Israeli occupation.

Yet our [[class is]{.mark} constantly [bombarded with]{.mark}
**imperialist [propaganda]{.mark} that aims to divide us** against our
allies abroad and to unite us with our enemies at home]{.underline}.
"We're all Americans," they tell us, slyly ignoring the class, national,
and other divisions in the imperialist heartland. Imperialist propaganda
takes diverse forms, and many of them liberal and even "progressive."
[Wars are never waged in the name of resources or profit,
but]{.underline} rather in the name of "**[human rights]{.underline}**,"
"**[democracy]{.underline}**," [and]{.underline} even the
"**[protection]{.underline}** [of minorities]{.underline}" \[14\]. For
each form of propaganda, [[we have to **respond clearly**]{.mark} **and
resolutely: [NO to]{.mark} U.S. [imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}!
U.S. troops out of everywhere! [These demands are
**consistent**]{.underline} regardless of our evaluation of the nation
or government under attack.

We have to show that workers in the United States have nothing to gain
through U.S. imperialism, whether it pursues its objectives through
military war or economic sanctions. We have to show our class that, not
only do we have nothing to gain, but [we suffer **continual losses from
imperialism**--we lose our lives, our jobs, our communities, and more.
By showing **these truths**]{.underline} to workers, [we]{.underline}
help unite and [[raise]{.mark} the **[consciousness of]{.mark} our
[class]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are [[indispensable to building
a]{.mark} **socialist [revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} here [in the
"**belly of the beast**."]{.underline}

While the global imperialist system has changed quite drastically since
Lenin's time, [the]{.underline} primary political [directive remains the
same: Fighting to end imperialist war is **necessary**]{.underline}, but
it is [part of the struggle for the **real solution**: to take power out
of the hands of the banks]{.underline}, financial [oligarchies,
landlords, and militarists, and put it in the hands of the many. [**We
can't do that** if]{.mark} our [class can be **won back over**]{.mark}
to the side of our enemies.]{.underline}

Universal Human Rights

[The]{.underline} other **[myth]{.underline}** [that is at the
foundation of]{.underline} Eurocentrism and European [modernity is the
veneer of universal human rights]{.underline}. [The so-called human
rights are applicable and ascribed to everyone when it suites European
modernity]{.underline}. The rights can be [easily denied other
races]{.underline} particularly the Black race [when it is convenient
for Europe]{.underline}. This epitomises Eurocentrism. [Europe seemingly
is the only civilisation that dictates what goes and for who it
goes]{.underline}. In convergence with this notion, Ramose (2003: 2)
speaks of an intrinsic link between land and human life. [Life exists
and is located somewhere; the attachment and location of human life to
land are unquestionable]{.underline}. In other words, life is
geographically located. [The colonisation of Africa---"losing land to
the conqueror"---therefore, was tantamount to losing a "vital source of
life" for the Africans]{.underline} (Ramose 2003: 2). Hence, [European
colonial conquests not only entrenched its domination in foreign spaces
and places, it literally killed and murdered other civilisations that
occupied those spaces and places it invaded and conquered]{.underline}.
So far, this work has [noted the]{.underline}
**[inconsistency]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[lived
experience]{.underline}** and reality [of European prescription of
modernity to other civilisations]{.underline}. The inconsistency lies in
that [the rhetoric speaks of ideals presumably ascribed for, and on,
everybody]{.underline}. The [reality proves the rhetoric to be
untrue]{.underline}. The United Nations was created in 1945 following
the so-called World War II, formed to liquidate and obliterate
"international wars" (UN 2018). The irony is that [when the UN was
formed, colonialism was at its peak in Africa. The formation of the UN,
therefore, did not include Africa because it was just Europe's
extension, if not property]{.underline}. In other words, [Africa was
forcibly incorporated into the international system without its
involvement, consultation, consent and ascent]{.underline}. Not only was
Africa forcibly incorporated into the international system, it was
[also]{.underline} forcibly incorporated [into the capitalist market
system]{.underline} (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2015: 485). Ramose concurs with
Ndlovu-Gatsheni's view and submits that Africa's loss of sovereignty
meant that: \[T\]he African was compelled to enter into the money
economy. Having been thus rendered poor by the stroke of the pen backed
by the use of armed force, the African was compelled to find money to
assure not only individual survival but also to pay tax for owning a
hut, for example. [In this way, the African's right to life---the
inalienable right to subsistence---was violated]{.underline}. (Ramose
2003: 2) [The assumption of sovereign equality bequeathed on all
states]{.underline} in the 1648 Westphalian Treaty, a[nd the
de-recognition of Africa as a sovereign space and place]{.underline} in
1886 [by European imperial powers]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [the
re-incorporation of Africa]{.underline} in 1945 [into the European
international system, proves the consistent inconsistency and the
absurdity of European modernity]{.underline}. Ramose (2003: 2) asserts
that human rights "revolve around the recognition, protection and
respect of the right to life". As such, [the continual violation of
human rights by the current world order is **problematic and unjust**,
which renders the rhetoric of human rights meaningless to
Africans]{.underline}. [If the rhetoric about human rights is to arouse
or evoke any meaning in Africans' experiences and consciousness, it must
reinstate and rehabilitate materially and bestow recognition of, and
uphold Africa's "inalienable right to subsistence"]{.underline} (Ramose
2003: 2). The UN, a perceived global authority that seeks to champion
universal human rights by some states and actors, and if at all
well-meaning, [should it not then seek to revisit the colonial question
for redress especially to victims of the greatest crime against
humanity---colonialism? It cannot be that Africa's human rights continue
to be trampled on and left unchallenged.]{.underline} Kissinger (2014:
7) draws the readers' attention to the current "world community"
modelled on the European Concert of State which was formed as a result
of the Westphalian Treaty of 1648. [The **modelling of the entire
world** on the European Concert of State is representative of
Eurocentrism and the idea of coloniality]{.underline}. In August 2001,
[the United Nations held a Conference on Racism in Durban, South Africa.
At that Conference, the USA **withdrew its delegation**]{.underline}
together with Israel, [in protest of demands put by Africans that the
rights of Africans particularly be recognised and that crimes against
humanity committed by colonial masters be accounted for]{.underline} and
recognised for what they are. Ramose observed that: [The majority of the
Western countries present at the conference insisted that the prevailing
inhumanity of the global structural violence and poverty should be
maintained]{.underline}. This they did by [ensuring that the conference
would adopt resolutions that would **absolve them from** both the
**moral** and the **legal guilt** of the violence of colonisation and
the inhumanity of racism.]{.underline} (2003: 3) [Accounting for
colonial injustices would mean acknowledging the dispossession of Black
people of their land]{.underline}, among other elements[; a thorny issue
that **capitalism cannot admit to**, seeing that the dispossession was
covered up by property rights---a fundamental principle of
capitalism---and contained in a **façade** of]{.underline} legal
documents including **[international law]{.underline}** and National
Constitutions of various countries. [Colonialism and capitalism are thus
protected by law]{.underline}, particularly the Roman Law and the
Roman--Dutch Law. Needless to note [that]{.underline} the Roman Law and
the Dutch Law are European and [naturally seek to entrench
Eurocentrism]{.underline}.

### Link --- I-Law

#### International law is not [neutral]{.underline}, but rather [codifies inequality]{.underline} --- their faith in the "[impartial]{.underline}" rule of law creates international [winners]{.underline} and [losers]{.underline}. 

**Hurd '20** --- Ian; Department of Political Science, Northwestern
University. September 16, 2020; "The case against international
cooperation"; *International Theory*, First View, Pages 1-22; Accessed

First, the [[rule of law]{.mark} ideal]{.underline}, consisting of the
neutral application of rules across cases, [[is not]{.mark} politically
[neutral]{.mark}]{.underline}. [International law is [**necessarily
partial** to some goals and opposed to others and]{.mark}]{.underline}
it [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[have **unequal
effects**]{.underline}]{.mark} on its constituents. The [[rose-colored
glasses]{.underline}]{.mark} that are often [used to interpret the world
of international law lead scholars to [assume]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[global governance enacts]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**best ideals** of
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}, universally shared and therefore
uncontroversial. Darryl Robinson adopts this view in his analysis of
international criminal law (ICL): 'I believe that cosmopolitanism
resonates with the aspirations of ICL: a concern for human beings that
extends beyond borders; a willingness to embrace alternative governance
structures to supplement state structures; and inclusiveness of the
concerns of the "international community as a whole"'.Footnote69 Shashi
Tharoor has called the United Nations 'the best hope the world currently
has' for its problems because it 'brings all the countries of the world
together to pursue collectively the security and welfare so essential to
our common humanity'.Footnote70 [[This is an]{.underline}]{.mark}
'**[[enchanted view]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [of international
law]{.underline} and governance.Footnote71 Fernando Nuñez-Mietz
[assumes]{.underline} that [international law is **naturally morally**
good]{.underline}: 'the content of much of international law is a
reflection of shared understandings of what is morally right'.Footnote72
[[To liberals]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}]{.underline} can [seem like [a **magical machine** that
takes in]{.mark}]{.underline} hot [[controversies and feeds
out]{.underline}]{.mark} cool, **[[impartial
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The limits of this view are easy to see. If one were to take the same
assumption into the study of tax law, the results would be equally weak.
As tax law creates categories for different kinds of income and wealth
and it sets rules to govern how each is taxed, it draws lines around
types of person or institution and taxes them differently. These are
understood as political because they affect different interests
differently, and they are fought over in legislatures and in the streets
by the partisans of these interests. The law is politically productive
in the sense that it creates inequalities which then present to
individuals as incentives to get on one side or other of the law and
gives rise to new terrains of political contestation.Footnote73 In the
USA for instance, where religious institutions are not taxed, courts are
required to monitor the distinction between religious and non-religious
institutions so that the rule can be 'correctly' applied as various
entities seek to be declared 'religious' for tax purposes.Footnote74 The
social distinction between religious and non-religious is made into a
legal distinction, governed by the state, with tax consequences. Tax law
might be applied in a neutral manner in the sense that everyone is
expected to follow the same rules equally but the effect of application
is not neutral because the law works to the advantage of some over
others. It cannot be apolitical.

[International law]{.underline} can be seen in the same light. Depending
on how it is used it could **[[prioritize]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[interests of [states over people]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
[**[powerful]{.mark} states** [over less powerful]{.mark}]{.underline},
or [[corporations over nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, or the opposite of
these. It specifies which laws govern the Nepalese peacekeeper sent to
Haiti by the United Nations and it regulates how a Haitian who suffers
harm by that peacekeeper can seek compensation and from whom.Footnote75
It [constrains some]{.underline} kinds of [killing]{.underline} and
[while empowering others]{.underline}.Footnote76 And it could be written
differently so that it would encompass different sets of winners and
losers,Footnote77 just as tax law could. But it can\'t be written so
that it benefits everyone.

Because international law reflects partial rather than universal
interests, it is important to investigate which interests are served and
which are denied. The empirical, pragmatist research agenda that I
advocate in place of cooperation theory traces the actual distribution
of welfare and power created by these rules or institutions.Footnote78
David Kennedy has pursued this work in connection with humanitarian
action, motivated by the idea that 'once we see international
humanitarians as participants in global governance --- as rulers --- it
seems impossible not to be attentive to the possible costs, as well as
the benefits, of our work'.Footnote79 The [**simple
[assumptions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} liberalism]{.underline}, of [[consent
and mutual gains]{.mark} are [bypassed]{.mark}]{.underline}. As David
Lake says, 'as a set of rules, international orders affect individuals
and groups in different ways, and these [actors pursue their
interests]{.underline} to the extent of their abilities, including
[legitimating]{.underline} the [rule of some foreign
country]{.underline} or resisting that rule. [[International order is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[Pareto-improving]{.mark}
cooperation]{.underline}, [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[theorized in
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline},
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} involves hard bargaining and [[**winners**
and **losers**]{.underline}]{.mark}'.Footnote80

Second, because it has these political effects, international law is a
powerful tool for governments and others and it has come to occupy an
important place in their strategic behavior. [States]{.underline} and
activists [invoke international law strategically with]{.underline} an
[eye on its potential t]{.underline}o help them [achieve their
goals]{.underline}. It empowers governments, as well as constraining
them. The instrumental use of law to advance interests is seen by some
liberal theorists as the direct contradiction of the idea of the rule of
law, but as a practice it is ubiquitous in IR. Brian Tamanaha argues
against instrumentalism in his book Law as a Means to an End: Threat to
the Rule of Law.Footnote81 A similar complaint comes up around
international courts. Shannon Fyfe, noted above, seeks to root out
'impermissible political influence' from the work of the ICC while
allowing it the admittedly political goal of deterring or punishing
perpetrators.Footnote82 These complaints presume the separation of law
from politics and they strive to keep each in its box.

A political approach to law recognizes that [instrumentalism is an
**inescapable part** of legalization]{.underline}. This is true of
international law just as it is of domestic tax law. Countries bring
cases to international tribunals when they believe that a legal judgment
will help their political goals, as Australia did over Japanese whaling
and the USA did at Nuremberg and governments do with self-referrals to
the ICC.Footnote83 Contesting political disputes in legal form is the
norm not an aberration. The [turn to law]{.underline}, in the form of
legal institutions, legal resources, and legal logics, [is a **political
one**]{.underline}, with characteristic effects on the shape of
arguments, the roster of authorized actors, and the distribution of
power and payoffs.Footnote84 'Law', said Judith Shklar, 'is a political
instrument'Footnote85 and Martti Koskenniemi went on to say that every
legal choice is a 'politics of law'.Footnote86

The instrumentalization of legal resources for political purposes
follows naturally from the idea of the rule of law, which elevates legal
institutions to the authoritative position of deciding how things should
go. A regime of legal supremacy directs actors to fight their fights in
the language of law. This is not particularly controversial as a
conceptual point --- indeed, it sits inside much liberal analysis of law
--- but the methodological commitment to separating legal from political
makes it harder to recognize and study.Footnote87 Bower says that the
goal of legal discourse is to 'shift the strategic terrain \[between
contending parties\] such that the other arguments are no longer
sustainable'.Footnote88 Even in a setting where courts are not
available, legal argumentation is strategically powerful. David Luban
identifies the expressive power of international prosecution as the main
payoff to the ICC itself: 'the most promising justification for
international tribunals is their role in norm projection'.Footnote89 The
court\'s function is in a sense ceremonial, showing the values of the
international community in vivid color. This is political theater,
deployed instrumentally in pursuit of what he sees as universal goals.

The [widespread [commitments to **rule-of-law ideology**]{.mark} in
world affairs [means]{.mark}]{.underline} that being seen as [acting
lawfully [is **politically powerful**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- it
[[gives legitimacy to]{.mark} the [state and its
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote90 These are valuable resources and
we should expect actors to reach for them. The [substance of
international law]{.underline} will [[tilt in the direction of those

The [[hope that law]{.underline}]{.mark} might be [a **[weapon of the
weak]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [[widely shared]{.mark} among liberal
scholars [but]{.mark}]{.underline} it [[runs into **empirical
difficulty**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Lee Seymour notes that the ICC
prosecutor once declared 'I believe in law as power for all; it is the
ultimate weapon that the weak have against the strong'.Footnote91 Adam
Bower also sees the ICC as empowering weaker players relative to the
USA.Footnote92 Harold Koh recently outlined his vision of 'law as
resistance' in his book on legal efforts to counter the Trump
administration at home and abroad.Footnote93 To be sure, there are many
instances where less powerful actors use the law to defend themselves
against powerful states. Harold Koh\'s account of legalized resistance
offers some success stories as does David Cole\'s similar book on
domestic US constitutional issues, Engines of Liberty.Footnote94 But the
[[capacity]{.mark} of law [to serve]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[interests
of the weak is **minor** compared to]{.underline}]{.mark} its [**more
common [function]{.mark}** [of serving]{.mark}]{.underline} the [goals
of [those who control it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Since
[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark} is [authored]{.mark} by states and
mainly developed]{.underline}, [interpreted]{.underline}, [[and changed
by **strong states**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[its development over time
tracks]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**changing interests** of **those
governments**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is [[evident
around]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rules]{.mark} of
self-defense]{.underline} in the law on the use of force, [which
[evolved]{.mark}]{.underline} from its mid-20th century origins as a ban
on war [into]{.underline} a more [permissive regime that the USA and
others now use [to **legitimize military**]{.mark} **operations**
under]{.underline} the headings of [counterinsurgency]{.underline},
[intervention]{.underline}, [and targeted
[killing]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote95 [Strong states]{.underline}
have the capacity to [shift]{.underline} the [operative interpretation
of international legal rules]{.underline} --- this is [[**baked into**
international legal theory]{.underline}]{.mark} and practice, as Tom
Ruys notes that treaty interpretation must take into account 'evolutions
in the international security environment' as it decides what is lawful
and what isn\'t.Footnote96 Thomas Franck and W. Michael Reisman embedded
this point in their grand theories of international law, offering
[great-power interests]{.underline} a prominent role as [a formal source
of legal change]{.underline}.Footnote97 With this in mind, we can
comfortably predict that [international [legal
development]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[follow]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[interests of the **most powerful**]{.mark} **actors**]{.underline}.
This is [[not]{.mark} a weapon of [the weak]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Admittedly, the utility value of these institutions (EU, AU, UN, etc.)
lies in that they have potency to provide an even-handed and impartial
framework for the engagement of a diverse community of states, if
handled fairly, justly and with symmetrical influence of the involved
parties (Kissinger 2014: 7). [The current global power structural
configuration was an **invention of Europe**, and as the architect of
this system of world governance, Europe championed the "balance of power
concept"]{.underline} with itself as the author and adjudicator of that
system (Kissinger 2004: 7). [This reveals the genesis of
the]{.underline} **[asymmetrical power configuration]{.underline}** [in
this]{.underline} **['new world order' system]{.underline}**. This means
that [the rationale of colonialism is coloniality]{.underline}.
Coloniality propelled the Europeans to conquer other civilisations in
order to impose their sense of order on every 'other' civilisation. [The
Westphalian Peace Treaty]{.underline} was signed in 1648,
[indicat]{.underline}ing the [official codification of the doctrine of
state sovereignty]{.underline}. The [Berlin West Africa
Conference]{.underline}, known for the slogan **['Scramble for
Africa']{.underline}** occurred in 1885--1887 (Iliffe 1979; Pakenham
1992; Chamberlain 2010). The [Versailles Treaty]{.underline} was signed
in 1919 [signalling the end of World War I]{.underline} (Kissinger 2014:
24) [demonstrating the European doublestandards and asymmetrical power
relations]{.underline}. This also speaks of the inconsistencies of
European modernity. The **[double-standards]{.underline}**
[applied]{.underline} by Europe in its interactions [with the rest of
the world are conspicuous]{.underline}. Another example of this is that
[the same European-centric worldview developed international
law]{.underline}. [International law entailed that "if a state would
accept these basic requirements, it could be recognised as an
international citizen]{.underline} able to maintain its own culture,
politics, religion and internal policies, shielded by the international
system from outside intervention["]{.underline} (Kissinger 2014: 27).
[Europe as the self-appointed architect]{.underline}, arbiter and
adjudicator of states' behaviours [considered international law "as an
expandable body of agreed doctrine]{.underline} aimed at the cultivation
of harmony, [with the Westphalian treaties themselves at its
heart"]{.underline} (Kissinger 2014: 27). It can be deduced, therefore,
that [international law was designed for Europe and had only Europe at
the centre of its creation and intended application]{.underline}, which
then explains why international law was not upheld at the Berlin West
Africa Conference, [Africa was partitioned to the whims of European
imperial powers without any consequence]{.underline}. [This renders
international law whim some as it is selectively applied, revealing the
impunity of international law]{.underline}. [International law speaks
of]{.underline} **[recognition as the precondition for]{.underline}**
the **[acceptance]{.underline}** [of a state]{.underline} in the fold of
the international community of states. It consequently speaks of being
shielded and protected from external intervention. [Recognised by who?
Shielded from who? This is problematic for the African
polity]{.underline}. [How can an imposed order maintain a culture,
politics and internal processes of African ecologies and localities,
when an outside imposition has already been put?]{.underline} If a state
does not accept or conform, it is not protected from outside
intervention. [Is this not coloniality of power at its **highest
expression**?]{.underline} Europe is the recogniser of states and
therefore the guarantor of political independence of states; Europe is
the power that recognises states, protects states and policies states
into conformity and order. [The European civilisation is the ordering
state, from which all order is derived. Such is the control that Europe
has on the current global power structural configuration]{.underline}.
[This undoubtedly makes]{.underline} **[Europe an Empire]{.underline}**.
A British Statesman, Lord Palmaston, once quipped that "our interests
are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow"
(quoted in Kissinger 2014: 29--30). [Europe prescribes what order is and
what it is not, if a state conforms to the prescribed order it is
insulated from Europe's wrath, but a deviant state is meted with
violence]{.underline}. [The problem]{.underline} with the order of
Europe [is that it is **foible** and it varies and changes depending on
whom is in question]{.underline}. The Euro-North American-centric
modernity is not even apologetic about this matter. Kissinger evinces
the rationale behind this arrogance; he notes, "we mean to do what may
seem to be best, upon each occasion as it arises, making the interests
of our country one's guiding principle" (Kissinger 2014: 30). This, in
fact, is not a principle because it is whim some, always depending on
circumstances; should a principle not be mandible depending on
circumstance(s)?

This is the terror that keeps Jürgen Habermas up at night. What will we
do if we discover our freedom is contingent, that our very nature can
change?31 The plan of the rest of this chapter is to follow Malabou's
provocation through to the heart of that terror. However, unlike
Habermas and others, I hope to do so without the sentimental attachment
to a humanity that never existed. Rather, I want to push Malabou's
concepts further. I want to consider what happens to plasticity and
destructive plasticity when they are let loose in the wilds of politics.
As knowledge of our formable and forming nature becomes not just known
but made practical, the nightmare of humanists becomes real.
[**Populations of human bodies** without essential identities **can be
altered** or, in the language of cybernetics, steered.]{.underline}
Unlike understandings of power, [even **subtle forms of disciplinary
power**, **plasticity on the scale of the individual** and the polis
represents the possibility of **change without
subjection**]{.underline}, that is, **[without
resistance]{.underline}**. Rather than the relations of power that make
subjects in the Foucauldian image, [we have the possibility of
**designing or steering subjects** that have no index of what they were
before, such that something could resist. Instead, plasticity represents
the possibility of a frictionless change---in the sense that one can
imagine (and has imagined) the alteration of the brain or the assemblage
of bodies-brains-semiotics-technics that is often called the
social---that would leave no trace of what could be called an
alternative.]{.underline} This is not the failure of resistance to
produce an outcome, as in the case of the noncompliant prisoner who
nonetheless remains imprisoned. Instead, [plasticity raises the question
of techniques that produce bodies that do not know that the "they" that
they once were wanted to resist or even are imprisoned.]{.underline} The
incorporation of plasticity into politics raises the specter of Gilles
Deleuze's "societies of control," in which [**individuals become
"dividuals**"--- **humans as counters** in a **flexible and constantly
"modulating" economy**]{.underline}.32 Control in this context is often
read systemically, as if only the "society" views humans as counters but
the "dividuals" themselves, like Robert Duvall's character in thx 1138,
yearn to be free, to be unique. [Confronting plasticity and its
explosive potential to obliterate precursors poses a dif­ferent dividual,
a real dividual: bodies stripped not just of their identity but of the
desire to have an identity or to have an identity nonidentical to the
identity that preceded it. **Control** represents the **real possibility
of order** without the leverage or friction of ordering.]{.underline}
Normatively I do not disagree with Habermas and others that this
reduction of freedom to an engineering problem is horrifying. The point
of disagreement is that arguing against the existence of such a
possibility will have an effect on the probability of this nightmare.33
The attempt to safeguard humanity through the scapegoating of
materialist thinking is self-defeating, as it insists that human freedom
and dignity are independent of the brain while also decrying the
possibility of each "becoming material." In its cruelest form, this line
of argument amounts to trying to cure someone with Alzheimer's by
scolding her about the intrinsic dignity and rationality of humans.
Lesions beat argument every time. So rather than taking recourse to
moralize the horror of control[, it is necessary to take seriously the
possibility of control as a material configuration enabled by the
inessential nature of humans: their plasticity]{.underline}.
Furthermore, I ask the reader to affirm the horror of destructive
plasticity rather than look away or flee into the arms of humanist
sentimentality.

#### The discourse of modernization is a foundational pillar of Western imperial hegemony -- it serves as the justification for the transformation of the "backwards" and "primitive" postcolonial world into a mirror of "enlightened civilization" by the Western savior of NATO -- reject the epistemic trajectory of the 1AC.

Modernization For Kennan, [the primary threat to Western security lay
not in Soviet military power but in the weakened fabric of Western
life]{.underline}. To counter this weakness, he argued, the decisive
policies should not be military encirclement but the rebuilding of
Western infrastructures. Writing in 1948 in the context of debates about
the European Recov- ery Plan, the ERP, Kennan argued: [This is the
significance of the ERP, the idea of European Union, and the cultiva-
tion of a closer association with the U.K. and Canada. For a truly
stable world order can proceed, within our lifetime, only from the
older, mellower and more advanced nations of the world-nations for which
the concept of order, as opposed to power, has value and
meaning.]{.underline} If these nations do not have the strength to seize
and hold real leadership in world affairs today, through that
combination of political greatness and wise restraint which goes only
with a ripe and settled civilization, then as Plato once remarked: \". .
. cities will never have rest from their evils,-no nor the human race,
as I believe.\" (Kennan, 1948:100) Kennan\'s famous \"Long Telegram\" of
1946 (Kennan, 1946:63) concluded with the observation that \"Much
depends on health and vigor of our own society. [World communism is like
a malignant parasite which feeds only on diseased tissue.\" This
medicalized representation]{.underline} was to find a more sustained
account in the work of W. W. Rostow, the architect of [modernization
theory and a key figure in the articulation of modern Western
identity]{.underline}. In Rostow\'s memorable words (1960:162,
1961:235), \"[Communism is a disease of the transition\" from
traditional to modern society. It would require Western military
intervention in the form of anti-guerrilla insurgents to staunch the
infection. To reconstruct the West, and to bring the rest of the world
along with it, would require therapies of
\"modernization.\"]{.underline} These would prove [cru- cial in the
development of a recognizably Western world order, for \"to modernize\"
would come to mean to improve, to upgrade, to make something better by
technical refinement.]{.underline} In both economic development and
military deterrence, [themes of \"modernization\" were to animate public
policy]{.underline}. Economic [modernization refers to the process of
enforced changes, implemented from above by a secular state system, that
strategically alter the social landscape and prepare the way for a
capitalist, market-oriented political economy]{.underline}. The master
plan for this reworking of international life was the self-consciously
proclaimed handbook of Westernization, Rostow\'s The Stages of Economic
Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (1960). The book was crucial in
setting the terms of [the subsequent \"development\"
paradigm]{.underline} (Gendzier, 1985:6). The basic idea was to [absorb
the newly independent, formerly colonial states into a global political
economy]{.underline}. Rostow\'s stages of growth presented the clearest
attempt [to draw the post-colonial world into the Western
orbit.]{.underline} His teleological unfolding of the various stages of
development [culminates in \"the age of high mass
consumption.\"]{.underline} As Rostow\'s words attest, the millennial
deliver- ance of life that results is truly an inspiring achievement:
\"The second stage of growth embraces societies in the process of
transition; that is, the period when the preconditions for take-off are
developed; for [this is the time to transform a tradi- tional society in
the ways necessary for it to exploit the fruits of modern science, to
fend off diminishing returns, and thus to enjoy the blessings and
choices opened up by the march of compound interest\"]{.underline}
(Rostow, 1960:6). This paean to impending affluence is a useful example
of how \"modernization\" draws its sustenance from particular
representations of life. Implicit in this celebra- tory account of
development is a series of conceptual commitments that need to be
brought to the foreground if practitioners concerned with \"developing\"
societies are to understand fully what analysts have in store for them.
[\"Traditional\" societies are seen as mired in a pre-Newtonian world,
confined to natural horizons with a fixed \"ceiling on the level of
attainable output per head\"]{.underline} (Rostow, 1960:4). Such a
limiting cosmology has to be transformed for modernization to proceed.
This \"pre-modern\" worldview is to be replaced by a recognizably
\"modern\" one of unlimited growth. Nature thereby becomes a resource
for use by human beings who now stand at the center of all things. [A
network of representations is called into play here: mutually dependent
concep- tions of nature, man, goods, and society. A set of dichotomies
is invoked, with the \"pre-Newtonian\" world on one side and \"modern\"
affluent cultures on the other: traditional society/modern society,
nature/science, subsistence/wealth. Only by tac- itly invoking these
dichotomous representations and invoking one side continually against
the other is Rostow\'s discourse of development possible.]{.underline}
But the mediation of the transition processes required here is by no
means politi- cally neutral. It is strikingly violent. Rostow\'s
developmental discourse draws upon a key [assumption that modern,
Western developed societies are simply better and more desirable than
traditional, pre-modern societies]{.underline}. Ever the economist, he
calls this \"the demonstration effect\" of modern technology and
lifestyles. The world\'s people really want Western products. Butjust in
case they don\'t-and here Rostow\'s text gets murky-they can always look
over the shoulder of traveling salesmen and see battleship guns in the
harbor. Surely, this is an impressive sight, one that demon- strates the
(potentially) superior effects of modern Western society. [Spurred on by
these \"demonstration effects\" of Western goods, the peoples of the
formerly colonial world are induced to follow along and to develop
themselves in the footsteps of their uninvited guests.]{.underline} When
problems develop in the modernization process, the state steps in to
expe- dite change. Rostow, writing in the heady days of development, was
characteristically sanguine about this process, seeing as the only
obstacle the unfortunate tampering by Communist elements-whom, he
argued, could be dealt with through covert action and counter-insurgency
warfare. [When more profound social problems threatened the
developmental process, more sophisticated forms of military and
paramilitary involvement would be needed]{.underline}. Samuel P.
Huntington, with a keener eye than Rostow towards the political
difficulties of modernization and thus more attuned to the prerequisites
of institution building, delivered the theoretical justifica- tion for
the constructive, socially transformative role of Third World military
elites in his Political Order and Changing Societies (1968). Looking
favorably upon the contri- bution to modernization of such reformers as
Ataturk, Nasser, and Sukarno, Hun- tington argued that in elite-bound,
traditional societies, [the military represents a new and liberating
political force that can break the hold of reactionary forces and loosen
their hold upon the economy and culture]{.underline}. In other words,
[the domestic military had to be cultivated as part of the state
building process, in the name of enforced mod- ernization from
above]{.underline}. To prepare local elites for this task, a whole
series of mea- sures would be needed, ranging from police training, the
sale of arms designed for local use against domestic sources of
turbulence, and the defeat of revolutionary labor movements in the name
of creating favorable climates for international invest- ment and wage
assembly work (Packenham, 1973; Augelli and Murphy, 1988; Klein and
Unger, 1989). This, too, was the stuff of modernization. It was always
part of postwar U.S. strategy, and it represents the dark underside of
the developmental process[. As a discourse of reconstruction,
developmental modernization provided an architecture for the physical
and social reshaping of the global landscape.]{.underline} In Europe
this was conducted under the umbrella of the Marshall Plan. [Globally,
the impetus for this reorientation of life was provided by the World
Bank, Truman\'s Point Four Pro- gram, Kennedy\'s Peace Corps, and a
panoply of political-economic-military alliance projects that linked
domestic state building with transnational integration under the U.S.
aegis]{.underline} (Barnet, 1972; Fagen, 1979). In the absence of any
identifiable external threats to such areas as Latin America or the
Southwest Pacific, for instance, the only plausible argument for the
creation of the Rio Pact in 1947 or ANZUS was to use a military security
bond as the cutting edge for state/society building along modern,
Western lines. In Europe, however, [the invocation of an external
security threat enjoyed a modicum of plausibility merely through the
existence of Soviet \"other- ness.\" Continental unity had been
shattered]{.underline}, after all. Central Europe disappeared in the
spring of 1945. Throughout the postwar era, there were only East and
West. [The task of defining the boundaries and limits of Western
identity was made considerably easier with the creation on the other
side of the Iron Curtain of an adversary whose culture and world view
offered, it was argued, a reverse image of everything cele- brated by
the emergent allies]{.underline}.

China as lawless bully: maritime disputes

To cheat and thief, we can layer [the trope of lawlessness]{.underline},
[readily employed in]{.underline} media **[representations and political
rhetoric]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} **[maritime]{.underline}**
[territorial and EEZ **disputes**]{.underline} [involving China and its
neighbors]{.underline} in the Western Pacific. China's territorial
claims [in the South China Sea]{.underline} are largely historical in
nature and do encroach on the 200 nautical miles EEZ of neighboring
countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam. The United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) does not expressly prohibit
land reclamation in the sea as long as due notice is given to other
concerned states and due regard to the rights of other states (Art.
60.3, 56.2, and 56.3) is taken into account, while the obligation to
protect and preserve the marine environment is observed (Art. 192).
Parties to a dispute are also obligated to refrain from acting in a
manner that would jeopardize or hamper a final agreement resolving the
dispute (Art. 74.3 and 83.3). The frantic [building of artificial
islands to enhance the legality of China's claims, unilateral
installations, and skirmishes in the disputed areas are thus amenable to
interpretation as lawless bullying]{.underline}. An editorial in the
Wall Street Journal titled "Calling Out China's Lawlessness; The US
Points Out that Beijing's Claims to the South China Sea Don't Stand Up,"
describes the "sketchy legality of its \[Beijing's\] actions" and claims
that "China is changing the status quo in the [South China
Sea]{.underline} with force and the [threat of force]{.underline}"
("Calling Out," 2014). This [characterization]{.underline} in the media
[is consistent with political rhetoric]{.underline}. US Secretary of
State John Kerry was reported to have said in May 2014 that China's
"introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters
disputed with Vietnam was provocative" (Ives & Fuller, 2014). Eliot
Engel of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee framed
China's actions in skirmishes with Vietnam [as]{.underline} "[needless
provocations]{.underline}" (Engel, 2014).

At the same time, [media representations and political rhetoric have
tended to obscure the fact that China's regional neighbors all built
airstrips and outposts on the claimed islands long before China ever
did]{.underline}. [China also]{.underline} displays inconsistent
behavior in that it has reached [agreements with Vietnam in the Gulf of
Tonkin and South Korea in the Yellow Sea to divide fisheries equally and
carry out joint enforcement patrols in keeping with international
law]{.underline}.3 Indeed, [China has in land disputes signed "fair and
balanced" treaties with 13 out of 14 neighbors in keeping with
international legal principles]{.underline} (Kraska, 2015). These
instances have not, however, drawn any significant media attention.
Instead, the [emphasis on China's non-compliance with international law
in the South China Sea disputes has served to **recapitulate China in
Orientalist terms** as **uncivilized**]{.underline} and, moreover, [as a
fully awakened]{.underline} **["sleeping giant"]{.underline}** [that
bullies its neighbors and is unsuited to replace the US as regional
leader]{.underline}. **[US]{.underline}** **[political
rhetoric]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} media
**[representation]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} also [obscured the
vagueness of international law when applied to the East China Sea
dispute as it would be inconsistent with the image of China as a lawless
bully in the South China Sea]{.underline}. The UNCLOS appears to have a
straightforward framework that gives states maritime jurisdiction over
resources 200 nautical miles from their coastal baseline, but it says
nothing about how overlapping maritime jurisdictions are to be resolved.
In the case of the East China Sea, the area of dispute is only 360 miles
across at its widest point. At the heart of the territorial dispute
between China and Japan is the "territorial acquisition" of the
Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, but there is no convention on how states
acquire sovereignty over disputed territories.4 The flexibility of
applicable principles in international customary law have instead
allowed both China and Japan to invoke the law to justify their claims
to sovereignty (Ramos-Mrosovsky, 2008). [China's refusal to have the
dispute adjudicated by an international body reflects the
unpredictability of outcomes and not necessarily China's
lawlessness]{.underline}, especially when viewed, [in light of a similar
disinterest on the part of the Japanese.]{.underline}

The **[essentialization of China as lawless]{.underline}**, [despite the
malleability of international law and dissimilar behavior]{.underline}
in other disputes, [has the potential to drive a wedge between China and
her neighbors, thus "containing" China's growing influence in the
region]{.underline}. Indeed, the depiction of China as a lawless bully
plays up the insecurities of its immediate---and in many cases, much
weaker---neighbors, whose heavy reliance on international law to
constrain hegemonic behavior is palpable. [The breaking of norms has
been identified as a crucial signal that heightens threat
perception]{.underline} (Farnham, 2003). In the context of long-standing
maritime territorial disputes, [playing up an image of China as a
lawless bully also suggests that the United States continues to be a
**necessary** power broker in the region]{.underline}. The notion that
there is an overbearing bully in the neighborhood that could care less
about the rules of the game [returns the United States to the **role of
protector** in the post--Cold War period---its ostensible **"manifest
destiny."**]{.underline} Since the late 1990s, titles such as "Spratly
Spat Heats up over Chinese 'Bullying'" (Lamb, 1998) or "Asian Nations
Support US Silently" (Wiseman, 2001) [demonstrate how constructing China
as a lawless bully serves to reinforce this purpose]{.underline}.
Indeed, a recent editorial in The Wall Street Journal makes this link
explicit in the text: Washington's hesitant response has allowed
controversy to build around freedom-of-navigation missions that should
be routine. Beijing's strategy in the South China Sea is to bully its
neighbors and achieve regional hegemony through coercive means short of
war. Turning peaceful naval patrols into diplomatic hot potatoes is
exactly the sort of change Beijing seeks. ("A 12-Mile," 2015)

Here, [China's behavior is portrayed as incorrigibly belligerent, in
distinct contrast to genteel US diplomacy]{.underline}. One Wall Street
Journal article makes this point clear in its title alone: "Chinese
Diplomacy Off Course; By Overreaching in the South China Sea, Beijing
has Drawn the US Irrevocably into the Debate" (Wain, 2000). This article
embodies the dominant narrative that assumes implicitly the rightful
role of the United States to dole out proper diplomacy and take on any
transgressors to maintain world peace. A Wall Street Journal article
describing China's "increasingly powerful---but highly opaque---military
and its more assertive stance \[towards the South China Sea\]" emphasize
China's military as an inherent threat to world order but construct the
US military according to a different standard, again assuming the
righteousness of US military intervention (Page, 2011). In this regard,
[it is important to note that US grand strategy consists of preventing
the development of any regional power capable of obstructing US access
to Eurasia---where most of the world's resources and economic activity
are located]{.underline}. This long-term security goal has informed the
Obama administration's much-touted Pacific Pivot policy, which many have
viewed as a "China containment policy." A Congressional Report notes
that although U.S. policymakers have not often stated this key national
strategic goal explicitly in public, U.S. military (and diplomatic)
operations in recent decades---both wartime operations and day-to-day
operations---can be viewed as having been carried out in no small part
in support of this key goal. (O'Rourke, 2014) China's territorial claims
in the South China Sea cover about 90% of the area that could
potentially allow China to deny the United States such access. As China
continues with the modernization of its naval and air capabilities, [US
apprehension has increased that the disputed land features in the South
China Sea are being used to bolster military and coast guard forces that
can monitor and respond to the activities of US allies]{.underline},
deny the US navy access to these waters, [and]{.underline} ultimately
[check US naval dominance]{.underline} in the region.

It is for this reason that the United States has insisted on freedom of
navigation and innocent passage---protected by UNCLOS---through these
contested waters, although tensions with China have ratcheted up
considerably as a result. As direct conflict between the United States
and China has become a real possibility, and as the United States has
not ratified the UNCLOS, the United States has attempted to base its
actions on firm legal principles, and in turn, to frame China's behavior
in the region as lawlessness. [Through US portrayals of China as a
lawless bully, China incurs **reputational costs** in the global and
regional community that have the potential to exert pressure on China to
stand down.]{.underline} The guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen was
thus sent in October 2015 on a "freedom of navigation" patrol within 12
nautical miles of islands artificially built by China in the Spratly
chain, which the United States insists is in compliance with
international law.5 The United States revealed this aim in another
dispute on whether China has an international legal right to regulate
foreign military actors operating within China's 200-nautical-mile EEZ.
The United States' view, which China disagrees with, is that China has a
right to restrict military and surveillance activities only within 12
nautical miles of its territorial waters. Tensions reached new heights
when China announced in November 2013 an East China Sea Air Defense
Identification Zone (ADIZ) that not only covered her territorial waters
but extended into its EEZ and thus, the contested areas in the East
China Sea. US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel responded in a press
statement that "We view this development as a destabilizing attempt to
alter the status quo in the region. This unilateral action increases the
risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations," yet the United States
followed shortly by flying two B-52 bombers through the zone (Harlan,
2013). Certainly, there have been media analyses that characterize
China's behavior as motivated by normal national self-interest or that
point out that US actions to curtail China are "hypocritical" and
"hegemonic" (see, for example, Denyer, 2015; Wu, 2005). However, many
more choose to reprise long-standing debates about whether China is a
military threat or not, with titles such as "US Starting to View China
as Potential Enemy" (Mann, 1995) and "Weakening Yet Still Aggressive,
China Poses Test for U.S. Presidential Candidates" (Sanger, 2015). [None
take seriously China's claims that its actions in the region have
been]{.underline} **[defensive in nature]{.underline}**. Even with a
wide range of opinions on the matter, by [focusing on the issue of
China's military buildup]{.underline}, [these]{.underline} news articles
[only serve to heighten this perceived threat by inferring threatening
intent from growing military capabilities]{.underline}.

Political rhetoric tends to contain far less ambiguity, however, some
even going so far as to suggest that the United States has been
unnecessarily patient toward China. Senator John McCain (2016), Chairman
of the Committee of Armed Services, thus commended and encouraged the
continuance of the freedom-of-navigation operation of October 2015,
adding that "this decision is long overdue." In a keynote speech
delivered at the Fourth Annual CSIS South China Sea Conference in 2014,
Representative Mike Rogers (R-MI), Chairman of the House Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence further advised that the United States
should stop being "deferential" to China's "naked aggression" as it
continues to "bully" and "intimidate" its neighbors.6 Indeed,
**[political rhetoric]{.underline}** [appears to take China's image as
lawless to its]{.underline} [**logical conclusion**---China as the
full-fledged threat to regional stability **legitimizes** any force that
the United States might be compelled to take in the future to contain
such a threat]{.underline}. [Unpacking the great power
rivalry]{.underline} in the maritime disputes thus [helps us to
understand the **cultural work** that the trope of lawless bully does to
bolster the long-term security objectives of the United States in the
region]{.underline}.

[Colonial conquest]{.underline} typically [entails]{.underline}
dispossession of valuable resources from the native peoples and the
ownership and **[control of critical infrastructure]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} **[colonial powers]{.underline}**. [In South Africa,
shortly after diamonds and gold were discovered]{.underline} in
Kimberley and the Witwatersrand, a handful of [mining magnates seized
the most valuable land]{.underline}. The Oppenheimer family dynasty
controlled almost all the country's diamonds, half the gold and
platinum, and a quarter of the coal. With their accumulated riches, they
obtained critical stakes in many other industries, including banking,
steel, auto, electronics, and agriculture.21 [In many parts of the
Global South, **critical infrastructure** such as railways were designed
by colonial powers not to benefit the indigenous population, but to
service the mother country]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} the
arrangement that emerged through [European colonialism, raw materials
were extracted by exploited local labor and shipped back to the
empire]{.underline}. In some cases, [colonial forces would import the
cheap, machine-made industrial products to the villages, undermining
local artisans and the capacity to build competitor
industries]{.underline}. In Africa and elsewhere, railroads were built
from the country interior straight to the ports and military stations,
with little "spread effect" to connect up the indigenous people. [The
architectural design of the production system was not engineered to
benefit the local inhabitants, but to "serve immediate European
needs"]{.underline}.22 [Under]{.underline} **[digital
colonialism]{.underline}**, [foreign powers]{.underline}, **[led by the
United States]{.underline}**, are [plant]{.underline}ing [infrastructure
in the Global South engineered for its own needs, enabling economic and
cultural domination while imposing **privatized forms of
governance**]{.underline}. To accomplish this task, **[major
corporations]{.underline}** [design digital technology to ensure their
own dominance over critical functions in the tech
ecosystem]{.underline}. This allows them to accumulate profits from
revenues derived from rent (in the form of intellectual property or
access to infrastructure) and surveillance (in the form of Big Data). It
also [empowers them to exercise control over the flow of
information]{.underline} (such as the distribution of news and streaming
services), [social activities]{.underline} (like social networking and
cultural exchange), [and a plethora of other political, social,
economic, and military functions mediated by their
technologies]{.underline}. **[The control of code is foundational to
digital domination]{.underline}**. In Code: And Other Laws of
Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig (1999/2006) famously argued that [computer
code shapes the rules, norms, and behaviors of computer-mediated
experiences in ways similar to architecture in physical
space]{.underline} [(e.g. imperial railways designed for
colonization)]{.underline}.23 As a result, "**[code is
law]{.underline}**" [in the sense that it has the power to usurp legal,
institutional, and social norms impacting the political, economic, and
cultural domains of society.]{.underline} This critical insight has been
applied in fields like copyright, free speech regulation, Internet
governance, blockchain, privacy, and even torts. [What has been missed,
however, is how US dominance of code --- and other forms of digital
architecture --- **usurps sovereignty** in foreign
countries]{.underline}. [The **power of the United States over
code**]{.underline} [and other digital infrastructure constitutes
a]{.underline} **[new form of imperialism]{.underline}**. [Digital forms
of power are linked together through the]{.underline} three [core
pillars of the digital ecosystem]{.underline}: software, hardware, and
network connectivity.24 Software is the set of instructions that define
and determine what your computer can do. Hardware is the physical
equipment used for computer experiences. The network is the set of
protocols and standards computers use to talk to each other, and the
connections they make. [Domination over these three elements ---
software, hardware, and networks --- provides a great source of power
over people]{.underline}. Let us consider each in turn. Software is the
coded logic that constrains and enables particular user experiences. For
example, [software determines rules and policies]{.underline} such as
whether or not users can post a message anonymously at a website, or
whether or not users can make a copy of a copyright-restricted file like
an e-book. The [rules that a programmer codes into the software largely
determines technological freedoms and shapes users' experiences using
their devices]{.underline}. [Thus]{.underline}, **[software exerts a
powerful influence]{.underline}** [on the behavior, policies, and
freedoms of people using digital technology]{.underline}. [Control over
software is a source of **digital domination**]{.underline} primarily
exercised through software licenses and hardware ownership. Free
Software licenses allow people to use, study, modify, and share software
as they see fit.25 By contrast, non-free software licenses grant a
software designer control over users by [precluding the ability to
exercise]{.underline} those [freedoms]{.underline}. With proprietary
software, the humanreadable source code is closed off to the public, and
owners usually restrict the ability to use the software without paying.
In the case of Microsoft Windows, for example, the public must pay for
the program in order to use it, they cannot read the source code to
understand how it works, they cannot change its behavior by changing the
code, and they cannot share a copy with others. Thus with proprietary
licensing, Microsoft maintains absolute control over how the software
works. The same goes for other proprietary apps, like Google Play or
Adobe Photoshop.26 By design, non-free software provides the owner power
over the user experience. It is authoritarian software. [Control over
hardware is a second source of digital domination]{.underline}. This can
take at least three forms: software run on third-party servers,
centralized ownership of hardware, or hardware designed to prevent users
from changing the software. Let us consider each of these in turn. In
the first instance, software is executed on someone else's computer. As
a result, users are dispossessed of their ability to control it. This is
typically accomplished through Software as a Service (SaaS) in the
cloud. For example, when you visit the Facebook website, the interface
you are provided executes on third party hardware (i.e. on Facebook's
cloud servers). Because users cannot change the code running on
Facebook's servers, they cannot get rid of the "like" button or change
the Facebook experience. "There is no cloud," the saying goes, "just
someone else's computer." [Corporations and other third parties design
cloud services for remote control over the user experience. This gives
them immense power over individuals, groups, and society.]{.underline}27
In the second instance, [people become **dispossessed** of hardware
ownership itself]{.underline}. With the rise of cloud computing, it is
possible that hardware manufacturers will soon only offer low-powered,
lowmemory devices (similar to the terminals of the 1960s and 1970s) and
computer processing and data storage will be primarily conducted in
centralized clouds. [With end-users dispossessed of processing power and
storage, software and data would be under the **absolute control** of
the owners and operators of clouds]{.underline}.28 In the third
instance, hardware is manufactured with locks that prevent users from
changing the software on the devices. By locking down devices to a
pre-determined set of software choices, the hardware manufacturer
determines which software is allowed to run when you turn on your
device.29 Thus, hardware restrictions can prevent the public from
controlling their devices, granting device manufacturers them power over
users. [Control over network connectivity is a third source of digital
domination]{.underline}. Net neutrality regulation proposes that
Internet traffic should be "neutral" so that Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) treat content flowing through their cables, cellular towers, and
satellites equally. According this philosophy, those who own the pipes
are "common carriers" and should almost never be allowed to manipulate
the data that flows through them.30 This constrains the ability of
wealthy media providers to pay for faster content delivery speeds than
less wealthy providers (such as grassroots organizations, small
businesses, and common people). More importantly, by treating traffic
equally, net neutrality prevents network discrimination against various
forms of traffic critical to civil rights and liberties. For example,
the Tor browser facilitates anonymous Internet communications, but the
use of the Tor network can be detected by Internet Service Providers and
throttled (i.e. slowed to a crawl).31 Net neutrality prevents this form
of discrimination and protects the end user's freedom to utilize the
Internet as they wish, without third party favoritism, blocking, or
throttling. [Each of the three pillars]{.underline} of the digital
ecosystem --- software, hardware, and network --- [constitute a source
of **power and control**]{.underline}. To illustrate the point, let us
consider some concrete examples related to social justice [in the Global
South]{.underline}. The copyright industry is threatened by the mass
sharing of paywalled publications over the Internet (what they
derisively label "piracy"). Given that hard drive capacity and Internet
speeds will rapidly increase over time, the capacity to share vast
libraries of music, movies, books, and other media is steadily
increasing. What will be done when each person has a 40 terabyte hard
drive and can trade the entire collection of popular music from the last
century within an hour? [**Advances in technology** deepen the need for
architectural control to police the copyright system]{.underline}. One
way to stop file sharing is to control software. The industry built
Digital Rights Management (DRM) software, for example, to prevent
copyright-restricted publications from playing on a user's computer
unless the user pays to access it first. This works well with
proprietary software because people cannot remove the DRM. However, if
the DRM software is Free Software --- which allows people the freedom to
use, study, modify, and share the software --- people can remove the DRM
code that locks the content. Thus, industry is bolstered by proprietary
software as a means to enforce copyright. A second way to prevent
sharing is to take control of the hardware. If, for example, people stop
running software on their own devices --- and instead run their computer
experiences through centralized cloud servers --- then cloud providers
can determine their "access" to copyrighted data. In this scenario,
users cannot copy and trade media over the Internet because the data
"streams" to their device from a content owner's platform (e.g. Netflix
or Spotify) which provides media content through their servers. Thus,
the [widespread distribution of storage capacity and broadband Internet
threatens the copyright monopoly]{.underline}.32 A third way to prevent
sharing media is to control the network. People may own and control
their software and hardware, but if they can be spied on by an ISP or
government, then they can be fined or arrested for copyright
infringement, or have their Internet connection throttled or terminated.
People might use privacy protection technologies to conceal their
content sharing --- such as the Tor network or Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs) --- but this can be thwarted by ISPs throttling Tor or VPNs. In
this scenario, control of the network (ISP discrimination) is used to
make anonymous content sharing impractical. Thus, [public control of the
network threatens copyright enforcement]{.underline}. [To bring this
back to colonialism, US multinationals have designed digital
architecture which, in one way or another, allows them to accumulate
vast fortunes based on rent or data extraction]{.underline}. [In the
case of copyright, control over software, hardware, or the Internet is
used to protect the copyright monopoly in the name of intellectual
property rights.]{.underline} Given that the marginal cost of producing
digital works is near-zero, prominent intellectuals have challenged
copyright paywalls in the interest of socioeconomic justice and out of
concern that draconian technologies are needed to enforce digital forms
of copyright.33 Free access to digital publications for all people on
planet earth, irrespective of their wealth, could improve education,
culture, equality, democracy, and innovation. [Western technology has
been engineered to block free sharing, which impoverishes poor people's
ability to obtain knowledge and culture and reduces communication
between rich and poor]{.underline}. Facebook's Free Basics service
offers another case example of how [Big Tech corporations expand empire
in the Global South]{.underline}. Free Basics offers a stripped-down
version of free Internet services to people with little or no disposable
income. Facebook decides which content and websites the poor can access
--- while of course offering Facebook itself within the app. Free Basics
is zero-rated by ISPs, meaning that data transfers inside the app are
paid for by ISPs instead of their customers. The ISPs hope that the
limited Internet experience will lead to paying customers who, having
tasted a free sample, will purchase data for the full experience. Free
Basics not only has Facebook playing Internet gatekeeper of the poor, it
also violates net neutrality laws: zero-rated offerings place content
providers on unequal footing. Several countries have terminated Free
Basics, in part due to popular backlash.34 However, Internet.org has put
over 100 million users from over 60 countries --- including South Africa
--- into the Facebook platform, which channels them towards the Facebook
ecosystem. Integrating platforms like Facebook outside the US does more
than drain local advertising revenue: it undermines various forms of
local governance. Seventy-five percent of web publisher's traffic now
comes from Google (46%) and Facebook (29%).35 Centralization of services
into their hands provides them with centralized control over
communications --- by way of code. These two firms filter search results
and news feeds with proprietary black box algorithms, granting them
enormous power to shape who sees which news. Leftist outlets have
published data suggesting that Google censors socialist views, while
Facebook has been found to favor mainstream liberal media.36 [Platforms
also regulate freedom of speech and association]{.underline}.37 If an
online social network detects certain keywords and forms of speech, they
can censor it, or ban the user. Moreover, they can prohibit the right to
associate with others in the pursuit of social, political, economic,
cultural, and religious ends. This has been carried out against
Palestinians (e.g. with the removal of the page for the political party,
Fatah), as well as the far-right.38 [As private overlords of critical
information infrastructure, US multinationals have the power to regulate
the press, speech, and association in foreign territories, as they see
fit. These examples demonstrate how **structural domination of the tech
ecosystem** **undermines local sovereignty** through privatized forms of
political, economic, and social governance]{.underline}. [This helps the
US]{.underline} perpetuate copyright paywalls, [control information
flows, spread their platform monopolies, supplant local autonomy, filter
communications, and deepen dependency on the US]{.underline}. In turn,
[corporations increasingly profit from **Big Data surveillance**, an
exploitative human rights transgression **against the Global
South**.]{.underline} We discuss this element next.

#### BigTech is the [newest iteration]{.underline} of corporate colonialization that [extracts]{.underline} the Global South.

[Under colonialism, Europeans dispossessed the natives of their land,
settled their territories, put them to work as slaves and servants,
instituted horrific acts of violence, and perpetuated dependency and
plunder through strategic underdevelopment]{.underline}. [Corporations
played a]{.underline} **[pivotal role]{.underline}** [through
the]{.underline} "**[pathological pursuit of profit and
power]{.underline}**".8 In 1602, the Dutch East India Company became the
first modern global corporation. Fifty years later, they initiated
European conquest in Southern Africa with the establishment of the Cape
Colony. [Over the next two centuries, whites seized large swaths of land
as colonists expanded into the interior. After the discovery of diamonds
and gold, the British and the Afrikaners consolidated the remaining
majority of land and further subjugated the African population under
racist regimes of labor exploitation.]{.underline} In no time flat, a
handful of corporations came to dominate large parts of the economy.9
[Today, a]{.underline} **[new form of corporate
colonization]{.underline}** [is taking place]{.underline}. [Instead of
the conquest of land, Big Tech corporations are colonizing digital
technology]{.underline}. The following functions are all dominated by a
handful of US multinationals: search engines ([Google]{.underline}); web
browsers (Google Chrome); smartphone and tablet operating systems
(Google [Android]{.underline}, [Apple]{.underline} iOS); desktop and
laptop operating systems (Microsoft Windows); office software (Microsoft
Office, Google Docs); cloud infrastructure and services ([Amazon,
Microsoft, Google, IBM]{.underline}); social networking platforms
([Facebook, Twitter]{.underline}); transportation (Uber, Lyft); business
networking (Microsoft LinkedIn); streaming video (Google YouTube,
Netflix, Hulu); and online advertising (Google, Facebook) --- among
others. [GAFAM now comprise the five wealthiest corporations in the
world]{.underline}, with a combined market cap exceeding \$3 trillion.10
If South Africans integrate Big Tech products into their society, the
United States will obtain enormous power over their economy and create
technological dependencies that will lead to perpetual resource
extraction. As an empirical matter, this point has been understudied.
Nevertheless, early [research]{.underline} and anecdotes [suggest the
economic impact of Big Tech intermediaries is detrimental to local
African industries]{.underline}. Murphy, Carmody, and Surborg studied
the role of ICTs among small, medium, and microsized enterprises (SMMEs)
in South Africa's and Tanzania's wood and tourism industries. They found
that [ICTs]{.underline} introduced the dominance of information
intermediaries. Increased use of ICTs also [led to greater worker
surveillance]{.underline} in some instances. They concluded that [ICT
integration is, on balance, benefiting foreign-owned businesses and
corporations]{.underline}.11 [Similar conclusions can be derived from
press accounts of the transportation industry]{.underline}. Since Uber
began operating in Johannesburg in 2013, there have been labor strikes
and violent clashes in the "South African taxi wars". Several e-hailing
taxi murders have been carried out by metered taxi drivers, who have
warned that Uber will "burn" if it remains in South Africa. At the same
time, many Uber drivers endure onerous working conditions for low pay.12
Uber has had devastating effects in Africa and beyond.13 The company
takes around 25% commission for each trip, in addition to hidden
costs,14 leading to an outflow of revenue from the local economy to
foreign coffers. Moreover, they are able to undercut local markets by
offering artificially low prices: Uber can operate at a loss --- to the
tune of billions --- thanks to funding from Wall Street and other
wealthy investors.15 [With the backing of corporate finance, it
leverages predatory subsidies, network effects, Big Data analytics, and
the deregulatory effects of its position as an "intermediary" to stamp
out competition and colonize the market]{.underline}. Within just two
years, Uber sported a net worth of R1.65 billion (\~\$125 million)
inside SA.16 Similar problems have emerged in the media. In April 2017,
the online news outlet GroundUp dropped Google Ads from its website.
GroundUp's Nathan Geffen explains the Google advertising model is
"broken" for publishers who "have to put up with poor quality,
misleading adverts in exchange for small change." "The problem," Geffen
says, "is that nearly all the power in the online advertising
relationship lies with Google." The ad giant also serves up censorship
threats: in one example, Google issued a warning to GroundUp for
publishing a picture containing a painted bare breast as part of a
protest action.17 In November 2017, Financial Mail's Anton Harber wrote
a feature story deeming Google and Facebook "the biggest threat to South
African news media".18 Google takes 70% of local online advertising,
while social media --- led by Facebook --- takes another 12%. The major
SA media groups are left with just 8% of the pie. The Google and
Facebook "nemesis" are an expanding duopoloy: they take 77% of online
advertising spend in the US and captured virtually all the ad growth in
2016.19 If his continues, Harber exclaims, "the big two could have a
devastating effect on the media's role in defining democracy".20 These
[early case examples --- the thin integration of ICTs into the wood and
tourism industries in South Africa and Tanzania, Uber colonization of
taxi markets, and the rising dominance of Google and Facebook in South
African media --- provide clear instances of digital colonialism whereby
foreign corporations undermine local development, dominate the market,
and extract revenue from the Global South]{.underline}. As we see next,
[this power is obtained primarily through the **structural domination of
digital architecture**, which leads to more general forms of **imperial
control**.]{.underline}

Considering the public media attention and concern about possible
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it is worth
reminding people about NATO's bloody history in Africa. [NATO was
founded]{.underline} in 1949 after WWII at a time [when African
countries were still under the yoke of colonialism]{.underline}. In fact
most of [the original founders of NATO had been **Africa's principal
colonizers**]{.underline} such as UK, France, Portugal, Belgium, Italy
and the USA as lead NATO organizer and dominant partner. The
organization was established as a collective defense against the Soviet
Union with the requirement (Article 5) that any attack on one was
considered an attack on all and therefore requiring a collective
response.

Since NATO was founded with the purported purpose of halting possible
Soviet aggression and stopping the spread of Communism it would seem to
follow that after the collapse of the USSR in 1991 there would no longer
be a need for NATO. Since then however, [NATO has
**expanded**]{.underline} from the founding twelve [to]{.underline} at
present [thirty member states]{.underline} many of whom are eastern
European countries, formerly Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact allies.
Today, [[NATO has become a]{.mark} **huge [axel]{.mark}** [in
the]{.mark} wheel of the **[m]{.mark}ilitary [i]{.mark}ndustrial
[c]{.mark}omplex controlled by U.S. empire**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark}
the purpose of **full spectrum [dominance]{.mark}**[, driven by]{.mark}
the **ferocious appetites** of **corporate
[capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Colonial Africa as NATO Bases

Walter Rodney accurately describes the early foundation of colonial
Africa's relationship with NATO which continues today as he described in
How Europe Underdeveloped Africa:

> Needless to say, in the 1950's when most Africans were still colonial
> subjects, they had absolutely no control over the utilization of their
> soil for militaristic ends. Virtually [the whole of North Africa was

> the whites of South Africa and Rhodesia and the government of the USA.
> Time and time again, the [evidence points to this cynical use of

> militarily**]{.underline}, and therefore in effect [[forc]{.mark}ing
> [Africa to **contribute to its**]{.mark} **own
> [exploitation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \[emphasis added\]1

Kwame Nkrumah had already warned in his 1967 Challenge of the Congo that
there were at least seventeen air bases, nine foreign naval bases, three
rocket sites and an atomic testing range operated by NATO in in North
Africa, in addition to military missions in about a dozen other African
countries, not to mention the exploitation of raw materials for the
production of nuclear weapons occurring in the mines of Congo, Angola,
South Africa and Rhodesia.2 Nkrumah called for the urgent need to
counter the challenge of NATO in the strategy he outlined in his
Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare which included the call for a military
high command and an All African People's Revolutionary Army (AAPRA).3

The example of Portugal, as one of the original members of NATO is worth
exploring. The great freedom fighter of Africa, Amilcar Cabral, called
Portugal "a rotten appendage of imperialism" he said, "Portugal is the
most underdeveloped country in Western Europe. Portugal would never be
able to launch three colonial wars in Africa without the help of NATO,
the weapons of NATO, the planes of NATO the bombs- it would be
impossible for them."4

Cabral goes on to explain that the only reason Portugal was able to hold
on to its colonies in Africa is because it had been a semi-colony of
Britain since 1775 and Britain defended Portugal's interest during the
partition of Africa. Furthermore NATO, a creation of the U.S., uses
Portugal and its colonies as part of the larger objective of domination
of Africa and the world.5 Portugal conducted a vicious war against its
colonies in Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, and Mozambique much like
the U.S. did in Vietnam. In both cases, colonizing powers used the most
modern weapons including napalm and cluster bombing campaigns killing
thousands, against guerilla armies that refused to bow down. The
Portuguese dictator Marcelo Caetano was forced to give up economic
interests in Angola to some of the NATO powers in exchange for the NATO
armaments and supplies used.6 Yet, Portugal still lost the war against
the heroic anti-colonial forces.

NATO's Strategy of Neo-colonialism

[Imperialism has always used its strategy of divide and rule. To enable
the acceptance of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} idea of a **[['benevolent'
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [colonial powers knew that they had to
convince and [recruit a **neo-colonial class**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
indigenous Africans who would do their bidding. This divide played
itself out in the national liberation movements between those who were
friendly to imperialist forces and those who wanted a real break from
colonialism. Nkrumah explains in Neo-colonialism, The Last Stage of
Imperialism, the wide array of [[methods]{.underline}]{.mark} employed
by neocolonialism, [[rang]{.mark}ing [from **economic**]{.mark}**,
political, religious, ideological [and cultural]{.mark}
spheres**]{.underline}. To do this, [[NATO works **hand in
hand**]{.mark} [with **other mechanisms of imperialism**]{.mark} like
the **CIA**]{.underline} 7 which was [instrumental in the coup
against]{.underline} the [Nkrumah]{.underline} government and the murder
of Patrice Lumumba.

The settler colony of Azania/[South Africa]{.underline} would be another
example of a NATO outpost. From the beginning it [was obviously on the
side of]{.underline} the Western/ [NATO]{.underline} powers since [it
was essentially a colony of Britain and therefore was a **NATO
surrogate**]{.underline}. In 1955 South Africa and Britain formulated
the Simonstown agreements which contained provision for the naval
surveillance and defense of the African continent from Cape to Cairo. In
spite of a purported arms embargo, NATO countries and Israel also
provided South Africa with the necessary technology to develop nuclear
weapons.

NATO & AFRICOM

[AFRICOM is]{.underline} actually [a direct product of
**NATO**]{.underline} via EUCOM, the U.S. European command. [EUCOM is a
central part of NATO and originally]{.underline} also [took
responsibility for 42 African states]{.underline}. In 2004 NATO ended a
five-year period of expansion; in 2007 the EUCOM commander proposed the
creation of AFRICOM. James L. Jones Jr. explains how he came to make the
proposal for AFRICOM from his position as commander of EUCOM as well as
commander of operational forces of NATO.

The U.S./NATO role in the destruction of [Libya]{.underline} in 2011 is
important to highlight because it [offers some **important
lessons**]{.underline}. First, [U.S. [imperialism]{.mark} and its
western lackies [do not accept **any country** that **decides to
be**]{.mark} **an [independent]{.mark} force**]{.underline} [outside of
its **sphere of influence**]{.underline}. Secondly, [it also
demonstrates how NATO can work **hand in hand** with other
U.S]{.underline}./western [dominated world structures like the
UN]{.underline}. In 2011 the UN (resolution 1973) gave political
authorization for a "no fly zone" and blockade of Libya purportedly to
"protect" its citizens but which ultimately resulted in the destruction
of Africa's most prosperous country with the highest Human Development
Index.

U.S. led NATO forces launched a bombing campaign that killed thousands
of civilians and caused tens of billions of property and infrastructure
damage. This shows that although [U.S.-led [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}
sometimes uses the UN for political cover, it [has no problem
**illegally overstepping**]{.underline} [its]{.underline} UN [mandate to
[commit]{.mark} its **[crimes against humanity]{.mark}** and achieve its
**regime change goals**]{.underline}. Even a few countries that
abstained from the UN vote like China said they did so as not to offend
the reactionary Arab League and the African Union which approved of the
resolution. In this case indirect and direct [cooperation between NATO,
the UN, the AU, and the Arab League]{.underline} (which includes the GCC
countries) [shows the **expansive and deeply woven web** of U.S. and
NATO reach.]{.underline}

The book The Illegal War on Libya edited by Cynthia McKinney, includes
the chapter titled "NATO's Libya War, A Nuremberg Level Crime" in which
Stephen Ledman writes:

> "The U.S.-led NATO war on [Libya will be remembered as one of

Jackson called aggressive war "the greatest menace of our times."
International law defines crimes against peace as "planning,
preparation, initiation, or waging of wars of aggression, or a war in
violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or
participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of
any of the foregoing."

**[[All]{.mark} U.S.]{.underline}** post-WWII [[wars fall under
**this**]{.mark} **definition**]{.underline}. Since then, America
[\[[U.S.\]]{.mark}]{.underline} [has [waged]{.mark} **direct** and
**[proxy]{.mark} premeditated**]{.underline}, aggressive
**[[wars]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}**. It has [[killed]{.mark}
**[millions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in East and Central Asia, North and
other parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe, as well as in
Central and South America.]{.underline}8

Those mentioned here are but a small sampling of NATO/AFRICOM's bloody
works in Africa's past. [NATO continues to operate under
guise]{.underline} the [of "**training**" and "**humanitarian**"
peacekeeping]{.underline} assistance. Jihadist terrorist violence on the
continent has increased since the founding of AFRICOM and NATO's
destruction of Libya resulting in civilian casualties and instability
which the west has used as pretext and justification for the continued
need for AFRICOM. As the Black Alliance for Peace's AFRICOM watch
bulletin reported, since the founding of AFRICOM there has also been an
[increase in coups by **AFRICOM trained soldiers**]{.underline}.

Consistent with what Nkrumah, Rodney and others warned of in the 1960's
and 1970's [NATO continues today in the form of AFRICOM
[facilitating]{.mark} **wars, [instability, and]{.mark} the corporate
[pillage]{.mark} of Africa**. The]{.underline} Democratic Republic of
Congo ([DRC]{.underline}) for example [is continuously [plundered
for]{.mark} its **strategic raw [materials]{.mark}**]{.underline} such
as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, coltan, and uranium etc.
[These]{.underline} minerals [are]{.underline} strategically
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[for **electronic**]{.mark}
**device[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} but [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} for
the [[tech]{.mark}nologies [that drive the **m**]{.mark}**ilitary
[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex**. AFRICOM continues to rely on its
neocolonial African proxies to fight **wars on its behalf**]{.underline}
in the DRC [and throughout Africa to achieve its
objectives]{.underline}. With the rise of China, the [[U.S]{.mark}./NATO
now seek to [ensure]{.mark} **full spectrum [dominance]{.mark}** [that
seeks to **shut China**]{.mark}]{.underline} or any other country
**[[out]{.mark} of the competition to control global
capital]{.underline}**.

#### [The gratuitous violence of African colonialism is the unseen underside of enlightened modernity \-- the rise of NATO is inextricably tied to the colonial governance of Africa -- NATO serves as a proxy of the military industrial complex operationalized in service of genocidal extermination and expropriation of African land and peoples.]{.underline}

Considering the public media attention and concern about possible
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it is worth
reminding people about [NATO's bloody history in Africa. NATO was
founded in 1949 after WWII at a time when African countries were still
under the yoke of colonialism]{.underline}. In fact [most of the
original founders of NATO had been Africa's principal colonizers such as
UK, France, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and the USA as lead NATO organizer
and dominant partner.]{.underline} The organization was established as a
collective defense against the Soviet Union with the requirement
(Article 5) that any attack on one was considered an attack on all and
therefore requiring a collective response. Since NATO was founded with
the purported purpose of halting possible Soviet aggression and stopping
the spread of Communism it would seem to follow that after the collapse
of the USSR in 1991 there would no longer be a need for NATO. Since then
however, NATO has expanded from the founding twelve to at present thirty
member states many of whom are eastern European countries, formerly
Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact allies. Today, [NATO has become a huge
axel in the wheel of the military industrial complex controlled by U.S.
empire for the purpose of full spectrum dominance, driven by the
ferocious appetites of corporate capital.]{.underline} Colonial Africa
as NATO Bases Walter Rodney accurately describes [the early foundation
of colonial Africa's relationship]{.underline} with [NATO which
continues today]{.underline} as he described in How Europe
Underdeveloped Africa: Needless to say, [in the 1950's when most
Africans were still colonial subjects, they had absolutely no control
over the utilization of their soil for militaristic ends. Virtually the
whole of North Africa was turned into a sphere of operations for NATO,
with bases aimed at the Soviet Union]{.underline}. There could have
easily developed a nuclear war without African peoples having any
knowledge of the matter[. The colonial powers actually held military
conferences in African cities like Dakar and Nairobi in the early
1950's, inviting the whites of South Africa and Rhodesia and the
government of the USA.]{.underline} Time and time again, the evidence
points to [this cynical use of Africa to buttress capitalism
economically and militarily, and therefore in effect forcing Africa to
contribute to its own exploitation]{.underline}. \[emphasis added\]1
Kwame Nkrumah had already warned in his 1967 Challenge of the Congo that
[there were at least seventeen air bases, nine foreign naval bases,
three rocket sites and an atomic testing range operated by NATO in in
North Africa, in addition to military missions in about a dozen other
African countries, not to mention the exploitation of raw materials for
the production of nuclear weapons occurring in the mines of Congo,
Angola, South Africa and Rhodesia.]{.underline}2 Nkrumah called for [the
urgent need to counter the challenge of NATO in the strategy he outlined
in his Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare which included the call for a
military high command and an All African People's Revolutionary
Army]{.underline} (AAPRA).3 The example of Portugal, as one of the
original members of NATO is worth exploring. The great freedom fighter
of Africa, Amilcar Cabral, called Portugal "a rotten appendage of
imperialism" he said, "Portugal is the most underdeveloped country in
Western Europe. Portugal would never be able to launch three colonial
wars in Africa without the help of NATO, the weapons of NATO, the planes
of NATO the bombs- it would be impossible for them."4 Cabral goes on to
explain that the only reason Portugal was able to hold on to its
colonies in Africa is because it had been a semi-colony of Britain since
1775 and Britain defended Portugal's interest during the partition of
Africa. Furthermore NATO, a creation of the U.S., uses Portugal and its
colonies as part of the larger objective of domination of Africa and the
world.5 Portugal conducted a vicious war against its colonies in Guinea
Bissau, Cape Verde, Angola, and Mozambique much like the U.S. did in
Vietnam. In both cases, colonizing powers used the most modern weapons
including napalm and cluster bombing campaigns killing thousands,
against guerilla armies that refused to bow down. The Portuguese
dictator Marcelo Caetano was forced to give up economic interests in
Angola to some of the NATO powers in exchange for the NATO armaments and
supplies used.6 Yet, Portugal still lost the war against the heroic
anti-colonial forces. NATO's Strategy of Neo-colonialism [Imperialism
has always used its strategy of divide and rule. To enable the
acceptance of the idea of a 'benevolent' NATO, the colonial powers knew
that they had to convince and recruit a neo-colonial class of indigenous
Africans who would do their bidding]{.underline}. This divide played
itself out in the national liberation movements between [those who were
friendly to imperialist forces and those who wanted a real break from
colonialism.]{.underline} Nkrumah explains in Neo-colonialism, The Last
Stage of Imperialism, the wide array of methods employed by
neocolonialism, ranging from economic, political, religious, ideological
and cultural spheres. To do this, [NATO works hand in hand with other
mechanisms of imperialism like the CIA 7 which was instrumental in the
coup against the Nkrumah government and the murder of Patrice
Lumumba.]{.underline} [The settler colony of Azania/South Africa would

While the Pentagon and the United States State Department continues to
provide a distorted rationale for the instigation of a major military
conflict in Eastern Europe, billions of dollars are being utilized to
transfer offensive weapons aimed at preventing a peaceful resolution to
the current war in Ukraine. Although the corporate and
government-controlled media outlets in Western Europe and North America
have reported to the public on a daily basis that their own
administrations cannot be blamed for the current war in Ukraine, [for
any serious observer, the culpability for the tensions now existence on
an international level can be traced back to the desire by imperialism
to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline} (NATO).
[NATO was formed in 1949 in the aftermath of the Second World War and
the initiation of the Cold War by Washington against the rising
socialist and national liberation movements around the world. In 1949,
only two countries on the African continent were independent, Ethiopia
and Liberia.]{.underline} Both of these countries in 1949 were [highly
compromised due to the intervention of the United States and Britain in
their internal affairs stemming from the legacy of African enslavement
and the rise of imperialist fascism during the 1920s and 1930s. The
founding members of NATO were all in North America and Western
Europe]{.underline} being Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland,
Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom,
and the U.S. [Many of these states were involved in the Atlantic Slave
Trade and colonialism. All of them benefited from the super-exploitation
of African and other oppressed peoples after the transformation of the
world economic system beginning in the 15th century.]{.underline} The
outcomes of the World War I and World War II left the U.S. as the
dominant imperialist power in the world. [The only real and effective
challenge to the hegemony of the U.S. and its allies during the post
WWII period were the socialist states of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR), the People's Republic of China (PRC) founded in 1949
after more than two decades of armed struggle, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) consolidated in 1948, the Democratic Republic
of Vietnam in the north which declared independence in August 1945,
along with the other anti-capitalist, anti-colonial and
anti-neo-colonial movements arising in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and
Latin America]{.underline}, which were objectively bolstered by the
burgeoning African American and workers' struggles which developed
during the late 1940s and 1950s. [The position of the U.S. during the
1950s and 1960s represented the height of political hypocrisy. African
Americans were being denied fundamental civil rights protections which
were originally put in place during the period after the Civil
War]{.underline} (1861-1865). There were Civil Acts and amendments to
the U.S. Constitution between 1866-1875 ostensibly designed to
reconstruct some semblance of democratic governance. Nonetheless, the
Reconstruction process was overthrown during the latter decades of the
19th century [placing African Americans in the social position of
neo-slavery]{.underline} at worst and second-class citizenship at best.
[Participants in the leading civil rights organizations after WWII were
pressured to denounce the socialist camp and pledge allegiance to U.S.
imperialism as the only legitimate system of governance not only
domestically but internationally. Those leading activists and public
figures who refused to adopt the Cold War policies of Washington were
subjected to investigations, prosecution, imprisonment, economic
isolation and exile. All the while African Americans were being lynched
by mobs, killed without justification by police, executed by the state
and denied fundamental due process and equal protection under the
law]{.underline}. Military Interventions to Halt National Liberation
[Two examples of repression and mass killings by countries in the
aftermath of WWII were carried out in French-controlled Algeria and the
British-dominated Gold Coast (later known as Ghana after independence in
1957).]{.underline} These acts by the colonial powers were [designed to
preserve imperialist rule in Africa]{.underline}. Both Britain and
France were founding members of NATO. [In Algeria on the same day as
Nazi Germany surrendered to the Allied forces, French troops massacred
thousands of people across the North African state for merely
demonstrating against the racist and repressive policies of
Paris.]{.underline} France had colonized Algeria since 1830 and would
not relinquish control until the people waged an eight-year armed and
diplomatic struggle aimed at national liberation. Even France24 in a
report published during 2021 said of the historical event: "On May 8,
1945, thousands had rallied in Setif as allied powers, including
colonial ruler France, marked a hard-won victory in Europe over Nazi
Germany. 'Long live the allied victory,' demonstrators shouted. But the
festive gathering soon turned into a demonstration for an end to
colonial rule, with cries of 'Long live independent Algeria!' That was a
provocation for [French police, incensed by the appearance, for the
first time, of Algerian flags.]{.underline} As they ordered the removal
of the green and white standards, scuffles broke out. [Demonstrator
Bouzid Saal, 22, refused to drop his flag --- so a French policeman shot
him dead]{.underline}. Outrage tore through the massive crowd. [The
ensuing riots and revenge attacks on Europeans sparked a wave of
repression by French authorities that left as many as 45,000 dead,
according to Algerian official figures]{.underline}. French historians
put the toll at up to 20,000, including 86 European civilians and 16
soldiers. [The killings would have a transformative impact on the
nascent anti-colonial movement. A full-blown independence war broke out
nine years later, finally leading to the country's independence in
1962]{.underline}.... [The French launched a 15-day campaign of
violence, targeting Setif and the surrounding rural region, bombing
villages and hamlets indiscriminately.]{.underline} General Raymond
Duval led French authorities' ruthless clampdown, imposing martial law
and a curfew on a patch of territory stretching from Setif to the sea,
50 kilometers (30 miles) north. [Nationalist leaders were detained on
pure suspicion, and villages suspected of harboring separatists were
strafed by the air force and set ablaze. Women, children and the elderly
were massacred, and some 44 villages were destroyed in 15 days of
retribution.]{.underline} Executions continued until November 1945, and
some 4,000 people were arrested."

Of course, [the official propaganda of the U.S. is that the purpose of
their intervention in WWII was to fight against fascism and spread
democracy in Europe.]{.underline} Yet the [Allies utilized repression in
an attempt to prevent the majority of people around the globe suffering
under the yoke of western domination from achieving freedom and national
independence]{.underline}. [In recent months the Algerian government has
been involved in a diplomatic row with France as well as Spain over the
legacy of colonialism and the status of the Western Sahara, which
remains under the control of the Kingdom of Morocco with the support of
the imperialist centers of authority in Europe and North
America]{.underline}. French President [Emmanuel Macron made statements
suggesting that Algeria as a country did not exist prior to 1830 and the
history of the anti-colonial movement, as told by Algiers, were a
fabrication]{.underline}. These provocative comments by Macron and the
role of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez who endorsed the continued
colonization of the Western Sahara under Moroccan tutelage, [represents
the contemporary attitude of NATO member-states. The second example
related to the founding NATO member-states' historic repression against
anti-colonial movements occurred in the Gold Coast]{.underline} on
February 28, 1948. [African veterans of the war combined with
traditional leaders boycotting the inflated prices of British-controlled
goods, held peaceful protests to request adequate pensions and benefits
for their military service for London as well as reasonable costs for
commodities. British security forces opened fire on the demonstrators
marching to Christiansborg Castle]{.underline} (Osu) to present their
petition to colonial authorities when three leaders of the protest were
assassinated. [Later as the African masses rose up in rebellion against
the massacre, the British arrested scores of people deemed as the
organizers of the unrest]{.underline}. This series of events in 1948
[led to the independence struggle headed by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah who
founded the Convention People's Party in June 1949]{.underline}, just
over one year later, creating the conditions for another eight-year
campaign to achieve freedom from Britain on March 6, 1957. Nkrumah had
been brought back to the Gold Coast in late 1947 to work as an organizer
for the then United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), an anti-colonial
grouping. In the aftermath of the event of February 1948, sharp
differences would surface between Nkrumah and other leading UGCC
officials. A source on the events of 1948 in the Gold Coast notes: "The
people's protests lasted five days. By 1st March the colonial governor
had declared a state of emergency and put in place a new Riot Act. On
12th March the governor ordered the arrest of 'The Big Six,' leading
members of the UGCC, which included Kwame Nkrumah, as he believed they
were responsible for orchestrating the disturbances. The Big Six were
incarcerated in remote northern parts of the country. It was around this
time that Nkrumah and the other five began to have significant
disagreements over the direction of the movement for independence. By
1949 Nkrumah had broken away from the UGCC to form the Convention
People's Party (CPP) taking the masses of the people with him. The CPP,
through a campaign of 'Positive Action,' achieved an end to the Gold
Coast colony and brought the new dawn of independent Ghana on 6th March
1957." (https://praad.gov.gh/index.php/the-riots-of-28th-february-1948/)

Serbia, including the capital of Belgrade, was designed to solidify the
dominance of the Pentagon-NATO alliance in Europe and consequently
throughout broader geo-political regions of the world. Serbia was
subjected to massive airstrikes for over two months.]{.underline} The
following year, even after the government in Belgrade had been
functionally neutralized, then [President Slobodan Milosevic was
overthrown, kidnapped and brought to the Netherlands to stand trial in a
U.S.-engineered special tribunal on war crime]{.underline}s. Milosevic
later died in detention while in subsequent years, several of the
newly-independent states in the area were recruited into NATO.
[Afghanistan in 2001 was bombed, invaded and occupied by the U.S. which
mobilized other NATO states to engage in the 20-year war ostensibly
aimed at ending jihadist terrorism in Central Asia.]{.underline} After
eight months in office President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of
Pentagon forces from Afghanistan. Other NATO states had already exited
the country. The character of the pullout from Afghanistan resulted in
the deaths of 13 Marines stationed outside the airport at Kabul during
the evacuation. In retaliation, [the U.S. launched a drone strike on
innocent people in Kabul killing members of a family which had
cooperated with the NATO occupation]{.underline}. At present, [there is
a widespread humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan leaving millions
displaced, impoverished and hungry. To add even more distress to the
Afghan people, Biden expropriated \$3.5 billion in assets being held in
U.S. banks.]{.underline} Consequently, [the White House has turned its
back on the victims of a disastrous NATO intervention and occupation
leaving tens of millions without employment, food, medicines and the
capacity to generate income and international trade]{.underline}.

This humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan by the Pentagon and NATO
has served to further damage the popular standing of the Biden
presidency. Nonetheless, there has been no reduction in the Pentagon
budget which strangles the working and oppressed masses in the U.S. At
present the war in Ukraine has taken center stage in regard foreign and
domestic policy. Countries around the world are being pressured into
rallying alongside imperialism in its war drive to expand the NATO
project through the destabilization of the Russian Federation and the
People's Republic of China in the Far East. [In the North African state
of Libya during the early months of 2011, the U.S. backed
counter-revolutionary rebel elements sought to overthrow the Jamahiriya
government led by Col. Muammar Gaddafi.]{.underline} The United Nations
Security Council at the time voted to pass two resolutions which
authorized a total arms and economic blockade against Libya as well as
the establishment of a so-called no-fly zone which is merely another
form of war declaration. A similar no-fly zone had been imposed over
Iraq during the 1990s accompanied by draconian sanctions which killed an
estimated one million people, many of whom were women, children and
seniors.

[After the ground operations in Libya, which began on February 17 were
not reaping the desired results by imperialism, a massive blanket
bombing of the oil-rich country by the Pentagon and NATO was launched on
March 19 which lasted for seven month]{.underline}s. There were reports
that [anywhere between 50,000 to 100,000 people were killed and two
million displaced. The longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi was targeted and
assassinated as he was attempting to exit the areas around
Sirte]{.underline}. The impact of the destruction of Libya as in the
cases of Yugoslavia and Afghanistan had regional and international
implications. [Instability due to the dislocation of millions during and
after the air campaign fueled further destabilization in neighboring
Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad]{.underline}. [Libya since 2011 has
become a notorious center for human trafficking and internecine conflict
that has spilled over into other states prompting migration across the
Mediterranean into Southern Europe.]{.underline} The human traffickers
engage in dangerous methods of transportation across North Africa and
the Mediterranean Sea. [Thousands die every year seeking to escape the
detention centers and continuing sectarian battles in
Libya]{.underline}. [The migration of Africans and Asians to Southern
Europe has provided a political rationale for the growth of ultra-right
groupings and governments committed to ending entry into their countries
by people of color. European Union (EU) coast guard units routinely
intercept migrants at sea to repatriate them back to Africa. In Europe,
migrants are often confined to detention centers where they are harassed
by the authorities]{.underline}. Moreover, on a political electoral
level, the migration question has become a major wedge issue in Europe
and the U.S. Successive administrations in Washington led by Democrats
and Republican have failed to develop a comprehensive immigration
policy. At least part of this inability to adequately address the issue
lies in the refusal to abandon the imperialist foreign policy of
Washington and Wall Street. [Imperialist wars of occupation since 2001
involving Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti, Syria, Yemen, Libya, among other
states, are at the root of the dislocation of tens of millions. This is
the largest number of refugees and internally displaced persons since
the conclusion of WWII.]{.underline} The UN Refugee Agency reports on
its website that: "[At least 82.4 million people around the world have
been forced to flee their homes. Among them are nearly 26.4 million
refugees, around half of whom are under the age of 18. There are also
millions of stateless people, who have been denied a nationality and
lack access to basic rights such as education, health care, employment
and freedom of movement.]{.underline} At a time when 1 in every 95
people on earth has fled their home as a result of conflict or
persecution, our work at UNHCR is more important than ever before."
(https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/figures-at-a-glance.html) These figures are
rarely reported on in the U.S. media, and when they are, it is not done
in a manner which links the unprecedented levels of displacement with
imperialist wars waged by the Pentagon, NATO and its allies around the
globe. [Absent of a social and historical context in which to explain
the origins of the crisis, people are encouraged to believe that the
refugee, IDP and migrant situations are somehow a result of the
purported moral deficiencies of people in Africa, Latin America and
Asia.]{.underline} Yet the African, Latin American and Asian
geo-political regions are still being targeted by NATO for containment,
exploitation and conquest. [By absolving itself of culpability, the U.S.
can attempt to justify its denial of entry to migrants and refugees and
their discriminatory treatment]{.underline} while awaiting a decision on
whether they can legally live in the country[.]{.underline} Within the
immigration laws and policies of the U.S., racism is often utilized to
limit the number of peoples of African, Asian and Latin American descent
into the U.S. [In the Horn of Africa state of Somalia there has been
instability for the last three decades due to the political and military
interference of the U.S. and NATO.]{.underline} More recently in
2006-2007, the administration of President George W. [Bush encouraged
troops from Ethiopia under the TPLF-EPRDF leadership of Meles Zenawi to
invade Somalia in order to prevent the consolidation of power by the
Islamic Courts Union]{.underline}. [Airstrikes by the Pentagon and the
British Royal Air Force were initiated on a regular base in Somalia
under the guise of preventing terrorism.]{.underline} Numerous attempts
to form a unified civilian transitional government has not been able to
include the Al-Shabaab underground armed guerrillas. Al-Shabaab has
since its emergence as the major opponents to the western-backed federal
government, has split into at least two identifiable factions. For the
last fifteen years, the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), which
included troops from several regional states including Kenya, Ethiopia,
Djibouti and Uganda, has failed to military defeat al-Shabaab. Once
again in recent weeks, the mandate of AMISOM was extended for another
year with no real prospect of a final resolution to the conflict in
Somalia. [Much of the military training and weaponry are supplied by the
U.S. and its NATO allies for AMISOM.]{.underline} The putative
peacekeeping operations also maintains UN Security Council diplomatic
backing and funding. U.S. soldiers and other personnel working with
intelligence agencies have been killed in action in Somalia. Suicide
bombings and other armed attacks take place in several areas of the
country including the capital of Mogadishu. Relationships developed
between AU member states with the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and NATO
are not just on a bilateral basis. [NATO itself has outlined an
extensive program of engagement, training and collaboration]{.underline}
with the AU Secretariat in Addis Ababa. The same reasons cited by
AFRICOM for its deployments of thousands of troops on the continent
mirrors the language of NATO. Both institutions claim that they are
invited to participate in joint training exercises with African military
forces from various regions. In addition, a significant number of
African officers are trained in Pentagon war colleges in the U.S.
Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, some of these ranking soldiers have
been involved in military coups against elected governments. This has
been the case in Mali, Guinea and Libya where internal conflict and lack
of democratization is objectively underwritten by the Pentagon and the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). AU-affiliated regional organizations
such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have been
unable to reverse a series of military coups taking place in Guinea,
Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad. ECOWAS along with France and the U.S. have
issued statements opposing the military usurpation of power yet these
coup regimes remain in office with absolute impunity. Therefore, the
training supplied by the Pentagon and NATO cannot ensure stability and
security on the African continent. In order for AU member-states to
achieve genuine independence and sovereignty it must come from the
internal dynamics within the political structures established by the
democratic forces operating inside these countries. [The western
bourgeois democracies represented by NATO have never extended the
notions of self-determination and independent foreign policies to the
underdeveloped nations and regions of the world.]{.underline} In
language provided by NATO in regard to its cooperation with AU
member-states, the military alliance says: "Since 2005, NATO has been
cooperating with the African Union (AU) -- a regional organization with
55 members created in 2002. The NATO-AU relationship started modestly
with AU requests for logistics and airlift support for its mission in
Sudan. The cooperation has evolved over time and, although primarily
based on ad-hoc military-technical cooperation, NATO Allies are
committed to expanding cooperation with the AU to make it an integral
part of NATO's efforts to work more closely with partners in tackling
security challenges emanating from the south."
(https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_8191.htm) However, [over the
last 17 years the degree of instability in Africa has heightened
substantially particularly since the Pentagon-NATO engineered
counter-revolution in Libya during 2011. Conditions have deteriorated in
some countries such as the Central African Republic and Mali that the
governments of these states, even the military juntas, are turning
towards Moscow for security assistance and training.]{.underline}

France and the U.S. have taken great exception to the presence of
Russian-based military advisors in the CAR and Mali. The Wagner group, a
defense services corporation which operates as a private enterprise, has
been present in Mali in recent months prompting threats by Paris to
withdraw its military assistance to Bamako. In response, the military
junta in Mali ordered the French ambassador to leave the West African
state within 72 hours.
(https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220131-mali-authorities-give-french-ambassador-72-hours-to-leave-the-country)
In the same [above-quoted NATO document on AU cooperation, it goes on to
emphasize: "In January 2007, the AU made a general request to all
partners, including NATO, for financial and logistical support to
AMISOM.]{.underline} It later made a specific request to NATO in May
2007, requesting strategic airlift support for AU member states willing
to deploy in Somalia under AMISOM. In June 2007, the North Atlantic
Council (NAC) agreed, in principle, to support this request and NATO's
support was initially authorized until August 2007. Strategic sealift
support was requested at a later stage and agreed in principle by the
NAC in September 2009. The AU's strategic airlift and sealift support
requests for AMISOM have been renewed on an annual basis. The current
NAC agreement to support the AU with strategic air- and sealift for
AMISOM extends until January 2022.... NATO has a liaison office at the
headquarters of the AU. The liaison office is comprised of a Senior
Military Liaison Officer, a Deputy and one support staff. The liaison
office provides, at the AU's request, subject matter experts, who work
in the AU's Political Affairs, Peace and Security Department alongside
African counterparts. The NATO Senior Military Liaison Officer is the
primary coordinator for the Alliance's activities with the AU. [The size
of NATO's presence on the ground in Addis Ababa is based upon the
requests from the AU and the availability of resources from
Allies.]{.underline}" [How can the AU member-states secure and protect
the interests of the 1.3 billion people on the continent with these
levels of penetration by NATO within its military
structures?]{.underline} These contradictions must be corrected in order
to build viable internal defense mechanisms, combined with strategies
and tactics which are compatible with the needs of the workers, youth
and farmers in Africa. [Neo-colonialism is manifested in the economic
and subsequent military policies of contemporary African states. The
source of what is described as "Islamic terrorism" has its origins in
the counterinsurgency efforts by Washington to undermine those
governments seeking to build genuine independence, unity and
socialism]{.underline}. The jihadist groupings founded and funded by
Washington and its allies serve the interests of the Pentagon and NATO
by providing a rationale for sanctions, bombings, invasions and the
installation of puppet regimes beholden to the interests of imperialism.
Global Impact of NATO Expansion in Eastern Europe: Food Deficits and
Energy Crises One of the most alarming aspects of the war in Ukraine and
the ongoing sanctions against the Russian Federation are the sharp rise
in prices for consumer goods and energy. Fuel prices in the state of
California in the U.S. have gone up to as high as \$6 per gallon. In
other regions of the country, prices are coming down slightly perhaps
due to the release by the Biden administration of millions of barrels of
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), a tactic which has been
used by other presidents in the past. The U.S. has witnessed the highest
inflation rate in over 40 years. The 7-8% rate noted by the federal
government does not tell the complete story. Costs related to living
expenses such as rents, taxes, car prices, food and other commodities
have increased substantially. Since there has not been a raise in the
minimum wage means that working people are losing income every single
quarter of the year. [On an international scale, food supplies to
various geo-political regions have been seriously curtailed because
Russian and Ukraine are considered two of the largest agricultural
producers in the world. In various African and Middle Eastern states,
the potential for enormous food deficits is more than
apparent]{.underline}. These countries are attempting to emerge from the
COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020 which caused serious disruptions in
industrial and agricultural production. Lockdowns and the rapid spread
of the coronavirus has caused millions of deaths and many more severe
illnesses which often have long term public health, economic and social
consequences. One report on the escalating crisis in food supplies
published by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington pointed out
that: "Russia and Ukraine are considered the breadbasket of the world.
In 2021, the two countries exported more than one-quarter of the world's
wheat. They are both major suppliers of corn, sunflower seed oil, and
barley; Russia is also a major supplier of fertilizer, which is critical
for agricultural production. Food prices are soaring, exacerbating
inflation rates and reducing the purchasing power of populations across
the Middle East and Africa, where 70% of Russian wheat exports went in
2021. These escalating costs, fed by actual and anticipated scarcity,
are exacerbating economic crises for Egypt and Lebanon, with a heavy
reliance on Russian and Ukrainian wheat imports, and imperiling
vulnerable populations in conflict zones, including Yemen, Syria, and
Somalia, which heavily rely on emergency food aid."
(https://agsiw.org/the-ukraine-crisis-deepens-food-insecurity-across-the-middle-east-and-africa/)
In the energy sector the banning of Russian oil and natural gas in
Western Europe are inevitably causing disruptions in supply.
Opportunistically the U.S. has proposed a plan to redirect its energy
supplies to NATO countries in Eastern and Western Europe. However, this
process. which is highly unfeasible, will take time to develop the
necessary supplies of oil and natural gas to those states which have
adopted Washington's foreign policy. [Sanctions above all else are acts
of war. The attempted strangulation of countries such as Cuba,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Russia and China, etc. are designed to destabilize these states and to
make them susceptible to regime change in favor of the U.S. and other
NATO governments. Russia, China and a host of other states have vowed to
resist these efforts to isolate them from world trade and international
relations.]{.underline} The New York-based think tank, Council on
Foreign Relations (CFR), acknowledged the strategic role of Russia in
providing energy resources to European states. An article on the CFR
website reveals: "Overall, Russia supplies about one-third of European
natural gas consumption, used for winter heating as well as electricity
generation and industrial production. The European Union (EU) also turns
to Russia for more than one-quarter of its crude oil imports, the bloc's
largest single energy source. Some EU states are far more dependent than
others. Portugal and Spain use little Russian energy, while Germany, the
largest European economy, gets more than half of its natural gas and
more than 30 percent of its crude oil supplies from Russia. France gets
most of its electricity from nuclear power but still relies on Russian
imports to meet its fossil fuel needs. Analysts say plans in Germany and
other countries to phase out nuclear and coal power could increase this
dependence."
(https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/russias-energy-role-europe-whats-stake-ukraine-crisis?gclid=CjwKCAjw9e6SBhB2EiwA5myr9mQXtnhE8l2nWlzuul9zpCJvZC1cIqzYGnhaBZ9K_EvLfQKszq2T0xoCLWEQAvD_BwE)
These factors portend much for the economic and consequent political
future of the capitalist and imperialist governments in Europe. The
disruptions in food and energy supplies perpetuated by the foreign
policy imperatives of Washington and Wall Street will have ramifications
far beyond the theater of war in Ukraine and Russia.

#### Africa is the perpetual ghost of the Euro-American regime, located in the blind spot of imperial international relations, in a perpetual zone of sacrifice --a paradigmatic reframing of the theories that undergird modern rational discourse is necessary.

Coloniality of Power and the Global Power Structural Configuration:
Unmasking the Politics and Philosophy of Empire Epistemologically, this
chapter seeks to [unmask the fault lines of the philosophy of the
European-centric empire as implicated in the generation of problems
epitomised by the invasion of Libya in 2011 by NATO forces]{.underline}.
It seeks to do so, by exposing some myths that informed, fueled and
continue to precipitate global coloniality in the absence of physical
colonialism. [Current international relations (IR) theories have proven
to be limited and unable to solve and eradicate this epistemic
challenge, partly because dominant and traditional IR theories are
located in the very European modernity that they disguise and camouflage
in the purported objectivity of science. The philosophy of the
Eurocentric empire universalised these particular theories of IR by
force (violence of colonialism) as they are part of the modernity
project of colonisation]{.underline} (Howe 1990: 677). The chapter
further aims to demonstrate [the deficiency and bankruptcy that
foregrounds traditional IR theories' assumptions, assertions and
proclamations particularly that Western-centric IR theories are
scientific, objective and universally applicable or
replicable]{.underline}. Such proclamations overlook the fact that
[these IR theories are located in particular ecologies of Europe and
therefore, are subjective]{.underline}. All knowledge is particular and
subjective to its ecology or locality. Since 1919, the official initial
academic inquiry of IR as a discipline, [IR theories have not adequately
addressed what the discipline initially set out to do---to curb and
liquidate international conflict.]{.underline} This suggests that [the
epistemologies (particular epistemic ecologies and localities) that have
informed IR theories to date are inadequate]{.underline} and have
reached some sort of cul-de-sac, or a dead-end. These epistemologies beg
the question and engage in circular reasoning. [This necessitates an
alternative frame of reference]{.underline}. Contingent upon Albert
Einstein's idea that insanity is doing the same thing over and over
again and expecting a different result each time, this chapter opts to
engage a non-conventional theory in the discipline of IR. As such, [this
work advances the decolonial perspective as a possible solution to
problems caused by epistemologies located in the ecologies and
localities of Western, Euro-North American-centric modernity that
purport themselves as objective, scientific and universal.]{.underline}
The chapter will unmask the inadequacies of Euro-North American-centric
modernity in the face of mounting and current global problems,
particularly those played out in the field of international relations.
IR as an academic discipline started in 1919 at Aberystwyth, University
of Wales (now Aberystwyth University), a year after the end of World War
I (Ziegler 1987). This, however, as Nyere (2014: 18) argues, "does not
mean that intellectual origins of political realism and liberalism only
started in 1919". [The main objective and aim of IR theorising was
solely to find peaceful solutions to international disputes and
therefore avert a similar conflict to World War I. IR failed in that
regard because just barely after a decade, World War II
started]{.underline}. Like the predecessor of the United Nations, the
League of Nations, IR as an academic discipline has failed in achieving
what it set out to do in the first place. [Since 1945, the end of World
War II and the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco,
USA, there has not been a single decade that the world has not witnessed
an international conflict or war (]{.underline}Bennet 1998: 7[).
Rational theories in the discipline of IR, such as realism, liberalism,
feminism, Marxism and constructivism, are expressive of ideas, concepts
and views located in modernity. The ideas expressed in IR rational
theories are embodied by scholars that are mainly located in modernity,
particularly from the Global North and reflect the rationale of European
modernity. The major problem of modernity is the inexplicable
discrepancy and inconsistency between its rhetoric and its lived
reality, its illusion vis-à-vis its essence, particularly from the
experience of people of the Global South]{.underline} in general, but
[by Africans in particular]{.underline}. As such, this chapter intends
to unmask [the inadequacy of mainstream theories and lenses in
explaining the ghosts and blindspots of empire because these ghosts and
blind-spots are born within the empire.]{.underline} The
European-centric empire is not sufficiently able to be reflexive on its
theories and to see beyond its assumptions and assertions. As such, this
chapter suggests [the need to explore outside the lenses of established
theory.]{.underline}

### Link --- Geography 

#### Geography DA --- their framing of [foreign worlds]{.underline} demarcates [zones of being]{.underline} and [non-being]{.underline}, where non-being in the New World (order) is [denied humanity]{.underline} and [civility]{.underline} and subject to [US coloniality]{.underline}.

Modernity's Creation of Zone of Being and Zone of Non-being

[In the Euro-North America-centric worldview]{.underline}, the accident
of geography is esteemed more than the essence of humanity. [There is
more value placed on the geography of where human beings originate from,
than the actual humanity]{.underline}. This worldview [perceives two
distinct zones; zone of being and the zone of non-being based on the
exclusion that emanates from geography and subsequently,
race]{.underline}. Kissinger highlights the fact that, despite the
global power structural configuration that was created and is
perpetuated by the Euro-North American-centric global domination, it is
in fact a European accident that was realised and now purports itself as
an essence; the realisation was, and is, maintained by force and
aggression. He argues that the ["international relations"]{.underline}
of the 1490s [were a mere European regional undertaking which was to be
globalised through the violence of colonialism]{.underline} (Kissinger
2014: 18). The Euro-North American-centric new world order was born out
of imagination. [The socially constructed borders of what determined
humanity and non-humanity were realised by force and are consistently
consolidated by either the use of aggression or the threat
thereof.]{.underline} The **[demarcation]{.underline}** is not only
imaginary, it was **[materialised]{.underline}**. Ramose (2001: 5)
submits that the ["amity lines"]{.underline} that enveloped the
Euro-North American-centric civilisation while [isolating]{.underline}
the rest of [the "overseas zone" were geographically
located]{.underline} "[along the equator or the Tropic of Cancer in the
South, along a degree of longitude drawn in the Atlantic Ocean through
the Canary Islands or the Azores in the west]{.underline}, or a
combination of both". This demarcation, that separated the Western
Meridian from the Azores, was to not be shifted under whatsoever
circumstances. In other words, [this Western Meridian]{.underline}
separated the Western Hemisphere and the overseas zone signalling the
end of Europe and the geography that existed beyond the "amity line"
[signalled the beginning of the "**New World**"]{.underline} (Ramose
2001: 5). [The overseas zone was not governed by Europe and hence no law
applied there, except for the "laws of the stronger";]{.underline} this
meant [**civility** was curtailed to exist only in the Western
Meridian]{.underline}, beyond that lay a territory of barbarity.
Kissinger (2014: 18) quips that as far back as 1550--1551, King Charles
the V, a Christian, summoned a council of theologians for deliberations
and that council concluded that "people living in the Western Hemisphere
were human beings with souls---hence eligible for salvation". That
pronouncement [implied that people who lived beyond the Western
Hemisphere where therefore, non-human beings and without
souls.]{.underline} In fact, that conclusion justified "conquest and
conversion" (Kissinger 2014: 19). This then speaks to the audacity with
which Europeans imposed their religion, even forcefully at times, on
people in spaces and places they colonised and conquered. [Coloniality
of power was henceforth geographically and asymmetrically constituted in
favour of the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}. This was [the creation of
the European-centric **"zone of being"** and the "hellish zone of
non-being" for non-Europeans, but Africans particularly]{.underline}.
What is noteworthy of the amity lines is that, unlike the "Rayas" lines,
they represented a zone that was subject to conflicting interests
arising between a duo of "contractual parties" that sought to seize land
and commandeer the inhabitants of that land. The conflicting parties
only shared consensus on the "freedom of the open spaces that began
beyond the line" (Ramose 2001: 5). This speaks of the condescending
attitude that engulfs the Euro-North American-centric civilisation[. It
ascribes humanity to itself and, beyond the geography of what it knows
and the proximity to it, **denies other humans of their
humanity**]{.underline}. The interaction between the conflicting parties
in the zone of being are amicably resolved through a contract, and
beyond the zone of being, the barrel of the gun, aggression and violence
become the order of the day---the "hellish zone of non-being". In the
'hellish zone of non-being', "force could be used freely and ruthlessly"
because there existed no humanity in those spaces and places (Ramose
2001: 5). This meant that anything that happened outside the Euro-North
American-centric world did not have legal merit nor consequence and had
no moral or political merit. Hence, John Tully's observation that "there
is no sin beyond the equator" (2011: 85). [Sins and transgression are
only committed in the zone of being, where civility, legality, morality
and reciprocity are located and enforceable. In the hellish zone of
non-being, chaos, pandemonium and disorder are the norm]{.underline}. To
this effect, Mamdani (2004: 4) argues that ["when violence does not
cross the boundary between 'the west' and the rest---it is called
**'communal conflict', as in South Asia**, or **'ethnic conflict', as in
Africa**"]{.underline} (Mamdani 2004: 4). Chossudovsky (2015) evinces
what he terms the "hegemonic project" of the "globalisation of war" by
the USA. He submits that there are [major US-sponsored military and
undercover intelligence operations]{.underline} that are run
concurrently in regions such as, but not limited to, the Middle East,
sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, the Far East and Central Asia. These
covert operations [are designed to destabilise sovereign states,
particularly those states that defy the global power structural
configuration of the Euro-North American-centric world view. The **USA
and its allies**]{.underline}, Western Europe, [do this to consolidate
its grip on the control of the **'new world order'**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} by so doing, [continuously defines and sustains global
coloniality through the control of colonial power
matrices---**coloniality of power**]{.underline}.

Re-presenting the South

[With the end of the cold war, the South assumed a more prominent role
in the security discourse of NATO]{.underline} than it did during the
cold war. The first sign-post was set by the Alliance\'s Strategic
Concept in November 1991. In this document, [NATO acknowledges the
disappearance of its dominating cold-war threat from the East, and
establishes a different scenario, in which \'challenges and risks\' are
\'multi-faceted and multi-directional\']{.underline}. As one of the
directions from which such risks and challenges might stem, the alliance
identifies the countries in the Southern Mediterranean and Middle East.
The stability and peace of the countries on the southern periphery of
Europe are important for the security of the Alliance, as the 1991 Gulf
war has shown. This is all the more so because of the build-up of
military power and the proliferation of weapons technologies in the
area, including weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
capable of reaching the territory of some member states of the Alliance
(NATO, 1991:5). What sounded rather innocuous then, has subsequently
been phrased in a more pointed way. Or, to phrase it in William
Connolly\'s (1991:64) terms, [what was then constituted as
a]{.underline} **[\'difference\' was turned into
\'otherness\']{.underline}**, [into a **quintessential
danger**]{.underline}. It is in this context that Secretary-General
Willy Claes set the tone, [constituting the countries to the South of
Europe as the sites of a force, comparable in its dangerousness only to
NATO\'s old enemy, Communism]{.underline}. [It comes by many names:
fundamentalism, Islamic fundamentalism, Islamism, yet its nature is
clear: it poses a threat to the West by denying that the latter identity
is the only acceptable political identity]{.underline}. Fundamentalism
is at least as dangerous as Communism. Please do not underestimate this
risk\... I cannot see how fundamentalism could accord with democracy.
And NATO is much more than a military alliance. It is also committed to
defend the basic principles of civilization, which connect North America
with Western Europe (Süddeutsche Zeitung, 1995:9).

As indicated above, Claes\'s statements did not go uncontested within
NATO\'s diplomatic community. Yet at the same time, [one should not
consider this articulation of post-cold war identity\\difference to be
unrepresentative]{.underline}. An article by a Portuguese scholar,
published by NATO in October 1994, virtually anticipated Claes\'
identification (Gaspar, 1994). Also, [NATO distributed a report by the
North Atlantic Assembly\'s Sub-Committee on the Mediterranean
Basin]{.underline} on \'The Rise of Religious Fundamentalism and the
Future of Democracy in North Africa\' (North Atlantic Assembly, 1994),
[which in a similar tone establishes **\'Islamism\' as the anathema to
Western cultural identity**]{.underline}. In responding to the rise of
Islamism, Alliance countries must take three factors into account. The
first is Islamic political thought, which is distinct from Western
thought on a fundamental point, namely its difficulty in accepting the
independence of politics from the religious and private spheres of human
activity. \... Secondly, the present governments of the North African
countries do not exhibit the main characteristics of democracy\...
Thirdly, Islam is thriving against a background of political and
economic crisis generally linked to the failure of a mode of development
which gave priority to major industry and state action at the expense of
the peasantry, private enterprise and the development of the middle
class (North Atlantic Assembly, 1994: ii-iii). This is [a central
statement in the re-constitution of the South: **modernization has ended
and failed**, and it has produced a monster]{.underline}. [The
modernization paradigm that informed the identification of the
South]{.underline} during most of the cold war [would allow for
manifestations of crisis as]{.underline} **[\'collateral
damages\']{.underline}** [in a transition process to]{.underline}
**[Western standards]{.underline}** [of economic, political and social
**modernity**]{.underline}. The post-cold war texts presented here on
the other hand turn political and economic crises into key features of
these countries, features that now identify these countries as
essentially anti-Western.7 A comparison of the security situations of
the Middle East and of Europe discloses their asymmetry on many levels.
Europe is a community of states engaged in a process of integration,
while the Middle East remains an area where the dynamics of
fragmentation can lead to conflicts among states; the common boundary
between the two areas separates democracy from autocracy, market
economies from under-developed economies, modern societies from archaic
social structures torn asunder by the phenomena of modernization.
(Gaspar, 1994:29). While there are faint [echoes of the modernization
paradigm]{.underline} resonating in this description (underdeveloped
economies), they [no longer hold the promise of ultimately becoming part
of the West]{.underline}. Rather, [against the]{.underline}
**[\'anti-Western radicalization\']{.underline}** (Gaspar, 1994:29) [the
West is recommended to use a]{.underline} **[strategy of
containment]{.underline}**. \"In the Middle East, democratization does
not seem to be on the agenda and there is no question of expanding the
European security complex into this area or integrating it into European
or Western institutions\" (Gaspar, 1994:28). Rather, [the identification
of \'Islamism\' could hold the promise of re-constituting the West as a
common trans-Atlantic identity against the **Islamic
Other**.]{.underline} \"Thus, in the end, the post-Cold War crisis in
the Middle East could serve as a catalyst to the consolidation of the
European and Atlantic communities through their efforts to coordinate a
coherent Middle East policy\" (Gaspar, 1994:30).

[What is at work]{.underline} here [is a]{.underline} **[spatial
differentiation]{.underline}** [that constructs a boundary between the
West and the \'Middle East\', reminiscent of, and at the same time
anticipating, the adversarial relationship between East and West in the
days of the cold war]{.underline}. This argument is [further supported
by the increasing militarization of the identification of the South in
the aftermath of the Gulf War.]{.underline} Here, NATO\'s texts are
increasingly concerned with the proliferation of \'weapons of mass
destruction\'. \"\[The\] Gulf crisis proved that the threats now facing
Europe no longer come from only one direction, and has provided all too
tangible evidence of the danger of a proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction\" (Colombo, 1992:3). The point here is, of course, that such
[weapons in themselves are not the problem. Rather, they become
dangerous **in the hands of the Other**, in the hands of the
\'Saddams\', \'rogue nations\' and \'fundamentalists\' of this
world]{.underline}. Thus, the current discussions on the future of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) already presupposes and at the same time
[reinforces an identity of the South as the Other]{.underline} (Mutimer,
1997). There is, however, a crucial difference between the adversaries
of NATO in the cold war, and the post-cold war era, respectively. The
spatial differentiation between East and West was undergirded by a
nuclear Mutually Assured Destruction, which sealed off the \'tectonic
plates\' of East and West from any mutual interference. Berlin 1953,
Budapest 1956, and Prague 1968 are sign-posts of this principle. [With
nuclear deterrence denied to the South, the West is currently
constituting an Other that is much more **accessible to intervention**.
The **geopolitical space of the South**]{.underline} might yet [**become
the** **maneuver-grounds for a re-assertive NATO.**]{.underline}

### Link --- Space

#### Settler colonialism is structured by the imperative of progress that demands the universal imposition of linear time and the reproduction of evacuated space -- indigenous continuities of space and time are located simultaneously as the "blank slate" upon which the "perfect laboratory" can be constructed and the antagonistic pre-modern savage obstructing the emergence of settler modernity. From the Lakota nation massacred in service of industrial development in the Black Hills to the usage of the Galapagos as a microcosm for evolutionary study to the taking of Navajo lands for spaceflight testing to the indigenous Hawaiian protectors of Mauna Kea whose spiritual connections are being erased in favor of Western astronomy, the scientific terrain of outer space cannot be conceptualized apart from the ongoing process of imperialistic otherization that legitimates settler sovereignty in the present.

Settler colonial space-times \[T\]he idea of a closed system \[is\] a
concept that was constituted by the island laboratory and the irradiated
atoll and perpetuated by the aerial view. (DeLoughrey, 2012: 168) T[he
[links between space science, Western imperialism, and settler
colonialism]{.mark} are]{.underline} not confined to the history of
Cook's voyages or the settler colonial conditions of contemporary
Hawai\'i. Rather, they are [[entangled in ongoing histories of the
Enlightenment]{.mark} in which ideologies of European superiority --
[used to justify violent conquest]{.mark} and pillaging [of Indigenous
lands -- rely upon claims of scientific objectivity, modernity,
universality, and futurity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Byrd, 2011). In this
section, we situate TMT and HI-SEAS in the history of colonial
imaginaries of islands as [[abstract laboratories for scientific
experimentation]{.mark}. We then consider how this [erasure of space is
entangled with Western conceptions of time that relegate Indigeneity to
the past while producing linear, progressive
futures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Goodyear-Ka'ōpua, 2017). We bring these
reflections together through Barad's notion of the apparatus, which we
employ to critically examine TMT and HI-SEAS. Island laboratories Since
Cook's expeditions, [the West has subjected the constellation of Pacific
Islands to a multitude of science experiments]{.underline} (DeLoughrey,
2012; Farbotko, 2010). Salmond (2003: ix) explains how "\[[a\]s the
edges of the known world were pushed out, wild nature -- including [the
'savages' and 'barbarians']{.mark} at the margins of humanity - was
[brought under the]{.mark} calm, [controlling gaze of Enlightenment
science]{.mark}, long before colonial domination was
attempted]{.underline}." There is a long history of the liveliness of
islands being abstracted by colonial powers and scientists alike, from
seemingly innocuous use of the Galápagos as discrete microcosms for
theorizing evolution (Matsuda, 2006); to the United States' devastating
testing of nuclear weapons on the Marshall Islands; to botany's role in
the colonization of Hawai'i and its extension into contemporary
experiments with genetically-modified organisms replacing native plant
species (Goldberg-Hiller and Silva, 2015). As with other landscapes,
[specific imaginaries of place play a unique role in colonial practices
on islands. Continental views of islands align with Enlightenment
scientific desire for blank slates, perfect laboratories]{.underline}
(Greenhough, 2006; Matsuda, 2007). [[Mobilizing imaginaries of frontier
and isolation]{.mark}, representations of islands within a continental
and colonial gaze are]{.underline}, as Matsuda explains, ["distant,
isolated, uninhabited, and abstract spaces"]{.underline} (2007: 230).
[The purported distance of the island colony [enacts a separation
between colonizer and colonized landscape that allows fo]{.mark}r
specific relations and forms of [observation.]{.mark} Islands become
simplified models of a complex world, acting as "[quintessential sites
for experimentation"]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Baldacchino, 2007:
165) based on fetishized assumptions about island spatiality.
[Scientists use islands to isolate variables and substitute space for
time to construct linear timestreams.]{.underline} Islandness functions
as stand-in for [a computational time-step within an experimental
design. These purported blank slates endow the initial time-step
essential to modelling.]{.underline} Islands and their peoples have been
employed to examine theories of geological, biological, human, and
socio-cultural evolution. DeLoughrey describes how island spatiality is
considered bound by "[the theme of isolation]{.underline}, a model that
had been deployed in the 19th century to propose the theory of
evolution, and which re-energized the longstanding colonial
understanding of the island as a laboratory" (2012: 168). [The expansion
of U.S. empire specifically enrolled island colonies from Puerto Rico to
the Philippines as sites for grisly experimentations, from weapons to
biomedical research on non-white bodies who were seen as relics of
earlier stages of evolution]{.underline} (Immerwahr, 2019). Just as
islands and their peoples have been used to model past evolutions, th[ey
are also [established as models for specific
futures]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Baldacchino describes islands as
sites of novelty; they tend toward clairvoyance; [they are disposed to
act as advance indicators or extreme reproductions of what is present or
future elsewhere ... with fallacious simplicity, \[they\] can be
conceived as a convenient platform for any whim or fancy.]{.underline}
(2007: 165) Islands have emplaced visions of future climate dystopias
(Farbotko, 2010) and imagined libertarian capitalist utopias (Lynch,
2017). [The continuation of these projects of empire and white supremacy
are shaping plans for human colonization of Moon and Mars. Such projects
re-articulate debates around questions of race, ability, eugenics,
reproduction, and human psychology]{.underline} in journals like Futures
-- including a 2019 special issue on ethics in offworld colonization.
Through these projects[, islands and peoples are erased and overwritten
by the totality of the model world they represent]{.underline}. As
DeLoughrey explains, "Western colonizers had long configured tropical
islands into the contained spaces of a laboratory, which is to say a
suppression of island history and Indigenous presence" (2012: 172[). [An
affective landscape of]{.underline}]{.mark} [history, [more-than-human
relationality]{.mark} (Watts, 2013), [and lived social place gets
transformed into independent]{.mark}, sterile [variables
instrumentalized in the projection of]{.mark} specific futures. Such
discourses intersect with [space science imaginaries of exploration,
exoticism, and otherworldliness]{.mark}.]{.underline} Settling time [As
an empire of time rather than space ... many significant American
national theorists sought to escape the political paradoxes of space by
conquering time.]{.underline} (Allen, 2008: 13) Allen examines how U[.S.
empire depends upon three notions of time: a romanticized historical
time recounting myths of the nation's founding, the geological time of
natural history, and the mechanized time of the clock and apparatuses of
measurement.]{.underline} The organization and control over these three
temporalities [constitutes a colonial totality (Matson and Nunn, 2017)
that works to settle time as much as space in the projection of settler
futures. [The projection of settler futures depends on the ordering of
time, constituted by ideologies of progress, of a mythologized past and
present oriented toward the future. Scientific "progress" is]{.mark}
positioned as [a universal value key to constructing the future, while
questioning t]{.mark}he actions of [Western science is]{.mark}
positioned as [irrational or reactionary.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Concerning the TMT controversy, Casumbal-Salazar writes: Relegated to
the 'dark ages' of tradition, [[Native peoples appear as the agonistic
menace of the modern scientific state]{.mark}. Delegitimized as
i[rrational]{.mark} within the gendered hierarchies of Western science
and philosophy ... Hawaiians become suspect and subject to institutional
anti-Native racism yet fetishized as an archeological remnant within
multicultural society.]{.underline} (2017: 2) In dominant discourses,
[I[ndigenous time is linked to the past, with the present constituted on
assimilation and the future on complete erasure]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Rifkin, 2017). [The existence of [contemporary Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} poses a challenge to ongoing settler colonial hegemony.
Goodyear-Ka'ōpua explains how "settler state officials cast the
kiaʻi]{.underline} \[land protectors, caretakers\] [as i[mpediments on
the road to 'progress]{.mark}']{.underline} (aka settler
futurity) ... ([mis)representing us as fixed in place, pinned in a
remote time]{.underline}" (2017: 191--192). Enlightenment [notions of
universality erase difference and thus Indigenous claims to prior rights
or sovereignty.]{.underline} While these conceptions of time have long
been critiqued, they continue to [sh[ape the central logics of
contemporary Western]{.mark} science, including [space science.]{.mark}
Linear conceptions of time are necessarily produced out of complex
practices that organize and control relative and variable
spatio-temporal formations.]{.underline} Rifkin posits a multiplicity of
temporalities, writing: [temporalities need to be understood as having
material existence and efficacy in ways that are not reducible to a
single, ostensibly neutral vision of time as universal
succession.]{.underline} The concept of frames of reference provides a
way of breaking up this presumed timeline by challenging the possibility
of definitively determining simultaneity ... Within Einsteinian
relativity, simultaneity depends on one's perspective based on one's
frame of reference. (2017: 20) Einstein's theory of relativity
demonstrates how time is relative, variable, and dependent on
acceleration, which is a function of location within a gravitational
field. It is a relationship between space, masses, and matter. As
Valentine explains: gravity is a consequence of the relational warping
of spacetime by matter ... That is, gravitational effects are literally
universal but emerge locally through relativistic and constantly
shifting specific relations among the mass of cosmic bodies and
spacetime, producing variable observations from differently situated
observers of one another (2017: 189--190). [[The practices of Western
astronomy are dependent on variable and relative relations among space
and time]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whether it is earth-bound astronomers
punching the clock on Martian time (Mirmalek, 2020) or the stretching of
temporal experience in a gravity well, the location of bodies matters as
it produces 'differently situated observers,' who experience time
differently based on their frames of reference. Yet, [[time is held as a
stable frame of reference from which the colonial scientist constitutes
the metric for a purportedly universal observer situated in a neutral
position of observation]{.underline}.]{.mark} Even Western science's own
understanding of time refuses to conform to Enlightenment notions of
universality, demonstrating a contradiction between this ontology and
the broader political and social ideologies with which it is entangled.
While [[notions of linear, progressive time are used to justify settler
colonial projects, the relative and contingent relationships among
space, time]{.mark}, and matter complicate claims to universality.
[Time,]{.mark} like space, i[s subject to practices of organization and
control that produce subject--object relations key to the Western
colonial project]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, geologic time, or
what Allen refers to as "vertical time," is the spatial-temporal
imaginary of geologic strata. He describes that, while "history often
depicted time advancing horizontally across space, the geological
revolution made it possible to imagine time extending perpendicularly
into the territory beneath the nation" (Allen, 2008: 165). [The deep
time of geology historicizes Western civilization as the top layer, the
apex of natural history, and thus stands to justify colonialism and its
civilizational projects[. The exploration of cosmological time in the
space sciences extends the colonial project further into the far
expanses of the future and the totality of the
universe.]{.mark}]{.underline} The apparatus Gazing out into the night
sky or deep down into the structure of matter, with telescope or
microscope in hand, Man \[sic\] reconfirms his ability to negotiate
immense differences in scale in the blink of an eye. Designed
specifically for our visual apparatus, telescopes and microscopes are
the stuff of mirrors, reflecting what is out there ... Man is an
individual apart from all the rest. And it is this very distinction that
bestows on him the inheritance of distance, a place from which to
reflect-on the world, his fellow man, and himself. A distinct
individual, the unit of all measure, finitude made flesh, his
separateness is the key. (Barad, 2007: 134, emphasis added) [In Barad's
deconstructive reading of [Enlightenment science, linear time and
evacuated space are both the product of active material processes
through which a purportedly universal "Man" continually enacts a
separation between himself and the universe]{.mark}. It is this supposed
separation from the rest of existence that constitutes "Man" as the
subject of a masculinist science and the remainder of the universe as
the object of his will. Practices of scientific observation and colonial
occupation work in tandem to re-enact and reinforce this fundamental
subject--object relationship]{.underline}. Critical scholars of science
have long argued against the purported passivity of observation, from
critiques of the Archimedean point (Yaqoob, 2014) to feminist theories
of the embodied and situated nature of knowledge production (Haraway,
1988). Yet, beyond simply noting the ontological impossibility of Man's
separation from the universe, Barad theorizes an emergent and contingent
form of separability -- what she calls agential separability -- that is
(re)produced through the material practices of apparatuses. Barad
explains that "apparatuses enact agential cuts that produce determinate
boundaries and properties of entities within phenomena" (2007: 148).
Apparatuses determine what comes to matter and how, thus producing
differences between subject and object, which are not stable positions
but rather enacted and contingent forms of relationality. We employ the
apparatus to explore how [subject--object relations of Western colonial
science are not universal and absolute, but rather enacted through
material practices that selectively produce the privileged subject
positions on which settler colonialism and space science both
depend.]{.underline} Barad's theory of [spacetimemattering highlights
the mutual constitution of space and time through the ongoing material
re-configuring of the world.]{.underline} Apparatuses are neither
neutral probes of the natural world nor social structures that
deterministically impose some particular outcome ...  the notion of an
apparatus is not premised on inherent divisions between the social and
the scientific ...  \[they\] are the practices through which these
divisions are constituted. (Barad, 2007: 169) Reconceiving subjectivity,
objectivity, space, time, and matter in this way implies that questions
of ethics are inseparable from apparatuses as practices that produce
differences and iteratively construct the world. Apparatuses enact
material changes through which some possibilities are realized while
others are foreclosed. Ontologically, apparatuses produce spatial,
temporal, and material relations that constitute projects of Western
colonial science. This approach helps elaborate arguments like those of
Matson and Nunn that "even the most futuristic space telescopes have
embedded within them a lineage of Euro-western cultural supremacy"
(2017: n.p.). This is not to simply claim that telescopes are in some
way symbolic of settler colonial relations, but to recognize how space
science apparatuses actively orient relations of observation and
materialize settler colonial relations. [Both TMT and HI-SEAS constitute
apparatuses that extend spatially well beyond the infrastructural
footprint on these mountains, to the island and surrounding ocean, into
the atmosphere, to Moon, Mars, and cosmos]{.underline}. As part of these
apparatuses, mountain environments of Hawaii become both a gateway to
the cosmos and simulation of an alien landscape. Temporally, [the
apparatus stretches beyond contemporary scientific practices, drawing on
longstanding histories of European imperialism, Western law, and settler
colonial logics, and projecting these ideologies into offworld
futures]{.underline}. Materially, these projects enroll technological,
logistical, and physical systems, including roads, mirrors and lenses,
sensors and surveillance devices, electromagnetic waves and domes, the
geology of the Hawaiian landscape, and bodies of observer and observed.

#### Outer space is a perpetual site of conquest and colonization -- the latest iteration of the genocidal project of terra nullius aimed at the naturalization of settler sovereignty over the "untamed" and "unknown" geographies of space. The project of extraterrestrial appropriation is rooted in the eliminatory logics of settler colonialism that seek to reinstitute the dispossession of Manifest Destiny in the present at the expense of indigeneity.

To most scholars, and certainly to the virtual majority of Indigenous
peoples on Turtle Island, it is no secret that the country we call the
United States of America was built upon the brutal subjugation of
Indigenous people and Indigenous lands. Fueled by the American settler
myths of terra nullius (no man's land) and Manifest Destiny, the
American settler state proceeded upon a project of cultural and physical
genocide, with lasting effects that endure to the present day. The
'settler myth' permeates American culture. Words such as 'pioneer', the
'West', 'Manifest Destiny' grab the imagination as connected to the
growth of the country in its early history. America sprang forth from a
vast open 'wilderness'. Of course, for Indigenous people, we know
differently---these lands had complex cultural frameworks and political
entities long before colonization. Words like 'pioneer' and 'Manifest
Destiny', have deep meanings for us too, as they are indicative of the
very real damage dealt against our cultures and nations, damage that we
have had to work very hard to undo. Trump's address raises key insights
into the continuing logics of settler colonialism, as well as questions
of its future trajectories. Trump's [[invocation of]{.mark} ideas such
as [the 'frontier' and 'taming the wilderness']{.mark} draws attention
to the brutal violence that accompanied the building of the American
state.]{.underline} Scholars such as Greg Grandin (2019) make the case
that the frontier is part of what America is---whether it is the 'Wild
West', or the U.S.-Mexican border, [America is always contending with a
frontier that must be defined. Language surrounding 'frontier' is
troubling because it perpetuates the rationale of why the American
settler state even exists---it could make better use of the land than
Native people would, after all, they lived in wilderness]{.underline}.
This myth tells us that what we know as [the modern world was built
through the hard work of European settlers; Indigenous people had
nothing to offer or contribute.]{.underline} For someone like Mr. Trump,
whose misgivings and hostility towards Native people have been
historically documented, this myth fits well with his narrative as
President---[he is building a 'new' America]{.underline}, one that will
return to its place of power and influence. The fact that [similar
language is being used around the potential of American power being
extended to space]{.underline} could reasonably be expected, given the
economic and military potential that comes from such a move[. [Space
represents yet another 'unknown' to be conquered and bent to America's
will.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, such [[interplanetary conquest does
not exist solely in outer space]{.mark}.]{.underline} I wish to situate
the very real [[colonial legacies and violence associated with]{.mark}
the desire to explore [space]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} tracing the
ways that they are [perpetuated and [reified through their destructive
engagements with Indigenous peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline} I argue that a
scientific venture such as [s[pace exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}
[does not exist in a vacuum, but instead [draws from settler colonialism
and feeds back into it through the prioritization of 'science' over
Indigenous epistemolog]{.mark}ies]{.underline}. I begin by exploring the
ways that [[space exploration by the American settler state is situated
within questions of hegemony, imperialism, and terra
nullius]{.mark},]{.underline} including a brief synopsis of the
controversy surrounding the planned construction of the Thirty Meter
Telescope on Mauna Kea. I conclude by exploring Indigenous engagement
with 'space' in both its Earthbound and beyond-earth forms as it relates
to outer space, and what implications this might have for the ways we
think about our engagement with space as the American settler state
begins to turn its gaze skyward once again. I position this essay
alongside a growing body of academic work, as well as journalistic
endeavors (Haskins, 2020; Koren, 2020) that demands that the American
settler colonial state exercise self-reflexivity as to why it engages
with outer space, and who is advantaged and disadvantaged here on Earth
as a result of this engagement. Settler Colonialism and 'Space' A brief
exploration of what settler colonialism is, and its engagement with
'space' here on Earth is necessary to start. [Settler colonialism is
commonly understood to be a form of colonialism that is based upon the
permanent presence of colonists upon land]{.underline}. This is a
distinction from forms of colonialism based upon resource extraction
(Wolfe, 2006; Veracini, 2013). What this means is that the settler
colony is intimately tied with the space within which it exists---it
cannot exist or sustain itself without settler control over land and
space. [This permanent presence upon land by 'settlers' is usually at
the expense of the Indigenous, or original people, in a given space or
territory]{.underline}. To reiterate: [[control over space is
paramount]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Wolfe states, [["Land is
lif]{.underline}e]{.mark}---or at least, land is necessary for life.
Thus, [contests for land]{.underline} can be---indeed, often
[are---contests for life]{.underline}" (2006: 387). Without land, the
settler state 'dies'; conversely, deprivation of land from the
indigenous population means that in settler logic, indigeneity dies
(Povinelli, 2002; Wolfe, 2006.) [The ultimate aims of settler
colonialism is therefore the occupation and remaking of
space.]{.underline} As Wolfe (2006) describes, the [settler state seeks
to make use of land and resources in order to continue on; whether that
is through homesteading]{.underline}/residence, farming and agriculture,
[mining, or any number of activities that settler colonial logic deems
necessary to its own survival. These activities are tied to a racist and
hubristic logic that only settler society itself possesses the ability
to make proper use of]{.underline} land and [space]{.underline} (Wolfe,
2006). This is mated with [a viewpoint of landscapes prior to European
arrival as terra nullius, or empty land t]{.underline}hat was owned by
no one[, via European/Western conceptions of land ownership and
tenure]{.underline} (Wolfe, 1994). Because of this overarching goal of
space[, [there is an inherent anxiety in settler colonies about space,
and how it can be occupied and subsequently rewritten to remove
Indigenous presence]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Anglo settler colonies,
[this often takes place within a lens of conservation.]{.underline}
Scholars such as Banivanua Mar (2010), Lannoy (2012), Wright (2014) and
Tristan Ahtone (2019) have written extensively on the ways that [settler
reinscription of space can be extremely damaging to Indigenous people
from a lens of 'conservation']{.underline}. However, dispossession of
Indigenous space in favor of settler uses can also be tied to some of
the most destructive forces of our time. For example, Aboriginal land in
the Australian Outback was viewed as 'empty' land that was turned into
weapons ranges where the British military tested nuclear weapons in the
1950s, which directly led to negative health effects upon Aboriginal
communities downwind from the testing sites (Vincent, 2010). Indigenous
nations in the United States have struggled with environmental damage
related to military-industrial exploitation as well. But, what does this
all look like in regard to outer space? In order to really understand
the potential (settler) colonial logics of space exploration, we must go
back and explore the ways in which [space exploration became
inextricably tied with questions of state hegemony and geopolitics
during the Cold War]{.underline}. US and Soviet space programs were born
partially out of military utility, and propaganda value---the ability to
send a nuclear warhead across a great distance to strike the enemy via a
ICBM and the accompanying geopolitical respect that came with such a
capability was something that greatly appealed to the superpowers, and
when the Soviets took an early lead in the 'Space Race' with Sputnik and
their Luna probes, the United States poured money and resources into
making up ground (Werth, 2004). [The fear of not only falling behind the
Soviets militarily as well as a perceived loss of prestige in the court
of world opinion spurred the US onto a course of space
exploration]{.underline} that led to the Apollo moon landings in the
late 1960s and the early 70s (Werth, 2004; Cornish, 2019). [I argue that
this fits neatly into the American settler creation myth referenced by
Trump---after 'conquering' a continent and bringing it under American
dominion, [why would the United States stop solely at 'space' on
Earth?]{.mark}]{.underline} To return to Grandin (2019), [[space
represented yet another frontier to be conquered and known by the
settler colonial state;]{.mark} if not explicitly [for the possibility
of further settlement]{.mark}, then for [the preservation of its
existing spatial extent on Earth.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, scholars
such as Alan Marshall (1995) have cautioned [that newer logics of space
exploration such as [potential resource extraction tie in with existing
military logics]{.mark} in a way that creates a new way of thinking
about [the 'openness' of outer space to the logics of
empire]{.mark}]{.underline}, in what Marshall calls [res
nullius]{.underline} (1995: 51)\[i\]. But we cannot forget the concept
of terra nullius and how [our exploration of the stars has real effects
on Indigenous landscapes here on Earth]{.underline}. We also cannot
forget about forms of space exploration that may not be explicitly tied
to military means. Doing so deprives us of another lens through which to
view the tensions between settler and Indigenous views of space and to
which end is useful. Indeed, [[even reinscribing of Indigenous space
towards 'peaceful' settler space exploration have]{.mark} very real
[consequences]{.mark} for Indigenous sovereignty and Indigenous
spaces.]{.underline} Perhaps [the most prominent example of the
fractures between settler space exploration and Indigenous peoples is
the on-going controversy surrounding the construction of the Thirty
Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea]{.underline}, on the island of Hawaii.
While an extremely detailed description of the processes of construction
on the TMT and the opposition presented to it by Native Hawai'ians and
their allies is beyond the scope of this essay, and in fact is already
expertly done by a number of scholars\[ii\], [t[he controversy
surrounding TMT is a prime example of the logics presented towards
'space' in]{.mark} both Earth-bound and [beyond-Earth contexts by the
settler colonial state]{.mark} as well as [the violence that these
logics place upon Indigenous spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}[, s]{.mark}uch
as Mauna Kea, which in particular already plays host to a number of
telescopes and observatories (Witze, 2020). In particular, [astronomers
such as Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, Lucianne Walkowicz, and others have
taken decisive action to push back against [the idea that settler
scientific advancement via space exploration should take precedence over
Indigenous sovereignty in Earth-space]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Prescod-Weinstein and Walkowicz, alongside Sarah Tuttle, Brian Nord and
Hilding Neilson (2020) make clear that [[settler scientific
pursuits]{.mark} such as building the TMT [are simply new footnotes in a
long history of colonial disrespect of Indigenous people and Indigenous
spaces in the name of science,]{.mark} and that [astronomy is not
innocent of this disrespec]{.mark}t]{.underline}. In fact, [Native
Hawai'ian scholars such as Iokepa Casumbal-Salazar strike at the heart
of the professed neutrality of sciences like astronomy: [One scientist
told me that astronomy is a "benign science"]{.mark} because it is
[based on observation, and that it is universally beneficial because it
offers "basic human knowledge"]{.mark} that everyone should
know]{.underline} "like human anatomy." Such a statement [[underscores
the cultural bias within conventional notions of what constitutes the
"human" and "knowledge.]{.mark}"]{.underline} In the absence of [a
critical self-reflection on this inherent ethnocentrism, [the tacit
claim to universal truth reproduces the cultural supremacy of Western
science as self-evident]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here, [the needs of
astronomers for tall peaks in remote locations supplant the needs of
Indigenous communities on whose ancestral territories these
observatories are built]{.underline} (2017: 8). As Casumbal-Salazar and
other scholars who have written about the TMT and the violence that has
been done to Native Hawai'ians (such as police actions designed to
dislodge blockades that prevented construction) as well as the potential
violence to come such as the construction of the telescope have
skillfully said, [when it comes to the [infringement upon Indigenous
space by settler scientific endeavors tied to space exploration]{.mark},
there is no neutrality to be had---dispossession and violence are
dispossession and violence, no matter the potential 'good for humanity'
that might come about through these things.]{.underline} Such
contestations over outer space and ethical engagement with previously
unknown spaces will continue to happen[. [Outer space is not the first
'final frontier']{.mark}]{.underline} (apologies to Gene Roddenberry)
[that has been discussed in settler logics and academic
spaces]{.underline}. In terms of settler colonialism, scholars have
written about how Antarctica was initially thought of as the 'perfect'
settler colony---land that could be had without the messy business of
pushing Indigenous people off of it (see Howkins 2010). Of course, we
know now that engagement with Antarctica should be constrained by
ecological concern---who is to say that these concerns will be heeded in
'unpopulated' space? What can be done to push back against these settler
logics?

\"NATO-Russia war inflames conflict between Turkey and Greece\"; World
Socialist Web Site;

Amid the ongoing US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine, [tensions are
**rising dangerously** between NATO member states **Turkey** and
**Greece**]{.underline} in the Aegean Sea. [The two countries are
holding **war games** aimed at each other, trading accusations of
disregarding **international treaties**, and violating **each other's
borders** with jet fighters and warships]{.underline}.

The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) Ephesus 2022 exercise, held in the Aegean
Sea and attended by more than 10,000 military personnel, ended last
week. Thirty-seven countries, including the United States and Italy,
participated in air, sea and land drills. Held in Seferihisar, only 1.5
kilometers from the nearby Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, the
exercise was based on the scenario of a "military landing on an island."
It was widely treated in Turkish capitalist media as a threat against
Greece.

Greek media reported that during Greece\'s naval exercise Storm 2022,
which ended on May 27, Turkey sent "two F-16 fighter jets that violated
Greek airspace, reaching just two 2.5 nautical miles from the northern
port city of Alexandroupoli."

During the Ephesus 2022 exercise, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
accused Greece of militarizing Aegean Sea islands in violation of
international agreements. He warned Athens \'one last time\' on this:
"We invite Greece to stop militarizing the islands that have
non-military status and to act in accordance with international
agreements. I'm not joking, I'm speaking seriously."

Threatening to militarize Turkish islands if necessary to threaten
Greece, Erdoğan said, "We again warn Greece to avoid dreams, statements
and actions that will lead to regret, just as they did a century ago," a
reference to the Turkish war of independence against the British-backed
Greek invasion in 1919-1922.

A week ago, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Çavuşoğlu accused Greece of
violating its peace treaties with Turkey: "But what is another reason
for Greece to be aggressive? Greece\'s violation of the status of the
islands given to it in the 1923 Lausanne Treaty and 1947 Paris Treaty
under the condition of not militarizing them \[Greek islands in the
Aegean Sea\], and our raising this violation within the framework of
international law."

Cavusoglu added: "The sovereignty of the islands will be questioned if
Greece does not end its violation." This threat to "question" Greece's
sovereignty over islands it controls amount to a threat to invade them
and go to war.

The Greek Foreign Ministry reacted to the Ephesus-2022 exercise and
statements by Turkish officials on Twitter, writing, "[Ankara poses a
**threat** to **regional peace** and **security**]{.underline}." On
Thursday, Greek government spokesman Giannis Oikonomou dismissed the
Turkish claims, calling them "Ahistorical claims and baseless myths that
can neither challenge nor, let alone, substitute for international law
and international treaties."

Accusing Erdoğan of provocation, Oikonomou threatened, "It is clear to
everyone that [our country has upgraded its
**geostrategic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[geopolitical
footprint]{.underline}** [as well as its **deterrent capacity** to be
able at any time to **defend**]{.underline} its national sovereignty and
sovereign rights."

A century after World War I began in the Balkans, NATO and the bourgeois
[governments in the region again risk **plunging the world** into a
**catastrophic war**]{.underline}. In 2020, tensions between Turkey and
Greece over natural gas and sea borders in the eastern Mediterranean
were defused by EU and especially German mediation. Greek-Turkish talks
resumed. However, as the World Socialist Web Site warned, "[History
shows such conflicts cannot be peacefully resolved **under
capitalism**]{.underline}, [whether or not a **temporary** Greek-Turkish
peace deal is somehow reached]{.underline}."

The US-NATO war on Russia in Ukraine has now inflamed the Greek-Turkish
conflict, turning the Aegean into an undeclared second front in the
NATO-Russia war.

The right-wing government of Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
has unabashedly aligned itself with Washington's moves against Russia.
The Greek port of Alexandroupoli in the northern Aegean Sea has been
transformed into a major US military base. Alexandroupoli is also being
used to deliver weapons to Ukraine and to NATO forces along the border
with Ukraine in Romania.

[The Turkish bourgeoisie has pursued a **cynical**]{.underline},
**[two-faced]{.underline}** [policy on the NATO war on
Russia]{.underline}. On the one hand, it has backed NATO's Ukraine
policy, including the far-right coup NATO backed in Kiev in 2014, and
armed Kiev with armed Bayraktar TB2 drones. On the other, it has kept
diplomatic channels with Russia open, greeting Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov in Ankara, and posed certain obstacles to the most
aggressive NATO moves targeting Russia.

Ankara closed the straits linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea
coast of Ukraine and Russia to both NATO and Russian warships, blocking
a NATO naval attack on Russia. It also threatened to veto NATO's plans
to absorb Sweden and Finland and post NATO troops on Russia's northern
border with Scandinavia. The Turkish government was not objecting to the
war, however, but continuing its long-standing targeting of the Kurdish
people: it denounced Sweden and Finland for having ties to
Kurdish-nationalist organizations.

Washington responded to this veto threat by inviting Mitsotakis to give
a speech denouncing Turkey in the US Congress. During his
enthusiastically received speech, Mitsotakis blamed Turkey for the
division of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and demanded a halt to US
F-16 sales to Turkey. US President Joe Biden also gave Mitsotakis strong
support.

Erdoğan condemned Mitsotakis\' trip, declaring that Mitsotakis "no
longer exists" for him. Erdoğan added that he viewed the US-NATO bases
in Greece, targeting Russia and growing Chinese economic influence in
the region, as a threat to his government, saying, "And, most
importantly, there are nearly a dozen bases in Greece. Whom does Greece
threaten with those bases?"

Workers in Greece, Turkey and internationally must be warned: [the
danger that the conflicts in the Black Sea and the Balkans will
**escalate uncontrollably** into a **world war** is very
great]{.underline}. In the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, [prices
are **spiraling** out of control as the **financial aristocracy**
massively increases its wealth. This has provoked **strikes** and
**protests**]{.underline} [internationally, and capitalist governments
are **all terrified**]{.underline} [of the international eruption of the
class struggle]{.underline}.

In Greece, there have been protests against the arrival of NATO forces,
including the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, to threaten
Russia. Strikes have also broken out among rail workers against being
forced to ship US tanks towards the Ukrainian and Russian borders. This
follows a decade of savage austerity imposed by the European Union and
both Mitsotakis' New Democracy and the pseudo-left SYRIZA ("Coalition of
the Radical Left") governments.

[In Turkey, the last year has seen an **eruption** of **health care**
strikes against the **official mishandling** of the COVID-19 pandemic
and **wildcat strikes** in auto, steel, mining, shipbuilding and other
industries against the **devastating surge**]{.underline} [in
prices]{.underline}. A one-day nationwide strike by over 100,000 doctors
in Turkey is set to begin today.

[Erdoğan and Mitsotakis]{.underline} are nearly at war with each other,
but they [are united in the attempt to use **militarism**]{.underline}
[and **nationalism**]{.underline} [to **divide** the **working
class**]{.underline} [and **suppress** the **growing
struggles**]{.underline} on both shores of the Aegean Sea. [It is
**impossible** to tell where their **reckless military adventurism**
ends]{.underline}, [and where their incitement of **anti-worker
chauvinism** begins]{.underline}. [The decisive question this poses is
unifying workers' struggles internationally in a
**socialist**]{.underline}, **[anti-war]{.underline}** [movement to
**bring down** these governments and transfer power to the **working
class**]{.underline}.

[War as defined by classical war studies suggests a **distinct class of
actors, interests, aims, and expertise**.]{.underline} As a result, [the
study of war as well as much of the social mobilization of war
**presumes an exteriority of war** and warfare from other sectors and
institutions like the economy or the state]{.underline}. For those who
study military history, war---in [this limited
understanding]{.underline}---[can certainly be decisive in the rise and
fall of nation-states and even transformations of the global system when
that system is only indexed by the states that populate it, but the
pursuit of these histories still presumes a kind of exceptional
character of war. War following this line of thought is a **cataclysmic
event** that interrupts the **otherwise normal character of daily
life**.]{.underline} For others, particularly in the field of strategic
studies, warfare is a tool, an instrument whereby states and sometimes
organizations pursue ends beyond the limits of politics and persuasion.
[War compels and determines a course of action as an orchestral
direction of overwhelming force]{.underline}. For those who hope to
abolish war, a parallel exteriority animates their theorizing about war.
War, according to these thinkers, is reducible to the self-interest of
hegemonic states, the militarism of soldiers, and the self-amplifying
loop of profit and power. Presidents, generals, ceos, arms dealers, and
patriots come together to pursue war as an end in itself. Again, those
actors and those pursuits are treated as outside the normal realm of
human social relations. But what if war is history? What if the very
form of life that created, was reinforced by, mutated with, and emerged
from the Eurocene is warlike? [State-making, territorialization,
expansion, annihilation, settlement, and globalization are all warlike
relations]{.underline}. I want to [consider the possibility of war and
warlike relations as processes of making a form of life in which warfare
is normal]{.underline}. And what I mean by normal is much more than what
we mean when we use concepts like ideology or legitimacy or discipline.
By normal, I mean [the **very fabric of relations** that **makes a form
of life and a world:** **a war body**, **a war assemblage**, **a war
ecology**. I am not suggesting that war is the only form of life. There
are surviving forms of life interior and exterior to the
Eurocene]{.underline}. No process of annihilation succeeds without
leaving at least a trace.3 However, [the normal workings of daily global
life are a state of war. Rather than think of state of war in the
juridical or theoretical sense, which distinguish war from peace on the
grounds of declarations or measures of order, I want to consider **war
as an ecology** **endemic to the Eurocene**.]{.underline} So by state of
war I mean state in the sense that physicists or chemists think about
states of matter. Every state of matter is an order, and despite that
order, every state of matter has some elements of other states. A state
of matter exhibits properties like solidity, liquidity, gaseousness, or
the full-on freak-out of plasma but is not entirely made up of that
state. And yet the state still has an effect despite that heterogeneity.
So to say that we live in a global state of war, and that the making of
the [Eurocene was that making of a global state of war, is to say that
war intensifies the field of relations that make the world what it is
right now, not that it exhausts the possibility of what the world can
become]{.underline}. Instead, [the practices and organizations---from
resource extraction, enclosure, carbon liberation, racialization, mass
incarceration, border enforcement, policing and security practices,
primitive accumulation by dispossession, targeted strikes, to allout
combat---are relations of war rather than merely correlates or
opportunities for a war metaphor.]{.underline} To put it a bit more
bluntly, [politics, colonialism, settlement, capitalism, ecological
destruction, racism, and misogynies are not wars by other means---they
are war]{.underline}. [**War is not a metaphor**; it is an **intensive
fabric of relations making the Eurocene.**]{.underline} To make this
claim requires rethinking---somewhat bombastically---the meaning of war.
If war has such a wide application, it would seem to mean nothing. In
talks, roundtables, and casual conversations, [colleagues have often
suggested that such an expansive definition of war is polemical or even
absurd]{.underline}. Others have said that spreading war so thin
cheapens the sacrifices and tragedies of those who have experienced
"real war." It is curious to me that many of [the same people have no
difficulty assigning similar base or structuring characteristics to
capitalism, settlement, or patriarchy]{.underline}. I do not see war as
a replacement or a displacement of those structuring structures.
Instead, [war is like those other complicated, heterogeneous, abstract
machines but interrelated and importantly semiautonomous in the making
of the world. The importance of shifting the point of emphasis or break
between war and other "big processes" is to emphasize the way
**collectively making death** comes to be **its own organizing ecology**
rather than just an instrumental means for other ecologies, such as
racism or sexism or capitalism]{.underline}, that are often more
obviously invested in ordering---subordinating orders---than
destruction. Furthermore, [I do not think, given the extreme level of
violence and deprivation necessary to create the global ecology we now
inhabit, that it is "a stretch" to call war the **constitutive fabric of
planetary relations**.]{.underline} Instead, [war as an intensive
difference takes possession of other categories, at which point phase
shifts take place in categories like racism or economics]{.underline}.
[What was the slow, lethal burn of postslavery policing escalates into
the fury of outright combat in the streets, a race war in the streets of
1921 Tulsa or the 2015 streets of Baltimore. Even in our sacred texts of
democratic theory, the **pulsing tributaries of war** **run throughout**
descriptions of **political formation**]{.underline}. John Locke argued
with little dispute that slavery was the institutionalization of war.4
And W. E. B. Du Bois said of the process of reconstruction after slavery
that war had begun again, and in fact had never ended.5 Do we think that
the same could not be said for the vast carceral project directed at
black people described so well by Michelle Alexander or Loïc Wacquant?6
The common retort is to ask whether this line of thinking means all
forms of killing should be considered war. I think that is a reasonable
question. However, I believe that retort actually demonstrates the
problem of war in the Eurocene. Take, for instance, the lynching of
African Americans after the American Civil War or the routine murder of
Native Americans by settlers before the arrival of the American cavalry
during the period of westward expansion. Were these killings disparate
acts of murder or strategically valuable microevents of war? How would
patriarchy's sadistic continuity and heterogeneous creativity across
geography and time survive without the nearly viral practices of
domestic violence that suture norms to bruises, scars, and corpses? [To
exclude the way **each micropractice of war**---murder---**aggregates
over time and space** into **continental scale, slow-motion warfare**
would significantly impoverish our understanding of the role war plays
in the making of global systems.]{.underline} Any one act of brutality
could be dismissed on idiosyncratic grounds and attributed to lazy
claims about human nature. Or these [acts of brutality can be brought
into a conceptual jurisdiction of war such that we can get a glimpse of
how these seemingly disparate practices of violence resonate, congeal,
and order the global system.]{.underline} The historical granularity
necessary to prove this seemingly absurd proposition is well beyond the
scope of this book. Instead, this chapter and the larger aim of the book
try to identify operators or machines in the emergence of war that
confound the tried and true questions of sovereignty, security dilemmas,
and the increasingly apparent absurdity of circumscribing global
political change to the behavior of "great powers" in a rationalist and
statecentric sense. The commitment to a world run by the causal agents
of states, regimes, and norms (whether thick or thin) appears to me like
the Velveteen Rabbit: toys whose straw stuffing is beginning to poke
through worn skin and whose button eyes have been long since lost.
Unlike the mythic rabbit, there is nothing real for these fetishes to
become.7 The first step to understand war as a form of life that is
world forming requires building a community of concepts capable of
capturing the diversity of relations at work in the making of war. It is
a messy inquiry. In recoil from this indiscernible mess, there are those
who would rather "un--black box" phenomena by exhaustively identifying
all actants or detailing complex processes of social and material
change, but these approaches are ill-suited to describing the broader
ecology of war. [The problem with the desire to explain or un--black box
phenomena is that it seduces us to focus on those phenomena on which we
think we have the best chance of imposing an artificial autonomy or
separation of things and events]{.underline}. Those phenomena that seem
to give themselves up to analyzable bits and pieces are prized for
publication and research funding. This cult of discreteness has not
gotten us very far. Reality does not, as some realist philosophers say
in a creepy analogy to butchering, "cut at the joints."8 Positivism,
even the complexity and systems variety, wants an object of inquiry at
an instant. In a particularly Whiteheadian moment, Merleau-Ponty
responds to the desire for discreteness with disdain: In human
existence, then, there is a principle of indetermination, and this
indetermination does not merely exist for us . . . from some
imperfection in our knowledge. . . . Existence is indeterminate in
itself because of its fundamental structure: insofar as existence is the
very operation by which something that had no sense takes on sense. . .
. Existence has no fortuitous attributes and no content that does not
contribute to giving it its form, it does not admit any pure facts in
themselves, because it is the movement by which facts are taken up.9 [In
the attempt to vivisect existence]{.underline}---[to reduce to an
instant what is process and movement, rhythm and
relation]{.underline}---[those more subtle connections or resonances
whose effects are felt but not discrete are overshadowed by those
relationships we can chart and measure]{.underline}. Such an approach
circumscribes our thinking rather than allowing it to remain open to the
emergence of thought as provoked by a wild world. Domesticated notions
of complexity are stand-ins for the merely complicated. Real complexity
suggests that there is novelty in the world rather than thinking that
novelty is an effect of a complicated process. This is what
Merleau-Ponty means when he says that the indeterminate is the
"fundamental structure of the world." Those who see in complexity the
mere character of complicatedness invest in that image of complexity the
hope for more sophisticated predictive models and desire a mechanistic
universe defined by initial conditions.10 For [those striving to create
positivism 2.0]{.underline}, [chance exists as an endangered species to
be extinguished once all the data are in.]{.underline} I think [this
diminishes the **creative and chaotic elements** of **becoming**
characteristic of **ecologies like war**, and **reinvests the desire**
for **order and control** with a **false and dangerous
telos**]{.underline}. [The aleatory is reduced to a question of
epistemology rather than being seen as a **generative principle of the
cosmos**, giving new confidence to those who would **see to make useful
predictions** or pronouncements **upon their models of the
world.**]{.underline} I admit it is tempting when new scientific
discoveries verify our own theoretical belief in thinking that somehow
science has finally gotten it right. However, one need only look at what
happens when the image of thought founded on this new faux-empiricism
combines with the shabby categories of interest and security to see how
quickly scientific facts about complexity or quantum physics or networks
or sociobiology can be put to use for preventive war and social
control.11 [In international relations, even insights about uncertainty
can become a predictive social scientific method]{.underline}.12 [The
postcolonies and pockets of peoples surviving settlement are still
finding that the "study" of their cultures' complexities serves the
interests of those who would obliterate difference rather than those who
would insist on a new pluralism]{.underline}. [Anthropologists,
sociologists, and economists---all armed with the latest in
social-actor-network theory, complexity equations, and advanced social
media scraping algorithms---are deployed as part of the subsequent
revisions of the Human Terrain System in Iraq, Afghanistan, Chicago, Los
Angeles, the Dakota Access Pipeline, Yemen, Mexico, Mali, and back
again]{.underline}. **[Knowledge separated from its ethical
considerations is readily weaponized]{.underline}**.13 Rapidly scoping
from the micro of culture to the macro of the planetary scale, [the
Eurocene is already transitioning from territorial warfare to
geopolitically motivated geoengineering and regional terraforming to
institutionalize hegemony geologically while still refining the
microscopic collection of data on threats as small as a single
person.]{.underline}14 Inspired by the work in early chaos and
catastrophe theory, Deleuze and Guattari suggest another path for the
pursuit of complexity. Rather than ignore the overwhelming complexity of
the world, [scientific inquiry can be a way to cope with chaos "defined
not so much by its disorder as by the infinite speed with which every
form taking shape in it vanishes]{.underline}."15 Creative sciences
attack the problem of chaos by attributing functions to chaos so that
its shifting patterns, orders, and relations can be thought. Functions
are a kind of "fantastic slowing down, and it is by slowing down that
matter, as well as the scientific thought able to penetrate it with
propositions, is actualized."16 I want to develop war as something
between a function and a concept. I am trying to draw together
consistencies by extending out, "building bridges," and occupying larger
zones of components and functions that attempt to slow down,
distinguish, and make actual indexible territories of interest, which
only appear whole because investigation as a science has imposed a kind
of temporary and hesitant "freeze frame."17 One could become worried
that such provisional moments could get mistaken for reality itself,
however, with close attention, care for the world, such mistakes are
hard to maintain. The relational (in movement-process) and substantive
character of the world defies reductionism. Novelist and philosophical
tinkerer Tristan Garcia explains the neither/nor of concept
object-relations as follows: A thing is nothing other than the
difference between that which is in this thing and that in which this
thing is. Unless one guarantees this double sense, there are no
thinkable things. Every reductionist who claims to deduce that which
this or that thing is from that which composes this or that thing only
succeeds in dis-solving the very thing that they claim to account for.
We attempt to accomplish the exact opposite of this: to guarantee things
as invaluable differences embedded in the distribution channels of being
of the world. To complete our task, we set out to discover the meaning
which circulates among things, between that which composes them and that
which they compose, inside or outside us, with or without us.18
[War]{.underline} in particular [demands this double aspect of things to
capture war's territorializing and deterritorializing tendencies to make
and unmake things and be a thing all at the same time.]{.underline}
Although throughout the [book I take inspiration from new scientific
researc]{.underline}h---examples from [neuroscience, physics,
evolutionary **biology**, **artificial intelligence**, and experimental
psychiatry]{.underline}---that inspiration will not be used to build
some new, more stable, method of inquiry, but instead I will try [to
trouble a still pervasive image of the world as
law-governed]{.underline}. Therefore, [war serves a double movement: it
presents itself as an ordering principle or form of ecology despite the
frequent conflation between war and chaos, while also undermining the
image of the world as one ruled by the laws of a singular transcendental
order.]{.underline} Even many postpositivists, particularly
interpretivists, of various kinds are unsettled by this kind of
open-ended or experimental thought, absurdly big claims, oriented around
assemblages, resonances, or systems of thought particularly in the
context of war and violence because it means letting go, at least for a
moment, of the desire to ascribe blame or culpability---from my
perspective, consonant with causality---to particular individuals in
time and space. This is a deficit, but it comes with the benefit of
elucidating, even if only vaguely, the operators in the generation of
technics, affects, peoples, and weak or novel connections in the savage
ecologies that often determine, or at least circumscribe, the incipient
possibilities of action by the individuals we so desperately want to
hold accountable for their failures or vices. Remember Walt Whitman's
words that began this book, "The war---that war so bloody and grim---the
war I will henceforth forget---was you and me." The question in the
context of this research is: Why is [there so consistently an
arrangement of racial supremacy, power, ethics, and violence to
prosecute or distribute war and technical-martial logic to support and
distribute it?]{.underline} While it is valuable to investigate how
leaders can function to amplify conflict, [what is striking is how
quickly any one leader can be replaced and how little the trajectory of
war changes. Following Sloterdijk's pronouncement on the **becoming
atmospheric of contemporary warfare,** collective violence is
**saturating every corner of the Earth system**, but like carbon,
neither the distributors nor distribution of violence is
equitable]{.underline}. Saturation is no excuse for universality. There
will never be a we that is human as such. And yet there is also no
tribe, history of proper names, or nation-state that can bear the
responsibility in any meaningful way. Twenty or thirty generations of
malicious and sadistic decisions cannot amount to the collective effect
of the heterogeneous relations that produced the Eurocene but neither
should we let go of the particular forms of life that congealed around
an instrumental approach to collective violence that swallowed and then
organized peoples, nonhuman peoples, and things throughout Europe and
then the regions those people, nonhuman peoples, and things settled.
Mapping something like the totality of those actors and relations is
impossible and maybe even counterproductive, but tracing the lineages of
warfare that came to enable the expansion of the Europeans until they
became a "cene," a geologically and geopolitically significant order,
may gather up a swarm of conceptual machines still buzzing through our
contemporary moment. Consequently, I am less interested in why once such
an institution or assemblage is in place, a leader at a given moment
succeeds in making actual the already present virtual tendencies of war.
Consider how difficult it is to reconcile our lost hope for Barack Obama
with the expected failure of George W. Bush or how quickly the terror
over Donald Trump was normalized once the adults from the military
stepped in, precisely because [foreign policies of each arrangement of
leadership are in many ways indistinguishable, particularly from the
perspectives of their victims.]{.underline}19 It is not surprising to
me, then, that sovereigns make war, or that they take advantage of
democratic paradoxes to do so. [The problematic that drives this section
is how such a complex, mobile, and global ecology of war so closely
aligns and adheres to such a seemingly local decision as a sovereign act
of violence or declaration of war.]{.underline} One might take a lesson
from the electrification of sound. In order to amplify or magnify a
sound and preserve the fidelity of a particular harmonic arrangement,
one cannot simply "turn up" the volume. It requires a certain interface
between the means of amplification, the ambient qualities of the room,
the number of people present, and the resonant capabilities of those
people, the furniture, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. Similarly,
political decrees or decisions to produce effects must reverberate and
interface with complex assemblages of institutions, economies, ethical
dispositions, affective discourses, and other machinic operators. From
this perspective, [sovereign "decisions," whether by presidents or
suicide bombers, appear to be on both sides of the razor's edge between
cause and effect]{.underline}. Such an approach requires, as Deleuze
writes, "not so much . . . convincing, as being open about things. Being
open is setting out the 'facts' not only of a situation, but of a
problem. Making visible things that would otherwise remain hidden."20 So
[we have a world full of sovereign violence, but the place of a given
sovereign in the distribution of that violence remains obscure. What
follows is an attempt to flush out the contemporary milieu or ecology of
war in its mutational, material, and global tendencies to open up the
landscape for something that requires a history]{.underline}. In the
following chapter, I return to the specific historical mutations of war
that contributed war's contemporary becoming as a Euro-cum-American
facialization of the Eurocene. The sections that follow look for these
"loose associations" or dif­ferent assemblages that may not yet have
converged or connected but have tendencies and internal resonances that
I think organize war's various becomings. In particular, [I consider the
**ecology of annihilation** that **characterizes American practices of
warfare** now **dominant among "great powers**]{.underline}." These
parts do not follow one from the other. They are often disjointed in
their locations and themes. The hope is that the consistency that does
connect them is one of possibility or chance rather than necessity so
that the sense of inevitability that often characterizes the analysis of
global security is not so easily territorialized for the capture of war.
Some connections will appear more obvious than others, but, like other
kinds of ecologies, sometimes the connections are merely the
happenstance of coinciding; contingency can produce novelty and novelty
can be catastrophic and horrifying. From this perspective, I ask what it
would mean to consider the driving force of the Eurocene, war,
ecologically.

#### The 1AC occludes the true nature of warfighting by reducing the milieu of warfare into a series of casual, normative decisions --- instead, warfare is an abstract machine, a creatively mutating front that sutures everyday atmospheres of violence.

If that is not tautological enough, I want to specifically address
ecological relations, which rather than a redundancy is meant to
dramatize the creativity and variable interinvolvement from top to
bottom, cosmos to microorganism in all things. So an ecology of things
describes an indefinite set of more and less interpenetrated force
fields, following Timothy Morton's insistence that "[the ecological
thought permits no distance]{.underline} . . . [all beings are related
to each other]{.underline} . . . [in an open system without center or
edge]{.underline}."26 Even as Morton at times is repelled by the
airlessness and objectlessness of such an ontology, his [hyperobjects
and other formulations cannot help but thrive in such an ecological
thinking]{.underline}. As a way of thinking, [ecology comprises all the
systems causally relevant to one another even when that relevance
fluctuates with changes in the intensity of
interinvolvement.]{.underline}27 Therefore, all systems are actual and
present in every other system, but the significance of the presence
fluctuates.28 The differences in fluctuations are the differences that
provoke us to notice and think. To give some space between what is
present and what is potentially present in the everything that is the
ecological, Deleuze, like Canguilhem, often referred to the broader
ecological category of all actual things in their pluripotential
relations as the milieu, ranging from the milieu of a particular
songbird to the cosmic milieu of the current epoch.29 Even the milieu
that comprises all the milieus, the set of all sets, if you will, is not
a closed system for Deleuze. It is made up of many overlapping and
intercalated assemblages, each influenced by the varying intensities of
force fields that bear on their multiplicity, that is, the structure of
their "space of possibility" of what we mean by difference in itself or
novelty that differs.30 Channeling Morton again, "[the very question of
inside and outside is what ecology undermines or makes thick and
weird.]{.underline}"31 Sometimes those things that provoke or encounter
us are territorialized before we encounter them, and in the case of
concepts, I think, we participate in their territorialization. [War, as
a concept, is a **participatory territorialization**; its **definiteness
is lent to it by our interest**, but war is **receptive and resonates**
without our interest because it is a **real fabric of immanent
relations** making and being **made by milieus**]{.underline}.32 To move
from the abstract to the concrete, [war, as a particular kind of
ecology, may be populated by martial assemblages such as soldiers,
tanks, uniforms, gas masks, rations, and bullets. These assemblages are
then crosscut by the mobile and nearly instantaneous arrival of the sex
trade, black markets that provide a missed brand of toothpaste, a
claymore mine, a valuable medicine, and food for civilians whose support
infrastructure has been devastated by the indiscriminate aerial bombing
of their cities of residence]{.underline}.33 [There can be nonhuman
animal assemblages such as great apes and forest habitats that fight
back against civil wars, or swarms of disease-carrying mosquitoes that
alter the internal ecosystem of warm-blooded mammals]{.underline}.34
These [overlapping assemblages may then be further amplified by a
drought or famine that raises tensions between civilians and soldiers
due to the relatively constant supply of food and water that passes by
hungry or thirsty civilians on the way to a well-stocked military
barrack]{.underline}s.35 All these assemblages feel the weight of
gravity, and even the potentially mutagenic effects of cosmic rays; but
[on the temporal register of human daily routine, on any one of maybe
twenty-six thousand or so days in an average Western lifespan, these
force fields of the cosmic variety will remain incipient]{.underline}.36
But maybe not. [At a critical juncture of command, or a heightened
moment of tension, say, between two superpowers on the brink of war, the
intervention of an asteroid]{.underline} like the one that hit Tunguska
on June 30, 1908, [could]{.underline} **[cascade into global nuclear
war]{.underline}**. In what must be an infinitesimal slice of time in
the life of an asteroid or a comet, what if the Tunguska event had taken
place fifty-four years later during the events of October 1962?37 Would
the Soviet Union have been able to distinguish the nearly thirty-megaton
blast caused "naturally" by the cosmic object from a nuclear ground
burst?38 [What about forward-deployed forces like those of Saddam
Hussein's in the First Gulf War who were instructed to launch all
chemical and biological weapons if radio contact with Baghdad was
disrupted, with that disruption being the effect of a particularly
intense solar storm?]{.underline}39 [**Warfare is chancy**, more and
less than its command structure or troop training, **because it is
ecological**]{.underline}. Does this mean that wars never happen because
of "first-move advantages" or offense/defense theory? Is the security
dilemma irrelevant?40 No, and these features certainly inhabit the
assemblages discussed above. However, [we make too much of them
precisely because causal stories are within the jurisdiction of human
leaders and experts. The presence of something like "easy conquest" may
be observable post hoc, but it would not be the cause of a war in its
totality. In the cosmology of global politics]{.underline} I am trying
to build, [events have a complex natural history, an ecology that is
radically empirical but antagonistically antipositivist in that it does
not conform to the metaphysical religion of nature's
uniformity]{.underline}. As E. H. Carr remarked after his engagement
with early complexity mathematician Henri Poincare, the propositions of
scholarship must abandon Isaac Newton for hypotheses to "crystalize and
organize further thinking . . . advancing simultaneously 'towards
variety and complexity' and 'towards unity and simplicity.'"41 Such a
double articulation---not a dialectic---eschews parsimonious theories of
international politics in favor of a deep intimacy with the processes of
the world or what Brian Massumi following William James calls extreme
realism. 42 Thus [**warfare in practice and war as concept** are **not
instrumental or successfully restrained** by **cold calculations of
national interest**]{.underline}. Instead, **[war names the mutational
rhythm or machinic character in warfare that is not reducible to
warfare.]{.underline}** This is why [we should refer to war as an
**axiomatic or abstract machine.**]{.underline} [War is a concept, a
slice of chaos, to describe what remains consistent enough to demand a
concept, and provocative and mercurial enough to explain the periodic
breaks, innovations, and catastrophes of martial life.]{.underline}
Therefore, [the question of war is not one that is to be answered by a
primary cause or a number of factors in which each can be subsumed under
a law, becoming more clear as the more detailed description of its inner
workings is finely vivisected and categorized]{.underline}. Nor is war
timeless. What has been categorized under the heading of war ranges from
interspecies combat between early hominids to the dropping of atom
bombs. Still, [there is not a continuous line that can be drawn from
Paleolithic tool use to the ballistic missile Minuteman
III.]{.underline} Instead, there [is a **changing ecology of relations**
out of which the **wielding of force and combat is organized and
mobilized** and endures over a slice of time and space we can name the
Eurocene]{.underline}. To begin [with a category of war presumed to be
ahistorical that is then used to strain historical events that are in
some way recognizable as war tells us very little about any particular
practice or event and even less about the relations that connect those
events through time and space such that a concept makes sense to create
a new kind of science of war]{.underline}. Becoming War [In our
contemporary era of **networks**, **counterinsurgencies**, and
**indiscernible zones of peace and conflict**, **war enters the
battlefield more obviously at odds with sovereign
warfare**]{.underline}. It may help to work in reverse, as the
contemporary conflicts demonstrate quite starkly how "rigorous"
definitions of war fall apart, before working our way through some of
the slower, more subtle historical attractors of war such as
annihilation. The examples in the contemporary memory are not hard to
find. Consider the soldiers of My Lai who did their jobs horrifically
too well, and the absent without official leave (awol) soldiers who
refuse to fight in Israel or elsewhere. [The tragic irony of the global
war on terrorism cannot be understood until we grasp the relationship of
war to the state of affairs rather than the relationship between warfare
and the state of which much ink has been spille]{.underline}d. For
instance, war is not initially apparent in the seeming strategic
deployment of the Mujahedin---mercenaries armed and trained by the
Central Intelligence Agency (cia) against the Soviet army---until the
Mujahedin's character of war exceeds and escapes the state apparatus's
strategic proxy warfare to return as civil wars in the Congo or the
networked logistics of Al Qaeda. [The U.S. attempt to break the deadlock
of bipolar deterrence via nonstate actors did not fail to disrupt the
bipolar balance of power]{.underline}. Instead, [it worked too well,
unleashing a new mode of organization for violence and
warfare.]{.underline} Instead of the nitpicking debates over
personalities and financial connections that try to prove or disprove
that the cia "created" Osama bin Laden, [we should map the ways new
organizations of violence were let loose, imitated, reinvented, and then
echoed across the planet.]{.underline}43 Whether by conspiracy or
imitation, the Mujahedin reterritorialized in the post--Cold War,
creating a veritable franchise of warlords throughout Africa and Central
Asia, and not just with the name brands of Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and the
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (isis) but the numbers of other novel
forms of warfare taking place in conflict far outside the civilizational
drama of the war on terrorism. Drug cartels in Mexico, neo-Nazis,
Christian militias, and even neo-Nazi sympathizers within the German
military are using the decentralized structures of information sharing,
improvised precision weapons, social media recruiting, weapons
development, and on and on---a new order congealed out of a previous
order already containing the vestigial structures necessary for what
would come next. Similar to the globalization of Mujahedin-like
organizational types and techniques, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003
could not be contained or instrumentally directed despite the great
power status and traditional state form of the United States. The
funding of opposition militias, both Sunni and Shia, against the
Revolutionary Guard, combined with the dramatic assault of shock and
awe, succeeded in the successful overthrow of the Baathist regime of
Saddam Hussein. Yet the fighting did not stop there. It continued and it
multiplied. The new assemblage of opposition created by the U.S.
invasion, while not unified or even organized, successfully forced the
U.S. to give up on permanent military bases and, for a time, enter a
state of withdrawal asymptotically approaching zero. However, U.S.-led
warfare returned and at the time this book is going to press is gaining
momentum. In writing this manuscript over a period of six years, I have
wondered whether I would need the past tense to describe the on-again,
off-again conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. So far the past tense seems
indef­initely postponed. [While it is impossible to identify strict
causal relations between events, the actions of the United States in
Iraq severely undermined its ability to gain support for its military
intervention in Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, and beyond, and the
organizational types set loose during the Cold War have entered into
fecund relations for the multiplication of species of war
making.]{.underline} The frequent [riots in Mosul against continued U.S.
drone violence and special ops assassinations reverberates throughout
the on-again, off-again uprisings and state captures of Arab uprisings
are now almost forgotten outside the region. The wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan continue to return home to the U.S. territory in the form of
debt, unemployment, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers with traumatic
brain injuries, each further amplifying the reach of war long after any
particular temporal segment of warfare has ended]{.underline}.44 [The
ecology of war also produces new bodies that emerge from the preparation
of warfare and combat, both friend and enemy, as deterritorialized and
reterritorialized bodies.]{.underline} In the case of the U.S. soldier,
the body is subjected to intensive training and discipline, given
amphetamines for response time and alertness, new eyes for night vision
and multidirection sensation, then drenched in affect overdrive forms of
right-wing media, as well as lingering religious or communal or national
zeal brought with each soldier that is then worked up into a
battle-ready lather.45 Insurgents and bombers are also prepared in a
number of ways with the elixirs of fear, hate, black market drugs like
the isis amphetamine of choice Captagon, revenge, duty, religion,
ideology, and reconfigured communications technologies.46 All result in
alterations in brain chemistry and perception.47 [The body in war
abandons its organs, the rectum, the eyes, the brain, a limb, to house
the bomb or weapons platform that is its new organ, its machine that
will alter the war space that it will soon be plugged
into]{.underline}.48 Hence [the productive capacity of bodies-in-war to
produce more fear, anger, revenge, hate, sorrow, and frustration is
limited only by the creativity and plasticity of the relations that
create them. There is no moral order or normative boundary to what a
body can do]{.underline}. War Is a Creative Force [War is what escapes
and deterritorializes constraints]{.underline}. Contrary to those like
Martin Heidegger or Theodor Adorno who see war as a pure
instrumentality, the ignoble novelty of violence demonstrates that the
enframing of war is never complete. [The **standing reserve of warfare**
(soldiers, bullets, bombs, civilians to be protected, totals of enemies
to be killed, etc.) is **never wholly subsumed as a resource or
instrument.** The **fog of war**, **unforeseen escalation**, **levée en
masse**, **low-tech assemblages**, ~~blind~~ allies, **ad hoc
militias,** and the defensive advantage of weakness express the
**creative elements of war** as they have been named]{.underline};
however, this list is not exhaustive. It is not an exaggeration to say
that no historical development of humanity has entirely escaped the
gravitational pull of war. It would be more accurate to say that [war
has organized a common and highly dispersed martial form of life that
thrives in the Eurocene.]{.underline} We do not like to ask the
question, but [what if **ever-present violence** has become a **way of
being, a form of life**? What would it mean to speak of war as a
"**fabric of immanent relations**" rather than merely a regrettable
means for politics?]{.underline}49 As scholars of war and geopolitics,
in my estimation, [we do not take seriously enough the metamorphoses of
war. War is often relegated by analysts to the status of an effect or an
object rather than a concept unto itself]{.underline}. [So wars are
declared; wars are waged; wars are ended; war is even
outlawed]{.underline}. People do not speak of war as they do the
political, the ethical, and so on. We need to consider what centuries of
wars do. What is war's analogue to the political as the political is to
politics? This is important if we want to consider that just maybe the
martial is more central than the political or ethical to the forms of
life that thrive and expand in the Eurocene. Like politics or ethics,
[each tactile act in warfare is another comportment of the body, a
technique of musculature, posture, style, gait, each with its own
possibility not just to survive war but to live war.]{.underline}50 And
the life that emerges, spreads. This raises a series of questions
ignored by normative investigation of how we ought to fight or what
would constitute a just war. For example: How long can peace be absent
before the body finds its satisfaction in an assemblage of war rather
than in the "beauty" or justness of peace? When does a body or
collective find the transition to peace to be as abrupt and violent as
the outbreak of conflict? And are we really so convinced of a future
"pacific" human society, as Kant was in his Theses for a Universal
History with a Cosmopolitan Intent (1784), that we cannot imagine
warfare ceasing to be an aberration? Hasn't it already for the powers
that organize the international order? [The stakes here are not trivial;
there is no providence that guarantees we are meant to live in peace,
which means there are also no natural laws to prevent us from fully
becoming war. And how many centuries has war come to define the
expansion, integration, and annihilating homogenization of planetary
relations? How many generations of bodies since 1492 have been created
by a state of war?]{.underline}

#### The plan is a self-fulfilling prophecy that makes war inevitable.

[In war, new bodies are made]{.underline}, but not by war any more than
war is made by bodies. Instead, there is what Massumi describes [as an
"instantaneous backand-forthing between now and the future, and between
disparate domains of activity]{.underline}. . . . The strike of paradox
renders the gesture inventively 'undecidable'---in addition to being
true."57 In the slight difference between axe swings---one to chop wood,
the other to sever arms---is the incipient possibility of dif­ferent
"cultural beings" and the longue durée of dif­ferent forms of life. This
incipience is contained not in the decision but in between the world and
the body and then subsequently in the worlds those bodies make. The
in-between of incipience is also not restricted to the human. A slight
difference in urban development---one high-rise to promote downtown
living and another to contain racial difference---may just as easily
extend from the indiscernibility of reality and enable or amplify a
particular becoming, or make it more durable or more contagious.
Similarly, [we should **puncture the myth** that the **preparation for
war and the prosecution of war** are **dif­ferent in kind**.]{.underline}
Instead, [we should treat the body and the **body of war as an "ecology
of process**]{.underline}."[58 **In preparation**---**the becomings of
war**---it is not just the habit of **sighting and pulling triggers**,
**innovating new strategies** and the **means to eliminate
populations**]{.underline} like the cities of Dresden or Hiroshima.
**[It is the affective mood]{.underline}**, **[the technological and
urban regulators]{.underline}** [and **amplifiers of the flows that slow
and congeal into new habits**---li]{.underline}ke dropping a bomb from
thirty thousand feet and other incipient possibilities, pre-adaptations,
that might at another moment find expression, like refusing to launch
nuclear weapons in a time of crisis.59 [**War makes worlds and worlds
make war. Shifting our interests from events and acts to processes and
habits** directs our attention to how the **outbreak of war may be
subterranean** in **habitual activities that are not seemingly
warlike**]{.underline}. [We should not be fooled by the common sense
that because things are not always at the fever pitch of war, war is not
working behind the scenes in our imaginative, judging, and bodily
faculties as well as our ports, freeways, internet connections,
satellite feed, and toxic runoff, emotional and molecular]{.underline}.
Some preparations for war move too slow to be seen.60 [If we want to
attend to war's invitation to be thought, we must make more vivid those
preparations for warfare that often get lost in political realist
discussions of armaments and troop movement, like the slow accretion of
carbon over a century or two, the reorganization of waste, the
resignification of belonging, and other more gradual processes in the
conversion of lifeworlds to "**operational atmospheres" for past and
future wars,** exposing]{.underline} what Sloterdijk calls "[new
surfaces of vulnerability]{.underline}."61 [The consequences of a life
of war far exceed any particular battle or even world war.]{.underline}

#### Warfare is an engine that operationalizes entire societies in service of its destructive rhythm --- the 1AC's move to advance techno-warfighting is inextricably linked to racial violence, settler colonialism, and imperialism.

[In light of the **total ecological wars** of **U.S. settlement** and
**the total consummation of technological advance and warfare**, there
is a temptation to use]{.underline} Fuller's claim about [the opening of
the conceptual boundaries between war, economy, life, and politics at
the end of the nineteenth century to allow war as a technological
Western art to be the final word on the possibilities of
life.]{.underline} Many others have joined Fuller in this claim. For
Marx, civil society is a kind of congealed war.89 For Du Bois, the
Reconstruction era was war continued.90 For Foucault, politics was war
by other means.91 Foucauldians and those who follow Agamben make similar
claims in the expansion of Foucault's inversion to a general description
of global politics.92 It is this, Foucault's formulation taken globally,
that has most caught fire among critical scholars of international
politics and elsewhere. [Foucault's account of the reversal of war and
politics rests on a distinction between the sovereign or juridical
orders of the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries and the rise of a
security dispositif beginning at the end of the eighteenth
century]{.underline}.93 However, [this epistemic shift from sovereign
war to governmentalized policing is insufficient to explain the
formation of what Foucault elsewhere called counterconducts, that is,
the emergence of new practices and relations of war that are not
derivative of or contingent on the particular carceral logic of the city
and its milieu.]{.underline} Again, if we follow this logic, [we fall
victim to a historical periodization that reinforces the provincial
Eurocentrism that all too often confines genealogical analysis to the
European continent as the source of change]{.underline}. To repeat the
critical maneuvers of Foucault rather than merely follow his extant
texts requires attention to the material formations of war (particularly
those outside the city and beyond the European continent) that follow
their own organizational and emergent logics, and which far exceed the
inside/outside distinction Foucault draws between the rise of the police
and what he characterizes as a lingering form of classical war at home
in the European balance of power.94 By turning Clausewitz's words inside
out, what we are left with is little more than war as an instrument; it
is just that now war is waged on more fronts, both internal and
external. This does nothing to complicate the concept of war. J. F. C.
Fuller's materialist account of the slugfest between what he calls the
constant tactical factor and the quantity theory of war comes to a
similar conclusion as Foucault, but the inversion of Clausewitz and the
targeting of whole populations provokes an image quite dif­ferent from
that of biopolitics. Instead, quoting Fuller from 1942: "[War ceasing to
be a struggle between life values becomes a blind destructive force,
like an earthquake, a volcanic eruption or a typhoon. Whole populations
are now attacked, wiped out, enslaved or herded from one country into
another like cattle]{.underline}. . . . [the entire life of the enemy
state comes to be the object of attack.]{.underline}" Fuller continues
quoting Ely Culbertson, "From time immemorial, men fought against men,
and weapons were but accessories; [in this and in future wars,
**machines fight against machines** and men are all but
auxiliaries]{.underline} . . . **[engines of destruction which devour
their substance]{.underline}**.95 This process occurs because [**war is
an assembly** of **things set in motion and held together** by the
**racial refrain of settler colonization**, the **imperial and
postimperial** **transforms territory into operational space**, and, as
an assemblage, war is also **transformed by those mutations and
expansions**.]{.underline} Following the ecological account developed in
the last chapter, **[war is not a tool of the state or a failure of
order]{.underline}**. [War is a **phylum of organizing principles,
refrains, and protocols** unto itself. War drag**s along with it the
whole of the population**---its **vitality**, **industry**,
**inventiveness**, **movement**, **rhythm, and affect**---and attests to
the human and nonhuman character of the population and **violently
metabolizes other forms of life** in its path.]{.underline} If we want
to call war biopolitical, [then bios must extend beyond the human and
certainly the thin European conception of humanism]{.underline}, and
even the nonhuman animal, [into the **creative anime of all things**,
and into the **formative and energetic forces of war** from its
beginnings]{.underline}. [Mass war was set loose by the French
Revolution's levée en masse as much as it was made possible by
gunpowder, supply lines, radio, interchangeable parts, mass production,
and the increasing speed and efficiency of transportation and
communication of information, whether linguistic or otherwise, as well
as new terrains of racialized enmity]{.underline}. [All these feedbacks
point to a **milieu or ecology of war** that, while overlapping with the
market or the epistemophilia of nineteenth-century humanizing sciences,
lured these assemblages into connection at least as much as Foucault's
account of late capitalism or humanist governmentality.]{.underline}
Therefore, **[the constant tactical factor]{.underline}**---**[war as
mutative creativity]{.underline}**---[is not just an **axiomatic or
abstract machine of war**. It is a **global abstract machine**
**traversing the war/nonwar divide**; **war individuates specific forms
of life.**]{.underline} Hence[, we can talk about warlike relations and
governance as a martial logic without having to find combat present in
either of these conceptual expansions]{.underline}. This statement would
seem consistent with those inspired by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt,
who seek to supplement Foucault by rebranding the global system an
empire. However, while Negri describes the veritable
deterritorialization of war, politics, economy, and life, he too quickly
subsumes these deterritorializations under the logic of capitalism. For
him, war is little more than a supplement or effect of capital: "War
seems the only possible solution. . . . With the disappearance of the
internal criteria that allow that self-regulation and self-valorization
of development, it is the violence of the strongest that creates the
norm. . . . it guarantees the smooth running of society and widens the
terms of the market."96 This is too simplistic, and perhaps this
formulation should also be flipped on its head. [War ought to be seen
from the other side too as a martial machine with capitalist
biopolitical effects, not just a capitalist axiomatic with martial
effects. This would shift the emphasis from an anthropocentric
preoccupation with human "states of emergency" or sovereign states of
exception, or market failure, to the emergence of material assemblages
that amplify human events such that they reverberate throughout the
assembly of things.]{.underline} Within the analytic frame of
capitalism, the microbial devastation of the Americas as well as the
subsequent annihilation of forms of life would be incidental to the

[The competition environment of increasingly long wars, now stretching
decades rather than months or years, is ripe for the **emergence of such
forms of life** not unlike the already too-present emergence of **child
soldiers** or **battlefield-created antibiotic-resistant
microbes**]{.underline}.82 Conflict zones now last for generations.
Think of how few denizens in Iraq can remember a time before a U.S.
invasion. Beyond the ongoing combat with isis, current generations of
Iraqis now suffer from war-induced air pollution and geneticsdamaging
heavy metals in the water table. [War has, on a human timescale,
permanently changed their zone of the atmosphere and terrestrial
environment]{.underline}.83 [The long war is, for many, an endless war
as they were born in war and will likely die before a conclusion is
found]{.underline}. The stories of J. G. Ballard and Joe Haldeman are no
longer fictional for many in the Middle East, as well as parts of Africa
and Central and South Asia.84 As William Gibson said in an interview on
npr, the future is already here, just unevenly distributed. This is
particularly true of the future of war.85 Thus [**contemporary warfare**
**waged by U.S. and nato forces** is a form of **sustainable warfare**:
**slower casualty rates**; **geographically dispersed targets**;
**automated and subcontracted violence**; and **zones of indistinction**
between war, crime, development, and humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}. [All render the otherwise effective means of
war termination ineffective. **Sustainable warfare** means a
**near-permanent state of war** to **incubate new forms of life**:
**organic, mechanical, and digital** as well as every possible hybrid
permutation]{.underline}. [What comes out of such an encounter between
war, life, and creativity is something like the **weaponization of life
itself**.]{.underline} Sloterdijk has considered at length the
weaponization of the lifeworld in the history of gas weapons and
incendiary bombing.86 However, I have something a little dif­ferent in
mind. Rather than the weaponization of the umwelt of life[, I want to
think through the weaponization of the process of life during the
five-hundred-year ecological experiment of the Eurocene.]{.underline}
[What artificial life confronts us with is the possibility of
weaponizing evolution, or the conditions that reproduce and create new
forms of life. I do not mean the "weaponization" of life in the banal
metaphoric sense but the actual harnessing of **creative evolution in
the making of weapons**]{.underline}. [This is a selective breeding and
husbandry of war made possible by the collision between the faltering
and expanding strategic aims of Eurocene geopolitics, and autonomous or
creative forms of emergent artificial life. The **coming-to-life of
lethal technics** with an appetite for "us" and our "others" is not as
fantastic as the history of robot-paranoia-inspired movies like the
Terminator series would suggest]{.underline}. After all, humans and
other nonhuman animals such as dogs are already evidence of this
phenomenon. [Humans and human cognition coevolved with and through war
and technologies of war]{.underline}.87 According to Sloterdijk, [with
the **emergence of "long-distance weapons and tools,** the hominids
managed to **escape the prison of bodily adaptation**]{.underline}."88
Therefore [the novelty of the approaching future is a kind of
second-order **weaponization of life** or]{.underline}, maybe more
appropriately, the **[vitalization of weapons]{.underline}**. What would
constitute such a "vitalization"? And what would the consequences of
this vitalization be? In a philosophical sense, [it would be a world of
military surplus that insists on its own superlative
existence]{.underline}.89 [Are weapons seeking their intended use as an
end in itself?]{.underline} [Objects for themselves are creeping out of
the **bifurcating ecologies of brilliant waste;** the descendants of
land mines and ieds and cluster bombs are thriving in the data-rich
nutrient of the always already militarized internet of
things]{.underline}. Images of these vital weapons, of
mechanical-machinic life, should also challenge our concepts of
artificial intelligence and how ai might succeed at modeling human
consciousness. That is, [**human consciousness** is itself **already a
weaponization** of a brain, appendages, thumbs, eyes, and coordination,
and therefore a **martial consciousness by design.**]{.underline}90 [To
successfully model human consciousness would be to create machines
capable of sadism, torture, and murder rather than instrumental
killing.]{.underline} And what of the automation of us?91 [The
**long-term corrosion of human life** resulting from **the global
automation** of **war, peacekeeping, and policing** is impossible to
predict in its particularity but less difficult to predict in its
philosophical outcome given current trajectories of research and
deployment]{.underline}. [The ethical catastrophe of making war and
surveillance easier and cheaper, while at the same time automating
ascending layers of decisionmaking, transforms the **thin amalgam** of
**cosmopolitanism and global rights** claimed by contemporary
interventions into a **perpetual motion machine**.]{.underline} Although
algorithms currently automate technical procedures such as takeoff and
landing, object recognition software makes possible the automated
acquisition of targets, the killing of those targets, as well as the
risk and value of collateral damage. The real revolution in automation
is happening as object recognition software and its capacity to
recognize objects such as tanks or ak-47s gives way to more
sophisticated (or pseudo-sophisticated) capacities of gait and behavior
recognition.92 Following Banu Bargu's work on necroresistance, [this
form of targeting is necropower par excellence as it returns the entire
field of battle to the physiognomy of the body itself.]{.underline}
According to Bargu, "[The insurgent's body becomes the concrete
battleground of domination and resistance, subjugation and subversion,
sovereignty and sacrifice]{.underline}."93 In 2016 Turkey's armed forces
foundation company aselsan began construction of fully autonomous
machine-gun turrets called "smart towers" to use at the Syrian border
with the capability to target and kill without human oversight.94
Politically, [the **decisionistic character of sovereignty** to pursue
war becomes a **mathematical fact rather than a human judgment** of
enmity automating politics, **if not fully automating any one machine or
human soldier**.]{.underline} Furthermore, the developing drone
capabilities referred to as signature strikes that choose targets based
on behavior rather than identity move beyond questions of citizenship or
even identity common to war and violence. Instead they rely on metrics
for identifying and judging behaviors as worthy of eliminating.95 From
the ecology of autonomous and increasingly aware weapons[, a new
ontology of the enemy emerges as a technical procedure well beyond the
political landscape of enmity. Rather than simply automating the "hunt"
for enemies chosen by political processes, so-called signature strikes
signal a shift to the automation of the political decision of who is and
is not an enemy in the first place]{.underline}.96 [The identity that
corresponds to the **enmity of combat** is **replaced by an algorithmic
definition** or **function of dangerousness**.]{.underline} This shift
from what Human Rights Watch has termed "human on the loop" practices to
"human out of the loop" practices pushes the posthuman character of war
further into the Cavellian nightmare zone in which everything is an
object to be targeted but never to be encountered or recognized.97 [An
object either is or is not dangerous as its temporally specific and
targetable function]{.underline}. The cause or reason behind those
attributes is no longer relevant. These changes will not be political
events. The [switches will be flipped by military planners or software
developers without accountability]{.underline}.98 If we continue on this
trajectory, practicality will replace both strategic and moral thinking.
Further, [that practicality will be habituated by bodies that also cease
to think about the quaint human algorithms of morality and duty. The
fora in which such decisions will be made if at all are likely to
constrict, as secrecy predominates in an environment charged by a
dangerous mix of paranoia and real danger. And then it will all be
modeled, explicated, and encoded.]{.underline} In such a world, [the
event of machine awareness will parallel the loss of forms of human
awareness]{.underline}. To take a more speculative tone, what will a
close encounter with nonhuman intelligence do to force a "persisting us"
to rethink the use to which we have put machines in the pursuit of what
we ourselves have been unwilling to do? The answer is hard to consider
because the "we" that remains at such a point may appear to us now as
alien or inhuman as the machines I am speculating about.99 We should
take seriously the full spectrum of possibilities of what artificial
life will look like if it emerges from the current world of surveillance
and war that drives its evolution. To put it simply, what happens when
we make artificial life in our own image or our martial image refracted
through the physiognomy of beetles or sharks? What emerges will be a
form of life native to the Eurocene.

self/Other imagination" in Knowledge, Desire and Power in Global
Politics: Western Representations of China's Rise) //CHC-DS

Constructing the Western Self in the 'China Threat' Paradigm

[The 'China threat' paradigm is a discursive construct closely linked
with **Western/American colonial desire**]{.underline} and historical
experience. [It reflects the inability or at least unwillingness of the
Western/American self to make sense of China beyond their
own]{.underline} **[fear and realpolitik trajectories]{.underline}**. In
doing so, [its ethnocentric representation of China provides the West
with a measure of strategic familiarity and moral certainty, thus
reaffirming the self-imagination of the West]{.underline}. The
[imagination of an external 'threat' or **Other** has long been
instrumental]{.underline} to the formation and maintenance of
self-identity.31 **[In the logic of]{.underline}** what Michael Hardt
and Antonio Negri call '[**colonialist representations'**, the
difference of the Other, first having been pushed to the extreme, 'can
be inverted in a second moment as the foundation of the Self. In other
words, **the evil, barbarity, and licentiousness of the colonized Other
are what make possible the goodness, civility, and propriety of the
European Self'**]{.underline}. They go on to say that ['Only through
opposition to the colonized does the metropolitan subject really become
itself']{.underline}. 32 [The threatening imagery of 'wilderness' in the
early periods of American nation-building served a similar purpose in
that it helped maintain America's **'New World
mythology'**.]{.underline} As James Robertson notes, '[there is no New
World without wilderness. If we are to be true Americans (and thus part
of that New World and its destiny), there must be
wilderness]{.underline}. [**The symbol is an imperative for our real
world**']{.underline}.33 The construction of self-identity through the
discourses of threat, Otherness and wilderness perhaps culminated in the
poetics and politics of the Cold War, 'an important moment in the
(re)production of American identity'.34 In this process, [discourses of
international relations and foreign policy]{.underline} played a central
role. They helped [create and police boundaries and Otherness so that a
unified self could be identified and protected]{.underline}. As Campbell
notes, '[The constant articulation of danger through foreign policy is
thus not a threat to a state's identity or existence: it is its
condition of possibility. While the objects of concern change over time,
the techniques and exclusions by which those objects are constituted as
dangers persis]{.underline}t'.35 In this sense, although the Cold War
was a pivotal moment in the Western/American construction of threat,
such a discursive practice is not confined to the Cold War.36 [Not
surprisingly then, the Cold War's end did little to disrupt the
discursive ritual of constructing Otherness]{.underline}. If anything,
[the fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the 'Evil Empire'
**demanded more threats**, simply because their very absence would
become a threat to the coherence and unity of the West/the
US.]{.underline} [**Without clearly identifiable enemies**, '**there can
be no overarching ontology of security**, no shared identity
differentiating the national self from threatening others, no consensus
on what---if anything--- should be done']{.underline}. It is, as noted
before, embedded in the modern quest for certainty, and the Cold War
mentality is only **[a]{.underline}** historically specific
**[manifestation of]{.underline}** that **[ongoing modern colonial
desire]{.underline}**. 37 For this reason, Mearsheimer quite accurately
predicted that 'we will soon miss the Cold War'.38 Mearsheimer's
prediction certainly rang true within a number of US government agencies
and institutions, most notably the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), whose very identity and institutional certainty had hinged
on fighting the Cold War Communist 'Other'. If the 'Communist threat' no
longer existed, the Pentagon would find it a lot harder to justify its
massive military spending, if not its very raison d'être. More
importantly, if history had indeed been won and there was little left to
fight for, would the moral leadership of the US 'as a force for good in
the world' still be in demand?39 In the words of Huntington: ['if there
is no evil empire out there threatening those principles, what indeed
does it mean to be an American, and what becomes of American national
interests?']{.underline} 40 [Would the West, a]{.underline} '**[highly
artificial']{.underline}** [**construct**, be able to
survive?]{.underline}41 [In this context, it became **imperative for the
West to continue invoking threat**]{.underline}, which would also help
counter the internal danger of 'declining strength, flagging will and
confusion about our role in the world'. Worse still, might the rest of
the world, now no longer in need of the 'indispensable nation', break
loose or even turn around and resent the latter's hegemony? 42 [Hence
the **persistent colonial desire for a threatening Other**, which by now
is not only a source of paranoia, but also one of secret
fascination]{.underline}. Clearly mindful of this Western paradoxical
affection for enemy, Georgi Arbatov, Director of a Moscow think tank,
told a US audience the year before the collapse of the Berlin Wall: 'We
are going to do something terrible to you---we are going to deprive you
of an enemy'. 43 Arbatov was no doubt correct to imply that for the US
living without an identity-defining enemy would be terrible indeed, but
he only got half right. For [the 'enemy' qua enemy to the US is often
not determined by that 'enemy' itself]{.underline}. Rather, as noted
before, [it is primarily a category in the colonial desire built into
the modern American selfimagination.]{.underline} Consequently, '[To
prove that we are menaced is of course unnecessary... it is enough that
we feel menaced]{.underline}'.44 As a consequence, the post-Cold War
period witnessed a proliferation of freshly minted threats, ranging from
Robert Kaplan's famous 'Coming Anarchy' thesis through Mearsheimer's
'Back to the Future' scenario to Huntington's 'clash of civilizations'
prediction. That is, [it is not up to the 'enemy' to decide whether or
not it can cease to be an enemy]{.underline}. [While the
USSR]{.underline} as a specific threat [might have gone, the 'emotional
substitute' of fear in the Western/American self-imagination lived on,
always eager and able to find its next monster to destroy]{.underline}.
45 Meanwhile the emergence of the Iraq threat in the waning days of the
Cold War temporarily allowed George Bush Snr. to regain 'a whole
plateful of clarity' about 'good and evil, right and wrong'. 46 [Yet,
for many anxious strategic planners, to best demonstrate why the US
should remain an indispensable nation, the most indispensable enemy had
to be China. The 'beauty' of this mega threat lies in its apparent
ability to **satisfy the colonial desire of Western/American self** on
both strategic and moral grounds]{.underline}. Strategically, China's
vast size would be the most obvious and convenient justification for the
often expensive strategic programmes pursued by Washington. This was
true even in the midst of the Cold War when America's main obsession was
with the Soviet Union. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered his
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to build an antiballistic-missile
(ABM) system. McNamara was personally opposed to such a system,
believing that it could be easily countered by a slight increase in the
number of Soviet offensive missiles. But unable to challenge the
President's order, McNamara gave a speech, which, after stating all the
reasons why an ABM was a bad idea, concluded that the US still needed
one to defend against an attack by China. Assistant Secretary of Defense
Paul Warnke walked into McNamara's office later that day and asked,
'China bomb, Bob?' McNamara simply replied: 'What else am I going to
blame it on?'47 The end of the Cold War has only further cemented
China's role as the indispensable threat. [Representing a most suitable
strategic target for the tools at hand, China]{.underline}, as Bruce
Cumings explains, [has]{.underline} basically [become 'a metaphor for an
enormously expensive Pentagon that has lost its bearings]{.underline}
\[since the end of the Cold War\] [and that requires a
formidable]{.underline} **["renegade state"]{.underline}** [to define
its mission]{.underline} (Islam is rather vague, and Iran lacks
necessary weight)[']{.underline}. 48 Only in the aftermath of 'September
11' was China temporarily let off the hook, when terrorism in general,
and [the more tangible 'Axis of Evil' in particular, served an
essentially similar function of reassuring American self-identity and
certainty]{.underline}.49 [As well as helping sustain the
**military-industrial complex**, the China threat also has moral and
political utility for the vitality of Western self-image]{.underline}.
Beijing's continued existence as an authoritarian regime contributes
both to the self-congratulatory image of 'democratic peace' in the West
in general, and to the need for American leadership and moral authority
in particular. Insofar as China reminds us that 'history is not close to
an end',50 the US-led West can continue to be called upon by the
oppressed for moral leadership. Facing a China-led coalition of the
world's despotic regimes, the enlargement of the Western self to form a
league of democracies can be relatively easily justified, perhaps even
with a measure of urgency. 51 In short, [the moral challenge posed by
China serves as a valuable discursive site where the Western/American
self can continue to be coherently imagined, constructed and
enacted]{.underline}.

This is why [the 'China opportunity' paradigm]{.underline} is largely
responsible for the China disillusionment. It [blames China for its
false promises, hence the **China fantasy**]{.underline} (as opposed,
for example, to an admission of the China opportunity fantasy).
Proponents of this paradigm could readily concede that they have got
China wrong, [Such disappointment, when repeated, is fertile ground for
disillusionment and resentment]{.underline}. 101 [but rarely do they
acknowledge that they have got their very paternalistic hope wrong to
begin with]{.underline}. Lucian Pye claimed that his political theory
'makes sense logically, but it falls apart when applied to traditional
China',102 a phenomenon which, in his view, could only be attributed to
what he sees as an erratic Chinese political culture that 'thwart\[s\],
frustrate\[s\], and even embarrass\[es\] those who try to help
\[China\]'. He went on to say that 'For all who befriend China, the
story is the same: high hopes then disappointment'. There was no doubt
in his mind that China should take sole responsibility.103 Similarly,
[if today a 'democratic China' envisaged by the 'China opportunity'
paradigm turns out to be an illusion, China opportunity believers would
argue that it is China, rather than their China expectation, that is the
culprit]{.underline}. Bruce Gilley, for example, insists that though the
democratic project in China is 'beset with difficulties in practice', it
is 'faultless in appeal'. 104 While Gilley is for now an enthusiastic
believer in the opportunity of China's democratisation (to recall, he
argues that the prospects for a democratic China 'are now better than
ever'), it is safe to predict that if such prospects remain elusive ten
or twenty years from now, chances are that he would probably choose
disillusionment with China over a critical reflection on his democratic
project itself. Consequently, though the 'China fantasy' discourse
appears to be a critique of the 'China opportunity' paradigm (and the
associated engagement strategy), in reality it has its very roots in it.
[By identifying China as a scapegoat for the unfulfilled China
opportunity, the 'China fantasy' serves to keep the premises of this
China paradigm intact]{.underline}. In fact, most 'China fantasy'
advocates are in essence strong believers in the 'opportunity' paradigm.
This may help explain why [many who are disillusioned with China are not
typical China-bashers or hardliners, but instead China opportunity
believers who are 'mugged by reality', just as a neoconservative is
often a disillusioned liberal]{.underline}. 105 Mann's position is again
instructive here. Even as he heaps scorn on a set of illusions about the
ability of commerce and economic engagement to effect political change
in China, he concludes The China Fantasy with this telling confession:
'I have never written a book in which I hoped so fervently that I would
be proved wrong. It would be heartening if China's leaders proceed along
the lines that America's political leaders predict'. So it turns out
that he doubts neither the desirability nor the possibility of the China
opportunity project per se. His main misgiving, rather, is that Western
engagers, taking that outcome for granted, are too naïve or too
complacent to contemplate alternative policies to see it through. 106 In
this context, [through its 'China fantasy' offshoot, the 'China
opportunity' paradigm is]{.underline} partly [responsible for the
**hardline turn** in Western approach to China]{.underline}. [Herein
lies the danger of this China paradigm and its strategy of
**'constructive engagement'**]{.underline}. [Engagement]{.underline}, as
Jean A. Garrison points out, '[rests on the **dangerous hope** for
regime change in China]{.underline}.... [This "hope" raises
expectations]{.underline} among certain constituencies [that make
presidents susceptible to political backlash when progress is not
forthcoming']{.underline}.107 What we are witnessing today is in large
degree a product of [such political backlash]{.underline}, which, if
unchecked, [could launch US-China relations on a **dangerous path of
spiralling confrontation**]{.underline}. In fact, [such a path has been
well-trodden in history]{.underline}. A cursory look at [past
Sino-Western interactions reveals that their clashes were not just due
to their conflicting interests or diverging values per se, but also due
to the recurring **volatile dynamics** of mutual hope and subsequent
mutual **disillusionment**]{.underline}. Though no bilateral
relationship can be free from the fluctuation of hope and
disenchantment, in their dealing with China, [the West in general and
the US in particular have been especially prone to the pendulum cycle of
**paternalistic hope** and **'rightful' disillusionment**]{.underline},
[with the end of each such cycle frequently marked by prolonged
estrangement and open hostility]{.underline}.108 In September 1792, when
Lord Macartney set out on his historic voyage to China, the United
Kingdom, a rapidly industrialising nation filled with selfconfidence and
hope, painted the Middle Kingdom as an unlimited market open to British
commerce. But as Macartney was about to return from his
controversy-ridden China mission, that expectation was met with bitter
disappointment. Many members of his embassy, lamenting their fractured
illusions, argued that this failure warranted 'more direct methods' to
prize open the China market. Macartney himself seemed cautious on the
use of offensive measures against China so long as 'a ray of hope
remains for succeeding by gentle ones'. Nevertheless, his thwarted
mission heralded a long-lasting change in Europe's attitudes towards
China from admiration to disillusionment and disdain. 109 In a way, the
frustration with Chinese 'obstructiveness' to the British and European
desire to conduct unrestricted trade subsequently foreshadowed nearly a
century of European gunboat diplomacy in the 'Far East'. [The
transformation of America's so-called 'special relationship' with China
into the Cold War animosity also ran parallel with a metamorphosis from
hope to disillusionment in the US]{.underline}. 110 As Michael Hunt
observes, [America's initial **paternalistic vision** of 'a **China
transformed under American guidance**', at first fuelling 'a patiently
paternal approach' to China, was bound to 'evolve into a policy of
**coercion** once hope in the Chinese government was gone']{.underline}.
111 [Such hope]{.underline}, shattered by the Communist victory in
China's civil war, [was replaced with strong indignation with the
'ungrateful' Chinese]{.underline} 'who had bitten the hands that had fed
and nurtured them, repaying a century of American benevolence with
hatred and enmity, causing deep parental sorrow, arousing righteous
anger and meriting just punishment'.112 While the origins of their Cold
War rivalry are no doubt complex and multifaceted, Hunt is nevertheless
right that ['Our own immoderate expectations of China's fitting the
American mold and our surprise and overreaction to China going her own
way' played a major part in 'the general instability that has
characterized our bilateral relations']{.underline}. 113 Perhaps it was
for this reason that during the 1950s and 1960s the US seemed more
resentful and fearful of China than of the Soviet Union, hence the
adoption of a tougher policy of containment and isolation against
Beijing. 114 The Soviet Union had never invoked the same level of hope
and fantasy for the US as had China. History never exactly repeats
itself, but [the fact that China is now once again on the cusp of
changing from the object of hope to that of disillusionment for the West
does not bode well for Sino-Western relations.]{.underline} Unrealistic
as it may sound, [the]{.underline} **[fantasmatic imagination of
China]{.underline}** as an opportunity for Western commercial expansion
and/or democratic enlargement per se is not problematic. Social and
political life cannot function without hope or even fantasy. What is
problematic, though, is that [once reified into an unreflective
paradigm]{.underline}, such China opportunity fantasies [are unable or
unwilling to recognise themselves as such]{.underline}. At one level,
given such false promises, [the 'China opportunity' paradigm is too good
to be true. But at another level, taking up the mantle of a regime of
truth, it is considered too true to be subject to critical
self-scrutiny]{.underline} even when it is not borne out in practice.
[To ease this]{.underline} inherent [tension, the 'China opportunity'
paradigm chooses to blame others, especially its very
object]{.underline}, for its lost opportunity and delayed or 'stolen'
pleasure of self-fulfilment. Through such blame shifting, [the 'China
opportunity' paradigm has **significant**]{.underline}, if only
unintended, **[policy consequences]{.underline}**, [as]{.underline} the
recent [deterioration in Sino-Western relations can attest]{.underline}.
To be sure, the hardening of Western strategy towards China cannot be
blamed on the volatility of the 'China opportunity' paradigm alone. It
seems also to have coincided with a period of dented self-confidence in
the U.S. and Europe in the wake of the global financial crisis and the
eurozone debt crisis, with this firmness in dealing with China designed
partly to dispel the perceived weakness and decline in the West.
Moreover, in the chorus of getting tough on China, hardline realists
have never left the centre-stage. Their unaccommodating approach to
China has less to do with disillusionment and more with their
longstanding fear of China's emergence as a geopolitical rival,
regardless of its democratisation or not. However, [attributing the
hardline approach to the role of hardliners is not only
**tautological**, but it does not adequately explain the sudden surge of
aggressive posture from the West.]{.underline} It is in this sense that
[we need to understand the 'China opportunity' paradigm, **not as an
innocent**, optimistic **framework** of analysis, but in terms of
**volatile international practice**]{.underline}. Despite or [because of
its normative project of engagement]{.underline} with China, [this
paradigm has been part of the problem]{.underline}, rather than its
solution.

First, [the **threat paradigm** helps]{.underline} define (or at least
**[renew]{.underline}**) [the purpose of **containment as a
policy**]{.underline}. Bernard Schaffer tells us that [policy has
**three dimensions of meaning**: **purposes**; the review of information
and the **determination of appropriate action**; and the securing and
**commitment of resources** in its implementation]{.underline}.12
[Thanks to a China threat 'out there', a new purpose can be injected
into US foreign policy]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} **[provides a
rationale]{.underline}** [for a policy that would otherwise struggle to
justify its contemporary relevance]{.underline}. This constitutive
effect on US China policy can be [likened to the way in which the
**discourse of terrorism** justified and **legitimised the US-led 'War
on Terror'**]{.underline}. For a start, [the terrorist threat
immediately gave George W. Bush a hitherto elusive sense of certainty
about his mission and policy direction.]{.underline} As reported in the
New York Times, [not until the 'September 11' tragedy did the President
begin to feel 'sure about what he should be doing']{.underline}. We are
familiar with the second and third dimensions of policy, but [no policy
can exist without the first]{.underline}, namely, a [certain
purpose]{.underline} (or purposes). In fact, functioning like a fulcrum,
[the articulation of a relevant purpose is often the very
first]{.underline}---sometimes also the most difficult---[step in a
policy-making process]{.underline}. For instance, [as far as US
strategic planners are concerned, the main challenge lies not in
implementing a policy of military build-up, but in **justifying** or
identifying a legitimate public purpose for that policy]{.underline}.
Likewise, for weapons manufacturers, promoting arms sales is not an
overly complicated task; but in order to translate it into official
policy, they require a rationale, or more specifically, a legitimate
target against which their arms should be deployed. In both cases,
[**identifying a** purpose or target **is crucial to
policy-making**]{.underline}. 13 Second, **[the threat paradigm
contributes to policy-making]{.underline}** by spelling out some
specific policy options. From the beginning, [the representation of
China as a danger is not merely an intellectual question about 'what is
China?'; it is always concerned with the practical question of 'what to
do about it?']{.underline} For example, in their book The Coming
Conflict with China, Bernstein and Munro devote a whole chapter to the
issue of how to manage China's rise. Among their policy recommendations
are maintaining a strong US military presence in Asia, strengthening
Japan, continuing arms sales to Taiwan, and restricting China's nuclear
weapons arsenal. While the rise of terrorism has enabled the US to
preoccupy itself with the 'War on Terror' for more than a decade, at
least for a particular section of the US foreign policy establishment, a
more lasting purpose for US foreign and security policy requires the
China threat. 14 Similarly, in the last pages of The Tragedy of Great
Power Politics, Mearsheimer believes that an appropriate China policy is
not what he calls the 'misguided' engagement strategy, but containment
to 'slow the rise of China'. 15 Charles Krauthammer, a prominent
neoconservative proponent of the China threat argument, not only
advocated explicitly for containing China in his 1996 Time magazine
article, but also detailed how this can best be done. Taking 'a rising
and threatening China' as a pregiven fact, he insisted that 'any
rational policy' towards the country should be predicated on various
containment strategies such as strengthening regional alliances (with
Japan, Vietnam, India, and Russia) to box in China, standing by Chinese
dissidents, denying Beijing the right to host the Olympics, and keeping
China from joining the WTO on its own terms. Speaking with a sense of
urgency, he urged that this containment policy 'begin early in its
career'.16 Feeling the same sense of urgency, Peter Navarro, in his book
The Coming China Wars, warns consumers, corporate executives, and
policy-makers of gathering storm clouds on the horizon. He then offers a
range of policy prescriptions on 'How to fight---and win!---the coming
China wars' (the title of his book's final chapter).17 These require,
for example, that the US 'adopt a "zero-tolerance" policy toward
intellectual property theft', 'condemn China's actions in the strongest
of terms, and if China's abuses of power continue, seek to strip China
of its permanent veto' in the United Nations. What those policy
prescriptions have in common, he adds, is that 'they require the
economic and political will to stand up to China, along with the
military might to back up the prescriptions'.18 [If the military and
economic threat of China entails military and economic containment, the
**image of China** as a brutal, authoritarian state helps **lay the
foundation for** moral and **ideological sanction**]{.underline}.
Advising on how to deal with 'hostile regimes' in general, Kagan and
Kristol offer a rich recipe of regime change: Tactics for pursuing a
strategy of regime change would vary according to circumstances. In some
cases, the best policy might be support for rebel groups, along the
lines of the Reagan Doctrine as it was applied in Nicaragua and
elsewhere. In other cases, it might mean support for dissidents by
either overt and covert means, and/or economic sanctions and diplomatic
isolation.... But the purpose of American foreign policy ought to be
clear. When it comes to dealing with tyrannical regimes, especially
those with the power to do us or our allies harm, the United States
should seek not coexistence but transformation.19 Counting China as one
of those 'tyrannical regimes', they urge that the US and the West make
it harder for the Chinese regime to resolve its contradictions, thereby
hastening its collapse.20 Of course, [policy prescriptions from the
China threat literature are not necessarily actual official policies,
but through the influence of]{.underline} mainstream media and [policy
consultancy, **the line between them is often easily
crossed**.]{.underline}

Knowledge, Desire and Power in Global Politics: Western Representations

THE POWER/KNOWLEDGE NEXUS IN THE AMERICAN CHINA-THREAT KNOWLEDGE
COMMUNITY

[The]{.underline} [**political economy of** the China **fear** no doubt
has something to do with]{.underline} the Cold War mentality, [political
self-interests]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} even [greed on the part
of politicians and defence contractors]{.underline}. However, those
factors alone cannot legitimately sustain military Keynesianism unless
the fear is sanctioned by 'objective' knowledge. In other words, the
political economy manifested in the 'China syndrome' cannot be the sole
work of the military-industrial complex. Rather, [demonstrating a
classic case of the]{.underline} **[desire/power/knowledge
nexus]{.underline}**, [it relies on the valuable service provided by the
China-threat knowledge community]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
**[epistemic community allows Sinophobia an aura of objective
truth]{.underline}**, [credibility and urgency]{.underline}, through
which public support can be easily galvanised for the power elite and
their various political economic agendas [under the unquestioned guise
of defending national security against an **existential
threat**]{.underline}. If Congressmen, the military services, and
defence contractors so far have had much luck in securing the massive
military budgets they have wanted, they should thank not China, but this
knowledge community for its contribution of [the weapon of
'truth']{.underline}. As Andrew Bacevich notes, intellectuals,
[through]{.underline} their [imagination of self and Other]{.underline},
have [played a key role in the continuation of military
Keynesianism]{.underline}. He rightly points out that 'Militarism
qualifies as our very own work, a by-product of our insistence on seeing
ourselves as a people set apart, unconstrained by limits or by history'.
51 Thus, [the 'China threat' paradigm as a particular scheme of
self/Other construction is central to US military
Keynesianism]{.underline}. From the beginning, [the military-industrial
complex has been a **military-industrial-academic complex**, of which
the knowledge-producing community of the 'China threat' paradigm is a
fully-paid-up member]{.underline}. Figuring prominently in this
China-threat knowledge community are think tank fellows, opinion
leaders, as well as university academics. [By way of]{.underline}
workshops, [reports]{.underline}, [media]{.underline} commentaries,
opinion pieces, congressional testimonies, [books, and journal articles,
they contribute to the constant production of the danger code on China
and a prevailing structure of feeling within which the political economy
of fear in the US and the West more generally can operate without a
hitch]{.underline}. Some [members of the China-threat knowledge
community maintain the **umbilical cord** between **knowledge** and
**power** by speaking directly to power and for power]{.underline}. They
may be called 'embedded experts',52 who hold public office in the
national security apparatus. For example, after George W. Bush's
election victory in 2000, Bush acknowledged that his administration
'borrowed' twenty of the best people from the American Enterprise
Institute (AEI) for state service in America's hour of need.53 In all,
the neoconservative Center for Security Policy (CSP) supplied twenty-two
former advisers or board members to the same administration.54 Other
'embedded experts' come from leading universities. Aaron L. Friedberg,
well-known for his view of the China threat, is a professor of politics
and international affairs from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson
School (WWS) whose graduate programmes proudly boast the rather accurate
and fitting ambition of 'preparing future public service leaders'. In
his other life, Friedberg served as Dick Cheney's National Security
Advisor on China Affairs from 2003 to 2005 and was appointed to the
Department of Defense's (DoD) Defense Policy Board in 2007. Another good
example is Paul Wolfowitz, an architect of the US policy on China as a
'strategic competitor'. Before becoming Deputy Secretary of Defense from
2001--2005, Wolfowitz was the dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University, a
School originally founded by Paul Nitze, a senior government official
who was instrumental in shaping US defence policy on the basis of the
Soviet threat during the Cold War. It is unnecessary to add that the AEI
and the CSP are both home to some of the most outspoken commentators in
the China-threat knowledge community. During the George W. Bush
presidency, the China-threat knowledge community led by some prominent
neocons became immensely influential. But the knowledge/power nexus is
by no means unique to the Bush administration. As exemplified by the
so-called 'Blue Team', the China-threat knowledge community was
politically active throughout the Clinton years in the 1990s. Named
after the side that represents the US in the Pentagon's war games (the
unnamed foe is called the 'Red Team'), the Blue Team was a loose
community of members of Congress, top congressional staff, Republican
political operatives, former intelligence officers, journalists,
think-tank analysts, historians and scholars, some of whom were 'tenured
professors at the country's most prestigious universities'. 55 Through
this informal yet powerful network, 'China threat' experts from top
universities and leading think tanks were able to collectively exert
steady influence on America's national security establishment.
[Manifested in the service of power by the priesthood of China-threat
experts, the power/knowledge nexus is not a one-way street]{.underline}.
In essence, [it is a]{.underline} **[symbiotic
relationship]{.underline}**, [for the production of such knowledge
cannot be detached from the power arrangement it serves.]{.underline}
Therefore, any understanding of this connection would be incomplete
without looking at how [this particular China knowledge is **defined,
promoted, and regulated by power**]{.underline}. Though specific
knowledge about the China threat may be the work of university academics
and think tank analysts, [its conceptual and financial ancestry can
often be traced back to the **military-industrial complex** and the
national security state, which, whether explicitly or implicitly, help
**delineate** the intertextual, paradigmatic boundaries of what kind of
questions can be asked, what topics are off limit, and even what counts
as legitimate knowledge]{.underline}. Just as area studies in the US
were shaped by power, ideology and geopolitics, so too is this powerful
China paradigm in contemporary China watching. Indeed, the discursive
production of the China threat makes for a sizeable knowledge industry.
Some of the most prominent players in this industry include both
individual scholars and such media outlets as the Weekly Standard,
Commentary, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Times, and Encounter
Books, a San Francisco-based publishing house. A self-promotion material
produced by the Weekly Standard offers a rare insight into part of the
operation of this industry. 'Thanks to a unique VIP distribution system,
a select list of the most powerful men and women in government,
politics, and the media receive the publication via hand-delivery on
Sunday morning---just in time for the nationally televised talk shows',
thus boasts the neoconservative flagship magazine. 56 Many hawkish and
neoconservative think tanks such as the Project for the New American
Century (PNAC) and the AEI are behind these media outlets and marketing
operations. Those [think tanks, pivotal in the production of the 'China
threat' knowledge, in turn are staffed by retired politicians, generals,
and intelligence officers from the political establishment through what
some have called the 'revolving door' phenomenon]{.underline}. That is,
[former government officials, military servicemen, and defence
industrialists (re)join the ranks of professors and research fellows at
universities and think tanks, thereby **bringing the influence of power
directly to the process of knowledge production**]{.underline}. A quick
glance at the signatures on the PNAC's 1997 founding statement reveals
'a rogue's gallery of intransigent hardliners' who are mainly
exgovernment and ex-Pentagon officials in the Reagan era. Dick Cheney,
Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, William Bennett, I. Lewis Libby and
Eliot Cohen are only some of the most recognisable luminaries. And there
is no prize for guessing what kind of knowledge those
officials-turned-nationalsecurity gurus would bring to the understanding
of China. The 2000 PNAC report, entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses:
Strategy, Forces, and Resources for a New Century, insists that China is
'the potential enemy'. The report's author, Thomas Donnelly, once worked
as a professional staff member at the US House of Representatives
Committee on National Security. Later, he became a Director at Lockheed
Martin before his move through the revolving door again to a post at the
AEI.57 The AEI, the CSP, and the Heritage Foundation, all key sources of
the China-threat knowledge in the forms of policy briefs, research
reports and opinion pieces, tell a similar story. One China specialist
at the AEI, Dan Blumenthal, was previously senior director for China,
Taiwan and Mongolia in the Secretary of Defense's Office of
International Security Affairs. Another AEI China expert, the late James
Lilley, was formerly a CIA station chief in Beijing, Director of the
American Institute in Taiwan, and Ambassador to China. Harvey Feldman,
Distinguished Fellow in China Policy at the Heritage Foundation, was
once Director of the Office of the Republic of China Affairs and one of
the architects of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. The ubiquitous China
commentator John J. Tkacik, Jr., also at the Heritage Foundation,
previously served with the US Foreign Service in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
mainland China. At the CSP, which is directed by former Pentagon
official Frank Gaffney, on its Board of Directors was once Charles M.
Kupperman, former vice president of Strategic Integration & Operations,
Missile Defense Systems, at Boeing. Its Advisory Council, meanwhile, is
regarded by some commentators as 'a virtual Star Wars hall of fame',
almost entirely made up of former Star Warriors from the Reagan
administration. 58 To highlight the symbiotic link between power and
knowledge in a significant section of China watching is not to suggest
that practitioners cannot make a worthy contribution to the scholarly
field of China studies, or that all research on the China threat is
necessarily tainted by the influence of the power apparatus. Harold
Isaacs, the author of the classic study Scratches on Our Minds, was
affiliated with the CIA-assisted Center for International Studies at
MIT, but his proximity to the government, as Ido Oren notes, did not
stop him producing a rigorous and high-quality study of American views
of China and India.59 In some cases, close encounters with power may
even make one a sharp critic of it, as in the case of Chalmers Johnson,
author of Blowback and The Sorrows of Empire, who once worked as a
consultant for the Office of National Estimates of the CIA.60 One aspect
of such entanglement concerns research grants and donations. According
to a 2002 report by the Association of American Universities (AAU), the
DoD is the third largest funder (after the National Institutes of Health
and the National Science Foundation) of university research, which
accounts for more than 60 per cent of defence basic research. 61
Similarly, [a significant share of the funding received by lobbying
think tanks comes from hardline foundations and defence
companies]{.underline}. In its 1998 annual report, where [the CSP
acknowledged the financial support it had received since its founding,
virtually every weapons-maker made it to the list, ranging from
**Lockheed Martin**]{.underline} (and before their merge, Lockheed and
Martin), [**Boeing** and TRW to **General Dynamics**, **Rockwell
International** and **Northrop Grumman**]{.underline} (and in its
pre-merge incarnations, Northrop and Grumman). As indicated in the
report's charts, [about one quarter of the Center's annual incomes
flowed from corporations, of which half came from defence
contractors]{.underline}.62 [The]{.underline}
**[military-industrial-academic nexus]{.underline}** [is evident also in
many universitybased research projects on China]{.underline}. For
example, after the end of the Cold War, [studies on the strategic
implications of China's rise have benefited from sizeable grants from
the largely conservative, anti-Communist foundations such as the Smith
Richardson, Bradley, Scaife, and Olin Foundations]{.underline}.63 The
John M. Olin Foundation, which funded the John M. Olin Institute for
Strategic Studies at Harvard University (Samuel Huntington was its
Founding Director), was set up by a chemical and munitions manufacturer.
[Some more reputable social sciences foundations, which maintain a keen
interest in sponsoring China-related studies, have been revealed as once
cover organisations for the CIA]{.underline}. Their influence on the
direction of disciplines is as important as that of government funding
on research during the Cold War.64 The **[DoD's Minerva
Initiative]{.underline}** [provides another potential financial boon to
the China-threat knowledge community.]{.underline} This initiative is
modelled on the US National Defense Education Act introduced at the
early stage of the Cold War. Initially coming with a \$50 million
research fund up for grabs, it calls upon university academics to offer
their expertise on several Pentagon nominated security challenges such
as religious and cultural changes in the Islamic world and the
development of the Chinese military and technology.65 Co-administered by
the National Science Foundation, the project states that it seeks a
diverse range of views, but its aim is to 'foster a new generation of
engaged scholarship in the social sciences that seeks to meet the
challenges of the 21st century'.66 It is too soon to tell how this
Initiative, first launched in 2008, may come to shape the outcomes of
its funded studies on China. Thus far, there is only one China-related
project funded by this Initiative. However, if Project Camelot in the
1960s established by the US Army is anything to go by, it does not
inspire much confidence in either its neutrality or promised
intellectual diversity. 67 Consider, for example, the administrative
setup of the Minerva Initiative. [With the condition that Pentagon
officials sit on each peer-review panel, this almost certainly
guarantees that the funded proposals are as diverse as the worldview and
strategic agenda of the military-industrial complex would allow, even
though the Pentagon often keeps a low-profile in running those research
projects]{.underline}. Where foreign sources share similar political
interests in the politics of fear vis-à-vis China, [the production of
the China threat knowledge in the US often become a **transnational
joint venture**.]{.underline} As Lawrence Soley notes, [many China
research programmes in the US have received grants from Taiwanese
foundations and business leaders, 'many of whom are also political
leaders']{.underline}.68 During his time as a senior vice president at
the AEI, John Bolton was paid \$30 000 over three years in the mid-1990s
by Taiwan's government for research papers on Taiwan's UN membership
issues.69

The China Threat as a Construction of Otherness

With its contribution to the Western/American self-imagination, **[the
'China threat' paradigm is]{.underline}** also **[a construction of
Otherness]{.underline}**. This is not primarily because this paradigm
portrays China as a threat. Rather, it is because [in its quest for
certain knowledge about China, it has sought to **deny Chinese
subjectivities, to impose upon China a fixed subjectivity, or to reduce
its subjectivities to a singular, homogeneous whole**]{.underline}.
[These discursive tactics of denial, imposition and reduction vis-à-vis
Chinese subjectivities are some of the hallmarks of
Othering]{.underline}. These 'Othering' strategies are easily
identifiable in many common arguments of the 'China threat' paradigm.
[Capability-based arguments]{.underline}, for instance, [openly bypass
Chinese concerns and subjectivities by focusing squarely on its material
capabilities, as if China as an international actor could be reduced to
its defence spending and military hardware alone]{.underline}. From this
perspective, [China's]{.underline} power status becomes the sole
starting point for understanding its international relations. Its
power---especially [military power]{.underline}---[metonymically passes
as China per se]{.underline}. One of the most dominant components of the
China debate has been predictably the 'assessment of China's overall
future military power'. 52 The following questions, for example, '\[Is\]
China a rising power, and if so, how fast and in what direction \[is it
headed\]?' 53 have been a standard opening gambit in numerous IR
analyses on China. John Fairbank once told us that 'as we phrase
questions, so we get answers'. 54 **[Capability-based
representations]{.underline}** of China are not completely oblivious to
intentions, but they [insist that intentions are merely epiphenomenal to
capabilities]{.underline}. As Bernstein and Munro claim, 'China is so
big and so naturally powerful that \[we know\] it will tend to dominate
its region even if it does not intend to do so as a matter of national
policy'. [If one takes China's military capabilities as a point of
departure, it is no surprise that the built-in answer is the China
threat]{.underline}. 55 Drawing on their assessment of China's military
power, they confidently declare what China's 'real' goal is: 'China is
an unsatisfied and ambitious power whose goal is to dominate Asia....
Its goal is to ensure that no country in its region... will act without
first taking China's interests into prime consideration'.56 [When it
comes to China's professed goals and objectives, they dismiss them as
propaganda out of hand]{.underline}. As the argument goes, 'China's
peace offensive was a tactical move', which does not change the
fundamental nature of its hegemonic ambition.57 Unlike capability-based
discourses, intention-based approaches to China's rise look at its
civilisational characteristics and strategic culture, among other
things. Huntington's The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of
World Order and Johnston's Cultural Realism, both examined briefly in
the previous chapter, readily come to mind as representatives of the
latter approaches. Departing from structural realists' almost exclusive
focus on military capabilities, Huntington's book engages with the
history, ideas, values, and customs of the Sinic civilisation. Yet, the
conclusions of his culture-informed analysis turn out to be not much
different to those of the capability-based discourses. His book treats
civilisations as essentially distinctive, self-contained entities, and
sees cultural differences between the West and China in essentialist,
absolute and mutually exclusive terms. Based on Edward Friedman's claim
that ['what is authentically Chinese' is 'patriarchal, nativistic, and
authoritarian']{.underline}, Huntington painted a stark contrast with
[what is 'authentically' Western, a unique combination of 'universal'
values such as the **rule of law**, **social pluralism**, and
**individualism**]{.underline}.58 In this way, [cultural differences
between China and the US become a **fixed dichotomy** of particularity
versus universality]{.underline}. To the extent that he believed that
'Civilizations are the biggest "we" within which we feel culturally at
home as distinguished from all the other "thems" out there', to invoke
this kind of cultural identity, as he himself acknowledged, is to define
'the state's place in world politics, its friends, its enemies'. 59 In
Cultural Realism, Johnston similarly promises to move beyond the
structuralist, capability-based explanation of China's strategic
behaviour. With a close reading of 'the classic texts in Chinese
strategic thought' and asking how its strategic culture may provide an
insight into Chinese foreign policy, Thus, by drawing a cultural 'fault
line' between self and Other, Huntington's grand theory is nothing short
of a more totalising construction of Otherness than the conventional
state-centric argument is usually capable of. In his 'clash of
civilizations' thesis, the threatening quality of the Sinic civilisation
is not only imposed on China proper, but also on the so-called 'Sinic
cultural area' of East Asia as a whole (though with the convenient
exclusion of Japan). 60 his efforts are in many ways commendable, for
rarely have Western scholars bothered to go to such great lengths to
gauge China's intentions. What is problematic with his analysis, though,
is that he is convinced in advance that there is a single Chinese
strategic culture.61 Even as his survey does come across two major
strategic cultures, namely, the ConfucianMencian paradigm and the
parabellum paradigm, Johnston views the former as essentially an ideal
type of strategic culture with a largely symbolic role in influencing
strategic options.62 Thus, despite Johnston's worthy attempt to
understand China on its own cultural terms, the quest for certainty
rooted in the Western self-imagination remains at play. Such a quest,
among other things, dictates that his notion of strategic culture be
'empirically testable'. To that end, Johnston insists on positively
specifying 'what the scope and content of strategic culture is and what
it is not'. Consequently, he suggests that there remains essentially one
singular Chinese strategic culture, the parabellum paradigm, which then
becomes the strategic culture in China. 63 Hence, he ends up with a
conception of strategic culture defined by 'questions about the role of
war in human affairs, the nature of conflict with the enemy, and the
efficacy of violence in dealing with the adversary'. 64 Certainly, these
questions are both relevant and important to any study of strategic
culture. But they beg another question: Why should strategic culture be
reduced to those questions alone? [By directing one's attention to
questions about war, conflict, and violence while brushing aside other
kinds of questions]{.underline} ([e.g.,]{.underline} about [peace,
reconciliation, and benevolence]{.underline}) [that are equally relevant
and integral to strategic culture, one is not simply engaging in an
objective study of strategic culture, but rather participating in a
**selective and reductionist discursive practice**]{.underline}. In
limiting his study to a narrow set of questions about war, conflict, and
violence, Johnston both reduces Chinese strategic culture to the use of
strategic force, and declares the 'irrelevance (to behavior)' of the
Confucian-Mencian stress on benevolence, righteousness, and virtue as a
basis for security and harmony.65 Indeed, he goes to some considerable
lengths to count China's use of force against Mongols raiding within
Ming territory as evidence of Chinese realpolitik aggressiveness.66 As a
result, for all his repeated qualification that strategic culture is
historically contingent and may be (un)learned, Johnston's
interpretation of the historical records in the Ming dynasty does not
leave much room for contingency. The reader is left with the impression
that realpolitik thinking is intrinsic to Chinese strategic culture,
which is precisely an impression China specialist Warren Cohen walks
away with: If Johnston's analysis of China's strategic culture is
correct---and I believe it is--- generational change will not guarantee
a kinder, gentler China. Nor will the ultimate disappearance of
communism in Beijing. The powerful China we have every reason to expect
in the twenty-first century is likely to be as aggressive and
expansionist as China has been whenever it has been the dominant power
in Asia.67 Aided in part by Johnston's findings, Cohen was able to spend
just 'a few minutes' lecturing a visitor from Singapore (who did not
view Chinese foreign policy as so 'aggressive and expansionist') on the
subject of 'the history of the Chinese empire' and 'thousands of years
of attacks on China's neighbors'. To wrap up his lecture, he prescribed
that visitor a reading: Johnston's Cultural Realism. 68 Another, perhaps
cruder, tactic of Othering in the 'China threat' paradigm involves
neither an analysis of China's military capabilities nor its intentions.
Rather, [it follows a deductive logic based more explicitly on an
either/or dichotomy in the Western/American quest for absolute certainty
and security: either China guarantees absolute peace for the United
States, or it cannot but be treated as a threat]{.underline}. The
reasoning of Betts and Christensen's abovementioned article serves as a
good example here: If the PLA remains second-rate, should the world
breathe a sigh of relief? Not entirely.... Drawing China into the web of
global interdependence may do more to encourage peace than war, but it
cannot guarantee that the pursuit of heartfelt political interests will
be blocked by a fear of economic consequences.... \[And\] U.S. efforts
to create a stable balance across the Taiwan Strait might deter the use
of force under certain circumstances, but certainly not all. 69 Of
course, they could not get, nor do they expect, affirmative answers from
China to any of those relentless quests for absolute certainty.
Consequently, their conclusion has to be certainty in a negative
form---the China threat: The truth is that China can pose a grave
problem even if it does not become a military power on the American
model, does not intend to commit aggression, integrates into a global
economy, and liberalizes politically. Similarly, the United States could
face a dangerous conflict over Taiwan even if it turns out that Beijing
lacks the capacity to conquer the island.... This is true because of
geography; because of America's reliance on alliances to project power;
and because of China's capacity to harm U.S. forces, U.S. regional
allies, and the American homeland, even while losing a war in the
technical, military sense.70 At this point, **[neither China's
capabilities nor intentions seem to really matter;]{.underline}** [the
China threat has already been predetermined by the **either/or
logic**]{.underline}. Because of this, some ['China threat' theorists
see no irony or paradox in justifying the policy of containing China not
in spite of, but on the very basis of China's current
weakness]{.underline}. For instance, Mearsheimer wrote in 2001 that
'China is still far away from having enough latent power to make a run
at regional hegemony, so it is not too late for the United States to
reverse the course and do what it can to slow China's rise'. 71 In
brief, [by]{.underline} [**representing China as a monolith**ic
whole]{.underline}, **[dismissing its subjectivities]{.underline}**,
[and/or imposing onto it a singular, fixed subjectivity of power
politics, the 'China threat' paradigm acts as a **discursive
construction of an objectified Other**]{.underline}. [Cast as an Other
and threatening object, China by definition lacks the kind of
rationality and subjectivity that are characteristic of the Western
knowing subject]{.underline}. Nor is it eligible to have its own
security concern, which may explain why there exists a 'severe
disproportion between the keen attention to China as a security concern
and the intractable neglect of China's \[own\] security concerns in the
current debate'. Here, [it is evident that the China threat is an
**Othering effect of Western/American colonial desire** from which China
cannot escape no matter what its capabilities or intentions might
be]{.underline}. This China insight may have the much-prized virtue of
analytical parsimony, but it does not occur to those theorists that such
logic could be used to describe any country, including the US. 72 Even
when it is allowed for some security interests, it is alleged that it
often has no idea what those interests are. 73 Lucian Pye once argued
that China is such an erratic state that it acts 'in ways that seem
perversely self-damaging in the eyes of those who believe they have that
country's interests at heart'.74 Perhaps it is at this level that the
Othering effect of the 'China threat' paradigm is most devastating.

THE 'CHINA THREAT' PARADIGM AS A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

If changing Chinese public opinion and [Beijing's growing
assertiveness]{.underline} in foreign policy are better understood in
the context of mutual responsiveness, then threatening as they may
appear, they at least partly [reflect the **self-fulfilling effect** of
the China threat theory as practice]{.underline}. That is, they are to
some extent [**socially constructed by Western representations** of the
China threat]{.underline}. At this juncture, we may return to the
question raised earlier---What's the cost of having an enemy? The cost,
simply put, is that [perceiving China as a threat and acting upon that
**perception help bring that feared China threat closer to
reality**]{.underline}. [Though not an objective description of China,
the 'China threat' paradigm]{.underline} is no mere fantasy, as it [has
the **constitutive power** to make its prediction come
true]{.underline}. [If this China paradigm ends up bearing some
resemblance to Chinese reality, it is because the reality is
itself]{.underline} partly [constituted by it]{.underline}. With US
strategic planners continuing to operate on the basis of the China
threat, this self-fulfilling process has persisted to the present day.
For example, in [July **2010**]{.underline}, [when China objected to the
joint US-South Korean navy exercise in the Yellow Sea to no avail, it
announced that its navy would conduct live fire drills in the East China
Sea for the duration of the US-South Korean manoeuvres]{.underline}. 129
Meanwhile, a [Global Times]{.underline} (a [Chinese daily]{.underline}
tabloid affiliated with the official People's Daily) [editorial opines
that 'Whatever harm the US military manoeuvre may have inflicted upon
the mind of the Chinese, the United States will have to pay for it,
sooner or later']{.underline}.130 All such Chinese 'belligerence' seems
to have provided fresh evidence to the 'China threat' paradigm, whose
image of China has now been vindicated.131 [Without acknowledging their
own **role in the production** of the 'China threat', 'China threat'
analysts thus play a key part in a **spiral model of tit-for-tat in
Sino-US relations**]{.underline}. Mindful of this danger, some
cool-headed observers have warned that [a US attempt to build a missile
defence shield could be reciprocated by China deploying more
missiles.]{.underline}132 Even the highly classified US National
Intelligence Estimate (NIE) report Foreign Responses to U.S. National
Missile Defense Deployment has hinted at this possibility. 133 In early
2006, Mike Moore, contributing editor of The [Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, predicted that if the US continues to **weaponise space** by
deploying a comprehensive space-control system, 'China will surely
respond']{.underline}.134 And respond it did. [In]{.underline} early
**[2007]{.underline}**, [it launched a ballistic missile to destroy an
inoperational weather satellite in orbit]{.underline}. That test
immediately caused a stir in the international press, even though it
came [after Washington's repeated refusal to negotiate with China and
Russia over their proposed ban on space weapons and the use of force
against satellites]{.underline}. A Financial Times article noted that
'What is surprising about the Chinese test is that anyone was
surprised'.135 In a similar vein but commenting on the broader pattern
of US strategy on China over the years, Lampton notes that '[Washington
cannot]{.underline} simply seek to strengthen ties with India, Japan,
the Republic of Korea, and central Asian states as an explicit offset to
rising Chinese power and then [be surprised when Beijing plays the same
game]{.underline}'.136 Nevertheless, such [surprise]{.underline} is
commonplace in the China watching community, [reflect]{.underline}ing
[an]{.underline} **[intellectual blindness]{.underline}** [to the
self-fulfilling nature of]{.underline} one of [its]{.underline}
time-honoured [paradigms]{.underline}. [This blindness, in turn, allows
the justification of more containment or hedging]{.underline}. In this
way, [the 'China threat' paradigm is not only self-fulfilling in
practice, but also self-productive and **self-perpetuating as a powerful
mode of representation**]{.underline}. One might take comfort in the
fact that neither Beijing nor Washington actually wants a direct
military confrontation. But that is beside the point, for the lack of
aggressive intention alone is no proven safe barrier to war. As in the
cases of the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the outbreak of war does
not necessarily require the intention to go to war.137 [Mutual
suspicion]{.underline}, as US President Theodore Roosevelt once observed
of the Kaiser and the English, [is often all that is needed to set in
motion a downward spiral]{.underline}. 138 And thanks to the 'China
threat' paradigm and its mirror image and practice from China, mutual
suspicion and distrust has not been in short supply. 139 [A war between
these two great powers is **not inevitable**]{.underline} or even
probable; the door for mutual engagement and cooperation remains wide
open. Nevertheless, [blind to its own self-fulfilling consequences, the
'China threat' paradigm, if left unexamined and unchecked, would make
**cooperation more difficult** and **conflict more
likely**]{.underline}. It is worth adding that my treatment of Chinese
nationalism and realpolitik thinking is not to downplay their
potentially dangerous consequences, much less to justify them. Quite the
contrary, for all the apparent legitimacy of reciprocal counter-violence
or counter-hedging, [Chinese mimicry]{.underline} is dangerous, as it
[would feed into this tit-for-tat vicious cycle and play its part in the
escalation of a security dilemma between the US and China]{.underline}.
Thus, [to emphasise Chinese responsiveness is not to deny Chinese agency
or exonerate its responsibility]{.underline}. While the general nature
of Chinese foreign policy may be responsive with regard to the US, its
'contents' are not simply passive, innocent mimicry of US thinking and
behaviour, but inevitably come with some 'Chinese characteristics'. That
said, those 'Chinese characteristics' notwithstanding, [there is no
pregiven China threat both unresponsive to and immune from any external
stimulus. To argue otherwise is to deny an important dimension of
Chinese agency, namely, their response-ability]{.underline}. [By
examining the self-fulfilling tendency of the 'China threat' paradigm,
we can better understand that **Sino-American relations**]{.underline},
[like international relations in general]{.underline}, **[are mutually
responsive and constitutive]{.underline}**. Thus, [both China and the US
should be held accountable]{.underline} to the bilateral relationship of
their mutual making. To the extent that this '[China threat'
knowledge]{.underline} often **[denies such mutuality]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** by extension, **[US responsibility]{.underline}**
[in the rise of the China threat]{.underline}, [it is all the more
imperative to lay bare its intrinsic link with power
practice]{.underline}.

IN FEAR OF CHINA: THE 'CHINA THREAT' PARADIGM IN WESTERN/AMERICAN
COLONIAL DESIRE

The West has been imagining itself in various ways for centuries, if not
longer, a complex subject which no doubt warrants a separate study. 9
But here I argue that [the West as a modern project is modelled
ultimately on an image of the modern knowing subject, who is defined by
a desire for certainty and a will to truth]{.underline}. With this
fundamental self-understanding, [the West could not only feel certain
about itself, but also exercise its reason and authority over an
objective and knowable world 'out there']{.underline}. As Charles
William Maynes notes, [the US]{.underline}, since the times of Theodore
Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, [has been convinced 'that we know the
way---politically and economically---and that therefore we have an
obligation, if not also a right, to lead others to a better
future']{.underline}.10 In this sense, [the]{.underline} **[will to
truth]{.underline}** [and certainty has been central to the
West's]{.underline} **[search for identity and power]{.underline}**.
[The inevitable existence of uncertainty and inscrutability in nature
and the outside world then becomes a stan**ding threat to the identity
and security of this modern self**]{.underline}. At one level, the
knowing subject may find refuge in fear as an emotional substitute for
certainty. In other words, ['What we do not know we
fear']{.underline}.11 [Through fear, the unknown world becomes at least
a known unknown]{.underline} (to borrow former US Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld's parlance), [or a negative form of certainty in terms
of **Otherness, danger, and threat**]{.underline}. Thus understood,
**[threat is not an object out there, but a necessary corollary of the
Western desire for absolute certainty and security]{.underline}**. [Even
Kristol and Kagan readily admit that their much-feared 'present danger'
'has no name]{.underline}. It is not to be found in any single strategic
adversary.... **[It is a danger, to be sure, of our own
devising]{.underline}**'.12 The China Threat as a Reflection of the
Western Self-imagination [The self-imagination as the modern knowing
subject affords the West a sense of scientific and moral authority. At
the same time, it also justifies its need for **imperial expansion** and
strategic dominance]{.underline}. Both the European Union's (EU)
self-identity as a 'Normative Power Europe' and [the US's God-given
right to military supremacy and global leadership can be understood in
this context]{.underline}. Indeed, for neoconservatives, the US, a
quintessential Western society, is entitled to both moral clarity and
military hegemony. However, as soon as the US stakes its self-identity
on 'universal dominion' and absolute security worldwide, 13 **[The China
threat]{.underline}** [is a product of precisely such encounters and
selfimagination]{.underline}. [Taking]{.underline} global hegemony in
general and [dominance in Asia]{.underline} in particular [as part and
parcel of American self-identity]{.underline}, one would 'naturally'
treat China's regional influence as a threat; it can hardly be
otherwise. But this is a challenge above all to the latter's
expansionist strategic selfimagination and the certainty and continuity
it entails. [its '**encounters'** with numerous threats
**become**]{.underline}s **[a logical necessity]{.underline}**. 14 As
Huntington reasoned, 'Chinese hegemony will reduce American and Western
influence \[there\] and compel the United States to accept what it has
historically attempted to prevent: domination of a key region of the
world by another power'.15 [Thanks to this longstanding American
self-imagery, it is fair to say that much of **the China threat is
imagined**]{.underline} as well. [The much-feared Chinese 'string of
pearls' strategy is a case in point]{.underline}. Describing China's
alleged ambition of establishing a series of naval bases along various
[strategic choke points from Southeast Asia to eastern
Africa]{.underline}, the term [is nowhere to be seen in China's military
playbook]{.underline}. Rather, [it is]{.underline} mostly [the work
of]{.underline} **[US strategic imagination]{.underline}**, first used
in an internal report titled Energy Futures in Asia commissioned by the
US Department of Defense. 16 In Europe where collective self-identity is
constructed less on the basis of military strength, the China threat
does not figure as prominently as it does in the eyes of American
strategic planners. Indeed, in 2009, Kagan expressed his displeasure at
what he saw as Europe's indifference to the proliferation of military
threats. Though not explicitly acknowledging the central role of
selfidentity in the construction of threat, he nevertheless correctly
attributed their divergent threat perceptions to the different ways in
which the US and Europe identify themselves. As he wrote: If Europe's
strategic culture today places less value on hard power and military
strength and more value on such soft-power tools as economics and trade,
isn't it partly because Europe is militarily weak and economically
strong? Americans are quicker to acknowledge the existence of threats,
even to perceive them where others may not see any, because they can
conceive of doing something to meet those threats.17 No longer primarily
identifying itself in military terms, contemporary Europe now prides
itself on being a normative or civic power, home to such universal
values as human rights, democracy and good governance. As a result, it
sees the China difference both as an opportunity for political change
and an ideological challenge to the teleological certainty of the
European self. Of course, moral clarity is not unique to Europe, but is
integral to the US self-imagination as well. As such, in addition to the
fear of China's strategic ambition, Washington is similarly ambivalent
about the opportunity and threat of the Chinese Other. Through the same
prisms of democracy and modernisation, Americans constantly 'found China
lacking' or even threatening. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker rightly argues that
'Unless the United States changes \[the moral parameters of its
political self-imagination\], that conclusion will not change'. 18 In
other words, its fear of China has less to do with China's difference
per se than with the particular way in which the Western self is
constructed. [If there is a China threat, its menace lies primarily in
its perceived **psychological 'disruption' of the lingering
Western/American colonial desire** about how the world should be run and
about how history should progress.]{.underline} 19 No doubt, [some would
protest that the 'China threat' conclusion stands on the firm ground of
realism, and has nothing to do with the way the West identifies
itsel]{.underline}f. For example, [according to Mearsheimer, in a world
of anarchy, 'states can never be certain about the intentions of other
states']{.underline}, 20 and therefore have to treat each other as a
potential threat. **[Yet]{.underline}**, I would argue that [such an
insatiable demand for transparency from others is itself a telltale sign
of the **Western quest for** certainty, **security**, and identity as
the modern knowing subject]{.underline}. Similarly, [the realist
first-image of human nature, which is often implicitly invoked in the
explanation of the China threat, has less to do with human nature per se
than with the Western quest for scientific truth about human
society]{.underline}. The Hobbesian 'discovery' of the first man and
human nature, as C. B. Macpherson argues, was not the objective
knowledge of man per se, but rather a conscious or unconscious
autobiographical reflection of Western modern man and his living
condition in a 'bourgeois market society'.21 Insofar as the 'China
threat' paradigm has been informed partly by the Hobbesian fear of every
man against every man, [this China threat representation is best seen as
a mirror image of some historically specific and selective
self-experience of the West]{.underline}. Two specific arguments in the
'China threat' discourse are illustrative of this point. The first is
the widely-invoked Germany analogy. Former US Deputy Secretary of
Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who was instrumental in the formation of
Washington's official view of China as a 'strategic competitor', 22 was
convinced by the 'obvious and disturbing analogy' between Wilhelmine
Germany and today's China. Though briefly acknowledging the differences
between the two powers, he insisted on their many 'similarities'. For
him, just as Germany's transition from the statesmanship of Bismarck to
the incompetence of his successors contributed to the tragedy of World
War I, so too China, which is in the process of a similar transition
'from two decades of extremely skilful management of its international
relationships to a new leadership of uncertain quality', poses a serious
threat to the international order.23 In an influential piece published
in The National Interest, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen similarly
argue that Like Germany a century ago, China is a late-blooming great
power emerging into a world already ordered strategically by earlier
arrivals; a continental power surrounded by other powers who are
collectively stronger but individually weaker (with the exception of the
United States and, perhaps, Japan); a bustling country with great
expectations, dissatisfied with its place in the international pecking
order, if only with regard to international prestige and respect. The
quest for a rightful "place in the sun" will... inevitably foster
growing friction with Japan, Russia, India or the United States.24 What
this Germany analogy can tell us is that [the Western knowledge of the
China threat is based, more than anything else, on a fear of repetition
of a European nightmare scenario. Its fear of China, situated in the
broader sense of paranoia that Europe's past may become Asia's
future]{.underline},25 The America analogy tells a similar story. Kagan
argues that 'if Americans want to understand Chinese power and ambition
today, they could start by looking in the mirror'. This is [derived less
from China's rise or its uncertain intentions than from the
self-righteous certainty about the universality of Western historical
trajectory]{.underline}. 26 This is exactly what Mearsheimer has done.
After extrapolating American history in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries to a status of the unchangeable 'tragedy' of great power
politics in general, Mearsheimer insists that China will have to, almost
slavishly, follow the same path: for sound strategic reasons, \[China\]
would surely pursue regional hegemony, just as the United States did in
the Western Hemisphere during the nineteenth century. So we would expect
China to attempt to dominate Japan and Korea, as well as other regional
actors, by building military forces that are so powerful that those
other states would not dare challenge it. We would also expect China to
develop its own version of the Monroe Doctrine, directed at the United
States. Just as the United States made it clear to distant great powers
that they were not allowed to meddle in the Western Hemisphere, China
will make it clear that American interference in Asia is unacceptable.27
Clearly, Mearsheimer's 'China threat' assessment is based not so much on
what China does in the present as it is on what the US itself did in the
past.28 His repeated anxious 'expectations' of China testify to a
paranoia of both China's Otherness and its emerging sameness. His fear
reflects, in the final analysis, the lingering ambivalence of colonial
desire towards the mimicry of the American self-experience by an
Oriental Other. [The autobiographical nature of the 'China threat'
discourse is so obvious that many references to the 'China
menace']{.underline} (such as the 'Beijing Consensus' and 'Chinese
Lake') [are **directly modelled on the Western/American
self**]{.underline}. Little wonder that [Mel Gurtov]{.underline}, while
reading a 2005 US Defense Department report on China's military threat,
[found the report's comments on China ironically more fitting to
describe US power and intention than China's]{.underline}.29 The US is
certainly not unique in the projection of self-experience onto the
understanding of others. As scholars of literary criticism and
Australian colonial history have pointed out, Australia's fixation with
the fiction of an Asian invasion has been bound up with its
self-consciousness as a settler country, which itself was born of
invasion. Australia's anxiety about its northern neighbours, in which
China often looms large, has been sustained by the fear that a nation
created by European invasion could subsequently be taken over by an
Asian/Chinese invasion. 30 [Thus, the anxiety and fear of China felt by
the West does not stem primarily from what China is or what it does, but
from an **anxious Western self**, or more precisely, from its own
historical role in the production of anxiety and fear suffered by
others]{.underline}. Perhaps unwittingly, the 'China threat' paradigm
exhibits an unspoken fear of the logic of mutual responsiveness in
international relations: with China's rise, there is a danger that China
might begin to imitate what 'we' have done to others, this time at 'our'
expense.

[In]{.underline} a [piece **explicitly defending** bloated military

exactly the "Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments" is. We can
start by reading this section taken directly from their website

[Brands]{.underline} is a [senior fellow at an organization

in]{.underline} the [upcoming **\$750 billion defense budget** Brands is
pushing for]{.underline}. While we don't have a tax filings for CSBA
since Brand was hired there, and thus we do not know his specific
income, the average senior fellow at the organization, as of its last
tax filing, makes just under \$300,000 a year.

They can [call it whatever they wish]{.underline} --- "[think
tank]{.underline}," "[nonprofit]{.underline}," "[Center]{.underline}"
--- [but by **any objective metric**]{.underline}, [this organization is
just a **lobbying entity** for the weapons industry and Western
militaries]{.underline}. A cursory glance at their policy briefs reveals
they, unsurprisingly, always support more spending on weapons systems.
Unlike other weapons-funded lobbying groups such as Center for Strategic
and International Studies (FAIR.org, 8/12/16), they don't even bother
throwing some banks or soda companies in there to give the appearance of
being anything other than a weapons industry trade group. (Don't be
fooled by the "Sasakawa Peace Foundation" --- that's an [organization
founded by far-right]{.underline} Japanese [business
executive]{.underline} Ryoichi Sasakawa, who was [jailed as a **war
crimes suspect**]{.underline} after World War II, [and]{.underline} who
once [described himself as the]{.underline} "**[world's richest
fascist]{.underline}**"---Time, 8/26/74.)

This is true not just in the military field, but in every policy area
that affects corporations' bottom lines, as is suggested by the Times'
reporting on the even more ubiquitous [Brookings]{.underline}
[Institution]{.underline} **[promoting the JPMorgan bank's
image:]{.underline}**

[JPMorgan]{.underline}, [in a
document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2972643-Brookings-MetroDonors1203.html#document/p11/a307260) dated
a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to
Brookings "**[deepens/extends relationships]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} [important client base]{.underline} [among business
and civic leaders both in the US and abroad."]{.underline}

**[And Brookings was ready to do its part]{.underline}**.

"Our events, which in part target these audiences," [said a[n internal
2014 Brookings
memo]{.underline}](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2972643-Brookings-MetroDonors1203.html#document/p93/a307273),
referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders,
"[have yielded 100]{.underline}+ [media hits]{.underline}, with 97
percent of them referencing GCI and 90 percent referencing JPMorgan; by
the end of this year, [we will have held events in 13 domestic
markets]{.underline} and nine international markets."

At times, Brookings **[officials seemed worried they were not doing
enough for the bank.]{.underline}**

"No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but
**[we need to carve out roles]{.underline}** **[and thought leadership
opportunity for market presidents]{.underline}**," said a 2013 Brookings
memo, referring to a dinner with the bank's executives. "**[We need to
do a better job tying it back to JPMC."]{.underline}**

[These "media hits"]{.underline} [would not be possible if
the]{.underline} [corporate agenda wasn't]{.underline} **[laundered
through the pseudo-academic credibility of a think tank]{.underline}**,
[whether it's a giant bank trying to improved its image via Brookings or
an arms manufacturers trying to promote the war industry via

The establishing documents for the Brookings Doha Center may be
uncomfortable reading for advocates of academic freedom.

Inked in 2007, [the deal]{.underline} [between]{.underline} the [storied
Washington]{.underline} [think tank]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs]{.underline} [laid]{.underline}
[out the financial terms under]{.underline} [which
Brookings]{.underline} **[established a groundbreaking
outpost]{.underline}** in the Persian Gulf. [The]{.underline}
fantastically [rich]{.underline}, autocratic emirate would put up \$5
million, bankrolling the groundbreaking research facility --- but also
got a notable degree of contractual prerogatives for a government over a
proudly independent organization. [The center's]{.underline}
[director]{.underline}, the [heretofore unreported document
read](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22062334-20070101-brookings-doha-center-establishment-agreement-memorandum-of-association?responsive=1&title=1),
would "**[engage in regular consultation]{.underline}** with \[the
foreign ministry\]," submitting an annual budget and "agenda for
programs that will be developed by the Center." Any changes would
require the ministry's OK. (The document was obtained from Qatar by a
U.S. source; a Brookings spokesperson did not dispute its validity.)

[Brookings's]{.underline} [Doha presence was]{.underline} [mothballed
last year,]{.underline} but the [history of chumminess
between]{.underline} [a Washington]{.underline} [liberal bastion and a
Middle Eastern monarchy is]{.underline} [suddenly relevant]{.underline}
[again]{.underline} this week due to the abrupt resignation of
Brookings' president in a classic Beltway scandal involving allegations
of improper lobbying for that very same country.

Ironically, [the now-former president]{.underline}, retired Marine
General John Allen, had [worked during his four-year]{.underline}
[tenure]{.underline} [to unwind the relationship, under which
**Qatar**]{.underline} **[had become one of Brookings']{.underline}**
**[top donors,]{.underline}** **[netting]{.underline}** the
**[institution millions of dollars]{.underline}** --- and [no shortage
of flak from critics]{.underline} [of Qatar's human-rights
record]{.underline} and its friendships towards groups like the Muslim
Brotherhood. In 2019, Allen announced that Brookings would phase out
money from non-democracies. In 2021, the Doha facility was quietly
disaffiliated from Brookings.

And yet [it now turns out that Allen's entire]{.underline} [run atop
the]{.underline} [capital's leading liberal think tank]{.underline} [was
shadowed by a]{.underline} [trip]{.underline} he took to the emirate
just months before ascending to the presidency.

The alleged details of that journey, which leaked out via [a federal
search warrant
application](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22062338-allen-search-warrant?responsive=1&title=1) that
was inadvertently [made public last
week](https://apnews.com/article/politics-us-news-think-tanks-nato-ap-top-5c30827587d2295012549d5d65fc806e),
have cost [Allen his]{.underline} \$1[-million-a-year job]{.underline},
[upended Brooking]{.underline}s, [and infuriated scholars who worry that
they'll again face suggestions that their work has been tarnished by
unseemly foreign influence.]{.underline}

### Indict --- CATO Institute

#### CATO is [propaganda]{.underline} that [ignores facts]{.underline}.

**Robinson '18** --- Nathan; English-American journalist, political
commentator, and editor-in-chief of Current Affairs magazine. October
13, 2018; \"Never Trust The Cato Institute\"; *Current Affairs*;
https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/10/never-trust-the-cato-institute/;
//CYang

So, the [Cato Institute]{.underline}: **[Never trust
them]{.underline}**. Because [these]{.underline} sorts of
[people]{.underline} are just [not going to represent]{.underline} the
[issues fairly]{.underline}. They're [not]{.underline} going to
[report]{.underline} the [conclusions of experts accurately]{.underline}
(Cannon cites the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to
show that industry professionals agree with him, and ignores the many
medical practitioners who don't). They're going to [pick quotes from
studies that sound good]{.underline}, and unless you have academic
journal access and can check for yourself, you'll never know whether the
studies contained other important findings. In an academic setting, this
would border on malpractice. These people may have charts and statistics
and degrees, but they are just not scholars. They already
[think]{.underline} that [**laissez-faire capitalism** is
correct]{.underline}, and they think it because it's what their economic
theory tells them must be true, and so [any **empirical evidence** to
the contrary will be ignored]{.underline}. (Again, if you truly won't be
satisfied until I go through a dozen more of their publications and show
all the same tendencies, I can do it. But just try it for yourself.)

Honestly, I'm just exhausted by the existence of these people. It's so
hard to figure out the truth in a complicated world. I wish I didn't
have to deal with a [**whole army** of propagandists who couldn't care
less about]{.underline} neutral [scholarly inquiry]{.underline}. They
might be right, or they might be wrong, but I'm always going to have to
investigate for myself since their publications are useless. So I
generally don't bother responding to the Cato Institute because it's
always going to require such a battle: They will do everything in their
power, they will strain themselves to their limit, to prove that
regulation is bad and laissez-faire is good. (This is, by the way, why
Charles [Koch]{.underline} has [given them so much money]{.underline},
and the [Institute used to be called]{.underline} the **[Charles Koch
Foundation]{.underline}**.) [All]{.underline} these "[economic
liberty]{.underline}" [places are the same]{.underline}. The [Free
Enterprise]{.underline} institutes, and the [Economic
Education]{.underline} funds. [You could pile up **mountainous
evidence** of market failures or regulatory success]{.underline}, [and
they'd **die** before they **conceded** the point]{.underline}.

I know everybody on the left will greet my conclusion here with a yawn:
Breaking news --- the Cato Institute care about their free market
ideology more than they care about facts! But it's still so unbelievable
to me that this can be an influential think tank that anyone takes
seriously. It's worth remembering that [the actual
profession]{.underline} of economics is [far less rigidly committed to
laissez-faire]{.underline} than the "economistic" commentators who serve
as the field's public face. You can see the [difference by looking at
how Cato writes]{.underline} about these issues [versus]{.underline} the
[scholars Cato **actually cites**]{.underline}. The real [papers have
nuance]{.underline}. They are scholarship. **[This is bullshit, and can
never be trusted]{.underline}**.

Eric

A recent New York Times article
([8/7/16](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/us/politics/think-tanks-research-and-corporate-lobbying.html?_r=0))
detailed, in often scathing terms, what many media critics already knew:
that think tanks are frequently not objective, neutral arbiters of
information, but corporate- and government-funded agenda-promoters with
an academic veneer to give the appearance of impartiality.

One of the two think tanks the Times' Eric Lipton and Brooke Williams
raked over the coals was [the **Center for Strategic and International**
**Studies**]{.underline}, which [published]{.underline} [a report
**advocating**]{.underline} [the **expansion** of drone]{.underline}
[sales]{.underline} **[while being funded by drone]{.underline}**
**[makers]{.underline}**, namely General Atomics (emphasis added):

As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did
not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear.

"Political obstacles to export," read the [agenda of one
closed-door](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2963994-CSIS-General-Atomics.html#document/p17/a307156) "working
group" meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a
lobbyist in General Atomics' Washington office, on the invitation lists,
the emails show.

**[Boeing and Lockheed Martin]{.underline}**, [drone makers that **were
major CSIS contributors**]{.underline}, [were also invited to attend the
sessions]{.underline}, [the emails show]{.underline}. The meetings and
research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that
reflected the industry's priorities.

"I came out strongly in support of export," Mr. Brannen, the lead author
of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy
assistant secretary of State for defense trade controls.

But the effort did not stop there.

Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and
congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included
setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and
deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export
limits at a conference
it [hosted](http://csis.org/event/sustaining-us-lead) at its
headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and
the Marine Corps....

"[CSIS]{.underline} [will not represent any donor]{.underline} before
any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and
executive branch officials," Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his
statement to the Times. "[We do not lobby."]{.underline}

The result was a victory for General Atomics.

As the Times also notes, [**CSIS [is
funded](https://www.csis.org/support-csis/our-donors/corporation-and-trade-association-donors) largely**
by **Western** and **Gulf** **monarchy governments**]{.underline},
**[arms dealers and oil companies, such as Raytheon, Boeing, Shell, the
United Arab Emirates, US Department of Defense, UK Home Office, General
Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, Northrop Grumman, Chevron and
others.]{.underline}**

Anyone with a seven-year-old's understanding of causality can conclude
that [CSIS would, in]{.underline} [the aggregate]{.underline},
**[promote the expansion of the military and surveillance
state]{.underline}**, since that's who pays their bills; what
the Times did was reveal a specific, rather direct example, using
heretofore secret documents.

New York Times readers didn't need a smoking gun in any event, since
CSIS's agenda can be seen with simple inference. Since it was
the Times that broached the topic, let's use what CSIS fellows have
written or said in the Times over the past year, and see if they ever
called for the defunding or de-escalation of the military state:

[CSIS op-ed]{.underline}

([8/5/16](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/world/africa/boko-haram-leader-speaks-on-youtube-deepening-signs-of-split.html)[)
insisting Boko Haram is **"increasingly unstable"**]{.underline}

One of the starkest examples, one that FAIR [noted at the
time](https://fair.org/home/us-leads-world-in-credulous-reports-of-lagging-behind-russia/),
was a New York Times article
([8/20/15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/world/united-states-russia-arctic-exploration.html?_r=0))
last year, warning about the US "lagging behind" Russia in the Arctic
Ocean, that was based almost entirely on a [CSIS
report](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/150826_Conley_NewIceCurtain_Web.pdf) warning
of "Russia's strategic reach" near the north pole. As we noted in
September, the piece failed to mention Russia has [14 times the Arctic
coast](http://diplomatonline.com/mag/2012/10/the-arctic-country-by-country/) of
the US, and thus it made sense it would have roughly that many more
icebreaker ships. The "gap" was just asserted, based primarily on US
military say-so and a CSIS report that breathlessly insisted Russia was
getting the better of the US in the Arctic. The New York Times even
helped out, using a wildly deceptive map implying Arctic parity where
none existed:

n May, the torrent of media articles hyping the "Arctic gap" asserted by
CSIS and the US military paid dividends, with Congress [allocating an
additional \$1 billion to the Navy's
budget](http://www.adn.com/politics/2016/05/24/congress-takes-a-big-step-toward-funding-a-new-1-billion-arctic-icebreaker/) to
pay for icebreaker ships. Another bill, the [Icebreaker Recapitalization
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1386),
calling for Congress to fully fund "six heavy-duty polar icebreaker
ships," has been introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D.--Wash.).

While the contracts are not awarded yet, Lockheed Martin---one of
CSIS's [top
donors](https://www.csis.org/support-csis/our-donors/corporation-and-trade-association-donors)--is [said](http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/24/navy-to-help-coast-guard-double-its-icebreaker-fle.aspx) by
market analyst The Motley Fool to be an "obvious choice" to build the
new fleet. Their runner up to build the new icebreakers? Huntington
Ingalls Industries, who also [donated
generously](https://www.csis.org/support-csis/our-donors/corporation-and-trade-association-donors) to
CSIS.

**[No instances of CSIS]{.underline}** [calling]{.underline} **[for the
defunding]{.underline}** or de-escalation of **[the military
state]{.underline}** in the New York Times could be found by FAIR. FAIR
reached out to CSIS spokesperson Andrew Schwartz, asking him to cite any
examples of CSIS ever saying the threat of Russia or Islamic extremism
was overestimated, or advocating for less surveillance or military
spending. He did not respond at the time of publishing.

It could be a coincidence that CSIS always errs on the side of more
military spending, more surveillance, more hyping of threats from Russia
and ISIS, and that these conclusions were reached based on a
dispassionate examination of the facts. Or the New York Times could read
its own reporting, and treat deep-state think tank war-boosters as just
that. At the very least, if they are to be cited, the paper could note
that they are funded by interests heavily invested in promoting the
expansion of a NATO/GCC-led military apparatus, so the reader can know
that the bespectacled quasi-academic being interviewed or proffering
charts and maps is not entirely without strings. (Noting that someone
commenting on war is funded by those who profit from war seems entirely
reasonable, no?).

[The media would understandably]{.underline} [be hard-pressed to **drop
think tanks altogether**]{.underline}. Their insta-pundits lend gravitas
to articles for writers on deadline and, just as they do for lawmakers,
think tanks do much of the research heavy-lifting. But the think tank
industry, as the internal emails New York Times revealed make clear, is
often based on laundering influence through ostensibly neutral-sounding
"institutes" or "centers," with the fact that the average media consumer
won't know who funds them being part of the service offered to donors.

In that reality, the [United States has **long been** an **imperial

[Given]{.underline} the [racialized nature of U.S. imperial

predicted, in a chapter entitled "The Three Races of the United States,"
that the [United States]{.underline} would one day [govern]{.underline}
"the [destinies of **half the globe**]{.underline}." In its early days,
while still a slave-holding country, the [United States asserted its
sovereignty through genocide on a **continental scale**]{.underline} and
annexed large portions of northern Mexico. The country went on to
[overthrow]{.underline} the independent state of [Hawaii]{.underline},
[occupied the Philippines and Haiti]{.underline}, [exerted]{.underline}
its [regional power throughout Latin America]{.underline}, expanded its
international hegemony after World War II, [and became]{.underline} what
it is today: [the world's foremost military and **nuclear power** with a

exceeds]{.underline} the spending of [all other **major global powers
combined**]{.underline}.

"Taking over from the British Empire in the early twentieth-century,"
argues James Tully, the [United States]{.underline} has
[used]{.underline} its many [military bases]{.underline} located
"outside its own borders" --- now nearly 800 in over 80 countries ---

The [green growth]{.underline} strategy [is reliant]{.underline} [on
**absolute [decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This
[assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [pressures]{.mark}
**economies**]{.underline} [exert]{.underline} on the environment can
and [will [decline as]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**GDP**]{.mark} continues
to [grow]{.mark}]{.underline} (Haberl et al., 2020). [New
research]{.underline} by **[[Hausfather]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2021),
published by the Breakthrough Institute last month, now [**[claims to
have found evidence]{.mark}** of]{.underline} [such
decoupling]{.underline}, sparking renewed debate among green growth and
degrowth advocates. While yet to go through peer review, the research
[claims that the]{.underline} [absolute decoupling]{.underline} [of
**CO2 emissions**]{.underline} [from economic]{.underline} [growth has
occurred]{.underline} [in]{.underline} a select number of (largely
[Global North]{.underline}) [countries]{.underline}. Between 2005 and
2019, 32 countries managed to decouple their CO2 emissions, both
territorial and consumption, from growth in GDP. Several prominent
[**ecomodernists** and]{.underline} [green growth advocates]{.underline}
[have declared]{.underline} [these **findings to be proof**]{.underline}
that [we can grow]{.underline} our way [out of the]{.underline}
[ecological crisis]{.underline}.

But [do]{.underline} [such claims]{.underline} [stand up to
scrutiny?]{.underline} There are five reasons to [doubt that they
do]{.underline}. **[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
[emissions]{.underline} counted in the research [do not
provide]{.underline} [the complete picture]{.underline}. While they
cover both territorial and consumption-based emissions, those from
[**[land use]{.mark}** changes]{.underline}, **[international
[shipping]{.mark} [and aviation]{.mark}]{.underline}** are not included.
These [are not trivial]{.underline} figures and, unlike other sectors,
[they are]{.underline} [continuing to increase]{.underline}:
international aviation [emissions are]{.underline} [[up **140%**]{.mark}
since 1990]{.underline} (Mattioli, 2020).
**[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the [[research only
considers]{.underline}]{.mark} [emissions from
**[CO2]{.mark}**]{.underline}; other greenhouse gases --
**[[methane]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[nitrous
oxide]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and **[ozone]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
are not included. Emissions of methane -- a greenhouse gas with [**[80
times]{.mark}** the]{.underline} [warming [power of
CO2]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [began **[rising]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
2007 after a seven-year period of stability. Since 2014, [the rate of
increase]{.underline} has more than [[doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
[[emissions]{.mark} from **livestock**]{.underline} production to
satisfy the Global North's demand for meat [being the primary
cause]{.underline} (Fletcher and Schaefer, 2019).

**[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the research also [does not
include]{.underline} the use of [material **[resources]{.mark} more
[broadly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which are [on the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[rise]{.mark} and [still]{.mark}]{.underline} **[tightly
[coupled]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[with GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
fact, [the global [econ]{.mark}omy]{.underline} [has
been **[rematerializing]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the turn of the
century, meaning an [increase in]{.underline} the [material
intensity]{.underline} [of the growth]{.underline} of GDP (Parrique et
al., 2019). This is [not likely to abate]{.underline} in the future. A
World Bank report in 2017 showed that powering the global economy
through [**[renewables]{.mark}** will [require]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[massive increases]{.underline}** [in **material
[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- including a [**[2,700%]{.mark}
increase** in lithium]{.underline}. This is before any economic growth
is taken into account (Hickel, 2020). Dittrich et al. (2012) estimated
that [global resource [extraction]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[total
**180**]{.mark} **billion tons**]{.underline} by 2050. [The
[sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline} annual [[limit is **50**]{.mark}
**billion tons**]{.underline} (Bringezu, 2015).

**[[Fourth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and relatedly, the research [provides
no evidence]{.underline} [of **absolute decoupling**]{.underline} - of
CO2 or otherwise -- yet occurring at the global level. Given that the
ecological crisis is a global problem, and the [timescales
require]{.underline} [a halving of]{.underline} [greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} by 2030, with total net zero to be achieved by
2050, this is a major obstacle. [Green growth]{.underline} advocates
therefore [speak of **[negative]{.mark}-emissions**]{.underline}
[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} the
Bio-energy with [Climate Capture and Storage]{.underline}
[(BE[CCS]{.mark})]{.underline} which is present in the majority of IPCC
scenarios. [Unfortunately]{.underline}, [this technology]{.underline}
[has **[never]{.mark} been shown** to [work]{.mark}]{.underline} at
scale, and the [land [require]{.mark}ments]{.underline} [total an
[area]{.mark}]{.underline} **[two to [three times]{.mark} the size of
[India]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the ecological implications of which
would be devastating and [fall disproportionately]{.underline} [on the
Global South]{.underline} (Hickel, 2020).

**[[Fifth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the research has also been subject to
several methodological critiques, the main one being the [use of
regression [analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} [rather than]{.underline}
actual [emissions]{.underline} **[figures]{.underline}**, [painting an
overly]{.underline} [optimistic impression]{.underline}. While both
methods come with their own issues, this demonstrates the importance of
waiting for peer review before making any **[sweeping
[assertions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**Lazare '21** --- Sarah; web editor and reporter for In These Times.
November 17, 2021; \"Think Tank Funded by the Weapons Industry Pressures
Biden Not To Regulate Military Contractors' Emissions\"; *In These
Times*;
https://inthesetimes.com/article/heritage-foundation-lockheed-martin-weapons-industry-climate-regulation-biden;
//CYang

The [Heritage Foundation]{.underline}, a [**prominent conservative**
think tank]{.underline}, is [publicly opposing]{.underline} a [new
Biden]{.underline} administration [regulation that]{.underline} would
[force]{.underline} the [weapons]{.underline} industry [to
report]{.underline} its [greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} related
to federal contracts. It turns out the [Heritage Foundation]{.underline}
also [receives **significant funding** from the weapons
industry]{.underline}, which makes the case worth examining --- because
it [reveals how]{.underline} the [arms industry pays **supposedly
respectable** institutions to do its **policy bidding**]{.underline} at
the expense of a planet careening toward large-scale climate disaster.

The regulation in question was first proposed in an executive order in
May. It would require federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse
gas emissions and their ​"climate-related financial risk," and to set
​"science-based reduction targets." In other words, companies like
Lockheed Martin would have to disclose how much carbon pollution its
F‑35 aircraft and cluster bombs actually cause.

In October, the Biden administration started the process to amend
federal procurement rules to reflect these changes. ​"Today's action
sends a strong signal that in order to do business with the federal
government, companies must protect consumers by beginning to mitigate
the impact of climate change on their operations and supply chains,"
Shalanda Young, acting director of the White House Office of Management
and Budget, said at the time.

The Department of Defense is the world's biggest institutional consumer
of fossil fuels and a bigger carbon polluter than 140 countries. Yet its
emissions (and those of other armed forces) are excluded from UN climate
negotiations, including the recent COP26 talks. The Biden administration
itself supports a massive military budget, initially requesting \$753
billion for the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, a number that
has since ballooned, with the Senate set to vote on a \$778 billion
plan. Organizers and researchers argue that, to curb the climate crisis,
it is necessary to roll back U.S. militarism and dismantle the military
budget.

But according to the Heritage Foundation, even this modest proposal is a
bridge too far. Earlier in November, Maiya Clark, research associate in
the Heritage Foundation's Center for National Defense, wrote an article
blasting the proposed changes as harmful to the ​"defense industrial
base" of the United States. ​"The additional expense of measuring,
reporting, and reducing contractors' greenhouse gas emissions would in
turn be passed along to their customer: the Department of Defense," she
writes in the article, co-published in the conservative Washington
Examiner. As a result, Clark argues, the Department of Defense wouldn't
be able to afford the items it needs to fortify itself, threatening
America's war-fighting ability.

"Defense industrial base" is a buzzword that has picked up steam during
the pandemic: It sends the message that, whatever happens with the
economy and pandemic, we need to make sure we are in ​"fighting
shape" --- by keeping military contractors afloat. This concept was
invoked to explain why, at the beginning of the pandemic, factories that
produce bombs and tankers should be allowed to stay open, even amid the
outbreak risk to workers. And it was also used to justify subsidies to
contractors during the hardship of the pandemic.

Clark's framing could lead one to believe that the Department of Defense
is forced to resort to bake sales to afford its F‑35s. In reality, the
United States has the largest military budget in the world by
far --- greater than the next 11 countries combined. And that trend is
poised to remain as Congress moves to pass another mammoth military
budget. As Lindsay Koshgarian, program director for National Priorities
Project, a research organization, tells In These Times: ​"The idea that
the military industrial complex is in danger is laughable. This is an
industry that took in \$3.4 trillion in public funds in the last ten
years, more than half of all military spending during that time. That
kind of funding should at the very least come with some accountability."

Ultimately, Clark's piece argues that the regulations are unfair to
companies. Clark writes that ​"adding burdensome regulations to the
already onerous Federal Acquisition Regulation would create a difficult
or even impossible task for contractors, leading some firms to simply
exit the defense market. The largest defense contractors for the biggest
programs, like Lockheed Martin for the F‑35 or Huntington Ingalls for
the Ford-class aircraft carrier, would somehow have to collect emissions
data for their tens of thousands of subcontractors and suppliers."

Clark leaves unexplained why the financial well-being of a company that
manufactured the bomb that killed 40 Yemeni children in a school bus in
2018 should be weighted more heavily than modest regulations aimed at
staving off humanity-threatening climate change. What's more, Lockheed
Martin is doing just fine financially, and has received considerable
help from the government during the pandemic.

Most importantly, Clark leaves out this critical detail: [Lockheed
Martin]{.underline} is [just one of **numerous weapons manufacturers**
that]{.underline} has [**directly funded** the Heritage
Foundation]{.underline}. According to a report by the think tank Center
for International Policy (CIP), the [Heritage Foundation ranks ninth
among]{.underline} the [**top think tanks** that received funding from
military contractors]{.underline} and the U.S. government from 2014 to
2019. [Lockheed Martin and Raytheon]{.underline} were [two of those
**major funders**]{.underline}, both of which are among the largest
weapons companies in the world and would be impacted by the new
regulation.

Ben Freeman, author of the CIP report, says, ​"Unfortunately, since that
report was published, Heritage has moved towards full secrecy on donors,
and doesn't publish any specifics," but adds he is ​"100%" certain the
think tank still receives funding from the weapons industry. ​"If they
had suddenly stopped, I'd be shocked," he tells In These Times.

The Heritage Foundation did not respond to a request from In These Times
for information about its funding sources, but even under the unlikely
scenario that the Heritage Foundation decided to drastically halt its
cash stream from weapons companies, the documented donations are recent
enough that, likely, the programs or staffers that money funded are
still around. Regardless, the article raises questions about what kind
of advocacy the weapons industry might be doing behind closed doors. And
the fact that it name-checks the hardships imposed on Lockheed Martin,
which we know has provided funding to the Heritage Foundation, certainly
raises eyebrows.

This case [provides]{.underline} a [window into the **murky world** of
think tanks]{.underline}, [which are]{.underline} often [viewed as
**academic** and **above-the-fray institutions** but operate more as
**lobbying outfits**]{.underline}. If Lockheed Martin were to run its
own public relations campaign against the Biden administration's climate
regulation, the public might rightfully be skeptical of a company that
markets weapons; an influential and prominent think tank, with its long
history of influencing government, is better positioned to take up such
a cause.

#### Kagan's an idiot.

**Lind 19**, Michael Lind is a visiting professor at the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, a
contributing editor to the National Interest and author of "The American
Way of Strategy.", (Michael, "Robert Kagan's big wrong idea", The
Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/26/robert-kagans-big-wrong-idea/)
//CHC-DS

In Kagan's world, Washington is to global ideology what Paris is to
fashion. [Because of America's failure to somehow check the illiberal
rule of Vladimir Putin, **Kagan** writes: "An authoritarian 'backlash'
spread globally, from Egypt to Turkey to Venezuela to Zimbabwe, as the
remaining authoritarian regimes]{.underline}, following Putin's example,
began systematically [restrict]{.underline}ing [the space of civil
society]{.underline}, cutting it off from its foreign supporters, and
curbing free expression and independent media.["]{.underline}
[But]{.underline} [**Egypt's** secular military did not
need]{.underline} the [permission provided by]{.underline} "**[Putin's
example"]{.underline}** [to overthrow the Islamist
president]{.underline} of Egypt, Mohamed Morsi, [any more than the
Islamist president of Turkey]{.underline}, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, [needed
Putin's example to purge Turkey's secular military]{.underline}.

[Could any claim be]{.underline} **[more absurd]{.underline}** [than
this? Yes --- Kagan's claim that Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump are
American versions of the supposed global "authoritarian"
backlash]{.underline}: "And, of course, the United States has been
experiencing its own anti-liberal backlash. Indeed, these days the
anti-liberal critique is so pervasive, at both ends of the political
spectrum and in the most energetic segments of both political parties,
that there is scarcely an old-style American liberal to be found."
[Americans to the left of Clinton Democrats and the right of George W.
Bush are "anti-liberals," according to Kagan. This is]{.underline}
**[red-baiting]{.underline}**, or perhaps brown-baiting, [by an adherent
of the]{.underline} **[dead center in American politics]{.underline}**.

Kagan repeatedly criticizes the Israeli scholar Yoram Hazony for
arguing, in "The Virtue of Nationalism," "that true democracy comes from
nationalism, not liberalism." [Kagan's distinction between liberalism
and nationalism]{.underline} is common among Western academics and
journalists, but it [is confused. Liberalism, like democracy, refers to
a form of government. Nationalism refers to a kind of state, a state
identified with a cultural and linguistic]{.underline} (not necessarily
an ethnic or religious) [majority]{.underline}.

[For two centuries]{.underline}, since the American and French
revolutions, [the most important contest of political models has been
between the nation-state]{.underline} (democratic or undemocratic,
liberal or illiberal) [and the multinational state]{.underline}
(democratic or undemocratic, liberal or illiberal). Most multinational
empires, from the Habsburgs, Ottomans and Hohenzollerns to the Soviet
Union, have crumbled into nation-states, democratic or otherwise. So
have a number of dysfunctional multinational states such as the former
Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia and the former Sudan.

**[Few]{.underline}**, if any, [of the major conflicts in the world
today are battles between liberalism and authoritarianism]{.underline}.
Almost all involve nationalism, whether that of stateless nations that
want their own nation-states, such as the Palestinians and Kurds and
Catalans, or powerful nation-states such as China and Russia, which wish
to increase their regional influence for nationalist reasons. [To the
extent that the European Union and the Pax Americana
resemble]{.underline} **[liberal empires]{.underline}** [in the service
of their own **dominant nations**]{.underline} --- the Germans, French
and Americans [--- the prospects for pan-Western anti-national
liberalism are not bright.]{.underline} Giuseppe Mazzini, William
Gladstone, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt understood that
liberalism and democracy are most likely to succeed when aligned with
national self-determination rather than opposed to it.

[As a former **neoconservative** foreign policy analyst like Kagan, I
recognize the call-to-arms genre]{.underline} in which he writes. From
the 1950s to the 1980s, Cold War liberals, later called
neoconservatives, individually and through groups such as the Committee
on the Present Danger sought to awaken their fellow citizens to the
threat of communism without and within. Comparisons to the 1930s were
common; among the neocons, it was always 1939.

These jeremiads seemed plausible at a time when there really was a
hostile superpower promoting a universal secular creed. But even then
[the idea that the Cold War was a battle of -isms between democracy and
communism was wrong. The United States fought two savage wars in Korea
and Indochina supporting allied authoritarian dictatorships and defeated
the Soviet Union]{.underline} in the 1980s [as a de facto ally of
communist China]{.underline}.

[In today's]{.underline} **[multipolar world]{.underline}** [of
low-level, traditional great-power rivalries]{.underline} over regional
spheres of influence, [prosecuted more in trade and industrial policies
and alliance diplomacy than]{.underline} on the [military and
propaganda]{.underline} fronts, **[what is needed is sober
realism]{.underline}**, **[not anachronistic]{.underline}**, Manichean
**[Cold War thinking]{.underline}** [that unites simple-minded
dichotomies with crusading fervor]{.underline}. **[Realpolitik is
back]{.underline}**. In fact, it never went away.

#### Kagan's logic is a [Cold War paradigm]{.underline} that justifies [never-ending]{.underline} wars.

the idea that Vietnam was a post-colonial war of national independence
was inconceivable. The Middle East? Our leading lights were so enamored
by the opposition between "liberalism" and Islamic fundamentalism that
the idea that the nations of the Middle East are involved in an internal
wrestling match with modernity that we cannot successfully referee was
unthinkable. ["Liberalism." The abstract universal "idea" against which
all the forces of darkness align, and because of which **never-ending
wars** must be authorized]{.underline}---communism after World War II;
Islamic fundamentalism after 2001; and now, authoritarianism in its
various guises, without distinction, from Trump and his Deplorables, to
Orban and his "White Christians." Everyone who does not believe in the
abstract universal "idea" of liberalism is an authoritarian at heart;
they differ only with respect to the political power they have at their
disposal to impose their wretched prejudices on others.

Let us take up [Kagan's "liberalism]{.underline},["]{.underline} and see
what it really amounts to. The **[deadly flaw]{.underline}** of
Manichean thinking [is that it locks two opposing parties in **endless**
and unresolvable **struggle**]{.underline}, [not least
because]{.underline} **[each party is a caricature]{.underline}** [that
becomes substantive]{.underline} **[only in relationship]{.underline}**
[to its caricatured opposite]{.underline}. Kagan's ["liberalism" is one
of those parties]{.underline}. ["Liberalism," Kagan tells us, is the
result of the Enlightenment]{.underline}, which is self-evidently
[synonymous with the French Revolution and]{.underline} the "all men are
created equal" clause of [the]{.underline} American [Declaration of
Independence. This is]{.underline} **[intellectually reckless and
irresponsible]{.underline}**. The Enlightenment was not one; it was
many, each having distinct national characteristics. John Locke, Kagan's
liberal founder, wrote a century before the French Revolution, and never
would have endorsed a revolution based on abstract and universal rights,
as the French Revolution was. The French Revolution sought to overthrow
everything, even the Gregorian calendar. Locke remained a Christian
throughout his life and sought to defend property and the integrity of
the (Christian) family. If Locke must be painted as a universalist, it
is as a Christian universalist that it ought to be done. Later,
purportedly secular, Enlightenment figures tried to strip away Locke's
Christianity, and to develop a universal theory of history based on the
development of reason---as Kagan notes Hegel attempted to do. Have we
forgotten Nietzsche, who in the 1870s demonstrated to the embarrassment
ever afterward of German idealism that Hegel's universal history was
Christianity in disguise? The bitter fruit of Nietzsche's revelation is
the post-modern morass in which we now find ourselves, about which Kagan
says nothing. Ironically, the depiction of Locke as a liberal, committed
to abstract universals, is something the very conservatives for whom
Kagan shows such contempt have asserted since the dawn of the
Conservative Movement in the mid-1950s.

[Kagan]{.underline} **[refuses]{.underline}** [to consider how
differences are interactively produced]{.underline}. Consider a
contemporary articulation of difference featured in Kagan's text. Here
is Bill Clinton contrasting the domain of liberal globalization
associated with legitimate trade, investment and travel (of authorized
persons) with a recalcitrant external environment of "outlaw
nations...an unholy axis of terrorists, drug traffickers, and organized
international criminals" (quoted in Kagan 2018, p. 97). Like all the
other liberal elites Kagan cites, Clinton's words are taken at face
value. [Kagan's]{.underline} **[logic of difference]{.underline}**
[locates aggression, violence and danger as forces that are]{.underline}
**[external]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[liberalism]{.underline}**
[and which, therefore, cannot have been produced by
liberalism]{.underline}. We have not had a hand in creating any of the
monsters that we seek to destroy. [Never mind that the]{.underline}
**[US led globalization]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}
**[shaped]{.underline}** [the security environment in which all of these
actors have emerged]{.underline}. This is a point demonstrated by Ioan
Grillo's (2016) account of gangster warlords in Latin America: they have
emerged not as an exception to the good, decent liberal order championed
by the US, but rather as a result of the violent exclusions that its
implantation, via structural adjustment policies, free trade agreements
and ongoing security cooperation policies, have engendered.

[Kagan does not]{.underline} spend time [worry]{.underline}ing
[about]{.underline} **[peripheral regions]{.underline}** [of the global
economy or about **marginalized people**]{.underline}. [He is more
concerned with the pacification of]{.underline} **[power
politics]{.underline}**, marked by the post-World War Two conversion of
Germany and Japan into pacifist states that disavowed the struggle for
power and national greatness to instead dedicate their national energies
to liberal progress within the context of an open world economy, which
US power would secure. When the Cold War ended, Russia and China were
offered a similar deal. The Soviets could withdraw from Eastern Europe
(and renounce communism) without worrying about German reunification
because of the US capacity to contain power politics. China could follow
the positive example of Japan (and not the negative example of inter-war
imperial Japan) and reject the pursuit of state power and focus instead
on getting rich. Too bad that they did not take the message to heart.
[For its part, Russia cares more about its power than its security and,
in any event, **Russian security perceptions**, warped by its great
power aspirations, **ought not matter** (Kagan 2018]{.underline}, p.
89[)]{.underline}. [What is important is that **NATO
expansion**]{.underline} [made Europe whole and free (Never
mind]{.underline}, as well, [that]{.underline} George Kennan warned,
correctly, that [the US driven expansion into the Eastern Europe would
antagonize Russia.]{.underline} Kennan is an unquestionable authority
when his views coincide with Kagan's, but otherwise, he is quite
dispensable[)]{.underline}. Russia could have lived with that, but it
chose not to for reasons of national pride (Kagan 2018, p. 111).
[Similarly, China's dream of empire is also a manifestation of pride
rather than acceptance of liberal order]{.underline} as a context for
national development [(Kagan 2018]{.underline}, p. 117[)]{.underline}.
**[Apparently only the United States]{.underline}**, [suggests
Kagan]{.underline}, [can aspire to greatness because only its

<https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2020/10/9/response-to-mcafee>.

[A number of people have asked me to respond to a piece that Andrew
McAfee wrote]{.underline} for Wired, promoting his book, [which claims
that rich countries - and specifically the United States - have
accomplished the miracle of "[green growth" and
"dematerialization]{.mark}"]{.underline}, absolutely decoupling GDP from
resource use. I had critiqued the book's central claims here and here,
pointing out that **[[the data he relies on is not in]{.mark} fact
[suitable for the purposes to which he puts it.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In short, [[McAfee uses]{.mark} data on domestic material consumption
([DMC]{.mark})]{.underline}, which tallies up the resources that a
nation extracts and consumes each year. But [this metric ignores a
crucial piece of the puzzle]{.underline}. While it includes the imported
goods an economy relies on, **[it [does not include the resources
involved in extracting, producing, and transporting those
goods]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Because the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and other rich economies have come to [rely]{.mark} so
heavily on production that happens [in other countries,]{.mark} that
side of resource use has been conveniently shifted off their
books.]{.underline}

In other words, **[[what looks like "green growth" is]{.mark} really
just an [artifact of globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Given how
much the U.S. economy relies on globalization, **[[McAfee's data cannot
be]{.mark} legitimately [compared to U.S. GDP]{.mark}, and [cannot be
used to make claims about dematerialization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [If
McAfee wants to compare GDP to domestic resource consumption, then he
[needs to first subtract]{.mark} the [share of US GDP]{.mark} that is
derived from production that happens elsewhere. [He does not. **Nor is
this possible** ]{.mark}**to do[.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Ecological economists have been aware of this problem for a long time.
To correct for it, they use a more holistic metric called "raw material
consumption,"]{.underline} or Material Footprint, which fully accounts
for materials embodied in trade. [When we look at this data, the story
changes]{.underline}. [We see that resource use in the United States
hasn't been falling at all; in fact, it has been rising along with GDP.
The same is true of all other major industrial economies.]{.underline}
**[[There has been zero dematerialization. No green growth.]{.mark} And
indeed [when it comes to]{.mark} [excess resource use, rich countries
are the biggest problem]{.mark} - not the saviours that McAfee suggests
they are.]{.underline}**

#### 2\-\--The EKC argument doesn't account for other environmental variables.

Jason **Hickel 20**. He holds a bachelor\'s degree in anthropology from
Wheaton College. Received his PhD in anthropology from the University of
Virginia in August 2011. Taught at the London School of Economics from
2011 to 2017, where he held a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship. He is

1\. First, [[McAfee points to]{.mark} the]{.underline} fact that rich
nations have reduced their air pollution. This is proof, he says, of the
Environmental Kuznets Curve, where impacts rise with GDP up to a point,
and then begin to decline as GDP continues to go up. McAfee says "The
[[EKC]{.underline}]{.mark} is a direct refutation of a core idea of
degrowth: that environmental harms must always rise as populations and
economies do. It\'s not surprising that today\'s degrowth advocates
rarely discuss the large reductions in air and water pollution that have
accompanied higher prosperity in so many places around the world."

In reality, [degrowth scholarship is full of references to the EKC; [it
is widely acknowledged]{.mark}]{.underline}. [McAfee would know this if
he engaged with the degrowth literature]{.underline}. We note, however,
that [[the EKC is known to apply to only a limited range of
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as air pollution). [It [does not
apply to impacts like resource use and energy use]{.mark}, **[which rise
inexorably along with economic growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and which
are, for this reason, the focus of degrowth analysis). [The [spottiness
of the EKC is well established in]{.mark} the [empirical
literature]{.mark}]{.underline} (see, for instance, Stern's recent
review, "The Environmental Kuznets Curve After 25 Years"). McAfee
ignores this fact in order to create the impression (as in the quote
above) that the EKC applies universally to all environmental harms.
There is nothing to be gained by papering over the nuance in the EKC
literature.

Moreover, [even where the EKC does apply, the literature is increasingly
clear that it's not income growth itself that drives the reduction in
pollution]{.underline} (as McAfee implies when he says "prosperity bends
the curve"); rather, it is policy interventions, and specifically legal
limits. London's mayor Sadiq Khan has massively reduced the city's air
pollution over the past couple of years. Is this because London's GDP
has suddenly increased? No, it's because Khan, unlike his predecessor,
has introduced laws to reduce air pollution. This could have been done
decades earlier with the same effect, regardless of how much GDP the
city might have had at any given time.

Indeed, Stern's conclusions about the relationship between GDP and
pollution are worth noting: "The effect of economic growth on pollution
is generally positive... The evidence shows that over recent decades
economic growth has increased both pollution emissions and
concentrations, ceteris paribus \[i.e., when controlling for all other
factors\]\... [This reinforces the early concerns that the [EKC
literature]{.mark} might [encourage policy-makers to incorrectly
de-emphasize environmental polic]{.mark}y and [pursue growth]{.mark} as
a solution instead."]{.underline} **[And [that's exactly the error that
McAfee has committed.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

So, yes, air pollution can be decoupled from GDP, with policy. We have
known this for a long time. But that has nothing to do with the question
of dematerialization, which is the focus of McAfee's book, and which is
the specific claim I have critiqued. Nor does it have to do with the
broader problem of ecological breakdown, or the broader question of
whether "green growth" is possible. In other words, yes, it's good news
that air pollution is going down, but this is certainly no sign that
everything is rosy.

We urge you to [look at the [science]{.mark}]{.underline} and scientists
[[Pinker promotes]{.mark} in his]{.underline} Enlightenment Now and his
other [works]{.underline} such as The Blank Slate (2002/2016),
[namely]{.underline}, F. Galton (founder of [[eugenics]{.mark}
or]{.underline} "[[science of **racial
betterment**]{.underline}]{.mark}"), E. O. Wilson (social biologist who
[[explained racial inequality as based on evolution]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [not racism]{.underline}), Herrnstein & Murray (who claimed to
[[supposedly]{.mark} empirically verify **overall [lower
intelligence]{.mark}** levels [among African
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Thornhill &
Palmer (authors of the Natural History of Rape who [claim [rape is
not]{.mark}]{.underline} a form of [**social [violence]{.mark}**
[but]{.mark} an **[evolutionary adaptive sex]{.mark}**]{.underline}).

Pinker [[defends]{.mark} **eugenic** and **racist**
studies]{.underline}, like the [Tuskegee syphilis
experiments]{.underline}, and recasts them as a "one-time failure to
prevent harm to a few dozen people with the prevention of hundreds of
millions of deaths per century in perpetuity." Notably, Pinker (New
Republic, 2005) was the [key supporter of Lawrence Summers after
Summers]{.underline} was [dismissed]{.underline} from his post as
president of Harvard University [for claiming]{.underline} that
[[men]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[outperform]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[women]{.underline}]{.mark} in sciences and mathematics [[because of
gender-based **biological differences** and not social
biases]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Many of Pinker's assertions have been questioned by concerned scientists
and social critics, including his statements that [stereotypes are true
because they are based on]{.underline} "[census figures]{.underline}"
(such as income, education, or crime statistics); that
[eugenic]{.underline} "[breeding]{.underline}" of people [based
on]{.underline} "[intelligence]{.underline} and character" [is a good
idea]{.underline}; that [[affirmative action]{.mark} is]{.underline} not
only "[discriminating against whites]{.underline}" but is [[wrong
because **minorities'**/**women's** under-representation reflects their
lack of]{.mark} supposed [inborn biological capacities]{.mark} in these
areas]{.underline}; or that [[treating rape as]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[form of [violence is]{.mark}]{.underline} "an [[example]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} **extraordinary [popular delusion]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[madness]{.mark} of crowds]{.underline}."

Pinker claims that because his views are supposedly based on scientific
data, they must be the "truth" and "cannot be sexist" or support hate.
In reality, the very same [[science]{.underline}]{.mark} and scientists
[[Pinker]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[promotes are used by contemporary
**racist** and **misogynistic** writers]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, some of Pinker's statements are an eerie echo of an
introduction to David Duke's My Awakening written by a "behavioral
genetics" psychologist, who [claimed]{.underline} that Duke, the [KKK
and white supremacy leader]{.underline}, provided "[discoveries of
honest truths that are **politically incorrect**]{.underline}. One of
his honest truths is that from a thorough immersion in modern science
\[Duke\] became convinced that [racial egalitarianism]{.underline} is
the [scientific equivalent of]{.underline} the [flat-Earth]{.underline}
theory."

[RAND]{.underline} [began]{.underline} [consulting]{.underline} [on

[missile defense.]{.underline} Before long, [the organization was
so]{.underline} [flush with contracts]{.underline} that [it had to hire

recruitment ads, [RAND]{.underline} **[bragged about its intellectual
genealogy]{.underline}**, tracing a direct line from its president,
Frank Collbohm, to Isaac Newton. Whether or not that claim was true, the
institute secured a reputation as the place to dream up new ways to wage

The Soviets had good reason to worry about [RAND]{.underline}. In 1957,
the Air Force hired the think tank to create spy satellites. Within two
years, it [developed]{.underline} [CORONA]{.underline}---[a covert
system that aimed to **send camera-carr**ying **satellites** **into**
**orbit** **on the backs of missiles**.]{.underline} While the idea was
genius, the design was flawed. It took 13 failed attempts before the
system finally got off the ground in 1959. Once it did, however, the
results were spectacular. The CORONA satellite returned with 161 lbs. of
film about the Soviet Union, more footage than spy planes had recovered
in the previous four years combined. For the following decade, CORONA
became the backbone of American intelligence on the Soviet
Union. Researchers watched troops march along the Russian border with
China and spied on cities they\'d never seen before. They could even
count the fruit in Soviet orchards and analyze their crops.

By the early 1960s, [RAND]{.underline} had **[established itself as

The distance from concrete societies increases further whenever it is
asserted, as Rhonheimer (2012) does, that the "free market" is an ideal
(15), i.e. something that does not truly exist in reality (I shall not
dwell on the contradiction entailed by his claim about free markets
having existed worldwide only for a brief period of time in the 19th
century). In other words, it is a purely theoretical construct, an

are]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The former are not around. The latter are.

**[[Rhonheimer]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2012) [seems [not]{.mark} to
[notice]{.mark} the trouble some implications of such an
approach,]{.underline} for not only does it mean that [[there is
**no**]{.mark} **clear [empirical ev]{.mark}idence** that [free markets
are the]{.mark} **one**, [necessary way to
**prosperity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also that there cannot be any,
for they have never been truly present, since they are not suited to
"the human condition" (15). Moreover, he does not seem to notice that
his approach is analogous to that of many 20th century Marxist zealots
who, when confronted with the failures of Eastern Europe's "real
socialism", argued that their theory was correct, since its practice
alone had failed, given various and varying human flaws. In short, [no
amount of contrary evidence could disprove their stance.]{.underline}

6\. Unfalsifiability The Marxist zealots' case leads us to the most
fundamental and most intractable conceptual knot of the liberal position
with regard to the markets' unique ability to generate prosperity. If
(i) the genuine "free market" cannot be established, for it is a
theoretical construct inconsistent with "the human condition", and if
(ii) the actual historical experience of what is commonly referred to as
the "free market", i.e. the history of mostly Western developed
countries over the past three centuries, is one of considerably
imperfect applications involving significant elements of State
intervention (e.g. post-bellic Germany and USA), why is the market
system necessarily responsible for wealth and, to some extent,
wellbeing, whereas, say, significant State intervention and ownership
are not? Why not the two of them together, on a par (cf. Rajan &
Zingales, 2003)? Or why not either of them, or other factors (e.g.
literacy, patriotism, military strength, science-technology), depending
on the specific circumstances of each particular case, duly investigated
by means of close historical, economic, legal, medical, sociological,
anthropological, environmental and axiological analyses? Principled
comparisons are possible, but they must rest on solid empirical ground
(cf. Boldizzoni, 2011). Moreover, reality may well be messy, diverse and
complex. Why should there be one necessary source of prosperity for all
cases?33

By his own account and qualifications, [Rhonheimer]{.underline} (2012)
has no answer to these questions. Quite simply, he [states his thesis
and uses it to read history so as to be allowed to state
it.]{.underline} In other words, [[Rhonheimer is **assuming a priori**
that the]{.mark} "free [market]{.mark}" [produces]{.mark}
**necessarily** wealth and, to some extent, **[well
being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [By means of that assumption he
[then]{.mark} proceeds to [read]{.mark}ing human [history as its
**verification**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- State-led development,
[[**recurrent crises**, **vast environmental degradation** and **social
tragedies** notwithstanding]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This is not just a case of **[rash
oversimplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which it certainly
is]{.underline} too, such that it would be necessary to pause and
specify which forms of market transactions are beneficial in which ways
to which groups of people under which circumstances[. It is
[also]{.mark} a profound **[methodological flaw]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
It does not apply solely to [[Rhonheimer]{.underline}']{.mark}s essay,
but also to much political liberalism and mainstream economic thinking
in general. In effect, it [does begin with]{.underline} Adam Smith's
Wealth of Nations and reaches its highest peak in laissez-faire
economics, which argues that [the "free market" is the necessary and
sufficient condition for human prosperity]{.underline}. In all of its
forms, [it is an example of [scientific **unfalsifiability**, or
**pseudo-science**]{.mark}, for such an assumption, [whereby]{.mark}
"free [markets]{.mark}" [are **bound to generate prosperity**, admits of
**no counter evidence**]{.mark}]{.underline}[**34**:]{.mark}

First of all, insofar as [it is assumed that unhindered markets bring
about prosperity, **[if we do not have prosperity]{.mark} now**, then
[we must]{.mark} simply wait and [**abstain** from]{.mark} causing undue
**[hindrance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Christians and Marxists have
long known, eschatology calls for patience; hence the recurrent phrases
commonly attached to so-called "market reforms": "transition", "in the
long run", "long-term benefits", "children and grandchildren", etc.
(e.g. Monti, 2013).

Secondly, if waiting is not a credible option, [then [we can always
blame someone else]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the government (e.g.
"corruption","red tape", "interference", "distortion"), the trade unions
(qua common example of "rent-seeking special interest group") [or some
dishonest [private actors]{.mark} (e.g. "**[crony capitalism]{.mark}**",
"**[State capture]{.mark}** by private interests"), for being
**unfaithful** to the spirit of "free markets" and causing
hindrance]{.underline}. [[Markets fail not; people
do]{.underline}]{.mark} -- although one can legitimately wonder what
markets may be if not people transacting with one another within a
certain normative setting (cf. Barden & Murphy, 2010).

Thirdly, insofar as Smith's followers and ordoliberals à la [[Rhonheimer
argue]{.underline}]{.mark} as well for the desirability of some State
intervention (e.g. Smith's progressive taxation, Presbyterian-style
education of the youth, public regulation of banks and mentally
destructive working conditions; Eucken's redressing of socially
detrimental market outcomes), they corner public authorities in a
hopeless argumentative position. Given the starting point, [growth and
prosperity can always be seen as the result of the markets' enduring
degree of freedom]{.underline} -- i.e. not of the State's intervention
-- [while **[crisis and misery can]{.mark}** always [be **blamed onto
the State**]{.mark} -- i.e. [not]{.mark} onto the [markets]{.mark} being
actually **unable** to generate **growth** or genuine
prosperity]{.underline}.35

\(d\) Operating under such an assumption, [[markets can never be
wrong]{.mark}, whatever major environmental or social ills may have
arisen. [If things go well, it is because markets]{.mark} have been
allowed to work out their "magic"]{.underline} (hence "rational agents"
have responded to "incentives", "entrepreneurship" has been "rewarded",
etc.): a textbook case. [[If things do not go well,]{.mark} then [the
guilty party is]{.mark} always someone or [something else]{.mark},
including protectionism]{.underline}36, unpredictable "financial
tsunamis"37 and excessive cocaine intake38. In [short, the unintended
consequences are such that, if they are positive, their intended premise
is the free market; if negative, something else39]{.underline}.

## Theory

### Theory --- AT: Alt = Policy

#### FALSE CHOICE! [Policy]{.underline} is [neither]{.underline} predictable *nor* a [useful]{.underline} starting point. Organizations [are predictable]{.underline} AND overcome the [absurdity]{.underline} of fiat. 

David **Graeber 18**, former Prof at the London School of Economics,
*Bullshit Jobs*, pp. 247-8, jy

Another reason I hesitate to make policy suggestions is that [I am
suspicious of the **very idea of policy**. [Policy implies]{.mark} the
[existence of]{.mark}]{.underline} an elite group---**[[government
officials]{.underline}]{.mark}**, typically---[[that]{.mark} gets to
**[decide]{.mark} on something**]{.underline} [([\"a
policy\"]{.mark})]{.underline} that [they [then arrange to be **imposed
on everybody else**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There\'s a little mental trick
we often play on ourselves when discussing such matters. We say, for
instance, \"[What are we going to do about]{.underline} the problem of
[X]{.underline}?\" [[as if \"we\" were **society**]{.mark} **as a
whole**, **somehow [acting on ourselves]{.mark}**[,
but]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, unless we happen to be part of that
roughly 3 percent to 5 percent of the population whose views actually do
affect policy makers, [[this is all]{.mark} a game of
**[make-believe]{.mark}**; we are [identifying with]{.mark} our [rulers
when]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, [[we\'re]{.mark} the **ones [being
ruled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is what happens when we watch a
politician on television say \"What shall we do about the less
fortunate?\" even though at least half of us would almost certainly fit
that category ourselves. Myself, [I find]{.underline} such [games
particularly **pernicious**]{.underline} [because **[I\'d prefer not to
have]{.mark} policy [elites around at
all]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} I\'m personally an anarchist, which
means that, not only do I look forward to a day sometime in the future
when [governments, corporations, and the rest will be looked at as
**historical curiosities**]{.underline} in the same way as we now look
at the Spanish Inquisition or nomadic invasions, but [I [prefer
solutions]{.mark} to **immediate problems**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark}
do not give more **power to governments or corporations**, but rather,
[give people]{.mark} the [means to **manage their own
affairs**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It follows that when faced with a social problem [[my impulse is **not
to imagine myself in charge**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and ponder what
sort of **solutions I would then impose**, [but to look for a
**movement**]{.mark} **already [out there]{.mark}**]{.underline},
already **[trying [to address the problem]{.mark} and create its own
solutions]{.underline}**. The problem of bullshit jobs, though presents
unusual challenges in this regard. [There are **no anti-bullshit job
movements**]{.underline}. This is partly because [most people don\'t
acknowledge the **proliferation of bullshit jobs to be a
problem**]{.underline}, but also because even if they did, it would be
difficult to organize a movement around such a problem. [What local
initiatives **might such a movement propose**?]{.underline} One could
imagine **[unions]{.underline}** [or **other worker
organizations**]{.underline} [launching anti-bullshit initiatives in
their **own workplaces**]{.underline}, or even across specific
industries---but they would presumably [call for the
**de-bullshitization of real work**]{.underline} rather than firing
people in unnecessary positions. It\'s not at all clear what a broader
campaign against bullshit jobs would even look like. One might try to
shorten the working week and hope things would sort themselves out in
response. But it seems unlikely that they would. Even a successful
campaign for a fifteen-hour week would be unlikely to cause the
unnecessary jobs and industries to be spontaneously abandoned; at the
same time, [[calling for a new]{.mark} government [bureaucracy]{.mark}
to assess the usefulness of jobs [would inevitably itself turn into a
**vast generator of bullshit**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Theory --- AT: Private Actor Fiat

#### RECIPROCITY. The alt's [3.5%]{.underline} of the domestic population --- that's [11.6]{.underline} million. (3.5% × 331893745\*\* = 11616281.075) 

David **Robson 19**, award-winning science writer specialising in the
extremes of the human brain, body and behaviour, citing Erica Chenoweth,
professor of public policy at Harvard and the Radcliffe Institute for
Advanced Study, 5-13-19, \"The \'3.5% rule\': How a small minority can
change the world,\"
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world,
jy

There are, of course, many ethical reasons to use nonviolent strategies.
But compelling research by Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at
Harvard University, confirms that civil [disobedience]{.underline} is
not only the moral choice; it [is also the **most powerful way of
shaping world politics**]{.underline} --- by a long way.

Looking at hundreds of campaigns over the last century, Chenoweth found
that [nonviolent campaigns are twice as likely to achieve their
goals]{.underline} as violent campaigns. And although the exact dynamics
will depend on many factors, she has shown [[it takes]{.mark} around
**[3.5%]{.mark} of the population**]{.underline} actively
[participating]{.underline} in the protests [[to ensure]{.mark}
**serious political [change]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Chenoweth's influence can be seen in the recent Extinction Rebellion
protests, whose founders say they have been directly inspired by her
findings. So just how did she come to these conclusions?

Needless to say, Chenoweth's research builds on the philosophies of many
influential figures throughout history. The African-American
abolitionist Sojourner Truth, the suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony,
the Indian independence activist Mahatma Gandhi and the US civil rights
campaigner Martin Luther King have all convincingly argued for the power
of peaceful protest.

Yet Chenoweth admits that when she first began her research in the
mid-2000s, she was initially rather cynical of the idea that nonviolent
actions could be more powerful than armed conflict in most situations.
As a PhD student at the University of Colorado, she had spent years
studying the factors contributing to the rise of terrorism when she was
asked to attend an academic workshop organised by the International
Center of Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC), a non-profit organisation based in
Washington DC. The workshop presented many compelling examples of
peaceful protests bringing about lasting political change --- including,
for instance, the People Power protests in the Philippines.

But Chenoweth was surprised to find that no-one had comprehensively
compared the success rates of nonviolent versus violent protests;
perhaps the case studies were simply chosen through some kind of
confirmation bias. "I was really motivated by some scepticism that
nonviolent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major
transformations in society," she says

Working with Maria Stephan, a researcher at the ICNC, [Chenoweth
performed [an **extensive review**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the
literature on civil resistance]{.underline} and social movements from
1900 to 2006 --- a data set then corroborated with other experts in the
field. They primarily considered attempts to bring about regime change.
A movement was considered a success if it fully achieved its goals both
within a year of its peak engagement and as a direct result of its
activities. A regime change resulting from foreign military intervention
would not be considered a success, for instance. A campaign was
considered violent, meanwhile, if it involved bombings, kidnappings, the
destruction of infrastructure --- or any other physical harm to people
or property.

"[We were trying to apply a **pretty hard test to nonviolent
resistance**]{.underline} as a strategy," Chenoweth says. (The criteria
were so strict that [India's **independence movement was not
considered**]{.underline} as evidence in favour of nonviolent protest in
Chenoweth and Stephan's analysis --- since Britain's dwindling military
resources were considered to have been a deciding factor, even if the
protests themselves were also a huge influence.)

By the end of this process, [they had [collected data from
**323**]{.mark} **violent and nonviolent
[campaigns]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And their results --- which were
published in their book Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic
of Nonviolent Conflict --- were striking.

Strength in numbers

Overall, [nonviolent campaigns were **twice as likely to
succeed**]{.underline} as violent campaigns: they led to political
change 53% of the time compared to 26% for the violent protests.

This was partly the result of strength in numbers. Chenoweth argues that
nonviolent campaigns are more likely to succeed because they can recruit
many more participants from a much broader demographic, which can cause
severe disruption that paralyses normal urban life and the functioning
of society.

In fact, of the 25 largest campaigns that they studied, 20 were
nonviolent, and 14 of these were outright successes. Overall, the
nonviolent campaigns attracted around four times as many participants
(200,000) as the average violent campaign (50,000).

The People Power campaign against the Marcos regime in the Philippines,
for instance, attracted two million participants at its height, while
the Brazilian uprising in 1984 and 1985 attracted one million, and the
Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia in 1989 attracted 500,000
participants.

"[Numbers]{.underline} really **[matter]{.underline}** for building
power in ways that can really pose a serious challenge or threat to
entrenched authorities or occupations," Chenoweth says --- and
nonviolent protest seems to be the best way to get that widespread
support.

[[Once]{.mark} around **[3.5%]{.mark} of the whole population** has
[begun]{.mark} to participate actively, **[success appears]{.mark} to be
[inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Besides the People Power movement, the Singing Revolution in Estonia and
the Rose Revolution in Georgia all reached the 3.5% threshold

"**[[There weren't any]{.mark} campaigns]{.underline}** [[that had
failed after]{.mark} they had achieved 3.5% participation]{.underline}
during a peak event," says Chenoweth --- a phenomenon she has called the
"3.5% rule". Besides the People Power movement, that included [the
Singing Revolution in Estonia]{.underline} in the late 1980s [and the
Rose Revolution in Georgia]{.underline} in the early 2003.

Chenoweth admits that she was initially surprised by her results. But
she now cites many reasons that nonviolent protests can garner such high
levels of support. Perhaps most obviously, violent protests necessarily
exclude people who abhor and fear bloodshed, whereas [peaceful
protesters maintain the **moral high ground**]{.underline}.

Chenoweth points out that nonviolent protests also have fewer physical
barriers to participation. You do not need to be fit and healthy to
engage in a strike, whereas violent campaigns tend to lean on the
support of physically fit young men. And while many forms of nonviolent
protests also carry serious risks --- just think of China's response in
Tiananmen Square in 1989 --- Chenoweth argues that nonviolent campaigns
are generally easier to discuss openly, which means that news of their
occurrence can reach a wider audience. Violent movements, on the other
hand, require a supply of weapons, and tend to rely on more secretive
underground operations that might struggle to reach the general
population.

By engaging broad support across the population, nonviolent
[[campaigns]{.mark} are also more likely to [win support among the
**police** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the very groups that the
government should be leaning on to bring about order.

During a peaceful street protest of millions of people, the members of
the [security forces may]{.underline} also be more likely to [fear that
their family members or friends are in the **crowd**]{.underline} ---
meaning that [they **fail to crack down**]{.underline} on the movement.
"Or when they're looking at the \[sheer\] numbers of people involved,
they may just come to the conclusion [[the ship has
**sailed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[they **don't want to go
down**]{.mark} **with the ship**]{.underline}," Chenoweth says.

In terms of the specific strategies that are used, general [strikes
"are]{.underline} probably one of the most powerful, if not [the most
powerful]{.underline}, single method of nonviolent resistance",
Chenoweth says. But they do come at a personal cost, whereas other forms
of protest can be completely anonymous. She points to the consumer
boycotts in apartheid-era South Africa, in which many black citizens
refused to buy products from companies with white owners. The result was
an economic crisis among the country's white elite that contributed to
the end of segregation in the early 1990s.

"There are more options for engaging and nonviolent resistance that
don't place people in as much physical danger, particularly as the
numbers grow, compared to armed activity," Chenoweth says. "And the
techniques of nonviolent resistance are often more visible, so that
[it\'s easier for people to find out how to **participate
directly**]{.underline}, and [how to coordinate their activities for
maximum disruption]{.underline}."

fundamentally, and, as a result, so are negotiating sites and modalities
of politics. Instead of doing global governance of the humans and for
the humans, engagement with politics might also entail immersion into
marine communities or thinking with trees. And engagement with "humans"
here too becomes less about modeling negotiations between abstract,
autonomous humans and more about exploring various ways in which
"humans" are made and cut the world around them, and not only as
(abstract, universal) humans but also as "more-than-humans" (porously

The New Monopoly of the International Oligarchic Alliance

Lenin stated in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism that "the
epoch of the latest stage of capitalism shows us that [certain
[relations]{.mark} between capitalist associations **grow up**, [based
on]{.mark} the **[economic division]{.mark} of the world**]{.underline};
while parallel to and in connection with it, [certain relations grow up
[between **political alliances**]{.mark}]{.underline}, between states,
[[on the basis of]{.mark} the **territorial [division]{.mark}** of the
world]{.underline}, of the struggle for colonies, [[of]{.mark} the
"**[struggle for s]{.mark}pheres [o]{.mark}f
[i]{.mark}nfluence**."]{.underline}31 Finance capital and its foreign
policy, which is the struggle of the great powers for the economic and
political division of the world, give rise to a number of transitional
forms of state dependence. Two main groups of countries---those owning
colonies and colonies themselves---are typical of this epoch, as are the
diverse forms of dependent countries that, politically, are formally
independent, but in fact are enmeshed in the net of financial and
diplomatic dependence.32 Nowadays, [[neoimperialism]{.mark} has
[formed]{.mark} **new [alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **hegemonic
relations**]{.underline} in the economic, political, cultural, and
military fields.

Within the context of the new monopoly of the international oligarchs,
[the]{.underline} fourth [characteristic of neoimperialism is the
[formation of a]{.mark}n **international [monopoly]{.mark} capitalist
[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between **one hegemon**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [several other **[great
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [An economic foundation consisting of
**money politics**, **vulgar culture**, and **military** threats has
been formed for them to exploit and oppress via monopoly both at **home
and abroad**.]{.underline}

The G7 as the Mainstay of the Imperial Capitalist Core

Neoimperialism's current international monopoly economic alliance and
the framework of global economic governance are both dominated by the
United States. The G6 group was formed in 1975 by six leading industrial
countries, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan,
and Italy, and became G7 when Canada joined the following year. G7 and
its monopoly organizations are the coordination platforms, while the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade
Organization are the functional bodies. The global order of economic
governance that was set up under the Bretton Woods system after the
Second World War is essentially a high-level international capitalist
monopoly alliance manipulated by the United States to serve its
strategic economic and political interests. In the early 1970s, the U.S.
dollar was decoupled from gold and the Bretton Woods currency system
collapsed. One after another, summits of the G7 countries then
shouldered responsibility for strengthening the Western consensus,
contending against the socialist countries of the East, and boycotting
the demands made by the less developed countries of the South for
reforms to the international economic and political order.33 Since
neoliberalism became the set of concepts dominating global economic
governance, these multilateral institutions and platforms have become
the driving force for the expansion of neoliberalism throughout the
world. In line with the wishes of the international financial monopoly
oligarchy and its allies, these bodies spare no effort to induce the
developing countries to implement financial liberalization, the
privatization of production factors, marketization without prior
supervision, and free exchange in capital projects so as to facilitate
inward and outward flows of international "hot money." These
institutions are constantly ready to control and plunder the economies
of developing countries, extracting huge profits by encouraging
speculation and creating financial bubbles. As Zbigniew Brzezinski
stated in The Grand Chessboard, "the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank can be said to represent 'global' interests, and their
constituency may be construed as the world. In reality, however, they
are heavily American dominated."34

Since the 1980s, the IMF and World Bank have lured developing countries
to implement neoliberal reforms. When these countries have fallen into
crisis because of privatization and financial liberalization, the IMF
and other institutions have forced them to accept the Washington
Consensus by adding various unreasonable conditions to loans provided
earlier. The effect is to further intensify the impacts of neoliberal
reform. Between 1978 and 1992, more than seventy developing countries or
former socialist countries implemented a total of 566 structural
adjustment programs imposed by the IMF and the World Bank.35 In the
early 1980s, for example, the IMF used the Latin American debt crisis to
force Latin American countries to accept neoliberal "reforms." In order
to curb inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1979 pushed short-term
interest rates up from 10 percent to 15 percent, and finally to more
than 20 percent. Because the existing debt of the developing countries
was linked to U.S. interest rates, every 1 percent rise in U.S. interest
rates would result in developing-world debtor countries paying an
additional \$40 to 50 billion per year in interest. In the second half
of 1981, Latin America was borrowing at the rate of \$1 billion a week,
mostly in order to pay the interest on existing debt. During 1983,
interest payments consumed almost half of Latin American export
earnings.36 Under pressure to repay their loans, Latin American
countries were forced to accept neoliberal reform plans initiated by the
IMF. The main content of these plans consisted of privatizing
state-owned enterprises; liberalizing trade finance; implementing
economic austerity policies, with the effect of reducing living
standards; cutting the taxes on monopoly enterprises; and reducing
government spending on social infrastructure. During the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, the IMF attached numerous conditions to assistance
provided to South Korea, including that the allowance for foreign
shareholdings be relaxed from 23 percent to 50 percent, and then to 55
percent by December 1998. Moreover, South Korea was required to allow
foreign banks to set up branches freely.37

NATO and the International Monopoly-Capitalist Military and Political
Alliance

Established in the early days of the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [is an international military
alliance for the defense of **monopoly capitalism**. It is led by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and [involves
**other**]{.mark} **imperialist [countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
During the Cold War, [NATO]{.underline} was the main tool used by the
United States to [actively contain and counter **the Soviet Union and
the countries of Eastern Europe**,]{.underline} as well as to influence
and control the Western European countries. At the end of the Cold War,
the [[Warsaw]{.mark} Treaty Organization was **[dissolved]{.mark}** and
[NATO became the]{.mark} **military [organization]{.mark}** [through
which the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates sought to [achieve
its]{.mark} strategic [goals on a **global level**. A]{.mark}
**capitalist military [oligopoly]{.mark}**, involving one hegemon and
several other great powers, had **[come into
being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Former U.S. secretary of state Warren
Christopher stated: "Only the United States can act as a leader.... [For
the United States to exercise leadership requires us to own a **credible
force threat** as a **backup for diplomacy**]{.underline}."38 The
National Security Strategy for the New Century, published in the United
States in December 1998, claimed unambiguously that the goal of the
United States was to "lead the entire world" and that no challenge to
its leadership, from any country or group of countries, would ever be
allowed to come into being.39 On December 4, 2018, U.S. secretary of
state Mike Pompeo declared in a speech to the Marshall Fund in Brussels:
"[The United States has not given up its global leadership]{.underline}.
It reshaped the order after WWII based on sovereignty but not the
multilateral system.... Under President Trump's leadership, we will not
give up international leadership or our allies in the international
system.... Trump is recovering America's traditional status as the world
center and leadership.... The United States wants to lead the world, now
and always."40

[To achieve leadership and **domination**]{.underline} over the world,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has made **every effort
to promote NATO's eastward expansion**]{.underline}, and has [expanded
its own sphere of influence to control Central and Eastern Europe and to
compress Russia's strategic space]{.underline}. Under the control of the
United States, [[NATO has become an **ideal**]{.mark} **military [tool
for U.S]{.mark}. global [interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In March
1999, a multinational NATO force led by the United States launched a
large-scale air attack on [Yugoslavia]{.underline}. It [was the first
time that NATO had launched a military strike]{.underline} against a
sovereign country during the fifty years since its foundation. In April
1999, NATO held a summit meeting in Washington, formally [adopting a
strategic concept]{.underline} that can be summarized under two points.
First, NATO was [permitted to conduct **collective military
intervention**]{.underline} outside its defense area in response to
"crimes and conflicts involving common interests." This effectively
[changed NATO from a "collective defense" military alliance into an
**offensive political and military organization**]{.underline} with the
so-called purpose of defending common interests and shared values.
Second, NATO's military actions did not require authorization from the
UN Security Council.41

In addition to NATO, U.S. military alliances formed on the basis of
bilateral treaties include pacts with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and
the Philippines. There are U.S. military bases on the territory of all
its military allies, and [these comprise a major part of the
**neoimperialist military alliance**. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} its [[allies make]{.mark}
**military [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and [carry out]{.mark}
**[provocations]{.mark} in many regions** of the world, [resulting
in]{.mark}]{.underline} many "[**hot [wars]{.mark}**," "warm wars,"
"cool wars," and "new cold wars," [intensifying]{.mark} the **new [arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The acts of ["**state terrorism**" carried
out by neoimperialism, and the double standard it applies to
counter-terrorism, have [caused]{.mark} other forms of **[terrorism to
multiply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\(1\) [[There is]{.mark} indeed]{.underline} "[[an **existential
crisis**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [human relation to]{.underline} the
[earth]{.underline}." (1) Over the last 10,000 years planetary
conditions fluctuated within relatively narrow and stable boundaries.
The entire history of settled human civilizations has unfolded in this
"Holocene" period of our planet's life.

This period has now concluded. In a number of areas crucially important
to humanity, these [[boundaries have been]{.underline}]{.mark} (or are
about to be) [[transgressed: **climate**]{.mark} **change**, [ocean
acidification]{.mark}, **stratospheric [ozone depletion]{.mark}**[,
nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, global freshwater use]{.mark}, changes
in land]{.underline} use, [[biodiversity]{.mark} loss, **atmospheric
[aerosol]{.mark} loading**, [and chemical
pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}. (244)

[Human activity is the **main causal factor** explaining
this]{.underline} development, leading earth scientists to refer to the
new period as the "Anthropocene."

The authors of an important study cited by Foster and Clark warn that
[if]{.underline} the upper-range of projections of [global
warming]{.underline} were to occur [it]{.underline} "[would **severely
challenge**]{.underline} the [viability of contemporary human
societies]{.underline}."(1) When we recall how little has been done to
prevent increased global warming, and how y-it is only one of the
numerous planetary transformations imposing comparable risks on human
societies, [talk of]{.underline} an "[existential threat]{.underline}"
[is **fully warranted**]{.underline}.

\(2\) [[There is no]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[tech]{.mark}nological
[fix]{.mark}]{.underline}**" [for this existential crisis]{.underline}.
The more intelligent representatives of capital do not deny that serious
environmental challenges must be faced. For them, however, this is best
done by working with capitalist markets and not against them.

A carbon tax on polluting firms would give companies a strong market
incentive to lower their costs by using technologies requiring fewer
carbon emissions. Having to purchase rights to release carbon into the
atmosphere in carbon markets would supposedly have the same effect, in
their view.

There are also calls for the state to support firms undertaking massive
geoengineering projects, such as sending aerosols into the upper
atmosphere to reflect away the sun's rays before they increase the
planet's surface temperature. Another proposal is to install
technologies capable of extracting and sequestering significant amounts
of carbon from the atmosphere.

As Foster and Clark remind us, technological change in capitalism tends
to develop "greener" technologies without any special spur. Over the
course of the industrial revolution, for example, each succeeding
generation of steam engines became "greener" over time, burning less
coal per unit of output than the one before. The total amount of coal
burned in England increased nonetheless. (245)

This "**[[Jevons paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (named after the
British political economist who first brought it to attention) [[is
**easily explained**: the increase in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [number
of [units produced **overwhelmed** the **reduction**]{.mark} **of coal
use** [per unit]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to more coal being burned
overall.

Is there [any reason to think]{.underline} that introducing
[technologies]{.underline} "[greener]{.underline}" than those employed
today [won't have]{.underline} a similarly [paradoxical
result]{.underline}? [Investors]{.underline} in the stock market, whose
pricing of oil companies' stocks assumes that the last drop of oil in
the ground will be profitably extracted, [do not]{.underline} seem to
[think so]{.underline}. (243-4)

Engineering Disaster

Regarding [[geoengineering]{.mark} projects]{.underline}, Foster and
Clark repeat the warning of many scientists that such [**unprecedented
technological experiments** would]{.underline} almost [[surely have
**pernicious consequences**]{.mark} as harmful as]{.underline} the
[harms they]{.underline} are [supposed to alleviate]{.underline}. (278)

Further, their **[massive [scale]{.mark}]{.underline}** would [[leave
few resources for **other**]{.mark} **social
[needs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An infrastructure capable of handling
annual throughput 70 percent larger than that handled currently by the
global crude oil industry would be required, along with ridiculous
quantities of water --- 130 billion tons annually just to capture and
store U.S. emissions. (280)

[[Far from]{.underline}]{.mark} being [a [step towards
socialism]{.mark}]{.underline} ([as]{.underline} some
**[techno-utopians]{.underline}** of the left [hold]{.underline}),
[government funded [geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} would [**simply
[solidify]{.mark}** an [environmental industrial
complex]{.mark}]{.underline} alongside the military industrial complex,
the pharmaceutical industrial complex, [and]{.underline} other complexes
of [big capital]{.underline}. (281-2)

Finally, once again, climate change is only one way in which present
environmental trends will soon "severely challenge the viability of
contemporary human societies." In all the other cases too the sorts of
[[technologies]{.mark} that have been developed]{.underline}, and the
ways they have been used, have been [[part of the]{.mark} story
of]{.underline} how we got to [the **present**]{.underline}
"**[[existential crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

Unless we figure out why that has been the case and eliminate that
reason, [to think we will be saved by technologies is to **indulge in
fantasy**]{.underline}.

\(3\) [[Capitalism is the]{.mark} **fundamental [cause]{.mark}** of the
existential crisis]{.underline} in the relation between humans and the
earth. All living beings appropriate resources from their environment
and all generate wastes back into their surroundings. [[For a
species]{.mark} to successfully occupy]{.underline} an [environmental
niche, the [rate at which it **depletes resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}
from its ecosystem [[must correspond to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rate
they are **replenished**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [rate it
generates [wastes must be aligned with]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[rate]{.mark} wastes can be processed]{.underline}.

[[When]{.underline}]{.mark} the [social [forms of capitalism are in
place, **neither**]{.mark} **condition [is met]{.mark}**[, creating the
metabolic rift]{.mark} between human society and]{.underline} its
[environment]{.underline}.

Capitalist market societies are distinguished from other societies in
that products generally take the form of commodities sold for a profit.
Any capitalist producers who do not attempt to make as much profit as
possible, as fast as possible, will find themselves losing market share
to those who do, if not forced out of existence altogether.

[[Making as **much**]{.mark} **profit as possible**, [as fast as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, generally means [producing and selling as
many commodities as possible, as fast as possible]{.underline}. This
[**accelerated temporality** [is in tension with the temporality of our
environment; resources]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}tend to be
[[deplete]{.mark}d at a faster rate]{.underline} than [they can be
replenished, and [wastes generate]{.mark}d at]{.underline} a [faster
rate than they can be processed]{.underline}.

From this standpoint the "[[Jevons Paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} less a paradox than [[a]{.mark}]{.underline}
general [[description of]{.mark} how [capitalism]{.mark} works. **Any
[environmental benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline} from technologies [using
fewer]{.underline} natural [resources or generating fewer
wastes]{.underline} per unit of production [necessarily [tend]{.mark}s
[to be **overwhelmed** by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [increase
in]{.underline} the number of [commodities produced in response to
the]{.underline} "[**[Grow or die]{.mark}**!]{.underline}"
[[imperative]{.underline}]{.mark} so [**ruthlessly imposed**
by]{.underline} the [demands of capital accumulation]{.underline}.

From Local to Global Destruction

In the early phases of [capitalist development]{.underline},
environmental destruction was relatively localized. After a handful of
centuries of global expansion, it has [sucked in re­sources from the
natural world and spewed]{.underline} out [wastes on a **global scale**,
creating]{.underline} a [**fundamental rift** in the metabolic
relationship between human beings and]{.underline} the
[earth]{.underline} that is our home.

#### Capitalism is [factually incorrect]{.underline} --- it misreads [foundational human]{.underline} psychology as competitive which replicates the failures of 21^st^ century IR!

A basic truth is once again trying to break through the agony of
worldwide pandemic and the enduring inhumanity of racist oppression.
Healthcare workers risking their lives for others, mutual aid networks
empowering neighbourhoods, farmers delivering food to quarantined
customers, mothers forming lines to protect youth from police violence:
we're in this life together. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} --- young and
old, citizen and immigrant --- [[do best when we
collaborate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, our [[**only way** to survive
is]{.mark} to [have each other's back while
safeguarding]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**resilience** and **diversity**
of [this planet]{.mark}]{.underline} we call home.

As an insight, [it's not new]{.underline}, or surprising.
Anthropologists have long told us that, as a species neither
particularly strong nor fast, [[humans survived because
of]{.underline}]{.mark} our [**unique [ability]{.mark}** [to create and
cooperate]{.mark}]{.underline}. 'All our thriving is mutual' is how the
Indigenous scholar Edgar Villanueva captured the age-old wisdom in his
book Decolonizing Wealth (2018). [What is new is]{.underline} the
[extent to which]{.underline} so [many civic and **corporate
leaders**]{.underline} --- sometimes [entire
[cultures]{.mark}]{.underline} --- have [[lost sight of
our]{.underline}]{.mark} most **[precious [collective
quality]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

This [loss is [rooted]{.mark}]{.underline}, in large part,
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[tragedy of the
private]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- this notion that moved, in short
order, from curious idea to ideology to global economic system. It
[[claimed selfishness]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[greed and private property
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**real [seeds]{.mark}** [of
progress]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, the mistaken concept many readers
have likely heard under the name 'the tragedy of the commons' has its
origins in the **[sophomoric [assumption]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
[[private interest is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**naturally
[predominant]{.mark}** [guide for human action]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
real tragedy, however, lies not in the commons, but in the private. It
is [the private that [produces violence]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[destruction]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Standing on its head thousands of years of cultural wisdom, the idea of
the private variously [[separates]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[exploits and
exhausts]{.underline}]{.mark} those living [[under its **cold**]{.mark}
**operating [logic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[In preindustrial societies]{.underline}, [cooperation represented
**naked necessity** for survival]{.underline}. Yet the realisation that
a **[healthy [whole]{.mark}]{.underline}** is [[larger than its
parts]{.underline}]{.mark} never stopped informing cultures. It embodies
the pillars of Christianity as much as the [[Islamic Golden
Age]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[Enlightenment]{.underline}]{.mark} or
the [[New Deal]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the midst of a global
depression, the US president Franklin D Roosevelt evoked an
'[[industrial covenant]{.underline}]{.mark}' --- a [commitment to living
wages and]{.underline} a [right to work]{.underline} for all. During the
1960s, Martin Luther King, Jr gave voice to the broader idea when he
said that [no one is free until we are all free]{.underline}. On Earth
Day 1970, the US senator Edmund Muskie proclaimed that [the [**only
society** to survive is one that]{.mark}]{.underline} '[[will not
tolerate]{.mark} slums for some and decent houses for
others]{.underline}, ... [[clean air for some and filth for
others]{.underline}]{.mark}'. We should call these ideas what they are
--- central civilisational insights. Social and economic prosperity
depends on the wellbeing of all, not just the few.

[[Cultures that]{.mark} **fundamentally [departed]{.mark}** [from
this]{.mark}]{.underline} awareness usually [[did
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the long run, [[fare
well]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the [[Roman Empire]{.underline}]{.mark}
to [[Nazism]{.underline}]{.mark} or [[Stalinism]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Will [**neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}** be [next]{.mark}]{.underline}?
Rather than acknowledge the endless variety of things that had to be in
place to make our individual accomplishments possible, it is [grounded
in]{.underline} the **[[immature]{.mark} claim]{.underline}** that our
[privileges are]{.underline} '[earned]{.underline}', made possible
primarily by private initiative.

But what a claim it is: [where would we be without the **work** and
**care** of others]{.underline}? [Without]{.underline} the
[food]{.underline} from the farmer? Without the
[electricity]{.underline} and [housing]{.underline} and
[roads]{.underline} and [healthcare]{.underline} and
[education]{.underline} and [access to information]{.underline} and
[hundreds of other things]{.underline} provided to us, day in and day
out, often for free, and routinely without us knowing what went into
their existence? [[Seeing ourselves as]{.underline}]{.mark} seemingly
**[[free-floating]{.mark} individuals]{.underline}**, [it's]{.underline}
both [[**easy** and **convenient** to indulge in]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[delusion]{.mark} that]{.underline} '[I built it]{.underline}. [I
worked for it]{.underline}. [[I earned it]{.underline}]{.mark}.'

The painful flipside are the billions of those who, through no fault of
their own, drew the short end of the stick. Those who were born in the
wrong country, to the wrong parents, in the wrong school district ---
'wrong' for no other reason than that their skin colour or religion or
talents didn't happen to be favoured. The limited focus on the
individual can here be seen as nakedly serving power: if those who have
privilege and wealth presumably earned it, so must those who have pain
and hardship deserve it.

Standard economic thinking both seeds and feeds the underlying fear

Old and young, meanwhile, sense the loss of a cultural heritage that
transcends the private, a purpose beyond the marketing of self. We
likely fear, with good reason, that, in all the self-promotion, we can
no longer rely on others to be there for us, to provide us with
consistent work, a stable community, a bit of love and kindness. We are
scared of climate change, the ultimate consequence of our voracious
consumption. We dread loneliness and depression, too much work, the loss
of jobs, debt. We sense, and often experience, that everyone looking out
for themselves brings out the worst in us --- me against you, one tribe
against the other. Many experience it simply as a culture in distress.

[[Standard economic thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[seeds and
feeds]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**underlying [fear]{.mark}** [by
instructing]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we're all in a race to
compete]{.mark} for limited resources]{.underline}. Most definitions of
mainstream economics are based on some version of Lionel Robbin's 1932
definition as the '[**efficient allocation** of scarce
resources]{.underline}'. The [answer to scarcity]{.underline} coupled
with people's presumed desire for more [is]{.underline}, [of
course]{.underline}: [keep producing stuff]{.underline}. Not
surprisingly, the [guiding star for success]{.underline}, of both
policymakers and economists around the world, [is]{.underline} a crude,
if convenient metric --- [GDP]{.underline} --- that does nothing but
indiscriminately count final output (more stuff), independent of whether
it's good or bad, whether it creates wellbeing or harm, and
notwithstanding that its ongoing growth is unsustainable.

It's **[[circular logic]{.underline}]{.mark}**: (1) [scarcity makes
people have **endless needs**]{.underline}, so the economy needs to
grow; (2) [for the economy to grow]{.underline}, [people need to have
ever more needs]{.underline}. Such thinking dominates the field of
economics, and much of contemporary culture: Man (yes, those ideas
overwhelmingly come from [men]{.underline}) as [the [**endless
optimiser** of self-interest]{.mark}]{.underline}; people reduced to
producers and consumers; [all aspects of life]{.underline} that [go
beyond]{.underline} the **[mere accumulation]{.underline}** of stuff ---
morality, joy, care --- confined to kindergarten, fiction and the
occasional ethics course in high school or college. The result is what
Nicholas Kristof in The New York Times calls a 'moral myopia'
threatening to collapse under a mounting pile of stuff.

Dysfunctions such as [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[racism]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[inequality]{.mark} are
not]{.underline} unrelated and [naturally occurring]{.underline}
features of life. On the contrary, they are [[based on the **fictions**
and **failures** of]{.mark} the]{.underline} '[private]{.underline}'
that later turned into [[systems that]{.mark} **now [govern]{.mark}**
[our lives]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In reality, we collaborate, organise together, show love and solidarity
--- as the Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom documented in her book Governing
the Commons (1990) --- in the process invariably creating common rules
and values that organise communal life. We rely on society, community,
family, day-in and day-out. And yet the tragic disconnect between our
lived reality (however embattled at times) and the dominant ideology,
celebrating 'the private' in textbooks, newspapers and Hollywood movies,
often eludes us. When large [[corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}, run by
people who [[preach]{.mark} the [gospel of the market]{.mark} and
private gain]{.underline}, [need]{.underline} the [public to bail them
out]{.underline}, few in power raise the most obvious question: why do
you need public money to bail you out if you are supposed to be pulling
yourself up by your bootstraps?

A deeper question might be: why should [**wealth** and
**privilege**]{.underline} --- largely [built on]{.underline} the [free
work of nature and]{.underline} the cheap [work of
labourers]{.underline} --- be [rescued]{.underline}, when in trouble,
[by]{.underline} the very [people]{.underline} otherwise
[deemed]{.underline} '[disposable]{.underline}'?

The particular version of the '[private as property]{.underline}' likely
has its origins in the Roman empire. It [comes with]{.underline} the
[notion of **absolute dominion**]{.underline} --- denoting one's right
to have full control over one's property. Initially, such dominion was
exercised by the male head of household, over both things and people ---
or, more precisely, over things, but also over people who, in what was
possibly the first legal power grab in the name of the private, came to
be defined as things (children, slaves).

When George Floyd was killed on 25 May 2020, it put on global display,
once again, that most people --- poor, younger, older, Black, Brown,
non-male --- remain disposable in the regime of private interest. All
too often, they are violated in the scarcely disguised name of private
property, perpetrated by those tasked to defend it, the police. The
mistake of vandals in recent demonstrations, as satirists have pointed
out, was that they didn't loot in the name of private equity firms. Put
differently: in order for the law not to put its boot on your neck, your
theft has to come at white-collar scale and the sanction of power.

The [[tragedy of the private]{.underline}]{.mark}, in short, doesn't
[[come from]{.underline}]{.mark} the private as individual, but from the
private as ownership, as [[control]{.underline}]{.mark} over land,
resources and others. [To own]{.underline} was always [[less about
protection]{.underline}]{.mark} of the self [[than]{.underline}]{.mark}
it was [about [exclusion of others]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, it is
a logical violation of the 'other self' or, really, other selves. You
against me --- **[[your gain as my loss]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Over generations, open theft of common heritage became disguised as
private property

To illustrate: [[no]{.mark} single [event]{.mark}]{.underline}, short of
war, [[created as much misery]{.underline}]{.mark} in a country like
England [[as when]{.mark} those]{.underline} with access to violence
(arms, laws, wealth) [[**privatised** and **fenced**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the [land]{.underline} that people needed to stay alive.
It came to be known as 'enclosure of the commons' but [represented a
largescale and bloody theft]{.underline}, [allowing]{.underline} a [tiny
percentage of people to exclude the majority]{.underline} from access to
a common heritage. The [[result]{.underline}]{.mark} has since [been
[naturalised and replicated the world]{.mark}]{.underline} over [and
[**sanctified in law** as]{.mark}]{.underline} 'the [[rights of private
property]{.underline}]{.mark}'.

No bodies were ever more violated than those brutalised as slaves or
serfs, all in the name of profit and --- as authors such as Kidada
Williams have documented in painstaking detail --- sanctified by a
vicious regime of private property. Racism, as thinkers from C L R James
to Angela Davis to Barbara and Karen Fields remind us, is an essential
building block to the system of private capital.

No form of governance, social or economic, has plundered the resources
provided by nature as much as private property (though the state
ownership of communism came close).

No single circumstance undermines political rights and freedoms today
more than poverty --- the violent exclusion from essential human rights:
access to work, income, vital resources.

The [private]{.underline} as dominion over property thus [inevitably
violates]{.underline} the private as [personal integrity and
freedom]{.underline}. [Humans become objects]{.underline} --- my slave,
my worker, my child --- and are [denied access to]{.underline} the
[essentials of life]{.underline}. Thus deprived of independence, the
[private reduces]{.underline} the [freedom of the majority]{.underline},
all those without access to sufficient capital, [to]{.underline} the
[narrow choices]{.underline} provided [by the marketplace]{.underline}
in service of private property --- they are, in Amartya Sen's words,
effectively denied 'the capability to realise one's full potential as a
human being'.

Over generations, open theft of common heritage became disguised as
private property, hiding behind legal contracts and the cold fiction of
money as wealth. One gets used to customs, this history suggests, even
when they defy rational thought. The original freedom fighters against
the enclosure of common land, groups such as 'the Diggers', were
remarkably less mystified than their modern compatriots: no one is free,
they declared in 1649, 'till the Poor ... have a free allowance to dig
and labour the Commons'. Thomas Jefferson (the freedom fighter, not the
slaveholder) would've understood the logic --- as would've Toussaint
L'Ouverture or Nelson Mandela.

Legally 'set free' to sell their labour power, the landless were instead
reduced to a state of abject poverty where they became the unwilling
'masses' populating the satanic mills of early industrialisation ---
freedom as a choice between misery or death.

The excuse for the ruthlessness of the exclusion and exploitation of
others in the name of private interest was always the same: the prospect
of a better future for all. Today, we should ask: has it succeeded? It
is a question far more difficult to answer than modern apologists such
as Steven Pinker would have us believe. Yes, by any available measure,
capitalism (based on private interest) has generated unprecedented
wealth and knowledge.

This [[explosive]{.underline}]{.mark} creation of
[[wealth]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, came, and continues to
[come]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} a [[steep]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [[exponentially rising]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[price]{.underline}]{.mark}. Powered by [[fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is both [depleting and
[burning]{.mark}]{.underline} up [the [planet]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Grounded in extraction and exploitation, [[capitalist progress carries
**mounting**]{.mark} **violence** and [destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}
in its wake. The flipside of civilisation, in Walter Benjamin's words,
appears to be 'a document of barbarism'. Growth, expansion, development
--- the struggle to conquer scarcity both gave and took in large measure
from those who populated our land. Perhaps it's finally time to
recognise the carnage that created the wealth.

At first, modern economies succeeded in providing more calories to a
starving patient. Based on this initial success, the economics
profession (no doubt based on sophisticated mathematical models)
concluded that more calories will forever improve health. Now dealing
with a lethally obese patient, our leaders and economic advisors
stubbornly resist acknowledging the obvious question: if we continue on
an exponentially increasing regimen of calories, won't we incapacitate,
if not kill, the patient --- ourselves?

Much has been said about how the incessant race for more, bigger, faster
has also led to a crisis of meaning and purpose, what King, Jr called a
widening 'spiritual death' of living in a 'thing-oriented' rather than
'a person-oriented society', or what D H Lawrence simply labelled 'the
Mammon of mechanised greed'.

But whether the death is one of spirit or meaning, or the actual death
of nature and people, all spring from a common root: the single story of
self-interest, and its logical manifestation, the private. 'We do not
have to escape from the Earth,' as the environmental activist Vandana
Shiva exhorts us in Oneness vs the 1% (2019), 'we have to escape from
the illusions that enslave our minds ...'

We produce and grow enough for every child, woman and man to have a good
and dignified life wherever they live

We live in a different world now. Whatever might have been justified in
the past to overcome poverty and scarcity no longer holds sway. Today,
we face an entirely different challenge. Not too little, but too much.
Not scarcity, but abundance.

In the modern world, more is actually less. Indeed, the [costs of
economic growth]{.underline} have begun [to outpace their
benefits]{.underline}, [visible]{.underline} in the [plunder of the
environment]{.underline} and [escalating inequality]{.underline}. We no
longer need more, but rather better and more fairly distributed, in
order to provide prosperity for all. Collectively, we produce and grow
enough for every child, woman and man to have a good and dignified life
wherever they live. As a world community, we know more and create more
than we know how to process. It's a huge accomplishment.
[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} should celebrate and enjoy it together, rather
than [[remain on the]{.mark} **deplorable [path]{.mark}** [of pitting
**one against the other** in the race]{.mark} for ever
more]{.underline}, one dying of too much, the other of too little.

And yet, our dominant economic systems continue to follow colonial
extraction and brutal exclusion, in the process creating two organically
related, existential problems: the perpetuation (and in some cases
intensification) of poverty, and the violation of the biophysical limits
of our planet. What a tragic irony that, in the early 21st century,
higher education's economics departments worldwide still instruct some
of our brightest minds in simplistic economic models about the efficient
allocation of scarce resources, rather than in how to sustainably build
the good life based on an abundance of knowledge and resources.

To emphasise: [[chasing the **bogeyman of
scarcity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we are]{.underline}]{.mark}, by now,
in the process of [[passing]{.mark} some **frightening [historic
thresholds]{.mark}**]{.underline}, altering the very makeup of life
[[and creating an **unsustainable future**]{.underline}]{.mark} for our
children and grandchildren. It's Barbarism 3.0.

John Molyneux and Owen McCormack: [Given the extreme summer weather and
the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, just how
bad are things now?]{.underline} What do you believe the [time scale is
for catastrophe and what do you think that catastrophe will look
like?]{.underline} Are things worse than the IPCC report claims? Some,
including Michael Mann, have warned against "doomsday scenarios" that
might deter people from acting. In your view, are doomsday scenarios the
truth that needs to be told?

John Bellamy Foster: [We should of course avoid promoting "doomsday
scenarios" in the sense of offering a fatalistic worldview]{.underline}.
In fact, [the environmental movement in general and ecosocialism in
particular are all about combating the current trend toward ecological
destruction]{.underline}. As UN general secretary António Guterres
recently declared with respect to climate change, [[it is now "**code
red for humanity**]{.mark}." This is not a doomsday forecast but a call
to action.]{.underline}

Still, the [word [catastrophe is scarcely adequate in the]{.mark}
present [age of catastrophe capitalism]{.mark}. [Catastrophes]{.mark}
are now ubiquitous, since [extending to the scale of the planet
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are experiencing [throughout the
globe]{.underline} a series of [[extreme weather]{.mark}
events]{.underline} due in large part to climate change, each of which
[[rank as "catastrophic]{.mark}"]{.underline} by historical precedents,
[sometimes lying [outside the range of]{.mark} what was
[previously]{.mark} **thought to be physically
[possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The extreme conditions experienced
this summer in the Northern Hemisphere---including [[floods]{.mark} in
Europe; [Hurricane]{.mark} Ida in the United States]{.underline}, which
not only devastated New Orleans, but also ended up killing people in
floods in New York and New Jersey; and the worsening [[drought]{.mark}
and [wildfires]{.mark} in California and the entire Pacific Coast of the
United States---clearly **[represent something qualitatively
new.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The latest report of the [IPCC]{.mark}]{.underline}, its Sixth
Assessment Report: The Physical Science Basis, [[explains]{.mark} that
the various [climatic]{.mark} and extreme [weather events]{.mark} will
tend to [compound]{.mark}, as [in]{.mark} the case of
**[droughts]{.mark}**, desertification (**[dustbowlification), soil
erosion, wildfires, and weakening monsoons]{.mark}**, on the one hand,
and a melting cryosphere, **[sea level rise, megastorms, and
flooding]{.mark}**, on the other]{.underline}---thereby intensifying and
[[extending these]{.mark} catastrophic events]{.underline}, which will
appear to come from **[[everywhere at once]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Moreover, the human consequences go deeper with temperature increases
[[diminishing]{.mark} world [grain production]{.mark} and putting
[strains on the **world food supply**]{.mark}]{.underline}; climate
change contributing, along with the [[destruction of]{.mark} ecosystems
by [agribusiness]{.mark}, to the emergence of [novel zoonoses]{.mark},
such as COVID-19]{.underline} (along with numerous other health
hazards); whole populations in cities throughout the planet exposed to
unprecedented flooding; the prospect of [[climate
refugees]{.underline}]{.mark} running into the hundreds of millions; and
numerous other equally dire consequences, imposed on present and future
generations.

[The IPCC]{.underline}, which has a record of scientific reticence,
[tells us that we will see [in the next]{.mark} couple of
[decades]{.mark}]{.underline}, and indeed throughout this century,
[[growing cataclysms]{.mark} and a shift toward an Earth System that is
increasingly unsafe for humanity, even in the most optimistic
scenarios]{.underline}. Thus, **[in [the most "rosy"
scenario]{.mark}]{.underline}** provided by the IPCC (SSP1-1.9)---the
only one of its scenarios where the increase in average global
temperature at the end of the twenty-first century is projected to be
below 1.5°C---[the best that can be hoped for]{.underline} is a
situation where a [[1.5°C]{.underline}]{.mark} increase is staved off
[until **2040**]{.underline} and global temperatures only increase by a
tenth of a degree after that, so that by the end of the century or the
beginning of the next century the increase in global average temperature
over preindustrial levels can be reduced to 1.4°C, removing humanity
from the extreme danger zone. The point is that [even in [the most
optimistic scenario]{.mark}---which would [require a global ecological
revolution]{.mark} on the part of humanity in order to be
achieved]{.underline}, leading to carbon emissions peaking halfway
through this decade and net zero emissions being achieved by 2050---the
overall climate catastrophe facing humanity [will be **extremely
dire**]{.underline}**.**

The [[second]{.mark} most optimistic [scenario]{.mark}]{.underline} is
one of staying [below a 2°C increase]{.underline} (somewhere around
1.7°C). [It too would [require a global ecological
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[other three scenarios]{.mark}
offered by the IPCC are basically unthinkable, for which the word
**[apocalyptic]{.mark}** is appropriate]{.underline}. In fact, [we are
currently headed toward the [IPCC's]{.mark} most apocalyptic
scenario]{.underline} (SSP5-8.5), in [which]{.underline} global average
temperatures this century would, [in the "[best estimate]{.mark}," rise
by 4.4°C]{.underline}, which would, according to current scientific
assessments, [mean the [collapse of]{.mark} industrial [civilization,
**raising questions of human survival**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an
ominous statement leaked from Part II of the Sixth Assessment Report, on
"Impacts," which will not be published until February, the IPCC says
that if humanity is driven into extinction during the "[[sixth
extinction]{.mark}" arising from **anthropogenic causes**, [evolution
will **not bring the human species back**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The trouble is that [if we go [beyond]{.mark} a [1.5°C]{.mark}
increase]{.underline}, and especially beyond a 2°C increase, more and
more climate feedback mechanisms, such as the **[[loss of arctic
ice]{.underline}]{.mark}** and thus the [[weakening]{.mark} of the
**[albedo effect]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the earth's reflectivity), the
[**release of [methane and carbon dioxide]{.mark}** from the **melting
tundra**, the [burning of the Amazon]{.mark}, and the [**degradation of
the ocean** as]{.mark} a [climate sink]{.mark} will compound the climate
problem and [create an **irreversible situation**]{.mark}, increasing
the possibility of **[runaway climate change]{.mark}** that would in
effect feed on itself, to the extent that the very existence of humanity
would be in question.]{.underline}

[**[There is still a possibility]{.mark}** of avoiding absolutely
catastrophic climate change on the level that would threaten human
existence altogether]{.underline}. But [to accomplish this would
[require]{.mark} revolutionary [changes in social relations]{.mark}, as
well as in [technology and ways of living]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a
revolution would **[need to [begin within the capitalist system]{.mark}
but would [lead beyond capital]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[There is no
other way]{.underline}**. As Karl Marx indicated, **[the [struggle
against capitalism]{.mark} is not simply about human freedom, it
[is]{.mark} also [about human survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[**Imperialism** and **war** go **hand in hand**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
According to the Canada-based Centre for Global Research [[the
US]{.mark} has [killed]{.mark} **more than [20 million]{.mark}**
[people]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in **thirty-seven nations**]{.mark} since
World War II]{.underline}. [It has engaged [in **188 conflicts**]{.mark}
between **1992** and **2017** alone]{.underline}.

[[Wars mean **big profits**]{.mark} [for the **military industrial
complex**]{.mark}. [They]{.mark} also [provide the basis
for]{.mark}]{.underline} regime change, **[new
[markets]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [access to **[cheap
labour]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[forcible acquisition of
**resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or
**counter-revolution**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[In the past twenty years alone, [the US has spent]{.mark}]{.underline}
US\$**[[21 trillion]{.underline}]{.mark}** (AU\$28 trillion)
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign and domestic
**[[militarisation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The human cost was and
continues to be enormous.]{.underline} The number of people directly
killed is over 900,000, and several times that indirectly [due to
war-induced **famine**, **disease**, **blockades**, and **infrastructure
destruction**]{.underline}.

During the same period [wars have forcibly displaced **thirty-eight
million** people]{.underline}, principally in and [from Afghanistan,
Iraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, the Philippines, Libya, and
Syria]{.underline}. (Watson Institute, Brown University)

[[The military]{.mark} industrial complex [requires **never-ending**
wars to sustain its]{.mark} **unquenchable [appetite]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} **[mega-profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Australia's
purchase of nuclear-powered submarines and missiles is part of the
country's emerging role as a merchant of death with its establishment as
a manufacturer and supplier of weapons of mass destruction.

In the case of the US and Australia, the dangerous conflict with China
brings out contradictions within the ruling class; for those sections
whose profits depend on Chinese trade and investments and those who
stand to benefit from the massive gains from the build-up to war. There
are other capitalists who see China as providing an opportunity for
massive investments and accumulation of capital following regime change,
a reflection of the broader counter-revolutionary tactics led by US
imperialism.

[[The US is an **imperialist** power in
**decline**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Its]{.mark} massive
[expenditure]{.mark} on wars [is taking its **toll**]{.mark}: [such
expenditure is **unsustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It faces an
**economic** crisis]{.mark} as a result of which its only means of
asserting global hegemony is through war]{.underline}.

INTERNATIONAL REALIGNMENT

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries up to the Second World
War, Britain, Spain, Belgium, France, and Holland exploited the people
and resources of their colonial possessions on the African, American,
Asian and Pacific continents. Inter-imperialist wars resulted in changes
in colonisers as these wealthy European nations attempted to expand
their empires.

At the end of, and in the decades following the Second World War,
national liberation movements saw India, Indonesia, Philippines, South
Africa, Cuba, and China gain their independence. Britain, in particular,
saw its once vast empire crumble. As the British empire was in decline,
the US was on the rise in pursuit of global hegemony.

Capitalism with its global reach was threatened by socialist revolutions
in Russia (1917), East Europe (1945), China (1949), and in Cuba (1959).
These revolutions posed an ideological threat to imperialism as the
working class took power, their people made gains, and their socialist
governments pursued peace. A bipolar world emerged with two
"superpowers" --- imperialist US and the socialist Soviet Union.
Following the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US saw itself as
dominant in a unipolar world.

As the US continues to assert itself around the globe, there are other
emerging forces that also seek to play an independent or leading role in
a multi-polar world. [The concept of a unipolar world, with one
imperialist power at the helm is being **challenged**]{.underline}. In
addition, the People's Republic of China, with its rapid economic,
social, and military development is perceived as a threat by US
imperialism.

[While the US has spent **trillions of dollars** on the
military]{.underline}, at the expense of its people's needs, [China has
lifted **hundreds of millions** of its people out of
poverty]{.underline}. Today [[China]{.mark} is the world['s]{.mark}
second largest [economy set to overtake the US]{.mark} **with[in a
decade]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Shifting and at times contradictory alliances mark the realignment of
international forces that is underway.

"GLOBAL BRITAIN"

Britain, once a global power with a vast empire spanning continents, is
now in a war coalition aimed at China. AUKUS signals the UK's shift to
an increased participation in the Asia-Pacific as a junior partner to
the US, and Australia as the launching pad for this strategy. The UK is
a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance with the US,
Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

In 2020, the British government released the report, Global Britain in a
Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development
and Foreign Policy. In the introduction to the report, conservative
Prime Minister Boris Johnson states:

"By 2030, we will be deeply engaged in the Indo-Pacific as the European
partner with the broadest, most integrated presence in support of
mutually beneficial trade, shared security and values. We will be active
in Africa, in particular East Africa and with important partners such as
Nigeria. And we will have thriving relationships in the Middle East and
the \[Persian\] Gulf based on trade, green innovation and science and
technology collaboration in support of a more resilient region that is
increasingly self-reliant in providing for its own security."

He continues: "We will remain a nuclear armed power with global reach
and integrated military capabilities across all five operational
domains. Our diplomacy will be underwritten by the credibility of our
deterrent and our ability to project power." (Emphasis added)

Military spending will be increased. The UK is already second only to
the US in military spending in NATO.

The report also refers to "China's increasing international
assertiveness and the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific; systemic
competition, including between states, and between democratic and
authoritarian values and systems of government."

"Russia will remain the most acute direct threat to the UK, and the US
will continue to ask more from its allies in Europe in sharing the
burden of collective security," the report states.

Australia is also sharing the burden of US war plans with the purchase
of nuclear submarines, long-range missiles and other materiel and a
massive hike in military spending. The report does not shy away from the
fact the UK is preparing for war.

EUROPE AND US RELATIONS

It is too soon to estimate what impact the departure of Chancellor
Angela Merkel will have on Germany's relations with the US. France's
President Macron has called for the formation of a European army, which
could have consequences for NATO and the US. France and Germany are the
most powerful countries in Europe.

A number of European countries have defied the US's bans on trade with
Russia and have also signed up to China's Belt and Road Initiative in
defiance of the US.

Nuclear-armed India, under the leadership of the reactionary Narendra
Modi government, has been drawn into US war plans, and has held joint
military exercises with the US and other countries in the Asia-Pacific
region, including Australia.

CHINA'S STAND

The US's targeting of China and Russia and attempts to contain both
countries are drawing them closer together. They recently held joint
military exercises on Chinese territory with unprecedented cooperation.
China has repeatedly made its position clear. It was Australia that
decided to abandon previously friendly relations with China by
discriminating against Chinese investment and meddling in China's
internal affairs.

"There is no way for China to develop economic ties with a country that
treats it as an enemy," said the Global Times newspaper. "There is no
path to future prosperity for an Australia which chooses to isolate
itself from the region's largest economy." (Global Times, 16th September
2021)

At the recent UN General Assembly, [China's President [Xi]{.mark}
Jinping **[pledged]{.mark}** that [his country would **never**]{.mark}
seek hegemony by [attack]{.mark}ing [other
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. He emphasised that [[China
was]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[a builder]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **world
[peace]{.mark}**, a contributor to **global development**, [defender of
the **international order**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and provider of
**public goods**]{.underline}."

[The United States has around **800 military bases** globally with
around half of them **at the borders** of China or Russia]{.underline}.

NO WINNERS

[[The US]{.mark} has by far the largest nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline} of any country. According to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) [it
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} an estimated [**5,550** nuclear
weapons]{.underline} --- [[enough to **destroy humanity many times
over**]{.mark}. It is constantly **modernising** its
arsenal]{.underline}.

The AUKUS agreement provides for the sharing of nuclear submarine
technology with Australia and paves the way for the establishment of a
nuclear industry here and the development of nuclear weapons contrary to
the international Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. It
should be noted that Australia is not a signatory.

[There would be **no winners** in a nuclear war]{.underline}.

[The [**provocative actions** of]{.mark} the US and its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, including Australia's in the Taiwan
Straits and South and East China Seas [[pose a]{.mark} **serious
[risk]{.mark}** [of escalating into war]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
regular joint military exercises conducted by the US and South Korea off
the coast of North Korea with live weapons are a further provocation.

[The world faces numerous crises including **climate change** and the
**global pandemic**]{.underline}. At the same time [the US is
**preparing for war** with the aim of enforcing a unipolar world with
itself at the helm. It seeks to **overthrow** China's socialist system,
by war if necessary]{.underline}, and to defeat it economically.

ACT NOW!

[The people]{.underline} of Australia and the Asia-Pacific region [want
**peace** and **stability**]{.underline}. The Quad and AUKUS [**military
[alliances]{.mark}** [are a catalyst for]{.mark} a **new [arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} are preparations for
**[nuclear war]{.mark}**, against China]{.underline}.

**[Say NO to war]{.underline}**! Cancel AUKUS! Disband the Quad! No
Nuclear Australia! Time for Action!

#### Hegemony is [unsustainable]{.underline}. America's capitalist imperialism makes nuclear war [inevitable]{.underline}. Only the alternative solves.

[Nuclear weapons early on became **entwined**]{.underline} [with the
pursuit of **US imperial policy**]{.underline} and remain there. US
presidents have routinely expressed moral abhorrence of nuclear weapons
privately. Eisenhower told a naval aide that "overkill . . .
frighten\[ed\] the devil out of me"; Kennedy muttered to Dean Rusk, "and
we call ourselves the human race" after a particularly nightmarish
briefing; and Reagan even agreed with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in
1985 that, "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."
However, they never publicly renounced the "all-out" option or stopped
planning for it. None said "A nuclear war must never be threatened, or
prepared for." [Such preparation continued because nuclear weapons
became **central** to imperialism]{.underline} from the mid-twentieth
century onwards. That [they]{.underline} "[continuously benefitted our
**military-industrial-congressional complex**]{.underline}" (Ellsberg
2017, 271, 324), not to mention a declining US economy ever more reliant
on it, also helped.

Since US imperial policy predated the Cold War and survived it, [the
world did not march toward liberal capitalist prosperity under benign US
"hegemony]{.underline}" with a peace dividend in its bank account after
the Cold War. [Rather, it entered an increasingly tense space bounded by
growing **pluripolarity** thanks to US economic decline and rapid growth
in **China**]{.underline} [and some developing countries]{.underline}
and increasing US military aggression in response. [Beginning by
**bombing** retreating soldiers and **civilians**]{.underline} in
violation of international law and the Soviet-brokered peace in the Gulf
war (Hudson 2018, 158--159; citing the Committee to Stop War in the
Gulf), [the US went on to wage a string of **illegal wars** in
**Yugoslavia**, **Afghanistan**, **Iraq**, **Libya** and
**Syria**]{.underline} and hybrid wars against other countries that
sought autonomous forms of development unsuited to the interests of US
and Western corporations. Today, [this aggression has culminated in the
**New Cold Wars**]{.underline} [against Russia and China and has set off
a new **nuclear arms race**]{.underline} [even as declining US
capacities become clear in **Afghanistan** and]{.underline} are about to
become clear once again in the hybrid war against Russia over
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**.

It is, therefore, difficult to overstate the dangers of the current
situation. In the original Cold War, the US and the USSR were
comparatively stable and prosperous countries. Today [US economic
decline appears **unstoppable**]{.underline} [and its drive to
compensate for it militarily can only be more and more **volatile** and
**unstable**]{.underline}, as the ignominious drawdown from Afghanistan
and impending debacle over Ukraine show. In recent years, [the US has
also lost its historic technological lead]{.underline} as Russian and
Chinese military modernisation programmes develop hypersonic missiles,
some capable of delivering bombs at 27 times the speed of sound and
evading US anti-ballistic missile systems (The Economist 2020; The
Guardian 2019). On the other hand, [China]{.underline}, though
considerably less prosperous (per capita US GDP remains over 5 times
higher than China's), [is vastly more stable]{.underline}. [It is also
on the rise, increasingly influential over]{.underline} more and more
[US victims and]{.underline} even [allies]{.underline} and determined to
ensure its own defence and aid allies amid ever-louder US
sabre-rattling. This only unsettles the US more. [The
**pandemic**]{.underline} and the war over Ukraine have only
[exacerbated this divergence, with the US's **shambolic** and
**economically destructive** responses and deepening economic and
**political disarray** contrasting ever more sharply with China's
competence]{.underline}, resumption of economic growth and adherence to
international norms making it a far superior model and partner to other
countries (Desai 2020b). For the first time in the history of
capitalism, a non-capitalist country will be the leading state in the
world, powering its growth and increasingly providing leadership (Desai
2020a, 2020b, 2020c).

[The economically declining US is **losing influence** in strategically
important zones such as the **Middle East**, the **S**outh **C**hina
**S**ea, **South Asia**, the **Korea**n Peninsula and]{.underline} even
[**Central** and **Latin America**.]{.underline} [It is also eroding
the]{.underline} relative post-war [**unity** of the core capitalist
powers]{.underline} and reducing US and Western capacity for domination.
With Iran and Russia, for instance, Continental Western European
countries wish to take a more cooperative stance than the US. [Japan and
South Korea as well as the European Union]{.underline} (EU) [have
recently concluded important trade and **investment treaties** with
China]{.underline} much to US chagrin. Moreover, while [other core
capitalist powers are increasingly **acting independently**]{.underline}
to subordinate certain parts of the Third World---such as Canada in
Latin America and France in Africa---their options are narrower as
productive power spreads and they face rival powers. Finally, [with
China's superior **economic performance** increasing its attractiveness
as a **model** and **partner**]{.underline} for other countries and
continuing US economic decline forcing the US to operate with ever fewer
economic carrots and ever more military and financial sticks, [more and
more countries will be able and willing to defy the US and its
**corporations**]{.underline}. [The dangers of not accepting the
**peaceful co-existence** of pluripolarity can only grow.]{.underline}

[The threat of nuclear weapons will only fade]{.underline}, and a true
dawn of nuclear arms control and elimination will only lighten the
horizon, [if one or both of two possibilities are realised]{.underline}.
[Either]{.underline} [**transformation** in US politics leads the US to
forsake]{.underline}, [or the diminution of its power]{.underline} on
the world stage [forces it to relinquish]{.underline}, [its obsession
for exercising an **impossible domination** over the ever more
**pluripolar world** and for keeping it capitalist against the
**currents of history**]{.underline}. In effect, the real question is
whether the US, and the West, are willing to accept with equanimity, if
not enthusiasm, the co-existence of different socio-economic systems,
that is, the world's growing pluripolarity. Will the ongoing turmoil in
US politics, of which Trump and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations
were both equal and opposite symptoms, issue in a political force
capable of giving up that drive for world primacy based on a more
realistic assessment of US interests and capabilities, not to mention a
commitment to popular rather than corporate well-being? Will the
acceleration of US relative decline amid the pandemic administer a dose
of geopolitical economic reality to US leaders? Can secondary capitalist
powers, such as Germany and Japan, ally with those that have acquired
nuclear weapons defensively, chiefly China, and NNWSs, to demand that
the weapon states adopt serious disarmament measures--- above all the US
but also Israel? Equally importantly, can a popular movement for
disarmament arise with a sophisticated understanding of the real drivers
of the nuclear arms race, those rooted in capitalist imperialism and the
US drive for domination? These are the questions we are left with.

### ! --- Cognitive Warfare

#### The brain is the battlefield of the [21^st^ century]{.underline} --- social engineering makes you cognitively primed to [unquestionably]{.underline} accept NATO decision-making.

[NATO]{.underline} is [developing **new forms of warfare** to
wage]{.underline} a "**[battle for the brain]{.underline}**," as the
military alliance put it.

The [US-led **NATO military cartel**]{.underline} has [tested novel
modes of **hybrid warfare** against its self-declared
adversaries]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} economic warfare,
cyber warfare, [information warfare]{.underline}, [and psychological
warfare]{.underline}.

Now, [NATO]{.underline} is [spinning out an **entirely new kind** of
combat]{.underline} it has branded cognitive warfare. Described as the
"[weaponization of **brain sciences**]{.underline}," the new method
involves "[hacking the individual]{.underline}" [by
exploiting]{.underline} "the [**vulnerabilities** of the human
brain]{.underline}" in order [to implement]{.underline} more
sophisticated "[social engineering]{.underline}."

Until recently, NATO had divided war into five different operational
domains: air, land, sea, space, and cyber. But with its development of
cognitive warfare strategies, the military alliance is discussing a new,
sixth level: the "human domain."

A 2020 NATO-sponsored study of this new form of warfare clearly
explained,

While actions taken in the five domains are executed in order to have an
effect on the human domain, [cognitive warfare's objective]{.underline}
is to [make **everyone a weapon**]{.underline}.

"The [brain will be the battlefield of the **21st
century**]{.underline}," the report stressed. "[Humans are the
**contested domain**]{.underline}," and "[future conflicts]{.underline}
will likely [occur amongst]{.underline} the [people **digitally
first**]{.underline} and physically thereafter in proximity to hubs of
political and economic power."

While the NATO-backed study insisted that much of its research on
cognitive warfare is designed for defensive purposes, it also conceded
that the military alliance is developing offensive tactics, stating,

The human is very often the main vulnerability and it should be
acknowledged in order to protect NATO's human capital but also to be
able to benefit from our adversaries's vulnerabilities.

In a chilling disclosure, the report said explicitly that "the
[objective of Cognitive Warfare is to **harm societies**]{.underline}
and not only the military."

With entire civilian populations in [NATO's]{.underline} crosshairs, the
report emphasized that Western militaries must [**work more closely**
with academia to weaponize social sciences and human sciences and help
the alliance develop]{.underline} its **[cognitive warfare
capacities]{.underline}**.

The study described this phenomenon as "the militarization of brain
science." But it appears clear that [NATO's development of cognitive
warfare]{.underline} will [lead to a **militarization** of **all aspects
of human**]{.underline} society and [psychology]{.underline}, from the
most intimate of social relationships [to the **mind
itself**]{.underline}.

Such all-encompassing militarization of society is reflected in the
paranoid tone of the NATO-sponsored report, which warned of "an embedded
fifth column, where everyone, unbeknownst to him or her \[themselves\],
is behaving according to the plans of one of our competitors." The study
makes it clear that those "competitors" purportedly exploiting the
consciousness of Western dissidents are China and Russia.

In other words, this document shows that figures in the NATO military
cartel increasingly see their own domestic population as a threat,
fearing civilians to be potential Chinese or Russian sleeper cells,
dastardly "fifth columns" that challenge the stability of "Western
liberal democracies."

[NATO's]{.underline} development of [novel forms of **hybrid warfare**
come at a time when member states]{.underline}' [military
campaigns]{.underline} are [targeting **domestic populations**
on]{.underline} an [unprecedented level]{.underline}.

The Ottawa Citizen reported this September that the Canadian military's
Joint Operations Command took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to
[wage an information war against its **own domestic
population**]{.underline}, [testing out **propaganda tactics**
on]{.underline} Canadian [civilians]{.underline}.

Internal NATO-sponsored reports suggest that [**this disclosure** is
just **scratching the surface** of]{.underline} a wave of new
unconventional [warfare techniques]{.underline} that [Western militaries
are employing **around the world**]{.underline}.

Canada hosts 'NATO Innovation Challenge' on cognitive warfare

Twice each year, NATO holds a "pitch-style event" that it brand as an
"Innovation Challenge." These campaigns--one hosted in the Spring and
the other in the Fall, by alternating member states --- call on private
companies, organizations, and researchers to help develop new tactics
and technologies for the military alliance.

The shark tank-like challenges reflect the predominant influence of
neoliberal ideology within NATO, as participants mobilize the free
market, public-private partnerships, and the promise of cash prizes to
advance the agenda of the military-industrial complex.

NATO's Fall 2021 Innovation Challenge is hosted by Canada, and is titled
"The invisible threat: Tools for countering cognitive warfare."

"**[Cognitive warfare seeks to change not only what people think, but
also how they act]{.underline}**," the Canadian government wrote in its
official statement on the challenge.

Attacks against the cognitive domain involve the integration of cyber,
disinformation/misinformation, psychological, and social-engineering
capabilities.

Ottawa's press release continued:

[Cognitive warfare]{.underline} positions the mind as a battle space and
contested domain. Its objective is to [sow dissonance]{.underline},
[instigate conflicting narratives]{.underline}, [polarize
opinion]{.underline}, [and **radicalize groups**]{.underline}. Cognitive
warfare can [motivate people to act in ways that]{.underline} can
disrupt or [fragment an **otherwise cohesive society**]{.underline}.

NATO-backed Canadian military officials discuss cognitive warfare in
panel event

An advocacy group called the NATO Association of Canada has mobilized to
support this Innovation Challenge, working closely with military
contractors to attract the private sector to invest in further research
on behalf of NATO --- nd its own bottom line.

While the NATO Association of Canada (NAOC) is technically an
independent NGO, its mission is to promote NATO, and the organization
boasts on its website,

The NAOC has strong ties with the Government of Canada including Global
Affairs Canada and the Department of National Defence.

As part of its efforts to promote Canada's NATO Innovation Challenge,
the NAOC held a panel discussion on cognitive warfare on October 5.

The researcher who wrote the definitive 2020 NATO-sponsored study on
cognitive warfare, François du Cluzel, participated in the event,
alongside NATO-backed Canadian military officers.

The panel was overseen by Robert Baines, president of the NATO
Association of Canada. It was moderated by Garrick Ngai, a marketing
executive in the weapons industry who serves as an adviser to the
Canadian Department of National Defense and vice president and director
of the NAOC.

Baines opened the event noting that participants would discuss
"cognitive warfare and new domain of competition, where state and
non-state actors aim to influence what people think and how they act."

The NAOC president also happily noted the lucrative "opportunities for
Canadian companies" that this NATO Innovation Challenge promised.

NATO researcher describes cognitive warfare as 'ways of harming the
brain'

The October 5 panel kicked off with François du Cluzel, a former French
military officer who in 2013 helped to create the NATO Innovation Hub
(iHub), which he has since then managed from its base in Norfolk,
Virginia.

Although the iHub insists on its website, for legal reasons, that the
"opinions expressed on this platform don't constitute NATO or any other
organization points of view," the organization is sponsored by the
Allied Command Transformation (ACT), described as "one of two Strategic
Commands at the head of NATO's military command structure."

The Innovation Hub, therefore, acts as a kind of in-house NATO research
center or think tank. Its research is not necessarily official NATO
policy, but it is directly supported and overseen by NATO.

In 2020, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) tasked du
Cluzel, as manager of the iHub, to conduct a six-month study on
cognitive warfare.

Du Cluzel summarized his research in the panel this October. He
initiated his remarks noting that cognitive warfare "right now is one of
the hottest topics for NATO," and "has become a recurring term in
military terminology in recent years."

Although French, Du Cluzel emphasized that cognitive warfare strategy
"is being currently developed by my command here in Norfolk, USA."

The NATO Innovation Hub manager spoke with a PowerPoint presentation,
and opened with a provocative slide that described cognitive warfare as
"A Battle for the Brain."

"Cognitive warfare is a new concept that starts in the information
sphere, that is a kind of hybrid warfare," du Cluzel said.

"It starts with hyper-connectivity. Everyone has a cell phone," he
continued.

It starts with information because information is, if I may say, the
fuel of cognitive warfare. But it goes way beyond solely information,
which is a standalone operation--information warfare is a standalone
operation.

[Cognitive warfare overlaps with **Big Tech corporations**]{.underline}
and mass surveillance, because "it's all about leveraging the big data,"
du Cluzel explained.

We produce data everywhere we go. Every minute, every second we go, we
go online. And this is extremely easy to leverage those data in order to
better know you and use that knowledge to change the way you think.

Naturally, the NATO researcher claimed foreign "adversaries" are the
supposed aggressors employing cognitive warfare. But at the same time,
he made it clear that the Western military alliance is developing its
own tactics.

Du Cluzel defined cognitive warfare as the "art of using technologies to
alter the cognition of human targets."

Those [technologies]{.underline}, he noted, incorporate the fields of
NBIC--[nanotechnology]{.underline}, [biotechnology]{.underline},
[information technology]{.underline}, [and cognitive
science]{.underline}. All together, "it [makes a kind of **very
dangerous cocktail** that]{.underline} can further [manipulate the
brain]{.underline}," he said.

Du Cluzel went on to explain that the exotic new method of attack
"**[goes well beyond]{.underline}**" [information warfare or
psychological operations]{.underline} ([psyops]{.underline}).

"[Cognitive warfare]{.underline} is not only a fight against what we
think, but it's rather a fight against the way we think, if we [can
**change the way** people think]{.underline}," he said.

De Cluzel continued:

It's crucial to understand that it's a game on our cognition, on the way
our brain processes information and turns it into knowledge, rather than
solely a game on information or on psychological aspects of our brains.
It's not only an action against what we think, but also an action
against the way we think, the way we process information and turn it
into knowledge.

In other words, cognitive warfare is not just another word, another name
for information warfare. It is a war on our individual processor, our
brain.

The [NATO]{.underline} researcher [stressed]{.underline} that "[this is
**extremely important** for]{.underline} us in [the
military]{.underline}," [because]{.underline} "[it has the
potential]{.underline}, [by developing new weapons]{.underline} and ways
of harming the brain, it has the potential [to engage]{.underline}
neuroscience and [technology in many]{.underline}, [many different
approaches to influence human ecology]{.underline}... because you all
know that it's very easy to **[turn a civilian technology into a
military one]{.underline}**."

As for who the targets of cognitive warfare could be, du Cluzel revealed
that anyone and everyone is on the table.

"[Cognitive warfare has **universal reach**]{.underline}, from [starting
with the individual to states and multinational
organizations]{.underline}," he said.

Its [field of action]{.underline} is global and [aim to **seize
control** of the human being]{.underline}, civilian as well as military.

And the private sector has a financial interest in advancing cognitive
warfare research, he noted:

The massive worldwide investments made in neurosciences suggests that
the cognitive domain will probably one of the battlefields of the
future.

The development of cognitive warfare totally transforms military
conflict as we know it, du Cluzel said, adding "a third major combat
dimension to the modern battlefield: to the physical and informational
dimension is now added a cognitive dimension."

This "creates a new space of competition beyond what is called the five
domains of operations--or land, sea, air, cyber, and space domains.
Warfare in the cognitive arena mobilizes a wider range of battle spaces
than solely the physical and information dimensions can do."

In short, humans themselves are the new contested domain in this novel
mode of hybrid warfare, alongside land, sea, air, cyber, and outer
space.

NATO's cognitive warfare study warns of "embedded fifth column"

The study that NATO Innovation Hub manager François du Cluzel conducted,
from June to November 2020, was sponsored by the military cartel's
Allied Command Transformation, and published as a 45-page report in
January 2021 (PDF).

The chilling document shows how contemporary warfare has reached a kind
of dystopian stage, once imaginable only in science fiction.

"The nature of warfare has changed," the report emphasized.

The majority of current conflicts remain below the threshold of the
traditionally accepted definition of warfare, but new forms of warfare
have emerged such as Cognitive Warfare (CW), while the human mind is now
being considered as a new domain of war.

For NATO, research on cognitive warfare is not just defensive; it is
very much offensive as well.

"Developing capabilities to harm the cognitive abilities of opponents
will be a necessity," du Cluzel's report stated clearly.

In other words, [NATO]{.underline} will need to [get the ability to
**safeguard**]{.underline} her \[[its]{.underline}\] [decision making
process]{.underline} and disrupt the adversary's one.

And anyone could be a target of these cognitive warfare operations: "Any
user of modern information technologies is a potential target. It
targets the whole of a nation's human capital," the report ominously
added.

"As well as the potential execution of a cognitive war to complement to
a military conflict, it can also be conducted alone, without any link to
an engagement of the armed forces," the study went on.

Moreover, [cognitive warfare is]{.underline} potentially [**endless**
since there can be **no peace treaty** or surrender for this type of
conflict]{.underline}.

Just as this new mode of battle has no geographic borders,
[it]{.underline} also [has no]{.underline} time [limit]{.underline}:

This battlefield is global via the internet. With no beginning and no
end, this conquest knows no respite, punctuated by notifications from
our smartphones, anywhere, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The NATO-sponsored study noted that "some NATO Nations have already
acknowledged that neuroscientific techniques and technologies have high
potential for operational use in a variety of security, defense and
intelligence enterprises."

It spoke of breakthroughs in "neuroscientific methods and technologies"
(neuroS/T), and said "uses of research findings and products to directly
facilitate the performance of combatants, the integration of human
machine interfaces to optimise combat capabilities of semi autonomous
vehicles (e.g., drones), and development of biological and chemical
weapons (i.e., neuroweapons)."

The Pentagon is among the primary institutions advancing this novel
research, as the report highlighted:

Although a number of nations have pursued, and are currently pursuing
neuroscientific research and development for military purposes, perhaps
the most proactive efforts in this regard have been conducted by the
United States Department of Defense; with most notable and rapidly
maturing research and development conducted by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity (IARPA).

Military uses of neuroS/T research, the study indicated, include
intelligence gathering, training, "optimising performance and resilience
in combat and military support personnel," and of course "direct
weaponisation of neuroscience and neurotechnology."

This weaponization of neuroS/T can and will be fatal, the NATO-sponsored
study was clear to point out. The research can "be utilised to mitigate
aggression and foster cognitions and emotions of affiliation or
passivity; induce morbidity, disability or suffering; and 'neutralise'
potential opponents or incur mortality"--in other words, to maim and
kill people.

The report quoted U.S. Major General Robert H. Scales, who summarized
NATO's new combat philosophy:

[Victory]{.underline} will be [defined]{.underline} more [in terms of
capturing the **psycho-cultural** rather than]{.underline} the
[geographical high ground]{.underline}.

And as NATO develops tactics of cognitive warfare to "capture the
psycho-cultural," it is also increasingly weaponizing various scientific
fields.

The study spoke of "the crucible of data sciences and human sciences,"
and stressed that "the combination of Social Sciences and System
Engineering will be key in helping military analysts to improve the
production of intelligence."

"If kinetic power cannot defeat the enemy," it said,

psychology and related behavioural and social sciences stand to fill the
void.

"Leveraging social sciences will be central to the development of the
Human Domain Plan of Operations," the report went on.

It will support the combat operations by providing potential courses of
action for the whole surrounding Human Environment including enemy
forces, but also determining key human elements such as the Cognitive
center of gravity, the desired behaviour as the end state.

All academic disciplines will be implicated in cognitive warfare, not
just the hard sciences. "Within the military, expertise on anthropology,
ethnography, history, psychology among other areas will be more than
ever required to cooperate with the military," the NATO-sponsored study
stated.

The report nears its conclusion with an eerie quote:

[Today's progresses in]{.underline} nanotechnology,
[biotechnology]{.underline}, [information technology]{.underline} [and
cognitive science]{.underline} (NBIC), [boosted by]{.underline} the
seemingly unstoppable march of a triumphant troika made of [Artificial
Intelligence]{.underline}, Big Data and civilisational 'digital
addiction' have [created a **much more ominous** prospect]{.underline}:
an embedded fifth column, where [everyone]{.underline}, unbeknownst to
him or her \[themselves\], [is behaving according to]{.underline} the
[plans of]{.underline} one of our competitors.

"The modern concept of war is not about weapons but about influence," it
posited.

Victory in the long run will remain solely dependent on the ability to
influence, affect, change or impact the cognitive domain.

The **[NATO-sponsored study then closed with a final paragraph that
makes it clear beyond doubt that the Western military alliance's
ultimate goal is not only physical control of the planet, but also
control over people's minds]{.underline}**:

Cognitive warfare may well be the missing element that allows the
transition from military victory on the battlefield to lasting political
success. The human domain might well be the decisive domain, wherein
multi-domain operations achieve the commander's effect. The five first
domains can give tactical and operational victories; only the human
domain can achieve the final and full victory.

Canadian Special Operations officer emphasizes importance of cognitive
warfare

When François du Cluzel, the NATO researcher who conducted the study on
cognitive warfare, concluded his remarks in the October 5 NATO
Association of Canada panel, he was followed by Andy Bonvie, a
commanding officer at the Canadian Special Operations Training Centre.

With more than 30 years of experience with the Canadian Armed Forces,
Bonvie spoke of how Western militaries are making use of research by du
Cluzel and others, and incorporating novel cognitive warfare techniques
into their combat activities.

"Cognitive warfare is a new type of hybrid warfare for us," Bonvie said.

And it means that we need to look at the traditional thresholds of
conflict and how the things that are being done are really below those
thresholds of conflict, cognitive attacks, and non-kinetic forms and
non-combative threats to us. We need to understand these attacks better
and adjust their actions and our training accordingly to be able to
operate in these different environments.

Although he portrayed NATO's actions as "defensive," claiming
"adversaries" were using cognitive warfare against them, Bonvie was
unambiguous about the fact that Western militaries are developing these
tecniques themselves, to maintain a "tactical advantage."

"We cannot lose the tactical advantage for our troops that we're placing
forward as it spans not only tactically, but strategically," he said.

Some of those different capabilities that we have that we enjoy all of a
sudden could be pivoted to be used against us. So we have to better
understand how quickly our adversaries adapt to things, and then be able
to predict where they're going in the future, to help us be and maintain
the tactical advantage for our troops moving forward.

'[Cognitive warfare is **the most advanced** form of
manipulation]{.underline} seen [to date]{.underline}'

Marie-Pierre Raymond, a retired Canadian lieutenant colonel who
currently serves as a "defence scientist and innovation portfolio
manager" for the Canadian Armed Forces' Innovation for Defence
Excellence and Security Program, also joined the October 5 panel.

"Long gone are the days when war was fought to acquire more land,"
Raymond said.

Now the new objective is to change the adversaries' ideologies, which
makes the brain the center of gravity of the human. And it makes the
human the contested domain, and the mind becomes the battlefield.

"When we speak about hybrid threats, cognitive warfare is the most
advanced form of manipulation seen to date," she added, noting that it
aims to influence individuals' decision-making and "to influence a group
of a group of individuals on their behavior, with the aim of gaining a
tactical or strategic advantage."

Raymond noted that cognitive warfare also heavily overlaps with
artificial intelligence, big data, and social media, and reflects "the
rapid evolution of neurosciences as a tool of war."

Raymond is helping to oversee the NATO Fall 2021 Innovation Challenge on
behalf of Canada's Department of National Defence, which delegated
management responsibilities to the military's Innovation for Defence
Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Program, where she works.

In highly technical jargon, Raymond indicated that the cognitive warfare
program is not solely defensive, but also offensive:

This challenge is calling for a solution that will support NATO's
nascent human domain and jump-start the development of a cognition
ecosystem within the alliance, and that will support the development of
new applications, new systems, new tools and concepts leading to
concrete action in the cognitive domain."

She emphasized that this "will require sustained cooperation between
allies, innovators, and researchers to enable our troops to fight and
win in the cognitive domain. This is what we are hoping to emerge from
this call to innovators and researchers."

To inspire corporate interest in the NATO Innovation Challenge, Raymond
enticed, "Applicants will receive national and international exposure
and cash prizes for the best solution." She then added tantalizingly,

This could also benefit the applicants by potentially providing them
access to a market of 30 nations.

Canadian military officer calls on corporations to invest in NATO's
cognitive warfare research

The other institution that is managing the Fall 2021 NATO Innovation
Challenge on behalf of Canada's Department of National Defense is the
Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM).

A Canadian military officer who works with CANSOFCOM, Shekhar Gothi, was
the final panelist in the October 5 NATO Association of Canada event.
Gothi serves as CANSOFCOM's "innovation officer" for Southern Ontario.

He concluded the event appealing for corporate investment in NATO's
cognitive warfare research.

The bi-annual Innovation Challenge is "part of the NATO battle rhythm,"
Gothi declared enthusiastically.

He noted that, in the spring of 2021, Portugal held a NATO Innovation
Challenge focused on warfare in outer space.

In spring 2020, the Netherlands hosted a NATO Innovation Challenge
focused on COVID-19.

Gothi reassured corporate investors that NATO will bend over backward to
defend their bottom lines:

I can assure everyone that the NATO innovation challenge indicates that
all innovators will maintain complete control of their intellectual
property. So NATO won't take control of that. Neither will Canada.
Innovators will maintain their control over their IP.

The comment was a fitting conclusion to the panel, affirming that
[NATO]{.underline} and its allies [in the military-industrial complex
not only seek to dominate the world]{.underline} and the humans that
inhabit it with unsettling cognitive warfare techniques,
[but]{.underline} to also [ensure that corporations]{.underline} and
their shareholders [**continue to profit** from these **imperial
endeavors**]{.underline}.

[A mutation takes place in the martial arts of European states and the
U.S. state.]{.underline} Great powers shift from the privileging of
individual skill on the battlefield to a quantity theory of war in which
numbers, at least for a time, matter more than tactical execution.10 In
specific historical terms, one can see the difference in the episteme of
skill versus the quantitative mode of warfare in the way leaders of the
Gauls were chosen by performance in combat. One's right to lead among
the Gauls came from one's ability to survive and excel in combat. The
leader often actually led, in the physical sense, the troops into
battle. The leaders were the front line or tip of the cannae or wedge
shape that fighters formed as they raced toward their enemy. [The
metaphorical meaning of "leading" a battle in which verbal and later
**cybernetic commands or leadership** replaces the physical presence of

contemporary practices of combat wreaking havoc with little success
around the globe. The **quantitative** and then **annihilative mode of
warfare** also says something about the **creeping entanglements**
between **war and other ecological orders** such as **the economy**,
**resource extraction**, **urbanization**, and **scientific
innovation**. These seemingly distinct modes of organization and
relations making are increasingly bound up with and to war precisely
because a quantitative approach to annihilation requires---as a
contest---the full mobilization of production, whether demographic,
economic, technological, or affective]{.underline}. Not surprisingly,
[each of these sectors becomes a target of war, resulting in an
inseparable entanglement of arsenal and form of life.]{.underline} Using
the example of gas warfare, Peter Sloterdijk argues that [**the
environment itself** became the **operational space of
warfare**.]{.underline} Unlike targeting or fighting, gas changed the
atmosphere of the lifeworld into a death world. [The
transition]{.underline} for Sloterdijk [was a logical outcome of a form
of war for which annihilation was analytically and materially practiced,
and therefore, habituated as a preference, war became technological:
"technology militarily encapsulates the nature of enmity: it is nothing
other than the will to annihilate one's opponent. Enmity made
technologically explicit is exterminism]{.underline}. This explains why
the mature style of warfare in the twentieth century was
annihilation-oriented."12 Therefore, for Sloterdijk, poison gas for
crops, poison gas for troops, and poison gas for victims of the
Holocaust, while not being indistinguishable, share a common heritage in
the explication of the ecological order. The habitats of bugs, soldiers,
Jews, queers, Roma, Communists, and other dissidents share an
atmosphere; therefore, the annihilation of each can be accomplished by
taking that atmosphere away. [Rather than seeing gas as an aberration
from other forms of war, Sloterdijk sees it as an extension of war
becoming ecologically aware]{.underline}.13 [War as a technological
assemblage of making each relation more and more explicit, whether
economy, combatant, or resource, also made each a target and each
relation that sustained that target a potential weapon.]{.underline}
Over four centuries of European development and expansion, [violence
capability and participation have undergone a process of radical
democratization for both citizens and things.]{.underline} Everything is
a target and the dependence of every target implies a weapon, a "new
surface of vulnerability." According to Sloterdijk, "[no other epoch
displayed such advanced expertise in the art of
annihilating."]{.underline}14

### ! --- AT: Utilitarianism

#### Their utilitarian framework of "extinction first" understands the planet as a spatially cartographic whole, reducible to the sum of its parts --- that makes violence against the periphery inevitable.

Rather than see these two career trajectories as opposed, I think
Crutzen's [thinking displays a continuous concern for the Northern
Hemisphere and a particular cartography, rather than a geography, of
human survival]{.underline}.9 Crutzen, as well as [the concept of the
Anthropocene itself]{.underline}, [cannot escape preceding geopolitical
conceptions of the Earth]{.underline}. Crutzen and others who rush so
quickly to the necessity to [transition efforts from climate abatement
to climate modification are]{.underline} unsurprisingly [not moved by
claims that **artificial cooling** will likely cause **droughts and
famines** in the **tropics and subtropical zones of the global
south;**]{.underline} [nor are they moved by how such plans may
**accelerate ocean acidification.**]{.underline}10 [**The utilitarian
risk calculus** that favors the greatest good for the greatest number
has **no geographical or historical sensibility** of how **unequally
aggregate conceptions** of the good are **distributed around the
planet.** Global thinking, even in its **scientific and seemingly
universalist claims** to an atmosphere that "we" all share, belies the
geopolitics that enlivens scientific concern, as well as the global
public policy agenda of geoengineering that seeks to act on behalf of
it]{.underline}. [**Saving humanity as an aggregate**, whether from
**nuclear war**, **Styrofoam**, or **climate turbulence**]{.underline},
[has never meant an egalitarian distribution of survivors and
sacrifices.]{.underline} Instead, [our **new cosmopolitanism**--- **the
global environment**---follows]{.underline} almost **[exactly the drawn
lines]{.underline}**, that is, [the **cartography or racialized and
selective solidarities** and **zones of indifference** that
**characterize economic development**, the **selective application of
combat**, and, before that, the **zones of settlement and
colonization**.]{.underline} [More than a result of contemporary white
supremacy or lingering white privilege, the **territorialization of who
lives and who dies**, who matters and who must be left behind **for the
sake of humanity**, represents a]{.underline} five-hundred-year
[**geopolitical tradition of conquest**, **colonization, extraction**,
and the **martial forms of life** that made them all possible through
**war** and through more **subtle and languid forms of organized
killing.**]{.underline} I am not suggesting that Crutzen and others are
part of a vast conspiracy; rather, I want to outline how [climate
change, species loss, slavery, the elimination of native peoples, and
the globalization of extractive capitalism are all part of the same
global ordering.]{.underline} That is, all of these crises are
geopolitical. [The particular geopolitical arrangement of]{.underline}
what others have called the longue durée, and what I am calling [the
Eurocene]{.underline}, [is geologically significant but is not
universally part of "human activity" despite the false syllogism at the
heart of popular ecological thinking that a global threat to humanity
must be shared in cause and crisis by all of humanity]{.underline}.11
Departing from Sloterdijk, [I am hesitant to so easily locate modernity
or explication as the root or cause of the global
catastrophe]{.underline}. [No single strategy, war, act of colonization,
technological breakthrough, or worldview fully explains the apocalypse
before us.]{.underline} However, [there is something like]{.underline}
what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari call [a refrain that holds the
vast assemblage together, a **geopolitical melody hummed along with the
global expansion** of a form of life characterized by homogenization
rather than diversification]{.underline}. Accordingly, [if we are to
make some sense of such a vast world that is]{.underline}, even for
Crutzen and Birks, "**[quite complex and difficult to
model]{.underline}**," I think [we must consider the particular refrain
of geopolitics that is capable of, by scientific as well as more humbly
embodied standards, destroying worlds along with the
world.]{.underline}12 [To **eschew geopolitics simply because**, as a
refrain, it is **too big, too grand, or too universal** would **ignore
the conditions of possibility** for **nuclear weapons**, **power
politics**, and **carbon-based globalization**, and would greatly
**impoverish the explanatory capability** of even the best climate
models]{.underline}. So maybe it is not so strange that Crutzen and
others' attention to the nuclear threat of great powers has all but
disappeared despite the fact that Russia and the United States still
possess thousands of nuclear weapons, and as of late have been all too
vocal about using them. Instead, [the Anthropocene]{.underline}, as
envisioned by Crutzen [as a universal concern, requires with it a
depoliticization of the causes of that concern.]{.underline} Therefore,
Crutzen's [fascination with nuclear winter is geopolitical not because
it is about nuclear weapons]{.underline}---although that does not hurt.
[Rather]{.underline}, Crutzen's attention to nuclear winter is
geopolitical [because it is an image of the **Earth system as a system**
with **particular beneficiaries animating that interest**]{.underline}.
Sloterdijk's diagnosis of what I am terming [the Eurocene]{.underline},
or the space of what he calls European "earth-users," [is present in the
very **cybernetic understanding** of the **planet as a spatial and
substantive whole**]{.underline}.13 [In the cases of both nuclear winter
and climate change, the atmosphere is a model, or more accurately, the
last model. The whole Earth becomes a single integer in a larger set of
planet systems rather than a set of habitats, zones, or locales. The
**Earth is merely another system isomorphic as a unit of analysis** with
Mars or the exoplanet trappist-1f]{.underline}. [The shift in scale from
place to the planetary is much more than a pulling back from the ground
upward]{.underline}. The integrated Earth as the representation of a
system and as an actual material system is aided by a process of
integration, proceeded by a few hundred years of Sloterdijk's conception
of explication where each part of each environment is disaggregated,
described, and then reassembled to explain the whole. [The process of
integration is not merely a metaphoric or metaphysical geopolitics. It
is the condition of possibility to understand the planetary as being
political, as well as the condition of possibility for its charting as
an economic and military cartography.]{.underline} Unlike the
weltanschauung of Heidegger's world image, [the **planetary "user
space"** requires]{.underline} five [hundred years of conquest, fossil
fuel extraction and exploitation, settlement, hundreds of expert fields
from geography to chemistry to ecology, and the normative consolidation
of cosmopolitanism as a right to the freedom of movement at least for
those capable of the feat.]{.underline}14 The worldview or world image
alone is a necessary but insufficient cause. The practices that
habituated, expanded, and intensified that worldview are what is
critical to its emergence. In this sense, the Anthropocene, like
Crutzen's award-winning models of climate change and nuclear winter, is
much more than an explanatory model. [These models are the outcome of
five centuries of integration and homogenization such that the
infrastructure capable of making the Earth as a system knowable could be
built,]{.underline} [and the circulation of knowledge and data could be
amassed to even make the diagnosis of a geological epoch in the first
place]{.underline}.15 [Properly accounting for the origins of our
ecological crisis is vital]{.underline}. No political project oriented
toward the many possible futures stretching out before us can consider
the questions of ecology and justice on a global, much less geological,
scale unless we first take on the unfortunate historical generality of
the Anthropocene. [The continuing project of
Europeanization]{.underline}, now [led by U.S. imperial
power]{.underline} (although perhaps not for much longer), [is central
to how the planet got to this point]{.underline}. Understanding this is
essential for how any "we" worthy of the plurality of the planet can
invent something less nasty and brutish than what currently counts as
global order. A consideration of the Eurocene, a geological history and
name that foregrounds the geopolitical confrontation that stands in the
way of any such future, is required in order to take the scale of our
predicament seriously, while also confronting the power politics that
made that scale possible.

#### 2. Their framing sacrifices billions at the altar of extinction and elites

**Torres 21**, PhD candidate at Leibniz Universität Hannover. Previously
studied at Harvard University and Brandeis University. Author of
Morality, Foresight, and Human Flourishing: An Introduction to
Existential Risks (Phil Torres, 7-28-2021, "**[The Dangerous
Idea]{.underline}**s **[of]{.underline}** 'Longtermism' and
**['Existential Risk']{.underline}**," Current Affairs,
<https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk>,
accessed: 10-27-2021)

[It's this line of reasoning that leads Bostrom]{.underline}, Greaves,
MacAskill, [and others to argue that **even the tiniest reductions** in
"existential risk" are morally equivalent to saving the lives of
literally billions of living, breathing, actual people]{.underline}. For
example, [Bostrom writes that if there is "a mere 1 percent
chance"]{.underline} [that 10\^54 conscious beings]{.underline} (most
living in computer simulations) [come to exist in the future, then "we
find that the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one
billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred
billion times as much as a billion human lives]{.underline}." Greaves
and MacAskill echo this idea in a 2021 paper by arguing that "even if
there are 'only' 1014 lives to come ... , a reduction in near-term risk
of extinction by one millionth of one percentage point would be
equivalent in value to a million lives saved."

To make this concrete, imagine Greaves and MacAskill in front of two
buttons. If pushed, the first would save the lives of 1 million living,
breathing, actual people. The second would increase the probability that
10\^14 currently unborn people come into existence in the far future by
a teeny-tiny amount. [Because, on their longtermist view, there is no
fundamental moral difference between saving actual people and bringing
new people into existence, these options are morally
equivalent]{.underline}. In other words, they'd have to flip a coin to
decide which button to push. (Would you? I certainly hope not.)
[**[In]{.mark} Bostrom's [example]{.mark}**[, **the**]{.mark} **morally
[right thing is]{.mark} obviously [to sacrifice billions]{.mark} of
living human beings [for]{.mark} the sake of even [tinier reductions in
existential risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}, assuming a minuscule 1 percent
chance of a larger future population: 1054 people.

[All of this is to say that even if billions of people were to perish in
the coming climate catastrophe, so long as humanity survives with enough
of civilization intact to fulfill its supposed "potential," we shouldn't
be too concerned]{.underline}. In the grand scheme of things,
non-runaway climate change will prove to be nothing more than a "mere
ripple" ---a "small misstep for mankind," however terrible a "massacre
for man" it might otherwise be.

[Even worse, [since]{.mark} our [resources for reducing existential risk
are finite]{.mark}, Bostrom argues that **[we must not "fritter \[them\]
away" on]{.mark}** what he describes as "feel-good projects of
suboptimal efficacy." Such projects would include]{.underline}, on this
account, not just **[saving people in [the Global
South]{.mark}]{.underline}**---those most vulnerable, especially
women---**[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the calamities of climate
change, but all other **[[non-existential]{.underline}]{.mark}**
philanthropic **[[causes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, too. As the Princeton
philosopher Peter Singer writes about Bostrom in his 2015 book on
Effective Altruism, "to refer to donating to help the global poor ... as
a 'feel-good project' on which resources are 'frittered away' is harsh
language." But it makes perfectly good sense [within Bostrom's
longtermist framework, according to which "priority number one, two,
three, and four should]{.underline} ... [be to reduce existential risk."
Everything else is smaller fish not worth frying]{.underline}.

If this sounds appalling, it's because it is appalling. [[By **reducing
morality to**]{.mark} **an [abstract numbers]{.mark} game**, and by
declaring that what's most important is fulfilling "our
potential"]{.underline} by becoming simulated posthumans among the
stars, [[longtermists]{.mark} not only trivialize past
atrocities]{.underline} like WWII (and the Holocaust) [but [give]{.mark}
themselves a **["]{.mark}moral [excuse" to
dismiss]{.mark}**]{.underline} or minimize comparable
**[[atrocities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the future. This is one reason
that I've come to see longtermism as an immensely dangerous ideology.
[[It is]{.mark}, indeed, akin to a **secular religion** built around the
worship of "future value," complete with its own "secularised doctrine
of salvation,"]{.underline} as the Future of Humanity Institute
historian Thomas Moynihan approvingly writes in his book X-Risk. [The
[popular]{.mark}ity of this religion [among **wealthy people
in**]{.mark} **the [West]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[especially the
**socioeconomic elite**]{.underline}---[makes sense because [it **tells
them**]{.mark} **exactly [what they want]{.mark} to hear**: not only are
you **ethically [excused from worrying]{.mark} too much
[about]{.mark}**]{.underline} sub-existential threats like non-runaway
[[**climate change** and]{.mark} **global [poverty]{.mark}**, but you
are actually a morally better person for focusing instead on more
important things]{.underline}---risk that could permanently destroy "our
potential" as a species of Earth-originating intelligent life.

#### Their framing causes genocide AND links 

**Santos 3**, Professor of Sociology at the University of Coimbra
(Boaventura de Souza Santos, 2003, "Collective Suicide?", Bad Subjects,
Issue \# 63, http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php)

[According to]{.underline} Franz [Hinkelammert, [the West
has]{.mark}]{.underline} repeatedly [[been under]{.mark} the [illusion
that it should]{.mark} **try to [save humanity by destroying part of
it]{.mark}**[. This is a]{.mark} salvific and [sacrificial destruction,
committed]{.mark} in the **name of the need to radically materialize all
the possibilities opened up by a given social and political reality**
over which it is supposed to have total power. This is how it was [in
**colonialism**, with]{.mark} the [**genocide of indigenous peoples**,
and]{.mark} **the [African slaves]{.mark}**. This is how it was
[in]{.mark} the **period of [imperialist struggles]{.mark}**[, which
caused **millions of deaths** in]{.mark} two [world]{.mark} wars
[and]{.mark} many other [colonial wars]{.mark}. This is how it was in
[**Stalinism**, with the **Gulag** and]{.mark} in [**Nazism**, with the
**holocaust**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And now today, [this is how it is in
[neoliberalism, with]{.mark} the **[collective sacrifice of the
periphery]{.mark}** and **even the semiperiphery of the world
system**.]{.underline} With the war against Iraq, it is fitting to ask
whether what is in progress is a new genocidal and sacrificial illusion,
and what its scope might be. [It is above all appropriate to ask if
[the]{.mark} new [illusion will]{.mark} not herald the radicalization
and the ultimate perversion of the western illusion:
**[destroy]{.mark}**ing **all of [humanity]{.mark} in the illusion of
saving it**. [Sacrificial genocide arises]{.mark} from a [totalitarian
illusion that]{.mark} is manifested in the belief that **[there are no
alternatives]{.mark}** to the present-day reality and that the problems
and difficulties confronting it arise from failing to take its logic of
development to its ultimate consequences. If there is unemployment,
[hunger and death in]{.mark} the [Third World]{.mark}, this [is not the
result of market failures]{.mark}]{.underline}; instead, [[it is the
outcome of]{.mark} the [market laws not having been]{.mark} fully
applied. If there is [terrorism]{.mark}, this [is not due to the
violence]{.mark} of the conditions [that generate it; it is due]{.mark},
rather, [to the fact that]{.mark} total [violence has not been employed
to physically eradicate all]{.mark} terrorists and [potential
terrorists. **This**]{.mark} **political [logic is based on]{.mark} the
supposition of [total power]{.mark}** and **knowledge**, and on the
radical rejection of **alt**ernative**s**; [it is
**ultra-conservative**]{.mark} in that it [aims to **infinitely
reproduce the s**]{.mark}tatus **[q]{.mark}**uo.]{.underline} Inherent
to it is the notion of the end of history. During the last hundred
years, [the West has experienced three versions of this
logic]{.underline}, and, therefore, seen three versions of the end of
history: [Stalinism]{.underline}, with its logic of insuperable
efficiency of the plan; [Nazism]{.underline}, with its logic of racial
superiority; [and neoliberalism]{.underline}, with its logic of
insuperable efficiency of the market. The first two periods involved the
destruction of democracy. The last one trivializes democracy, disarming
it in the face of social actors sufficiently powerful to be able to
privatize the State and international institutions in their favour. I
have described this situation as a combination of political democracy
and social fascism. One current manifestation of this combination
resides in the fact that intensely strong public opinion, worldwide,
against the war is found to be incapable of halting the war machine set
in motion by supposedly democratic rulers. [At all these
moments,]{.underline} [a **death drive**, a catastrophic heroism,
predominates, **the idea of a looming collective suicide**, **only
preventable by the massive destruction of the other**.]{.underline}
Paradoxically, [the broader the definition of the other and the efficacy
of its destruction, the **more likely collective suicide becomes**. In
its sacrificial genocide version, neoliberalism is a mixture of market
radicalization, neoconservatism and Christian fundamentalism. **Its
death drive takes a number of forms, from the idea of [\"discardable
populations\"]{.mark}**, referring to citizens of the Third World not
capable of being exploited as workers and consumers, to **the concept of
[\"collateral damage\"]{.mark}** , to refer to the deaths, as a result
of war, of thousands of innocent civilians]{.underline}. The last,
catastrophic heroism, is quite clear on two facts: according to reliable
calculations by the Non-Governmental Organization MEDACT, in London,
between 48 and 260 thousand civilians will die during the war and in the
three months after (this is without there being civil war or a nuclear
attack); the war will cost 100 billion dollars, enough to pay the health
costs of the world\'s poorest countries for four years. [Is it possible
to fight this death drive?]{.underline} We must bear in mind that,
historically, [**sacrificial destruction has [always been linked
to]{.mark} the [economic pillage of natural resources and]{.mark} the
[labor]{.mark} force**, to the imperial design of **radically changing
the terms of economic**, **social**, **political** and **cultural
exchanges** in the face of falling efficiency rates postulated by the
**maximalist logic of the totalitarian illusion in
operation**]{.underline}. It is as though hegemonic powers, both when
they are on the rise and when they are in decline, repeatedly go through
times of primitive accumulation, legitimizing the most shameful violence
in the name of futures where, by definition, there is no room for what
must be destroyed. In today\'s version, the period of primitive
accumulation consists of combining neoliberal economic globalization
with the globalization of war. The machine of democracy and liberty
turns into a machine of horror and destruction.

Contextualising Coloniality of Power

[To control is to]{.underline} induce/evoke in another a
reaction/response, or [take a course of action that they would not
otherwise willingly choose]{.underline}. As such, control is [the
**essential and primary currency of empire**]{.underline}. Coloniality
of power is a unit of analysis that unmasks the control patterns and of
modernity. [The **architects of modernity** and colonialism had in mind,
control of the world, for the survival of their colonial project. The
coloniser and the colonised are by design unequal]{.underline}. [An
inherent asymmetrical power relationship exists]{.underline} between the
two. [The design cannot be greater than the designer]{.underline},
neither a creation greater than the creator. [A creator cannot be part
of the creation or created]{.underline}. The creation is a product of
the creator, so is the design a product of the designer. [What (cause)
limits and regulates (control) the design is the designer
(agency).]{.underline} [As such, the rules that apply to the design may
not be applicable to the designer. The creator is **above and beyond the
creation**]{.underline}. This scenario places the creator in an
asymmetrical power relation with its creation, the two are incomparable.
What are the implications of the asymmetrical power relations? [The
Euro-North American-centric civilisation is outside the global power
structural configuration. It created this configuration, and it is the
force that does the configuration.]{.underline} **[All other
civilisations]{.underline}** [are the ones]{.underline} **[to be
configured]{.underline}**. [Any deviant civilisation]{.underline} or
perspective to the established 'global order' [becomes a
**threat**]{.underline} [to the functioning of this]{.underline}
**[global imperial design]{.underline}**. [In this paradigm, there can
never exist more than one centre of power; the Euro-North
American-centric civilisation views itself as the only legitimate seat
of power and control.]{.underline} The designer regulates and controls
the design. The design could have not existed without the designer. This
is the bone of contention; since the design could have not been without
the designer, how then can the same rules that regulate the design be
applied to the designer? As such, [coloniality of power perpetuates the
patterns and designs of Euro-North American-centric
modernity]{.underline}. The **[perpetuation of modernity's
designs]{.underline}**, patterns and structures **[is the essence of
coloniality]{.underline}**. [Coloniality is the vehicle that transports
and transplants modernity]{.underline}. Coloniality of power is [the
vehicle that transports and transplants control of institutions of
authority]{.underline}, the [markets]{.underline}, [sexuality and gender
as well as what is acceptable as knowledge]{.underline}, from Europe to
the rest of the world. What would be of value to the analysis that this
chapter embarks on is the four levers of control that Quijano identified
as core to understanding and unpacking the concept of coloniality of
power. In analysing and [assessing the events that occasioned the **NATO
invasion of Libya** in 2011]{.underline}, this chapter will analyse how
[Libya was a threat to the current global power structural configuration
on four levels---control of authority, control of knowledge and
subjectivity, control of the economy and control of gender and
sexuality]{.underline}. Going forward, this chapter will analyse how
[Libya's]{.underline} stance on, and [call to]{.underline}, [forming
a]{.underline} **[United Africa]{.underline}**, as evinced by Koenig
(2017: Online), [went against the authority component of the current
global power structural configuration]{.underline}. This work will also
go on to demonstrate how Libya's [proposal for]{.underline} African
countries to develop and adopt [their own monetary currency]{.underline}
that was to be backed by gold reserves, as submitted by Koenig (2017:
Online), went [against the economy and markets component]{.underline} of
the Euro-North American-centric power structural configuration. Libya's
quest to develop a [communication satellite]{.underline} that was to
improve communication technologies in Africa, as averred by Bowen (2006:
14), [went against the knowledge and subjectivity component]{.underline}
of the global power structural configuration. At the time of Gaddafi's
demise, Libya was [increasingly beginning to be seen as a good example
of a **decolonial state**]{.underline}, as opined by Bowen (2006: 15),
and [that was a **threat** to the gender and sexuality component of the
global power structural configuration.]{.underline} It is therefore
conceivable that the [NATO-led UNSC acted to consolidate the global
power structural configuration]{.underline}. As such, this work will now
go on to demonstrate and evince these assertions and convictions in the
subsequent chapters.

A NEW KIND OF IMPERIAL INTERVENTION

It must be stated that the mobilisation of the international peace
forces against NATO have always been a consideration for the planning of
Operation United Protector. Within the United States, sections of the
Congressional leadership had called on President Obama to invoke the War
Powers Act in order to receive Congressional support for US
participation in this war. However, the White House and the Pentagon did
not want an open discussion of the role of the US military in this
operation. [The Pentagon had moved to a new form of warfare where
special forces were linked to private military
organisations]{.underline}. The Washington Post has reported that the
United States had deployed special operations forces in 75 countries,
from South America to Central Asia. It is now time to place the
opposition to militarism with clear focus on these special forces and
especially the private military corporations [who act outside of the
law]{.underline}. Inside the United States, the former Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates told West Point cadets in March 2011 that, 'In my
opinion, any future defense secretary who advises the president to again
send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or
Africa should 'have his head examined.' The Pentagon was afraid of being
bogged down in another war. [With memories of the lack of popular
support for the military during the war against the people of Vietnam,
the top military planners wanted to limit opposition to the **financial
/military/industrial complex**]{.underline}. [Although the peace
movement had the Obama administration on the defensive, some sections of
this movement did not distance itself from Gaddafi and Libyans
**slaughter of sub-Saharan Africans**, while they condemned the killing
of **innocent civilians by NATO jets**.]{.underline}

European workers, faced with the double dip recession where the banks
were calling on the governments to impose austerity measures, were
lukewarm toward the Libyan operation, so the [invaders had to find a
novel way for intervening. This intervention]{.underline} then [took the
form of **bombings by NATO**]{.underline}, on the ground special forces
from the French and British commandos with air and ground support from
Qatar. The New York Times reported the coordination in this way, 'The
United States provided intelligence, refueling and more precision
bombing than Paris or London want to acknowledge. Inevitably, then, NATO
air power and technology, combined with British, French and Qatari
'trainers' working 'secretly' with the rebels on the ground, have
defeated the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.'
(http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/sunday-review/what-libyas-lessons-mean\...)
Reuters news service reported that 'former soldiers from an elite
British commando unit, the Special Air Service, and other private
contractors from Western countries were on the ground in the Libyan city
of Misrata.' In this same Reuters piece, it indicated that according to
The Guardian, [**private military contractors** were helping NATO
identify possible targets in the heavily contested city and passing this
information, as well as information about the movements of Gaddafi's
forces, to a NATO command center]{.underline} in Naples, Italy. The
newspaper reported that [a group of six armed Westerners had been
filmed]{.underline} by the Al Jazeera TV network [talking to rebels in
Misrata; the men fled after realizing they were being
filmed]{.underline}.

Initially, the United States Africa Command took credit for the NATO
operations in Libya, but when it seemed as if the entire operation was
bogged down, there were efforts to bring in special forces and private
security personnel using Qatar as the front and paymaster. Indeed, [the
use of fronts such as the Emir of Qatar pointed to a new form of global
militarism]{.underline}. **[Blackwater]{.underline}** (now called Xe),
[the American private military firm for hire, had moved to establish its
headquarters in the United Arab Emirates]{.underline}, specifically Abu
Dhabi. In a compilation of articles on nytimes.com, entitled,
'Blackwater Worldwide' , [new information was provided on the various
front companies of Blackwater and the **integrated nature** of the
CIA/Blackwater operations]{.underline}. The compilation further informed
that [Blackwater did not want to recruit Muslims because Muslims would
be reluctant to kill other Muslims.]{.underline} When the rebels entered
Tripoli, the same talking heads in Washington that were opposed to the
intervention were now praising this new kind of cooperation between the
US military and Global NATO. Future researchers on the 'special
operators on the ground' in Libya will be able to list the names of the
Private Military Contractors who were involved in this war. [When the
leaders of the National Transitional Council of Libya]{.underline} (the
political body formed to represent Libya by anti-Gaddafi forces during
the 2011 Libyan civil war) [needed money to pay the private contractors
and to bribe regional leaders, the Global NATO diplomats promptly called
for the unfreezing of the assets of Libya, even while the African Union
was protesting the killing of black Africans.]{.underline}

## Impact --- NATO

### ! --- AT: Russia 

#### Russia's [inept]{.underline} AND the alliance causes [more instability]{.underline}.

\[ [[Should NATO Exist?]{.mark}]{.underline} \]

**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded in 1949, and in the
words of its first secretary general, Baron Ismay Hastings, it had three
goals: Keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.
Nearly three-quarters of a century later, all of these rationales have
run out of gas, and it is past time for Washington to exit and thereby
dissolve NATO.

The Russian invasion of [[Ukraine does **not change this**]{.mark}, even
if Moscow's aggression has breathed new enthusiasm]{.underline} into the
alliance. While the [[invasion]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[demonstrated]{.mark} Moscow's]{.underline} bellicosity and
recklessness, it has also laid bare the
**[[ineptitude]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Russian military. [If the
shambolic [units]{.mark}]{.underline} that just hightailed it [[out of
**suburban Kyiv** are]{.mark} the **greatest
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} facing our European allies, [then [the
latter are]{.mark} plainly [capable of **defending**]{.mark}
**themselves**]{.underline} without US troops, subsidies, and
micromanagement---in other words, **[[without
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US could have wrapped
up the alliance. But instead, the Clinton administration decided that
NATO should take on new members from Moscow's former satellite states.
American foreign policy figures from across the political spectrum, from
George Kennan to Jack Matlock to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, warned against
expanding NATO eastward, predicting it would infuriate and bring out the
worst in Russia's government, many of whose own leaders stated the same
in the clearest possible terms. But Washington's [elites]{.underline}
have tended to [see NATO membership]{.underline}, or at least the
application process, [as an **inalienable legal right**, not as a matter
of **earthly politics amenable to dealmaking and
compromise**]{.underline}, with the US-led alliance loudly declaring in
2008 that Ukraine and Georgia would someday join.

Two months into the Russian invasion, it is now taken for granted that
Ukraine will never be a member of NATO. The best Ukraine can hope for is
armed neutrality with political autonomy from Moscow, the goal that
Washington should have been seeking for the past 20 years. We'll never
know how such a project might have worked out---negotiated Cold War
neutrality did give Finland and Austria space to flourish, though they
are not perfectly analogous to Ukraine---but we can very well see how
things have turned out now, in no small measure thanks to promises to
bring a US-led military alliance up to Ukraine's 1,400-mile border with
Russia.

Beyond its expansion from 12 initial members to 30, [[NATO]{.mark} has
also [**strayed** from]{.mark} its **[defens]{.mark}ive
mandate**]{.underline}. Though its bombardment of [Serbia in 1999
over]{.underline} the breakaway region of [Kosovo is vaguely remembered
as a humanitarian win, it **shouldn't be**]{.underline}. Washington,
which is to [say]{.underline} NATO, [lurched into its 78-day bombing of
Belgrade without exhausting **diplomatic alternatives**]{.underline},
and [the bombing campaign only accelerated the genocide of ethnic Serbs
from Kosovo and the Serbian slaughter of some 10,000
Kosovars]{.underline}.

After Kosovo, the alliance looked outside Europe for its reasons for
being. In 2011, [NATO imposed a no-fly zone over
[Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it soon stumbled into a regime-change
war against Moammar Gadhafi. [Now that nation [is in its **11th year of
civil war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the operation is widely regarded
as a disaster.

To the degree that this rudderless security pact has made war easier,
more salable, and more attractive for Western leaders than diplomacy,
[the alliance has been a **liability** to **peace and
stability**]{.underline}.

Bad wars aside, there is the issue of control. [Can]{.underline} the
[[defense of Europe be trusted to the Europeans]{.mark}?]{.underline} In
2022, the answer is **[yes]{.underline}**. It is true that given its
wealth and population, Germany may eventually wield outsize influence in
a European security alliance. But that's OK. Many Americans might find
it painful to admit, but [[Germany is]{.mark} a **more [stable]{.mark}**
and **functional democracy than the United States**]{.underline}, [with
a more equitable system of representation, less polarization, and
smoother transfers of power]{.underline}.

Far from garrisoning more troops in Europe---the US just added 20,000
troops to the 80,000 already deployed---the Biden administration should
hold the new government in Berlin to its post-invasion pledge to
increase defense spending to 2 percent of GDP, up from a lächerlich 1.53
percent. The US should also lean on other member countries to meet the 2
percent threshold. To make this happen, [Washington's first step should
be to **redeploy its forces out of Europe**]{.underline} without
formally leaving the alliance, a move outlined by Jasen Castillo,
codirector of the Albritton Center for Grand Strategy at Texas A&M, in a
2019 report from the Center for a New American Security. Recent events
have not changed Castillo's mind. "Frankly, [it's time for the UK,
France, and Germany to do the heavy lifting in NATO,]{.underline}"
Castillo told me, "especially now that the Ukraine war has revealed that
[[Russia is **not 10 feet tall**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

Leaving NATO would not, of course, be sufficient to set hubristic
Washington on a path of farsighted preventive diplomacy. But the
entirety of the war in Ukraine, from the diplomatic missteps leading up
to it to the underperformance of the Russian military, should show that
[the security pact's **[liabilities]{.mark}** continue to
**[outweigh]{.mark} its [benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### ! --- AT: Warming

#### This take is [mort-cérébrale]{.underline}. 

Jonathan **Power 22**, international foreign affairs columnist, 3-17-22,
"Is Nato obsolete, or brain-dead?"
<https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/oped/is-nato-obsolete-or-brain-dead--3749750>,
jy \<3 BB \[brackets for translation\]

What did ex-president Donald Trump think about Nato? Twice during his
campaign, he rubbished it publicly as "obsolete". Three years ago the
French president Emmanuel [Macron said Nato was
"**brain-dead**."]{.underline} Is it obsolete or brain-dead or both?

Nato's job, as the British secretary-general, Lord Ismay, said in 1967
was to "keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down".
It certainly had success with the latter two. The first was unnecessary.

There are some- a few- influential [people- much wiser than Trump or
Macron- who have argued that [Nato is **indeed
obsolete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of these was William Pfaff, the
late, much esteemed, columnist for the International Herald Tribune.

Another is Paul Hockenos who set out his views in a seminal article in
World Policy Journal. Their words fell on deaf ears.

President George H.W. Bush (Senior), who presided over the end of the
Cold War, wanted to see the Soviet Union more involved in Nato's
day-to-day work.

He travelled to Kiev and told Ukrainians in a public speech that they
should keep their country as part of the Soviet Union. Bush preferred
stability.

His successor, President Bill [[Clinton]{.underline}]{.mark}, had
totally another agenda- and one that [turned out to be **dangerous
one**]{.underline}, [triggering over time Russia's **present-day
hostility towards the West**]{.underline}- [incorporating]{.underline}
one by one Russia's former east European allies, the so-called
"**[[expan]{.mark}sion of [Nato]{.mark}]{.underline}**" eastwards.

His successors continued that approach with Barack [Obama]{.underline}
at one time [[raising a **red rag to a bull**]{.underline}]{.mark} by
[calling for]{.underline} the entry into Nato [Ukraine and
Georgia.]{.underline}

Nato countries thought that they had a role after the Berlin Wall came
tumbling down in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. It
led to "humanitarian" interventions in Bosnia in 1995, against Serbia in
1999 and in Kosovo later in 1999. But the latter two were done without
the authority of the UN Security Council, thus breaking international
law. Russia and Spain voted against the intervention in the UN Security
Council. (Ironically, if Russia had got its way it would have set a
precedent that would have made it very difficult for Russia later to
justify its occupation of Crimea and Ukraine.) The final settlement made
by the warring parties is unlikely to last.

In 2001 [Nato]{.underline} countries led by the US started to [[bomb
**Afghanistan**]{.underline}]{.mark} and later sent in troops. The war
lasted 19 years and [ended with Nato's defeat.]{.underline} In 2003 Nato
attacked [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} and quickly overthrew its
government but caused so much damage that the country [[is still
struggling to]{.mark} [get **back**]{.mark} **on its
feet**]{.underline}. (Before that it was the most prosperous of all Arab
countries.)

Let's return to the founding of Nato in 1949, meant "to keep the
Russians out". A majority (yes, a majority) of top historians who have
examined the evidence are convinced that Stalin had no intention of
invading Western Europe. The Second World War was won.

The Soviet Union, perhaps understandably a bit neurotic after Napoleon
and Hitler's attempts to invade it, reaching within striking distance of
Moscow, had a ring of friends around its borders, and Germany was
divided.

The allies had been an invaluable helpmate during the war and the Soviet
Union did not feel threatened by its former comrades-in-arms. It did not
need to fight them for more territory.

Thorough searches by Western historians through the Soviet archives-
they were opened during the years of President Boris Yeltsin- have
revealed that [[Moscow had **no plans** to invade
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Despite its deployments in the former ex-Yugoslavia and Afghanistan,
Nato is not a truly multilateral institution of equals. The Europeans do
not initiate military action (with the exception of the invasion Libya
that led to the overthrow and killing of President Muammar Gadhafi in
2001, followed by chaos that still lives on). It is the Americans who do
that and the Europeans, whatever their reservations, invariably follow.

Moreover, obeying America rather than following their own convictions in
ex-Yugoslavia, they did not seek UN Security Council permission, and
then are angry that Russia follows suit with its grabbing of Crimea.

[[Nato has **no relevance**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the problems [that
truly occupy Europe and the US today]{.underline}.

Its [[hands are **tied**]{.underline}]{.mark} in Ukraine
[[because]{.mark} of the [fear of **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}
if they start to fight the Russians. Moreover, there are other examples
of irrelevance to our most pressing problems.

It cannot help in dealing with the fact, as a European Union study
concluded, that [[there will be an **increase in tensions**]{.mark} over
**declining water supplies in the Middle East**]{.underline} [that will
affect Europe's security and economic interests. It [has **no
plans**]{.mark} to deal with that.]{.underline}

[[Nor can it do anything to contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark} the fight
against global **[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in [the long run the
most **severe threat**]{.underline} that confronts humanity.

[[**Economic power** begets **political power**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Lenin says, "the more capitalism is developed, the more strongly the
shortage of raw materials is felt, the more intense the competition, and
the hunt for raw materials throughout the world." Is it not clear that
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, having carried out the capitalist
restoration, [is compelled to [pursue]{.mark} its interests on a global
scale in its quest for [**markets** and]{.mark} **raw
[materials]{.mark}**]{.underline}? And is it not equally clear that
[this quest is [bring]{.mark}ing it **[into
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not only [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the neighbouring countries (Vietnam, [**Japan**,
**Taiwan**]{.underline}, etc.) [but also]{.underline} with the main
superpower, [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates?

The Chinese state apparatus is a product of the Chinese Revolution of
1949. This strong, well organised state, independent of imperialist
influence, was able to carefully foster and protect a developing
capitalist class. Over a few decades, it has presided over the creation
of massive monopolies, both state owned and private, and a vast
accumulation of capital. All history shows that the accumulation of
economic power must express itself at a certain stage in the building of
political and military power. At present the key nations in this region
--- Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan,
the Philippines --- are all American allies. The booming Chinese economy
has made this region the key to world trade, but the USA controls the
area.

China today not only has a powerful industrial base. It also has a
powerful army. And [what are [they]{.mark} doing [build]{.mark}ing
[islands]{.mark} in the Pacific?]{.underline} They are doing it in order
[[to seize]{.mark} control of a very important sea on which one third of
the **world's [trade]{.mark} is transported**]{.underline}. The
[Americans]{.underline} [are **furious**]{.underline} about this, they
denounce it. Is all this just theatre? The [Americans send
warships]{.underline} to sail close to these islands "to defend freedom
of navigation." This [[brings them into]{.mark} a **very close
[confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline} with the Chinese. It probably will
not lead to war, but the [conflicts are **real** and **very
serious**]{.underline}.

With the sole exception of Japan, [the biggest trade partner for **all
these countries is China**]{.underline}, not the USA. [This
contradiction will **intensify**]{.underline} as time goes on, and
[[something will]{.mark} **have to [give]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
process has even been seen as far afield as New Zealand and the UK,
traditionally staunch US allies. New Zealand said it would not sign the
TPP trade deal if it was designed to contain and isolate China.

The Financial Times (12.10.2015) comments: "While some neighbours will
welcome the investment, it is less clear they will want China's
overcapacity. Many have unemployment and underperforming steel mills of
their own, or ambitions to develop their own industry rather than import
someone else's." Frictions have already surfaced over contracts with Sri
Lanka, where the new government does not want to honour the deals made
by the old.

And it concludes as follows:

Lenin's theory [that [imperialism]{.mark} is [driven by]{.mark}
**capitalist [surpluses]{.mark} seems to hold true**]{.underline},
oddly[, in one of the last]{.underline} ([ostensibly]{.underline})
[Leninist countries]{.underline} in the world. It is no coincidence that
[[the Silk Road]{.mark} strategy [coincides with]{.mark} the aftermath
of an **[investment]{.mark} boom**]{.underline} that has left vast
overcapacity and a need to find new markets abroad.

If the strategists of Capital are able to see that [[China is a]{.mark}
**new [imperialist power]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that represents
a]{.mark} **growing [threat]{.mark} to the West**]{.underline}, surely
Marxists ought to be able to see the same thing? Lenin pointed out that
[the international balance of forces is constantly changing and spheres
of influence are shifting like the **tectonic plates**]{.underline} that
lie beneath the continents. And just as the latter can produce
earthquakes, so the jostling between the powers for influence can
produce all kinds of crises and conflicts.

In 2000 China had 2.5 million troops to deter potential aggressors. But
the history of war teaches us that [**defence** can easily be
transformed into]{.underline} offence. [China is now the largest
contributor of peacekeepers and observers among the permanent
members]{.underline} of the UN Security Council. They have sent troops
to Liberia, the Congo, Sudan, Haiti and even Lebanon. [This
is]{.underline} something like [a practice run for]{.underline} more
**[serious military interventions]{.underline}** on foreign soil at a
later date. China has recently passed a law allowing its soldiers to be
posted in bases in other countries for the first time.

[Xi]{.underline} Jinping has [expressed the will to develop **maritime
capacity**]{.underline} to become a true maritime power commensurate
with China's geostrategic standing. He lists the different local
conflicts China has had and he refers to China's slow tactic of small
challenges in the Pacific and the region and eventually presenting
countries with a fait accompli. He refers to China's plans to build
aircraft carriers, in which it is still far behind American technology,
but it shows the direction in which they are going.

The level of military spending can be seen from the fact that for 17
years defence spending in China has increased by about 10 percent
annually. [China's growing economic power must at a certain point find
its **expression in military terms**]{.underline}. And we can see from
these figures that [it is building up its **military
power**.]{.underline} The Centre for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington says: "It \[China\] is using the centrality of its power
to persuade other nations that to challenge China on territorial issues
is simply not worth it." This refers to the [nations]{.underline} around
the Pacific [that swing between the US and China depending on the
pressure. China is **constantly testing the ground**]{.underline} to see
how far it can push against American power in the region.

[The Chinese thrust]{.underline} for expansion in Asia [[brings it into
**conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline} with Vietnam, Japan and the
Philippines. The [building of **new islands**]{.underline} to build
bases on [is a **blatant provocation**]{.underline}, not only to these
countries but also [to the **USA**]{.underline}. Can it be that China is
building these military bases in the interest of US imperialism? Nobody
who looks at the real concrete facts of the situation would think so.

Does this mean that there will be a war between America and China? Is it
possible that China can take on the might of US imperialism, or perhaps
supplant it as the dominant imperialist power in the world? We do not
think so. It is clear that [China bears]{.underline} all the [hallmarks
of an **imperialist nation**]{.underline}. But its rise has definite
limits. If the perspective globally was a period of 20 or 30 years of
world boom then [China could challenge the USA for **supremacy on a
world scale**]{.underline}, but that is not the perspective.

China was growing at a rapid rate, but now that process seems to have
reached its limit. [[Growth is **slowing**]{.mark} **down**]{.underline}
and [[the economy could]{.mark} even [enter]{.mark} into
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the coming period. [China's
slowdown is]{.underline} in fact [threatening to drag the world economy
into a **depression**]{.underline}. It is therefore highly unlikely that
on a capitalist basis US imperialism could be supplanted by China. The
bourgeois "experts" said similar things about Japan in the past, until
[Japan entered a period of **chronic economic stagnation**, which has
lasted until the present]{.underline}.

The Godzilla-like image of the virus [[Covid]{.mark}-19]{.underline} has
been [haunting the world]{.underline}. Not only has the virus
[[unraveled **nightmarish possibilities** leading to]{.mark} the
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} of millions of people, but it has
also [served as a [**quintessential case**
revealing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[structural
contradictions]{.mark}**]{.underline} of [[and **existential threats**
posed by **capitalism**]{.mark} on a global scale]{.underline}.

Several researchers agree that Covid-19 is quite an unprecedented virus.
Unlike seasonal influenza, Covid-19 is ten times deadlier, and we have
yet to develop a medical remedy or herd immunity to slow it down; the
best estimates for the development of a vaccine are at least three to
six months away.

The virus's mortality rate seems much lower than earlier pandemics (such
as Ebola \[1994\], Avian flu \[1997\], SARS \[2002\], MERS \[2012\]);
yet the manner in which Covid-19 spreads, i.e., its mode of infectivity,
seems radically different. Unlike earlier pandemics, the virus has
proved infectious even before carriers display any symptoms, which
renders it often undetectable during the 14-day incubation period.

Facts on the Ground

Given that we are unable to detect or cure it, we are completely
helpless against the virus's global march. Emergency measures such as
compulsory quarantines, social-distancing and improved hygiene standards
may temporarily slow down the virus's pace, yet once these measures
begin to be relaxed --- as they surely will be --- it is very likely
that the virus will be at our door again. This grim picture gets even
more complicated by the fact that the virus is likely to go through
several mutations. The virus may increase its adaptability to new
climatic and generational circumstances, hence targeting not only the
elderly, but a broader age group even when summer arrives in the
northern hemisphere.

[Covid-19 is not the first]{.underline} 'modern' [pathogen with **global
consequences**]{.underline}. The [Spanish Flu]{.underline} (1918), for
example, was [sweeping in]{.underline} terms of its [geographical
span]{.underline} as well as [devastating in terms of]{.underline} its
[death toll]{.underline}. As Mike Davis notes, the Spanish flu broke out
at a time when billions were still in the process of being (forcibly)
incorporated into the capitalist world market. The [expansion of
[markets eliminated]{.mark} the **very basis** of
**[safety-first]{.mark} agriculture**]{.underline}, [undermining local
reciprocities and solidarities that traditionally provided welfare to
the poor during crises]{.underline}. Indeed, [[what prepared]{.mark} the
[ground for]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[outbreak]{.mark} and exacerbated
the impact]{.underline} of this early 20th century pathogen
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[deterioration of]{.mark} **nutritional
[standards]{.mark}** [under **market imperatives**]{.mark}]{.underline}
as well as the exigencies and scarcities caused by the Great War.

[[Covid]{.mark}-19]{.underline}, by contrast, has begun its journey and
[taken its biggest toll thus far in the **most advanced** and affluent
parts of the world]{.underline}. This is to say, the
[[contagion]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[no longer limited
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[persistently]{.underline}]{.mark}
[undernourished]{.underline}, [[underdeveloped]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and war-torn [parts of the world]{.mark}]{.underline}; its impact is no
longer restricted to a distant wet market or a third world country
alone. Instead, it has [[**emerged** and **expanded** in the]{.mark}
**very [heart]{.mark}** [of the capitalist]{.mark} world [order]{.mark}
at a time [when capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} has not only been
already firmly established across the globe but has been
[[testing]{.mark} the [**eco-biological limits** of the]{.mark} **entire
[planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Should things remain]{.mark} the same]{.underline}, [[Covid-]{.mark}19
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[future cousins]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[[likely to claim the lives of]{.underline}]{.mark} not just 'some'
people as they did in the past, but of **[[humanity as a
whole]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this sense, perhaps for the first time
in modern history, the [[biological blitzkrieg activated
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[coronavirus]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[thrown into sharp relief]{.underline} the [[**immediately existential**
and **undeniably global** contradictions and consequences]{.mark}
generated by capitalism]{.underline}.

Contradictions on a Global Scale

Critical biologists and [epidemiologists]{.underline} have put the
[blame]{.underline} on [[industri]{.mark}al agriculture as [the **root
cause** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [emergence of **new
[pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the 1990s. According to Rob
Wallace, [giant agribusiness and resource extraction firms]{.underline}
have now [[reached]{.mark} the [last virgin forests and
smallholder]{.mark}-held [farmlands]{.mark} in the world]{.underline},
subordinating them to the logic of capitalist markets.

The [loss of the ecological diversity and complexity of]{.underline}
these [huge tracts of land]{.underline} has increasingly forced wild
food operators to hunt in previously untouched parts of the jungle,
which, in turn, has [[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} "the [[interaction
with]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and spillover of]{.underline}, [[previously
boxed-in pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}, [including
Covid-19]{.underline}." Likewise, [[global warming]{.underline}]{.mark}
has forced or [[allowed pathogens to escape their]{.mark} **natural
[habitat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a result, [[new
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} against which we have no immunity "[are
being **sprung free**]{.underline}, [[threaten]{.mark}ing [the **whole
world**]{.mark}]{.underline}." In short, as John Vidal writes, "we
disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts.
When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it."

That some agribusiness [firms have been [**blatantly risking** lives for
profit]{.mark}]{.underline} would not come as a surprise to the critical
reader. Even Bill Gates has been sounding the alarm about the
potentially deadly consequences of irresponsible business practices and
new viruses. Yet, what tends to remain underemphasized in these debates
is that the blame belongs neither solely to 'greedy' firms that have
driven viruses out of their natural habitat, nor to 'short-sighted'
politicians who have not invested enough in vaccine technology or
national health systems. Instead, the [[problem]{.mark} is [rooted in
the]{.mark} **very [structure]{.mark}** and **rationality** of the
system [as a whole]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is,
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[go **extinct** as a result of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} '[successes]{.underline}' [of the very
system]{.underline} '[we]{.underline}' [created in the **first

[[Imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[involves the **race for
resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [strategic **energy
sources**, such as **hydrocarbons**]{.underline}, but [extending to all
**key minerals**]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} vital
[germplasm, foods, forests, land, and]{.underline} even [water. For the
**core capitalist countries**]{.underline} [the issue of **environmental
[limits]{.mark}** has [signaled]{.mark}]{.underline}---if
anything---[the [need to **control resources in the**]{.mark} **global
[South]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The most extreme case of [ecological
[imperialism is]{.mark}]{.underline} what Richard Haass (president for
the past twelve years of the Council of Foreign Relations, and before
that director of policy planning in the State Department under Colin
Powell during the 2003 invasion of Iraq) is calling **[[The New Thirty
Years' War]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the Middle East, aimed at the
control of]{.underline} a significant portion of world
**[oil]{.underline}** supplies. Moreover, this New Thirty Years' War
[is]{.underline} only [[part of]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S-led
[[NATO]{.mark} alliance['s]{.mark} grand [strategy to bring the]{.mark}
whole]{.underline} vast geopolitical arc, now known as the "[**[arc of
instability]{.mark}**," [from]{.mark} **Eastern
[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [the **Balkans**]{.underline} [[to
the **Middle East**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [**North
[Africa]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **Central [Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline},
within the triad's sphere of influence---viewing it all as up for grabs
following the Soviet Union's departure from the historical stage in the
early 1990s.44 So aggressive has this imperial advance been in the not
quite quarter-century since the demise of the USSR that what [is now
being called a **Second Cold War with Russia**]{.underline} [appears to
be developing]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} growing **[race for resources]{.underline}** behind
the current geopolitical struggle [is [feeding]{.mark} a **new
extractivism**, extending to **every corner of the earth**]{.underline},
and increasingly [to the **Arctic**---where melting]{.underline} sea
[ice from **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline} is opening up new
realms [for oil exploration]{.underline}. According to energy analyst
Michael Klare this scramble for global resources can only point in one
direction:

The accumulation of aggravations and resentments among the Great Powers
stemming from the competitive pursuit of energy has not yet reached the
point where a violent clash between any pair or group of them can be
considered likely.... Nevertheless, the [conflation of two key
trends---the rise of **[energy nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} accumulating [ill will]{.mark} between the
**Sino-Russian** and **U.S.-Japanese proto-blocs**---[should be]{.mark}
taken as a **[dangerous]{.mark} sign for the future**]{.underline}. Each
of these phenomena may have its own roots, but the way [they are
beginning to intertwine in **competitive struggles over prime
energy-producing**]{.underline} [areas in [the **Caspian**]{.mark} **Sea
basin**, the **[Persia]{.mark}n Gulf**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} [the
**E**]{.mark}**ast [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea** is
**[ominous]{.mark}**]{.underline}.... [\[I\]f national [leaders]{.mark}
fear the loss of a major field to a **rival state**]{.underline} and are
convinced that global energy supplies may be inadequate in a "tough oil"
era, [they may [act **irrationally and order**]{.mark} **a muscular show
of [force]{.mark}**---setting in motion a chain of events whose ultimate
course **no one may be able to control**]{.underline}.

The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and other more recent events, have
given national leaders some experience in managing such inherently
perilous encounters. But [no one in recent times has had to contend with
a world of many **aggressive powers**]{.underline} competing for
increasingly scarce and valuable resources on a global basis---[often in
regions that are **inherently unstable**]{.underline} and already [on
the **edge of conflict**. Preventing a complex struggle of this sort
from **erupting** into **unimaginable slaughter calls**]{.underline}
[for **cool heads** at the best of times; doing so when
**[conditions]{.mark} begin to [deteriorate]{.mark}** [may
**exceed**]{.mark} **the [capabilities of]{.mark} even the [most
lucid]{.mark} and accomplished [leaders]{.mark}**.]{.underline}45

[The rise of]{.underline} various [unconventional sources of fossil
fuels]{.underline} in recent years is part of the feverish search for
hydrocarbons worldwide, and while temporarily easing supply concerns
(especially due to fracking), it [has not materially altered the
**frantic global scramble for fossil fuels**]{.underline}.

Economically, the [outward movement of generalized-monopoly
capitalism]{.underline} is propelled primarily by the competitive
struggle for low cost position via global sourcing of labor and
increasingly scarce raw materials, and the monopoly rents that all of
this generates. The result, as we have seen, [is **enormous [cost
savings]{.mark}** in production for **individual monopolistic
enterprises**, [generat]{.mark}ing **widening [profit]{.mark} margins**,
[which]{.mark}, coupled with more traditional forms of tribute, [leads
to]{.mark} a continual inflow of **imperial [rent]{.mark}**]{.underline}
to the center of the system. [The]{.underline} full extent of [extracted
surplus is **disguised**]{.underline} by the enormous complexity of
global value chains, exchange ratios, hidden accounts, and above all by
the nature of capitalist GDP accounting itself.46 [A part of the
imperialist rent remains in the **peripheral country** and is not
transferred to the center, but constitutes rather a payment to local
ruling classes for their roles in the globalization game]{.underline}.
About \$21 trillion of this global tribute, meanwhile, is currently
parked abroad in tax-haven islands, "the fortified refuge of Big
Finance."47

[At the center of the capitalist economy the tendency to **economic
stagnation**]{.underline} has been increasingly asserting itself since
the mid-1970s. This induced [repeated]{.underline} attempts [to
stimulate]{.underline} the system [through **[military
spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with the United States as the engine.48
This strategy proved to be limited, however, since a big enough boost to
the capitalist economy by these means in today's environment [would need
to [assume]{.mark} the **dimension of a [world
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Under these circumstances, as [corporations]{.underline} in the 1970s
and '80s sought to hold onto and expand their growing economic surplus
in the face of diminishing investment opportunities, they
[poured]{.underline} their massive [surpluses into the **financial
structure**, seeking]{.underline} and obtaining rapid returns from the
securitization of all conceivably ascertainable future income streams.
Increased concentration ("mergers and acquisitions") and its attendant
new debt, securitizations representing the income stream of
already-existing mortgages and consumer debt that piled new debt on old,
and new issues of debt and equity that capitalized the potential future
monopoly income of patent, copyright, and other intellectual property
rights, all followed one another. The financial sector provided every
sort of financial instrument that could arguably be serviced by a
putative income stream, including from the trading in financial
instruments themselves. The result, as Magdoff and Sweezy already
documented in the early stages of the process from the late 1970s to the
'90s, was a vast increase in the financial superstructure of the
capitalist economy.

This **[financialization]{.underline}** of the economy had three major
effects. First, it [served to further]{.underline} uncouple in space and
time---though a complete uncoupling is impossible---the amassing of
financial claims of wealth or "asset accumulation" from actual
investment, i.e., **[capital [accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
meant that the leading [capitalist economies became characterized by a
**long-term amassing of financial wealth**]{.underline} [that exceeded
the growth of the **underlying economy**]{.underline} (a phenomenon
recently emphasized in a neoclassical vein by Thomas
Piketty)---[creating a more **destabilized capitalist
order**]{.underline} in the center, [[manifested in]{.mark} the dramatic
rise of **[debt]{.mark}** as a **share of GDP**]{.underline}. Second,
the [financialization]{.underline} process [became the major
basis]{.underline} (together with the revolution in communications and
digitalized technology) [for a deepening and broadening of
commodification **throughout the globe**]{.underline}, with the center
economies no longer constituting to the same extent as before the global
centers of industrial production and capital accumulation, [but rather
relying more and more on their role as the **centers of financial
control**]{.underline} [and **asset accumulation**. This was dependent
on the capture of streams of commodity income throughout the world
economy]{.underline}, including the increased commodification of other
sectors---primarily services that were only partially commodified
previously, such as communications, education, and health services.
Third, "the financialization of the capital accumulation process," as
Sweezy called it, [[led to]{.mark} an enormous increase in the
**[fragility of the]{.mark} entire capitalist world [economy]{.mark}**,
which became **[dependent on]{.mark} the [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of the]{.mark} **financial [superstructure]{.mark}** relative to its
**productive base**, with the result that the system was increasingly
[prone to]{.mark} **asset [bubbles]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
**periodically [burst]{.mark}**[, threatening]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[stability]{.mark} of global capitalism]{.underline}** as a
whole---[most recently in the Great Financial Crisis of]{.underline}
2007--[2009. Given its]{.underline} financial [ascendancy, the United
States is uniquely able to externalize its economic crises on **other
economies**, particularly those of the **global South**]{.underline}. As
Yanis Varoufakis notes in The Global Minotaur, "[To this day, whenever a
crisis looms, **capital flees to the greenback**]{.underline}. This is
exactly why the Crash of 2008 led to a mass inflow of foreign capital to
the dollar, even though the crisis had begun on Wall Street."49

The phase of global monopoly-finance capital, tied to the globalization
of production and the systematization of imperial rent, has generated a
financial oligarchy and a return to dynastic wealth, mostly in the core
nations, confronting an increasingly generalized (but also highly
segmented) working class worldwide. The leading section of the
capitalist class in the core countries now consists of what could be
called global rentiers, dependent on the growth of global
monopoly-finance capital, and its increasing concentration and
centralization.50 The reproduction of this new imperialist system, as
Amin explains in Capitalism in the Age of Globalization, rests on the
perpetuation of five monopolies: (1) technological monopoly; (2)
financial control of worldwide markets; (3) monopolistic access to the
planet's natural resources; (4) media and communication monopolies; and
(5) monopolies over weapons of mass destruction.51 Behind all of this
lie the giant monopolistic firms themselves, with the revenue of the top
500 global private firms currently equal to about 30 percent of world
revenue, funneled primarily through the centers of the capitalist system
and the core financial markets.52 As Boron points out with respect to
the world's 200 largest multinational corporations, "96 percent...have
their headquarters in only eight countries, are legally registered as
incorporated companies of eight countries; and their boards of directors
sit in eight countries of metropolitan capital. Less than 2 percent of
their boards of directors' members are non-nationals.... Their reach is
global, but their property and their owners have a clear national
base."53

The internationalization of production under the regime of giant,
multinational corporations thus follows a pattern first explained by
Stephen Hymer, and recently underscored by Ernesto Screpatini, who
writes that "the great multinational companies" are characterized by
"decentralized production but centralized control.... As a consequence
the process of expansion of foreign direct investments involves a
constant flow of profits from the South to the North, that is, from the
Periphery to the Center of the imperial power of multinational
capital."54

[Today the **threatened [implosion]{.mark}** of this [system is
**everywhere**]{.mark} **apparent**. U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony in the
military sphere]{.underline}---in which it retains the power to unleash
untold destruction but has a diminishing power to control geopolitical
events---[[is **receding**]{.underline}]{.mark} along with its economic
hegemony. [This is so well understood]{.underline} today within U.S.
foreign policy circles [that some of the sharpest establishment thinkers
emphasize that U.S. global preeminence is giving way to an
**imperium**]{.underline} [based on the **combined force**]{.underline}
(military, economic, and political) of the triad of the United
States/Canada, Western Europe, and Japan. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, although still retaining global preeminence, [is
increasingly able to exercise its power as a]{.underline}
"**[sheriff]{.underline}**" [only when backed up by the
"**posse**"]{.underline} (represented by Western Europe and Japan)---as
famously articulated by Haass in The Reluctant Sheriff and subsequent
works.55 It is thus [[the]{.mark} U.S.-led [triad]{.mark}]{.underline},
and not Washington itself directly, [which increasingly seeks to
[establish itself]{.mark} as the **new governing power**]{.underline},
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} such institutions as the G7 and
[**[NATO]{.mark}**. The goal is to [promote]{.mark} the [interests of
the **old**]{.mark} **imperial [powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
the]{.mark} **capitalist [core]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through
political, economic, and military means, while containing threats to its
rule by a rising China, a recovering Russia, emerging economies
generally, and the global **anti-neoliberal revolt**]{.underline} based
in Latin America's movement toward socialism.

Haass describes the current world situation as "**[[The
Unraveling]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [As evidence he [points to]{.mark}
the U.S. role in [destabilizing the **Middle East** and]{.mark} **North
[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [rise of the]{.underline} Islamic
State of Iraq and al-Sham ([**[ISIS]{.mark}**), the growing conflicts of
[the]{.mark} United States with]{.underline} China over the
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea [and Africa, the return of **[Russia]{.mark}
as a world power**]{.underline} (manifested in the dispute over the
Crimea and the Ukraine), [the **misdirection**]{.underline} (in his
terms) [of states such as "Brazil, Chile, Cuba, and Venezuela," as well
as a whole failed set of regime changes initiated by
Washington]{.underline}. He concludes: "[The question is not whether the
world will continue to unravel but **how fast** and **how
far**]{.underline}."56

All of [this [highlights]{.mark}]{.underline}, as István Mészáros tells
us, "[[the]{.mark} **potentially [deadliest phase of
imperialism]{.mark}**."]{.underline}57 It is perhaps a reminder of the
seriousness of the world situation today that Soviet and U.S.
[climatologists alerted the world in the 1980s to the fact that a
**full-scale [nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline} [would
[generate]{.mark} a **nuclear [winter]{.mark}**]{.underline}, reducing
the temperatures of whole continents by several degrees and possibly
several tens of degrees, destroying much of the biosphere itself and
with it humanity. It was this type of scenario that E.P. Thompson had in
mind in his "Notes on Exterminism, the Last Stage of Civilization."58 A
war between the great powers does not appear to be an imminent danger at
present. However, the [**[instability]{.mark} generated** [by
the]{.mark} **hyper-exploitative** and **expansionist
[imperialist]{.mark}** world [system]{.mark} of today, led by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [which is now [engaged
in]{.mark} simultaneous **military [interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and drone warfare in a half dozen countries (and which is [planning to
spend \$**200 billion dollars**]{.underline} in the next decade
[[modernizing]{.mark} its massive [nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}), suggests any number of ways in which a
deadly confrontation could emerge. **[[Climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself, with the continuation of business
as usual, [is expected to [**destabilize civilization**,
heightening]{.mark} the]{.underline} threat of a [**world
[war]{.mark}**, which would quickly [lead to]{.mark} a **planetary level
of [destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.59

[[The responsibility]{.mark} of the left]{.underline} under these
circumstances **[[is to confront]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in Lenin's
terms, the "[[contradictions]{.mark}, conflicts, and
convulsions]{.underline}---not only economical, but also political,
national, etc."---[that increasingly characterize our era. [This means
fostering a]{.mark} more "**[audacious" global movement from
below]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which [the key challenge will be the
**[dismantling of imperialism]{.mark}**, understood as **[the]{.mark}
entire [basis of capitalism in our time]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[with
the object of creating a more **horizontal**]{.underline}, egalitarian,
peaceful, and sustainable **[social-metabolic order]{.underline}**

**[Why imperialism now?]{.underline}**

Most analysts of imperialism locate the seat of imperial power as
residing in the US for the majority of the post-World War Two period.
Since then, [the US has been engaged in a]{.underline} more or less
overt [project to project its power globally via military and financial
dominance. Challenges]{.underline} to these efforts [**have existed**
in]{.underline} the form of both foreign and [**domestic opposition to
US policy**.]{.underline} The most obvious examples would likely be the
opposition to US military intervention in Vietnam and Iraq in the
1960-1970s and 2000s respectively. [Geopolitical and **ideological
opposition to US hegemony has persisted**]{.underline} even since the
decline of Soviet \'communism\', emerging in South America, for
instance, under the banner of ALBA (Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos
de Nuestra America).

A number of signals point to ongoing challenges to US imperial hegemony.
[The US\'s own military [strategists]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Strategic Studies Institute, aligned to the US Army and Department of
Defence, [recently published a paper lamenting what they [saw]{.mark} as
the US as [an **imperial power in decline**]{.mark}. The report stops
short of explicitly using the **concept of Empire**, instead speaking
euphemistically of\'a more competitive, **post-primacy
environment\'**]{.underline}.9 They suggest that this environment is
being brought about by, on the one hand, \'the increasing vulnerability,
erosion, and, in some cases, the loss of an assumed US military
advantage vis-a-vis many of its most consequential defence-relevant
challenges\'.10 On the other hand, [they point to the \'volatile and
uncertain restructuring of international security affairs in ways that
appear to be increasingly hostile to unchallenged US
leadership]{.underline}. In light of these \'challenges; one of their
objectives is to \'create, preserve, and extend US military
advantage\'.11 While not directly representing US foreign policy, [the
document provides an insight into understanding the US military elite\'s
**[insecurities]{.mark} over their status**]{.underline}. These
[insecurities must be [borne in mind]{.mark} when trying to come to
terms with recent attempts to [reassert]{.mark} US [power via]{.mark}
**spectacular military [interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as
the dropping of the perversely named \'Mother of All Bombs\'.12

It is also through the lens of an imperial power in decline that we can
better understand the Trump project more broadly. [A [combination
of]{.mark} **imperial [nostalgia]{.mark}**, along with the **perceived
threat from China**]{.underline} and others, [helps to [account for
**Trump**]{.mark}**\'s vow to \'Make America Great Again\'**. [China,
the]{.mark} US Right\'s main scapegoat in the story of its **imperial
decline**, [has]{.mark} itself enthusiastically **[adopted the mantle of
an]{.mark} emerging [imperial power]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In a
throwback to the heady days of the Han dynasty, [China has embarked
on]{.underline} the [building]{.underline} of a \'new Silk Road\'
([O]{.underline}ne [B]{.underline}elt [O]{.underline}ne
[R]{.underline}oad), as well as being implicated in various
neo-colonialist land grabs across East Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.13

Imperial nostalgia and its attendant rhetoric is in vogue beyond the US
and rival superpowers such as China, however. With \'Brexit\' dominating
the parochial policy agenda of the UK, civil servant talk has been of
establishing \'Empire 2.0\'.14 Meanwhile, survivors of Empire Version
1.0 are yet to have seen any form of reparatory justice for that phase
of history.15 Elsewhere in Europe, France, lacking the imagination to
think past neoliberalism, successfully avoided the authoritarian
populism of the Front National by installing a centrist technocrat as
President. President Macron promptly caused outrage by suggesting that
Africa had \'civ-ilisational problems, continuing the unveiled racism
long since accompanying French imperialism.16 That Macron\'s electoral
success came against the openly racist authoritarian populist Marine Le
Pen, only serves to further underscore the progressive deficit exhibited
in the politics of so many post-, or neo-, imperial states.

[[Accompanying]{.mark} trends of **imperial nostalgia**]{.underline}
[and **empire-building**]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} the
[emergence]{.mark}]{.underline}, in some cases persistence,
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of **[authoritarian [populist
projects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as: Narendra Modi\'s BJP in India;
Manuel Duterte in the Philippines; Recep Erdogan in Turkey; Victor Orban
in Hungary; Yoweri Museveni in Rwanda; Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe; and
Putin in Russia.17 [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} politics
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[underpinned by]{.mark} a rhetoric of
**aggressive [nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, in
some cases, **[expansionism]{.underline}**. Hence [the
[sentiment]{.mark} used to shore up these projects [is]{.mark}
frequently [similar]{.mark} in tone [to]{.mark} the [rhetoric employed
by]{.mark} the Great [Imperial powers at]{.mark} the [height of their
**racist**]{.mark} **colonisation [projects]{.mark}**. While it is
unclear what the trends towards authoritarian populism will
bring]{.underline}, it is fairly clear that [progressive movements will
need to retain, or indeed recall, the **notion of
imperialism**]{.underline} in order **[to accurately understand and
oppose them]{.underline}**.

Globally, [social [movements]{.mark} sensitive to]{.underline} the
[interconnected dimensions of **class**, **race**, **gender**, **ecology
and empire** [are emerging. These]{.mark} [include mobilisations]{.mark}
in the US **[against White Supremacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or [against
indigenous ecological genocide at Standing Rock; mass student uprisings
in Chile; and the much-discussed Arab uprisings.]{.underline} Examples
of **[encouraging [state-level solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to
these questions are wanting, a fact that perhaps [points to the
**inadequacies of the**]{.mark} **nation [state]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[as an entity [through which **empire might**]{.mark} **successfully [be
opposed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is nevertheless clear that [any
serious political project to push for progressive alternatives must
necessarily contain an **analysis**]{.underline} [and
**critique**]{.underline} [of **contemporary forms of
imperialism**]{.underline}, [as well as attendant forms of **global
solidarity**]{.underline}.

[[weaken]{.mark} international alliances and **[multilateral]{.mark}

**presumed distinction** between responsible and irresponsible nuclear
powers]{.underline} and complicates attempts to heal rifts in the

A sustainable strategy to deal with the challenge posed by populists
would need to start by recognizing that [we can no longer
assume]{.underline} that [nuclear weapons are safe in the hands
of]{.underline} some [states]{.underline} but not in others'.

Introduction

The rise of nationalist populists1 to power in nuclear-armed states and
their allies is undermining the nuclear order and raising the risks of
nuclear war. That populists such as Boris
[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}, Narendra [[Modi]{.underline}]{.mark},
Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} were able to [take [charge]{.mark} of
**nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including in some of the
nuclear powers recognized under the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), challenges the assumption that established
nuclear-weapon states behave responsibly. Nationalist populism,2
understood as a nationalist, anti-elitist, illiberal, and anti-pluralist
set of ideas and politics conducted in the supposed interests of "the
people" --- that is, the domestic constituencies of the
nationalist-populist leaders---has been on the rise globally since the
mid-2000s. It has come to include the leadership of a growing number of
countries3 and has begun to influence the effectiveness of time-honored
institutions of the nuclear order.

We argue that this rise of nationalist populists and their foreign and
defense policies weakens the nuclear order in novel, significant, and
persistent ways. Three [characteristics]{.underline} are [typical of
nationalist populists' nuclear policies]{.underline}: they [[talk
differently]{.mark} about nuclear weapons]{.underline}; they
[have]{.underline} a [specific way of getting [involved in national
decision making]{.mark}]{.underline} on nuclear-weapon issues;
[and]{.underline} their [approach to international
alliances]{.underline} and institutions is [unique]{.underline}. The
fact that nationalist-populist leaders have assumed control over nuclear
weapons in countries at the core of the nuclear order
[[shatters]{.underline}]{.mark} the presumed [[distinction
between]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[responsible]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[irresponsible]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
**[nuclear [powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These [leaders
threaten]{.underline} the [[nuclear order built on]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**principled acceptance** of]{.underline} a logic of
[[restraint]{.mark} by the nuclear-weapon states]{.underline}.

wealth]{.mark}]{.underline},["]{.underline} as David Bollier and later
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri note, [has been increasingly
[privatized]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 In 2010, the financial wealth of the
world\'s high-net-worth individuals (with investable assets of \$1 to
\$50 million or more \[all money amounts are in U.S. dollars\] )
surpassed the 2007 pre-financial crisis peak, growing 9.7 percent and
reaching \$42.7 trillion. Also in 2010 the global population of high-net­
worth individuals grew 8.3 percent to 10.9 million.13 In 2010, the
global population was 6.9 billion, of whom there were 1,000
billionaires; 80,000 ultra-high-net-worth individuals with average
wealth exceeding \$50 mil­ lion; 3 billion with an average wealth of
\$10,000, of which 1.1 billion owned less than \$1,000; and 2.5 billion
who were reportedly \"unbanked\'\' (without a bank account and thus
living on the margins of the formal financial system) .14 [In a world
where financial advantage brings with it political benefits, these
figures attest to the weak position the majority of the world occupies
in the arena of environmental and climate change politics.]{.underline}
[[Neoliberal capitalism ameliorates]{.mark} the threat posed by
[environmental change by taking control of the collective call it issues
forth, splintering the collective into a disparate]{.mark} and confusing
[array of]{.mark} individual [choices]{.mark}]{.underline} competing
with one another over how best to solve the crisis. Through this process
of competition, [the collective nature of [the crisis is restructured
and privatized, then put to work for]{.mark} the production and
[circulation of capital]{.mark} as the average wealth of the world\'s
high-net-worth individuals grows at the expense of the majority of the
world living in abject poverty. Advocating that the free market can
solve debilitating environmental changes and the climate crisis is not a
political response to these problems; it is merely a political ghost
emptied of its collective aspirations.]{.underline}

#### War is explained through [militarized accumulation]{.underline}.

Militarized Accumulation

The Russian invasion --- brutal, reckless and condemnable by any
standard --- has sparked debate on NATO's proposed expansion into
Ukraine and the role that it played in motivating the Kremlin. U.S.
officials were keenly aware, in fact, that [the drive [to **expand
NATO**]{.mark} to Russian borders would eventually [push Moscow
into]{.mark} a **military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "We examine
a wide range of nonviolent measures that could exploit Russia's actual
vulnerabilities and anxieties as a way of stressing Russia's military
and economy and the regime's political standing at home and abroad,"
notes a 2019 study by the RAND Corporation, a Pentagon-affiliated think
tank. "The steps we examine would not have either defense or deterrence
as their prime purpose," it states, but rather, "these steps are
conceived of as elements in a campaign designed to unbalance the
adversary, leading Russia to compete in domains or regions where the
United States has a competitive advantage, and causing Russia to
overextend itself militarily or economically."

But the provocation could not be reduced to geopolitical competition,
however important, as most observers were keen to do.
[Missing]{.underline} from the larger picture [was the centrality of
**[militarized accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [--- of endless low-
and high-intensity warfare, simmering conflicts, civil strife and
policing --- to the **global political economy**]{.underline}.
Militarized accumulation refers to a situation in which [a global war
economy relies on the state to **[organize war]{.mark}-making**,
**social control and repression** [to **sustain capital**]{.mark}
**accumulation**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the [face of]{.mark}
**chronic [stagnation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **saturation of global
markets**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} state-organized [practices
are outsourced]{.underline} to transnational corporate capital,
[involving the fusion of private accumulation with state militarization
in order to sustain the process of capital accumulation. Cycles of
destruction and reconstruction provide **ongoing outlets for
over-accumulated capital**]{.underline}; that is, [these cycles open up
**new profit-making opportunities**]{.underline} for transnational
capitalists seeking ongoing opportunities to profitably reinvest the
enormous amounts of cash they have accumulated. [There is a convergence
in this process of global capitalism's political **need for social
control** and **repression**]{.underline} [in the face of **mounting
popular discontent worldwide**]{.underline} [and its economic need to
perpetuate accumulation in the face of stagnation]{.underline}.

[[Wars provide]{.mark} **critical [economic
stimulus]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They have]{.underline} historically
[pulled the capitalist system **out of accumulation crises** while they
serve to deflect attention from political tensions and problems of
legitimacy]{.underline}. It took **[World War II]{.underline}** [to
finally lift world capitalism out of the]{.underline} Great [Depression.
**The Cold War**]{.underline} [legitimated a half century of expanding
military budgets]{.underline} and the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, the longest
in history, helped keep the economy sputtering along in the face of
chronic stagnation in the first two decades of the century. [From
the]{.underline} anti-Communist fervor of the [Cold War, to the "war on
terror," then the]{.underline} so-called [New Cold War, and
now]{.underline} the Russian invasion of [Ukraine, the transnational
[elite]{.mark}]{.underline}, led by Washington, [have had to [conjure
**up one enemy after another**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **legitimate
militarized accumulation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[deflect [crises of]{.mark} state [legitimacy]{.mark} and capitalist
hegemony]{.underline}** [[onto **external enemies**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and **contrived threats**]{.underline}.

The events of [September 11]{.underline}, 2001, marked the
[start]{.underline} of an era of a **[permanent global
war]{.underline}** [in which logistics, warfare, intelligence,
repression, surveillance and even military personnel are more and more
the **privatized domain of transnational capita**]{.underline}l. The
Pentagon budget increased 91 percent in real terms between 1998 and
2011, while worldwide, [total state military budget outlays grew by 50
percent]{.underline} from 2006 to 2015, from \$1.4 trillion to more than
\$2 trillion. (This figure does not take into account the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent on intelligence; contingency operations;
policing; bogus wars against immigrants, terrorism and drugs; and
"homeland security.") During this time, [military-industrial complex
profits **quadrupled**]{.underline}.

However, focusing just on state military budgets only gives us a part of
the picture of the global war economy. As I showed in my 2020 book, The
Global Police State, [the various [wars]{.mark}, conflicts and campaigns
of social control and repression around the world [involve]{.mark} the
**[fusion of]{.mark} private [accumulation with]{.mark} state
[militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this relationship, the [state
facilitates the expansion of opportunities for private capital to
**accumulate through militarization**]{.underline}, such as by
[facilitating global weapons sales by military-industrial-security
firms, the amounts of which have reached unprecedented
leve]{.underline}ls. Global weapons sales by the top 100 weapons
manufacturers and military service companies increased by 38 percent
between 2002 and 2016 and can be expected to escalate further in the
face of a prolonged war in Ukraine.

Said one consultant to Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and
Raytheon Technologies: "For the defense industry, **[happy days are here
again]{.underline}**.

By 2018, private for-profit military companies employed some 15 million
people around the world, while another 20 million people worked in
private security worldwide. The private security (policing) business is
one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in many countries and has
come to dwarf public security around the world. The amount spent on
private security in 2003, the year of the invasion of Iraq, was 73
percent higher than that spent in the public sphere, and three times as
many persons were employed in private forces as in official law
enforcement agencies. In half of the world's countries, private security
agents outnumber police officers.

These corporate soldiers and police were deployed to guard corporate
property, provide personal security for executives and their families;
collect data; conduct police, paramilitary, counterinsurgency and
surveillance operations; carry out mass crowd control and repression of
protesters; run private detention and interrogation facilities; manage
prisons and participate in outright warfare. Now, these same private
military and security firms are pouring into Ukraine, with some
mercenary companies offering between \$1,000 and \$2,000 a day for those
with combat experience.

The Russian invasion has accelerated but did not originate the ongoing
surge in military spending around the world. It is notable that state
military spending worldwide skyrocketed in the wake of the 2008 global
financial collapse even beyond the post-9/11 spending hike, rising from
about \$1.5 billion in 2008 to over \$2 trillion in 2022. The fact that
this explosion in spending coincides perfectly with continued worldwide
stagnation following the Great Recession suggests that the heightened
militarization of the global economy is as much or more a response to
this chronic stagnation than to perceived security threats. If bursts of
militarized accumulation (such as that unleashed by 9/11, then by the
2008 financial collapse, and now by the Russian invasion) help offset
the overaccumulation crisis further into the future, they are also
high-risk bets that heighten worldwide tensions and push the world
dangerously towards all-out international conflagration.

The Crisis of Global Capitalism

[This crisis of global capitalism is **economic**]{.underline}, or
structural, [one of **chronic stagnation in the global
economy**]{.underline}. But [it is also **political**: [a crisis
of]{.mark} **state [legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
**capitalist [hegemony]{.mark}**[. The system is moving towards "a
**general crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline} of capitalist rule" [as billions
of people around the world face **uncertain struggles for
survival**]{.underline} [and question a system they no **longer see as
legitimate**. Historically,]{.underline} [wars have pulled the
capitalist system **out of crisis**]{.underline} while they serve to
deflect attention from political tensions and problems of legitimacy.

Economically, [global [capitalism faces]{.mark}]{.underline} what is
known in technical language as
"**[[overaccumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**": a situation in which [the
economy has produced]{.underline} --- or has the capacity to produce ---
[great quantities of wealth but the market **cannot absorb
this**]{.underline} wealth because of escalating inequality. [Capitalism
by its very nature will produce abundant wealth yet polarize that wealth
and generate ever **greater levels of social inequality**]{.underline}
unless offset by redistributive policies. [The level of global social
[polarization]{.mark} and inequality]{.underline} now experienced
[[is]{.mark} **[without precedent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2018, the
richest 1 percent of humanity controlled more than half of the world's
wealth while the bottom 80 percent had to make do with just 5 percent.
The international development agency Oxfam reported in January that
during the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, the 10 richest
men in the world more than doubled their fortunes, from \$700 billion to
\$1.5 trillion, while 99 percent of humanity saw a fall in their income
and 160 million more people fell into poverty.

Such [[inequalities]{.mark} end up **[undermin]{.mark}ing the [stability
of the system]{.mark}**]{.underline} as the gap grows between what is
--- or could be --- produced and what the market can absorb.
[The]{.underline} extreme [concentration]{.underline} of the planet's
wealth in the hands of the few and the accelerated impoverishment and
dispossession of the majority means that [the transnational capitalist
class]{.underline}, or TCC, [has increasing difficulty in finding
productive outlets to unload enormous amounts of surplus it
accumulated.]{.underline} In the years leading up to the pandemic, there
was a steady rise in underutilized capacity and a slowdown in industrial
production around the world. The surplus of accumulated capital with
nowhere to go expanded rapidly. Transnational corporations recorded
record profits during the 2010s at the same time that corporate
investment declined. Along with militarized accumulation, [the TCC has
turned to unprecedented levels of **financial speculation**]{.underline}
and to debt-driven growth to sustain profit-making in the face of the
crisis. If left unchecked, [overaccumulation [results in
**crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in stagnation, recessions,
[**depressions**, **social upheavals**]{.underline} [[and
**war**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [just what **we are
experiencing**]{.underline} right now.

But [there is a related dynamic at work]{.underline} in the global war
economy: [the need for [dominant groups]{.mark} to **[suppress]{.mark}
mass [discontent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **deflect the crisis of
state legitimacy**. International [frictions **escalate**]{.mark} as
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}, in their efforts to retain legitimacy,
[seek to **[sublimate]{.mark} social and political
[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and to **keep the social order from
fracturing**]{.underline}. All around the world, a "[people's
Spring]{.underline}" has taken off. [From Chile to Lebanon, Iraq to
India, France to the United States, Haiti to Nigeria, South Africa to
Colombia, Jordan to Sri Lanka, waves of strikes and mass [protests have
**proliferated**]{.mark}]{.underline} and, in some instances, [appear to
be acquiring **an anti-capitalist character**. Wars and external enemies
allow the ruling groups to **deflect attention away**]{.underline} from
domestic malaise in their effort to maintain a grip on power as the
crisis deepens.

In the U.S., this [[sublimation]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[involved]{.mark} efforts to channel social [unrest towards
**scapegoated communities**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as immigrants or
other marginalized groups --- this is [one **key function of
racism**]{.underline} [and was a [core]{.mark} component [of]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} government's political strategy ---
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} towards an external enemy such as [[**China**
or **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which had clearly become [a
cornerstone of the Biden]{.underline} government['s strategy well
before]{.underline} the Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}. U.S.
presidents historically reach their highest approval ratings when they
launch wars. George W. [Bush reached an all-time-high of 90 percent in
2001 as his administration geared up to invade Afghanistan]{.underline},
and his father George H.W. Bush achieved an 89 percent approval rating
in 1991, right as the U.S. declared the end of its (first) invasion of
Iraq and the "liberation of Kuwait."

[[It is **unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [an increasing
[militarization]{.mark}]{.underline} of the world economy
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} in the long run [[offset]{.mark} either the
economic or the political dimensions of [the crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}
of global capitalism. [Global [capitalism is emerging]{.mark}
from]{.underline} the [coronavirus]{.underline} pandemic [[with **more
inequality**]{.mark}, **more [authoritarianism]{.mark}**, more
**[militarization]{.mark}**, and more **civic and political
strife**]{.underline}. In the U.S., [class [struggle is **heating
up**]{.mark}, with a wave of strikes and of unionization
drives]{.underline} in Amazon, Starbucks, and elsewhere in the gig
economy. [The current **[inflation]{.mark}ary spiral** [and the
**escalation of class struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United
States [and around the world [point to]{.mark} the **[inability]{.mark}
of the ruling groups [to]{.mark} [contain the]{.mark} expanding
[crisis]{.mark}**. The drive]{.underline} by the capitalist state [to
externalize the political fallout]{.underline} of the crisis [increases
the danger that **international tensions**]{.underline} [and
**[localized conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as in Ukraine [will
**[snowball]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[into]{.mark} broader
**international [conflagrations]{.mark} of unforeseen
consequences**]{.underline}.

As the Ukraine crisis continues to drag on and the global revolt
escalates, [there will be a **radical [reconfiguration of]{.mark} global
geopolitical [alignments]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} the
[drumbeat of]{.mark} **escalating [turbulence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the world economy [that will [feed]{.mark} new **political
[upheavals]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **violent [conflicts]{.mark}**, making
global capitalism **all the more volatile**]{.underline}. While it is
hard to imagine a return to the status quo antebellum in Eastern Europe,
in the larger picture, the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis [is not the
cause but a consequence of the **general crisis of global capitalism**.
That]{.underline} crisis [will **only get worse**. **[Fasten your seat
belts]{.mark}**]{.underline}; it will get much worse.

### ! --- Unsustainable --- T/L

#### Sustainable capitalism is an oxymoron: *No decoupling, cost internalization's impossible, and the law of the resource pyramid negates benefits of innovation.*

13[.3 Three Aspects of the **Impossibility** of a **Sustainable
Capitalism**]{.underline}

The logic of the impossibility of a sustainable capitalism is concretely
proven in numerous aspects of its modus operandi. Let us isolate three
aspects of this impossibility.

But before that, it is best to start by giving voice not to pure and
staunch liberals like Milton Friedman, but to those who believe that
capitalism has nothing to fear from environmental regulation. Many of
them reject a defensive stance and put themselves on the offensive,
claiming that environmental sustainability and increased profits are not
only compatible but reciprocally strengthen each other in a virtuous
circle.

If I am not mistaken, the [advocates of this thesis prefer the following
argument: adopting **innovative solutions** to increase the
**efficiency** of the input/product or product/waste ratio and improve
environmental safety in the production process]{.underline}
[increases]{.underline} the company's **[competitiveness]{.underline}**
(as opposed to reducing it) because it is a value-generating process, be
it in terms of risk management, brand image, and, finally, effective
financial results. [If this is true, then taking the lead and being at
the forefront of economic processes with lower environmental impact and
risk will ensure a better profitabilit]{.underline}y than the average
profit rate. I hope to not underestimate the literature on the business
and sustainability binomial by saying that it limits itself to
elaborating variations on this theme while offering several case studies
on the direct relationship between sustainability and profitability.
There are a growing number of economists and NGOs committed to
encouraging companies to embrace this belief. They naturally render a
tremendous service to society and to the companies themselves through
their work. [However]{.underline}, their [success is limited by the
**[three aspects]{.mark}** that **[render]{.mark} an environmentally
[sustainable capitalism impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as stated in
the title of this section.

**[[(1)]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Decoupling and Circular Economy]{.underline}

**[Decoupling]{.underline}** [is the hope that **eco-efficient
technologies**]{.underline} and production processes [in industrialized
countries with mature economies will **enable** the **miracle** of
**increased production**]{.underline} and consumption [with]{.underline}
**[less pressure]{.underline}** (or at least no corresponding increase
in pressure) [on]{.underline} **[ecosystems]{.underline}** (Jöstrom and
Östblom 2010). [It is true that a greater [efficiency]{.mark} in the
production process [may]{.mark} [allow]{.mark} for **[relative
decoupling]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [meaning that it enables a
**reduction in pressure** **per product or per unit of
GDP**]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} it does [not]{.mark} decrease this
pressure [in **absolute terms**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[since]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[number of products]{.mark}** does
not **cease to [increase]{.mark}** [on a **global
scale**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The mechanism known as [the "**Jevons
paradox**]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} [or **rebound effect**
[describes how]{.mark} [**increasing demand** for **energy**]{.mark} or
**natural resources**]{.underline} [always tends to **[offset]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark} **eco[-efficiency gain]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark}
technological [innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, although energy
efficiency **per product** has **doubled**]{.underline} or even tripled
[since 1950, this gain is **offset** by the]{.underline}
**[expansion]{.underline}** [of **production** at a **greater rate**
than the]{.underline} **[eco-efficiency gain.]{.underline}**

The actions of institutions and business foundations that advocate for
an eco-efficient and circular economy based on reverse engineering,
recycling, reuse, and remanufacturing are certainly positive. We know,
however, that **[there is no circular economy]{.underline}**. [[No
economy]{.mark}, let alone a global economy trapped in the
paradigm]{.underline} of [expansion, [can **evade**]{.mark} the **second
law of [thermodynamics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whose relationship with
economics has been analyzed by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen since the 1970s
(1971, 1975 and 1995). Here we must state the obvious: [even though the
surplus energy supplied by oil and other fossil fuels in relation to the
energy invested to obtain them is declining]{.underline} (for this
declining EROI, see Chap. 5, Sect. 5.5), [low-carbon renewable energies
are not yet, and **may never be,** **as efficient as oil.**]{.underline}
[This means that the **energy transition,**]{.underline} while urgent
and imperative, [will **further distance us** from a **circular
economy.**]{.underline} According to calculations by Dominique Guyonnet,
"[to provide one Kw/h of electricity through land-based wind energy
requires about **10 times more reinforced concrete and
steel**]{.underline} [and **20 times more copper**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[aluminum]{.underline}** than a coal-fired thermal
power plant" (Madeline 2016). **[[The only way]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
therefore, [to lessen the environmental impact of capitalism [is to
**reduce**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in absolute terms, [the
**[consumption]{.mark} of energy**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[goods]{.underline}** by the richest 10% or 20% of the planet. **[This
is [incompatible with capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**'s basic
mechanism of expansive functioning and with the worldview that it sells
to society.

**[[(2)]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The **Law of Resources Pyramid**]{.underline}

[The **[increasing scarcity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} certain
**[inputs]{.mark}** and the need to secure their **large-scale** and
**low-cost supply** **[nullify]{.mark}** the **potential
[benefits]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} various **[green initiatives]{.mark}**
taken on by]{.underline} [companies]{.underline}. [[These
cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, [[evade]{.mark} the law of [the
**resources pyramid**]{.mark}]{.underline}, described by Richard
Heinberg (2007):

[The capstone \[of the pyramid\] represents the **easily** and **cheaply
extracted**]{.underline} [portion of the resource; the next layer is the
portion of the resource base that can be extracted with **more
difficulty** and expense]{.underline}, [and with **worse environmental
impacts**]{.underline}; [while the remaining bulk of the pyramid
represents resources **unlikely to be extracted**]{.underline} under any
realistic pricing scenario

This law of the resources pyramid can be stated in an even simpler form:
[in capitalism, the **logic of capital accumulation**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[surplus]{.underline}**, [together with the
**growing scarcity** of **finite** natural **resources**]{.underline},
**[necessarily exacerbates]{.underline}** [the **negative environmental
impact**]{.underline} [of economic activity.]{.underline}

**[[(3)]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The **Impossibility** of **Internalizing** the **Environmental
Cost**]{.underline}

[What makes it **specifically impossible** for corporations to submit
themselves to the environmental imperative is the **impossibility** of
**"internalizing"**]{.underline} [the **costs** of **increasing
environmental damage**]{.underline} [that they bring about]{.underline}.
[Methodologies to "**price**]{.underline}" [nature are now]{.underline}
**[multiplying]{.underline}**. [But **whatever the
methodology**]{.underline} (**[always based on the assumption that the
value of nature is reducible to a market price]{.underline}**), [the
result is the same: [it is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[impossible]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [[corporations
to **internalize** their **environmental cost** because the]{.mark}
**total [value]{.mark}** [generated]{.mark} [by their activity
is]{.mark} often [**less** than the]{.mark} **monetary
expression**]{.underline} of [the value of the **natural heritage** that
was **destroyed by that activity.**]{.underline}4 A report was prepared
for The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), titled Natural
Capital at Risk. [The top 100 externalities of business (2013) show
that:]{.underline}

[The estimated [**cost** of **land use**, **water
consumption**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[GHG
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[air
[pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[land]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[water pollution]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[waste]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for the world's primary sectors amounts
to almost]{.underline} **[US\$7.3 trillion]{.underline}**. The analysis
takes account of impacts under standard operating practices, but
excludes the cost of, and risk from, low-probability, high-impact
catastrophic events. (...) [This equates to **13% of global economic
output**]{.underline} in 2009. Risk to business overall would be higher
if all upstream sector impacts were included.

#### Green growth is [fake]{.underline}! It can't scale up fast enough.

<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/12/why-growth-cant-be-green/>;
//CYang

[Warnings about **ecological breakdown** have become
ubiquitous]{.underline}. Over the past few years, major newspapers,
including the Guardian and the New York Times, have carried
[**[alarming]{.mark} stories** on [soil depletion,
defo]{.mark}restation, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[collapse of
fish]{.mark} stocks [and insect]{.mark}
population[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [crises are being [driven
by]{.mark} **global [economic growth]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
its]{.underline} accompanying [[consumption]{.mark}, which is
[destroying the]{.mark} **Earth's [biosphere]{.mark}** [and blowing
past]{.mark} **key [planetary boundaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[scientists say]{.mark} must be respected to avoid **triggering
collapse**]{.underline}.

Many policymakers have responded by pushing for what has come to be
called "green growth." All we need to do, they argue, is invest in more
efficient technology and introduce the right incentives, and we'll be
able to keep growing while simultaneously reducing our impact on the
natural world, which is already at an unsustainable level. In technical
terms, the goal is to achieve "absolute decoupling" of GDP from the
total use of natural resources, according to the U.N. definition. It
sounds like an elegant solution to an otherwise catastrophic problem.
There's just one hitch: [**New [evidence]{.mark}**
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[green growth]{.underline}]{.mark}
isn't the panacea everyone has been hoping for. In fact, [it
[isn't]{.mark} even [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Green growth first became a buzz phrase in 2012 at the United Nations
Cosnference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro. In the run-up
to the conference, the World Bank, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, and the U.N. Environment Program all
produced reports promoting green growth. Today, it is a core plank of
the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.

But the promise of [green growth]{.underline} turns out to have been
[[based]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[on **wishful thinking**]{.mark} than
on evidence.]{.underline} In the years since the Rio conference, [three
**[major]{.mark} empirical [studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} have
[[arrived at]{.mark} the same **rather troubling
[conclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Even [[under]{.mark} the **[best
conditions]{.mark}**, absolute [decoupling]{.mark} of GDP [from resource
use is not possible]{.mark}]{.underline} on a global scale.

A [team of scientists]{.underline} led by the German researcher Monika
Dittrich first raised doubts in 2012. The group [ran a **sophisticated
computer [model]{.mark}** [that predicted]{.mark}]{.underline} what
would happen to [[global resource use if]{.mark} **economic growth**
continued on its **current trajectory**]{.underline}, increasing at
about 2 to 3 percent per year. It found that [human consumption of
natural resources]{.underline} ([including fish, livestock, forests,
metals, minerals, and fossil fuels]{.underline}) would
[[rise]{.underline}]{.mark} from 70 billion metric tons per year in 2012
[[to **180 billion**]{.mark} **metric [tons]{.mark}** per
year]{.underline} by 2050. For reference, a [[sustainable]{.mark} level
of resource use [is]{.mark}]{.underline} about **[[50]{.mark} billion
metric tons]{.underline}** per year --- a boundary we breached back in
2000.

The team then reran the model to see what would happen [[if]{.mark}
every nation on [Earth]{.mark} **immediately [adopted]{.mark}** [best
practice]{.mark} in **efficient resource use**]{.underline} (an
extremely optimistic assumption). The results improved; [[resource
consumption]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[hit]{.underline}]{.mark} only
[**[93]{.mark} billion** metric tons]{.underline} by 2050. But that is
still a lot more than we're consuming today. Burning through all those
resources could hardly be described as absolute decoupling or green
growth.

In 2016, a second team of scientists tested a different premise: one in
which the world's nations all agreed to go above and beyond existing
best practice. In their best-case scenario, the researchers assumed a
tax that would raise the global price of carbon from \$50 to \$236 per
metric ton and imagined technological innovations that would double the
efficiency with which we use resources. The results were almost exactly
the same as in Dittrich's study. Under these conditions, if the global
economy kept growing by 3 percent each year, we'd still hit about 95
billion metric tons of resource use by 2050. Bottom line: no absolute
decoupling.

Finally, last year the U.N. Environment Program --- once one of the main
cheerleaders of green growth theory --- weighed in on the debate. It
tested a scenario with carbon priced at a whopping \$573 per metric ton,
slapped on a resource extraction tax, and assumed rapid technological
innovation spurred by strong government support. The result? We hit 132
billion metric tons by 2050. This finding is worse than those of the two
previous studies because the researchers accounted for the "rebound
effect," whereby improvements in resource efficiency drive down prices
and cause demand to rise --- thus canceling out some of the gains.

[**Study after study** shows the **same thing**]{.underline}. Scientists
are beginning to realize that there are physical limits to how
efficiently we can use resources. Sure, we might be able to produce cars
and iPhones and skyscrapers more efficiently, but we can't produce them
out of thin air. We might shift the economy to services such as
education and yoga, but even universities and workout studios require
material inputs. Once we reach the limits of efficiency, pursuing any
degree of economic growth drives resource use back up.

These problems throw the entire concept of green growth into doubt and
necessitate some radical rethinking. Remember that each of the three
studies used highly optimistic assumptions. We are nowhere near imposing
a global carbon tax today, much less one of nearly \$600 per metric ton,
and resource efficiency is currently getting worse, not better. Yet the
studies suggest that even if we do everything right, decoupling economic
growth with resource use will remain elusive and our environmental
problems will continue to worsen.

[[Preventing]{.mark} that [outcome]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[require
a]{.mark} **whole [new paradigm]{.mark}**]{.underline}. High taxes and
technological innovation will help, but they're not going to be enough.
[[The **only**]{.mark} **realistic [shot]{.mark}** humanity has at
averting ecological collapse [is to]{.mark}]{.underline} impose hard
caps on resource use, as the economist Daniel O'Neill recently proposed.
Such caps, enforced by national governments or by international
treaties, could ensure that we do not extract more from the land and the
seas than the Earth can safely regenerate. We could also [**[ditch
GDP]{.mark}** as an indicator of **economic success**]{.underline} and
adopt a more balanced measure like the genuine progress indicator (GPI),
which accounts for pollution and natural asset depletion. Using GPI
would help us maximize socially good outcomes while minimizing
ecologically bad ones.

But there's no escaping the obvious conclusion. Ultimately,
[bringing]{.underline} our [civilization back within planetary
boundaries]{.underline} is going to [[require]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[we **liberate ourselves** from]{.mark} our dependence on **economic
[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- starting with rich nations. This
might sound scarier than it really is. Ending growth doesn't mean
shutting down economic activity --- it simply means that next year we
can't produce and consume more than we are doing this year. It might
also mean shrinking certain sectors that are particularly damaging to
our ecology and that are unnecessary for human flourishing, such as
advertising, commuting, and single-use products.

But **[[ending growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** doesn't mean that living
standards need to take a hit. Our planet provides more than enough for
all of us; the problem is that its resources are not equally
distributed. We can improve people's lives right now simply by sharing
what we already have more fairly, rather than plundering the Earth for
more. Maybe this means better public services. Maybe it means basic
income. Maybe it means a shorter working week that allows us to scale
down production while still delivering full employment. Policies such as
these --- and countless others --- [will be [crucial
to]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[**surviving** the **21st**]{.mark}
**century**]{.underline} but also flourishing in it.

### ! --- Unsustainable --- Law of Profitability

#### 1) [LAW OF PROFITABILITY]{.underline}. Newest studies [confirm it.]{.underline} 

Michael **Roberts 22**, economist and author of author of *The Long
Depression: Marxism and the Global Crisis of Capitalism*, 1-22-22 via
carbon dating, "A world rate of profit: important new evidence,"
https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2022/01/22/a-world-rate-of-profit-important-new-evidence/,
jy

But now Marxist [economists]{.underline} at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst led by Deepankur Basu have [delivered **new
evidence**]{.underline} using data compiled by Brazilian Marxist
economist Adalmir Marquetti. [Marquetti has expanded]{.underline} and
modified the Penn World Tables developed by the Groningen Growth and
Development Centre into what he calls [the]{.underline} Extended Penn
World Tables ([EPWT]{.underline}). The EPWT was first developed by
Marquetti back in 2004 and I have used that database since then for my
world rate of profit calculations. But now Marquetti has issued an
updated series EPWT 7.0. And this series can be used to calculate a
world rate of profit-based on a large number of countries going back to
1960.

Basu et al use the new EPWT data to construct a world rate of profit as
a weighted average of country-level profit rates, where a country's
share in the world capital stock is used as the weighting. Of course,
this world rate is only an approximate world average. A proper world
average would involve aggregating all the s, C and v in the world. Basu
et al make the point that it is incorrect to aggregate country-level
profit rates using the gross domestic product (GDP) as weights. So
previous studies like Maito's and mine have used an incorrect weighting
scheme when country capital stock should be used. I agree and in my
latest version of the world rate of profit I went further and aggregated
the s, the C and the v for the G20 countries using the Penn World Tables
10.0 going to back to 1950. So no country weighting was necessary.

So much for method. Let's look at Basu et al's results. They are
compelling in support of Marx's law. Here is the key graphic using all
the countries with data going back to 1960.

Basu et al conclude that: "[The country-aggregated world [profit]{.mark}
rate series **[displays a]{.mark} strong [negative]{.mark} linear
[trend]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the period 1960-1980 and a **weaker
negative linear trend from 1980 to 2019**.]{.underline} A medium run
decomposition analysis reveals that [the decline in the world profit
rate is driven by a **decline in the output-capital ratio**. The
industry-aggregated world profit rate shows a negative
linear]{.underline} trend for the period 2000-2014, which, [once
again]{.underline}, is [driven by a fall in the output-capital
ratio]{.underline}."

So [[Marx's law is **emphatically vindicated empirically**]{.mark} **at
a world level**]{.underline}. On the Amherst figures [[there has been
a]{.mark} **secular [decline in]{.mark} the world rate of
[profit]{.mark}**]{.underline} [over the last 80 years [of
**-25%**,]{.mark}]{.underline} starting with the huge profitability
crisis from 1966, leading to the major global slump of 1980-82. That was
followed by the so-called 'neoliberal' revival in profitability up to
1996 (+11%). After that, [the]{.underline} world [[economy
entered]{.underline}]{.mark} what I have called **[['a long
depression']{.underline}]{.mark}** when [[profitability
**slipped**]{.mark} **back**]{.underline}, turning up briefly in the
credit boom of the 2000s until 2004, before slipping again into the
Great Recession of 2008-9. Since then, [the world rate of [profit
has]{.mark} **[stagnated]{.mark}**]{.underline} and was near its
all-time low in 2019, before the global pandemic slump of 2020. Each
post-war global slump has revived profitability, but not for long.

How does the Basu calculation compare with my own made in 2020? Bearing
in mind that my last calculation was only for the top 19 economies in
the world (the EU is a separate G20 member) and my method of calculation
is somewhat different, my results show a striking similarity. There is
the same secular decline and the same turning points. Perhaps this is
not too surprising as both Basu et al and I are using the same
underlying database.

Marx's LTRPF argues that [the rate of profit will fall if the organic
composition of capital]{.underline} (OCC) [rises faster than the rate of
surplus value or exploitation of labour]{.underline}. That is the
underlying reason for the fall. [Basu et al have decomposed the
components of the world rate of profit to ascertain whether that is
correct. They find that the world rate of [profit declined at]{.mark} a
rate of about [0.5% a year]{.mark} from 1960 to 2019, while the
output-capital ratio declined by 0.8% a year]{.underline} (this is a
reciprocal proxy for the OCC), and the profit share (a proxy for rate of
surplus value) rose about 0.25% a year. So [this supports Marx's law
that [the OCC]{.mark} will **[outstrip]{.mark} the rate of [exploitation
of labour]{.mark} most of the time**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} so [lead
to **a fall in the rate of profit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I found a
similar result in my 2020 paper.

Ahmet Tonak, the world's greatest Marxist expert on national accounts,
had some concerns on using the Penn Tables as the raw data source for
calculation because it does not distinguish between productive (value
creating) labour and unproductive (value using) labour in an economy.
And that can lead to diverging results on the rate of profit in national
economies --- which he found for Turkey.

We can go some way to dealing with this possible divergence by
considering the rate of profit in the non-financial, non-residential
property sectors of an economy. It does not solve the problem of
delineating unproductive and productive labour within a sector, but it
does provide some greater precision. For more on this issue, see the
excellent work by Tsoulifis and Paitaridis.

Basu and Wasner have also produced a profitability dashboard for the
rate of profit in the US which distinguishes non-financial corporate
profitability from corporate profitability. I compared the Basu et al
(global) results for the US rate of profit against their results for the
US non-financial corporate rate of profit. Both series follow the same
trend and turning points so the divergence at this level is not a
significant problem.

However, during the neo-liberal period, the US rate of profit based on
the global data (which does not distinguish productive and unproductive
sectors) rises much more than the rate of profit on just the
non-financial sector using the Basu-Wasner calculations. That suggests
that the neo-liberal [recovery in profitability was mostly based on a
switch **into the financial sector by capital**]{.underline} --- another
explanation for the fall in productive investment exhibited in the US in
that period.

In sum, the [Basu]{.underline} et al study [has added yet **more
empirical evidence**]{.underline} [in support of Marx's law on a **world
level**. The [ev]{.mark}idence [is **overwhelming**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and yet the [[sceptics]{.mark} **continue to [ignore]{.mark}
it**]{.underline} and deny its relevance. The [sceptics of Marx's law of
profitability are increasingly [becoming **like**]{.mark} **the
[climate]{.mark} change [sceptics]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### ! --- Unsustainable --- AI

#### 2) [AI]{.underline}. It will create [unemployment]{.underline} and [rational allocation of resources]{.underline}. 

Feng **Xiang 18**, professor of law at Tsinghua University, 5-3-2018,
\"AI will spell the end of capitalism,\"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/05/03/end-of-capitalism/,
jy

BEIJING --- [The most momentous challenge facing socio-economic systems
today is the **arrival of artificial intelligence**]{.underline}. If AI
remains under the control of market forces, [it will inexorably result
in a **super-rich oligopoly of data billionaires**]{.underline} who reap
the wealth created by robots that displace human labor, [leaving
**massive unemployment**]{.underline} in their wake.

But China's socialist market economy could provide a solution to this.
[If AI **rationally allocates resources**]{.underline} through big data
analysis, and if robust feedback loops can supplant the imperfections of
"the invisible hand" while fairly sharing the vast wealth it creates, [a
planned economy that actually works could **at last be
achievable**]{.underline}.

[The [more AI advances]{.mark}]{.underline} into a general-purpose
technology that permeates every corner of life, [the less sense it makes
to allow it to **remain in private hands**]{.underline} that serve the
interests of the few instead of the many. More than anything else, [the
[inevitability of]{.mark} **mass [unemployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} the [demand for **universal welfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[will]{.mark} drive]{.underline} the idea of
[[socializing]{.underline}]{.mark} or nationalizing
[[AI.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Marx's dictum, "From each according to their abilities, to each
according to their needs," needs an update for the 21st century: "[From
the **inability of an AI economy to provide jobs and a living wage for
all**, to **each according to their needs**]{.underline}."

Even at this early stage, [the idea that digital capitalism will somehow
make social welfare a priority has already proven to be a
**fairytale**]{.underline}. The billionaires of **[[Google and
Apple]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who have been depositing company profits
in offshore havens to avoid taxation, [[are **hardly paragons
of**]{.mark} **social [responsibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
ongoing scandal around [Facebook's business model]{.underline}, which
puts profitability above responsible citizenship, [is]{.underline} yet
[another example]{.underline} of how in digital capitalism, private
companies only look after their own interests at the expense of the rest
of society.

[One can]{.underline} readily [see where this is all headed once
**technological unemployment accelerates**]{.underline}. "Our
[responsibility is to]{.underline} our **[shareholders]{.underline}**,"
the robot owners will say. "We are [not]{.underline} an employment
agency or a **[charity]{.underline}**."

These companies have been able to get away with their social
irresponsibility because [the legal system]{.underline} and its
[[loopholes]{.mark} in the West [are **geared to protect**]{.mark}
**private [property]{.mark}**]{.underline} above all else. Of course, in
China, we have big privately owned Internet companies like Alibaba and
Tencent. But unlike in the West, they are monitored by the state and do
not regard themselves as above or beyond social control.

It is the very pervasiveness of [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} that [will
[spell]{.mark} the **[end of market]{.mark} dominance**]{.underline}.
The market may reasonably if unequally function if industry creates
employment opportunities for most people. But [when industry **only
produces joblessness**, as [robots take over]{.mark} **more** and
**more**, there is **[no good alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[but]{.mark} for the state to step in. As AI invades economic and
social life, all private]{.underline} law-related [issues will **soon
become public ones**]{.underline}. More and more, [[regulation]{.mark}
of private companies will become a **necessity** to
maintain]{.underline} some semblance of **[stability]{.underline}** in
societies roiled by constant innovation.

I consider this historical process a step closer to a planned market
economy. [Laissez-faire]{.underline} capitalism as we have known it can
[lead nowhere but to a **dictatorship of AI oligarchs**]{.underline} who
gather rents because the intellectual property they own rules over the
means of production. On a global scale, [it is easy to envision this
unleashed digital capitalism leading to a battle between robots for
market share]{.underline} that will surely end as disastrously as the
imperialist wars did in an earlier era.

For the sake of social well-being and security, individuals and private
companies should not be allowed to possess any exclusive cutting-edge
technology or core AI platforms. Like nuclear and biochemical weapons,
as long as they exist, nothing other than a strong and stable state can
ensure society's safety. If we don't nationalize AI, [we could [sink
into a **dystopia**]{.mark} reminiscent of the early misery of
industrialization, with its satanic mills and street urchins
**scrounging for a crust of bread**]{.underline}.

The dream of communism is the elimination of wage labor. If AI is bound
to serve society instead of private capitalists, it promises to do so by
freeing an overwhelming majority from such drudgery while creating
wealth to sustain all.

If the state controls the market, instead of digital capitalism
controlling the state, true [communist aspirations will be
**achievable**]{.underline}. And because [AI]{.underline} increasingly
[enables the management of **complex systems**]{.underline} by
[processing **massive amounts of information**]{.underline} through
intensive feedback loops, it presents, for the first time, a real
alternative to the market signals that have long justified laissez-faire
ideology --- and all the ills that go with it.

Going forward, China's socialist market economy, which aims to harness
the fruits of production for the whole population and not just a sliver
of elites operating in their own self-centered interests, can lead the
way toward this new stage of human development.

[If properly regulated]{.underline} in this way, [we should
**celebrate**]{.underline}, not fear, the advent of [AI.]{.underline} If
it is brought under social control, it will finally free workers from
peddling their time and sweat only to enrich those at the top. The
communism of the future ought to adopt a new slogan: "[**[Robots of the
world, unite]{.mark}**!]{.underline}"

[[Endless growth]{.mark} will [generate]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**minerals scarcity**]{.mark} within **decades**]{.underline} 

The EV transition is, in short, a massive industrial project.
[[Electrification]{.mark} of roads and rail will [require]{.mark}
upgraded [smart grids]{.mark}, complex routes connected to high [power
lines]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} regular [battery]{.mark}-swap
stations]{.underline}. The paper explores several scenarios to explore
how such a transition would take place. 

In a continuing GDP growth scenario, the authors note that [the economy
begins to **stagnate** "due to **peak oil limits** at around
2025-2040,"]{.underline} but GDP is able to continue growing thanks to
the EV transition. This shows that the reduction in liquid fuels in
transportation can play a powerful role in avoiding "energy shortages in
the economy as a whole." 

But then [the [economy hits]{.mark} the [limits of mineral]{.mark} and
material production to sustain this electric transition---in just
**three decades**]{.underline}. And [this is **even with** high levels
of **minerals recycling**]{.underline}.

By 2050, in this scenario, [the EV transition will "require higher
amounts of [copper, lithium and manganese]{.mark} than current
reserves]{.underline}. For the cases of [copper and manganese the
[depletion is]{.mark} mainly [due to]{.mark} the [demand]{.mark} from
the rest of the economy]{.underline}," but most lithium demand "is for
EV batteries," and [this alone "**depletes** its estimated **global
reserves**]{.underline}."

[Mineral depletion takes place even with "a very high increase in
recycling rates"]{.underline} in a continuing GDP growth scenario.  

In one such scenario, the authors apply what they consider to be
[realistic upper level recycling rates of 57 percent, 30 percent and 74
percent to copper, lithium and manganese respectively]{.underline}.
These are based on **[extremely optimistic projections]{.underline}** of
recycling capabilities relative to their costs.  

But still they find that [[even]{.mark} these [high recycling]{.mark}
rates [**wouldn't prevent depletion** of]{.mark} all current estimated
reserves by 2050]{.underline}. The [conclusion corroborates findings of
other studies, estimating an expected **bottleneck for

[manganese]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} 20[38]{.mark}-2050]{.underline}.  

[Actual [bottlenecks]{.mark} could **[come]{.mark} even

Scientists from the University of California, San Diego published a
[[**study** investigating]{.mark} a [**diverse portfolio**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} successful and failed [**[c]{.mark}**arbon
**[c]{.mark}**apture and **[s]{.mark}**torage projects]{.underline} in
the US. It [[concluded]{.underline}]{.mark} that while many projects
essential to commercializing the technology have been started, [**[more
than 80%]{.mark}** of them have [ended in failure]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [study [entails the **largest sample** of]{.mark}]{.underline} US
**[[CCS]{.mark} projects [ever examined]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[with]{.underline} the [input from]{.underline} the [people who managed
them]{.underline} in the past. The researchers came up with 12 crucial
traits that describe why commercial carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS) projects become a failure or a success.

Reality Assessment

According to the study, commercial CO2 capture that is deployed in power
plants to separate CO2 for use in EOR has been here since the 1970s. The
technology is mature now, yet [[CCS]{.mark} project developments
are]{.underline} moving at an [**[overwhelmingly slow]{.mark}**
pace]{.underline}.

The US saw a big push in the 2000s to commercialize CCS with billions of
dollars invested in dozens of industrial and power plant capture
projects. However, [most [end]{.mark}ed [in failure]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- largely [[before]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**f**inal
[**i**nvestment]{.mark} **d**ecision]{.underline} ([FID]{.underline}).

According to the US National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), more
than 300 CCUS projects of all types have been proposed or built
globally. Half of these (149) intended to store some or all of the
captured CO2.

However, more than 100 of the 149 CCS projects have [been [terminated or
placed on]{.mark} **indefinite [hold]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They were
also originally scheduled to be operational by 2020. The projects were
planned to capture more than 130 million tons of CO2 per annum which is
more than three times the amount of CO2 captured today.

One important highlight is that the [[projects in the **power sector**
experienced]{.mark} around **[90% failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
comparison, more than 70% of the proposed gas processing projects with
CCS have succeeded and are still operational today. That points to the
conclusion that the probability of failure depends on the type of

The [[study uses **empirical models** and **expert
assessment**]{.underline}]{.mark} to determine the 12 main factors
determining the project results. The factors are diverse, including
engineering economics, finance, and political economy. They are as
follows:

- Plant siting

- Capture technology readiness level

- Capital cost

- Employment impact

- Credibility of revenue

- Credibility of incentives

- Population proximity

- Institutional setting

- Burden of CO2 disposal

- Regulatory challenges

- Public opposition

- Industrial stakeholder opposition

The experts, whose opinions were obtained, only put an emphasis on the
significance of the credibility of incentives and revenues. The projects
had to obtain unconditional incentives upfront to provide a safe
financial footing. That is the main reason why the [**majority of
[effective projects]{.mark}** [use]{.mark}d their captured [CO2]{.mark}

Some environmentalists say that is exactly what is happening. They argue
that the [money]{.underline} being appropriated by Congress is likely to
[[allow **polluting power plants** and **petrochemical facilities** to
continue operating]{.mark} longer into the future]{.underline}, [[while
doing little to reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} the [nation's
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. They also say that, [[even
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} is [able
to [cut carbon]{.mark} pollution]{.underline} from petrochemical plants
or refineries, [[it won't address **other**]{.mark} **toxic
[chemicals]{.mark}**]{.underline} those operations send into communities
that are home to many people of color. Electrifying industry and
reducing the use of plastics and petrochemicals, these advocates argue,
would be far cheaper and safer.

The [[**most powerful** forces pushing for **c**]{.mark}**arbon
[c]{.mark}apture** have been **[fossil fuel
companies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which have promoted CCS for decades
but have increased their lobbying and marketing for the technology in
recent years as they have fallen under increased pressure to address
climate change.

Soon after launching a new business line that it said will deploy carbon
capture technology, ExxonMobil in April proposed a \$100 billion
mega-project in Houston that would capture emissions from the region's
heavy industry and store it underground.

But there's a catch: The company said it would need substantial
government funding to move forward. With the two major pieces of
legislation working their way through Congress, Exxon may get what it
wants.

A Politically Appealing Opportunity

Nearly three years ago, a major United Nations' climate report
fundamentally altered the public discourse on climate change by
highlighting the far-reaching effects expected if the world warmed just
1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Advocates and scientists
spoke with new urgency about the need to rapidly reduce emissions.
Governments and corporations began announcing plans to reach "net-zero"
emissions. And carbon capture and storage started to receive renewed
attention, with the growing realization that every emissions-cutting
tool might be needed to get there.

In the United States, CCS has also offered a politically appealing
opportunity to reach consensus on climate change: The energy industry
and many Republicans who oppose other solutions support carbon capture
and storage, as do unions that represent people who work in the fossil
fuel sector.

Lee Beck, international director for carbon capture at the Clean Air
Task Force, an environmental nonprofit, said carbon capture and storage
could help reduce emissions faster and more cheaply in some parts of the
world, particularly in Asia, home to many newly-built fossil fuel power
plants that could continue spewing greenhouse gases for decades.

"We need to deploy as many solutions as fast as possible," she said.

But just as carbon capture and storage has drawn increased attention,
the plummeting costs of wind and solar energy have eroded the case for
using the technology in the power sector. In most parts of the United
States and much of the rest of the world, renewable power sources are
already competitive with or cheaper than burning fossil fuels to
generate electricity. Adding expensive carbon capture equipment to a
fossil power plant would only tilt the balance further in favor of
renewable sources.

The federal government has poured billions of dollars into carbon
capture demonstration projects that were never completed. The only
commercial power plant in the country to use carbon capture and storage
shut its emissions-cutting operations last year during the pandemic, and
later announced it would suspend them indefinitely. This hasn't stopped
some companies from continuing to try to implement the technology.

"CCS for power plants is something of a boondoggle," Nicholson said.

As the case for carbon capture power plants has collapsed, supporters
have argued that the technology is still worthy of support because of
the role it could play in decarbonizing industry or in removing carbon
dioxide from the air. The bipartisan infrastructure bill provides \$3.5
billion to direct air capture technology, according to recent drafts.

But many environmental advocates warn that much of the rest of the money
in the infrastructure bill is likely to go toward expanding some of the
more problematic uses of the technology.

There are about a dozen carbon capture plants operating in the United
States, most of which are attached to natural gas processing, ethanol or
fertilizer plants, which produce emissions that are high in carbon
dioxide and therefore relatively cheap to capture. The vast majority of
that [[captured carbon dioxide]{.mark} is then **[sold to oil
companies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which pump]{.mark} the [gas
into]{.mark} depleted [oil reservoirs to squeeze **more petroleum** out
of the ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. The companies say most of the carbon
dioxide stays underground permanently, though long-term monitoring is
limited. Either way, the gas serves as a tool to produce oil that would
otherwise be left underground.

Exxon and other companies have already received hundreds of millions of
dollars for capturing carbon dioxide and selling it for use in oil
fields through a federal CCS tax credit, which was created in 2008 and
then expanded in 2018. At the same time, Exxon led an ultimately
successful lobbying campaign to strip the requirement that the
Environmental Protection Agency oversee the operations of companies that
claim the credit, to ensure the greenhouse gas is not escaping into the
atmosphere.

In December, after lobbying from industry, Congress extended how long
companies could claim that credit, as part of an omnibus budget bill.
Now, energy and industrial companies are pushing lawmakers to take
advantage of the reconciliation bill to further expand the tax credit
and increase the amount of money that companies can claim for capturing
emissions, whether or not the gas is used to produce more oil.

"The last thing that U.S. taxpayers should be doing is subsidizing
fossil fuels, especially subsidizing drilling for oil," said Jim Walsh,
senior energy policy analyst at Food and Water Watch, an environmental
group.

A New Interdependency?

The December omnibus bill and the bipartisan infrastructure bill
currently moving through Congress include numerous other measures that
support carbon capture technology, including fast-tracked environmental
reviews, billions of dollars for demonstration projects and loan
guarantees and billions more to fund projects that make hydrogen from
natural gas with carbon-capturing equipment. One section of the
infrastructure bill encourages states to waive property taxes for carbon
capture projects for at least 10 years. Axelrod, of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, said these are the latest in a series of
policies that industry has won.

"What happened [over the course of a decade]{.underline} of legislation
is [all these]{.underline} little individual pieces and policy
mechanisms [have been passed into law that basically
**[subsidizes]{.mark} industry**]{.underline}," he said, "and the
industry in this case is pretty [overwhelmingly [the fossil fuel
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Other provisions in the infrastructure bill would pour billions into
building carbon dioxide pipelines and funding research into making
plastics and other products out of the gas. Walsh said the funding could
make it harder to phase out fossil fuels, by creating new jobs and
economies that depend on their emissions.

"It's [[creating]{.underline}]{.mark} this [**[new]{.mark}
inter[dependency]{.mark}** [on fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}" he said.

Many environmentalists also warn that, even if carbon capture and
storage proves successful, it fails to address other damage caused by
the industry and its products.

"What we're talking about is [essentially [allowing **environmental
injustice** to continue]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} in fact
**[doubling down]{.mark}** on it]{.underline}," said Kendall Dix, policy
lead at the Gulf Coast Center for Law and Policy, a climate
justice-focused nonprofit. He said many Gulf Coast communities face
unacceptable toxic pollution from petrochemical plants that could
continue to operate for longer if fitted with carbon capture equipment.

### ! --- AT: Geoengineering

#### Geoengineering fails --- it's more likely to backfire.

//CYang

Some **[atmospheric [scientists]{.mark}]{.underline}**, like Dr Alan
Robock at Rutgers University, argue that the [[complexity of the climate
system means]{.mark} that [it's difficult to draw]{.mark} **firm
[conclusions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[consequences
of]{.underline}]{.mark} such a **[radical
[intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They point out that the
[[chemistry]{.mark} of the upper atmosphere]{.underline} --- [including
the ozone layer]{.underline} --- [is [**complicated** and **poorly
understood**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Reducing the amount of sunlight
reaching the Earth in a [computer [model]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[give
**little clue**]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[to what]{.mark} would [happen
in the actual climate system]{.mark}]{.underline} if a layer of sulphate
aerosols were injected into it.

One worry is that, combined with increased water vapour as a result of
global warming, adding sulphates to the upper atmosphere [[could be a
**lethal cocktail**]{.mark} for ozone loss]{.underline}, [speeding up
chemical reactions that destroy this **crucial gas**]{.underline}. Other
studies indicate that, depending on the kind of aerosol spraying
programme, the South Asian and East Asian
[[monsoons]{.underline}]{.mark} could be
[[disrupted]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**Tropical [rainfall]{.mark}**
[depends on differences between temperatures]{.mark} on land and
sea]{.underline}, and some models show that by changing the temperature
ratio between land and sea, [[solar geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}
could suppress monsoon rains, [[affecting **food supplies**]{.mark} for
millions of people]{.underline}.

However, global warming itself is changing precipitation patterns around
the world (broadly speaking, dry regions are becoming drier and wet ones
wetter) so a solar shield may improve rainfall in some regions that are
drying out. It's here we get to some of the most difficult issues
associated with geoengineering.

Unknown unknowns

If the [[**most sophisticated models** cannot provide a]{.mark} **firm
[answer]{.mark}** [regarding how]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[affect the]{.mark} actual
global [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}, [nor can experiments]{.underline}.
[[Only **full-scale implementation**]{.mark} would provide a **clear
idea**]{.underline} of its impacts.

Even then, we'd need at least 10 years of global climate data before we
had enough information to separate out the effects of sulphate aerosol
spraying from natural climate variability and, indeed, from the effects
of human-induced climate change. To compound the risks, if after 10
years we had accumulated enough data to decide that our intervention was
not a good idea, it may be impossible to terminate the solar shield. Why
should this be so?

For some time, ecologists have known that the rate at which the globe
warms is a greater threat to ecosystems than the amount of warming,
because a slower rate of warming gives plants and animals more time to
adapt. If the solar shield causes some nasty unintended effects
(including conflict between nations), removing it suddenly would cause
the suppressed warming 'rebound'. It's been estimated that if warming
occurs at a rate of 0.3°C per decade (well within the estimated rebound
range) then only 30 per cent of ecosystems could adapt and survive.

So we may find that, [[once deployed]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[removing
the shield becomes **too risky**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[we'd be **stuck
with it**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [danger]{.underline} would be
[multiplied if we failed to take]{.underline} the [opportunity to cut
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} sharply while the shield was in
place. This is perhaps the greatest hazard of going down this path.

Politics, politics

Some technologies are inherently political in the sense that they
increase the power of those who control it and reduce the power of those
excluded from it. Imagine if the US government decided to install a
solar shield that allowed it to regulate the climate. The government
would wield great power over all those US industries that depend on the
weather, while also being able to influence the climate in other parts
of the world, creating immediate strategic tension.

Paradoxically, [solar [geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} can also be
seen as [a [means of preserving social and political
structures]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [threatened by measures to
cut]{.underline} carbon [emissions]{.underline}. Instead of taxing
fossil fuels, banning [coal mining]{.underline} and restricting air
transport, those [[**profiting** from]{.underline}]{.mark} these
activities might welcome [[a technofix]{.underline}]{.mark} like
sulphate aerosol spraying.

Indeed, in the US, [[conservative think tanks]{.underline}]{.mark} that
have been [[at the **forefront**]{.mark} of]{.underline} climate science
denial have shown an interest in [solar geoengineering]{.underline}.
It's cheap and protects any vested interests. Geoengineering promises to
turn a drastic failure of the free enterprise system into a triumph of
human ingenuity. And they are more inclined to agree with Prof David
Keith that an artificial Earth shaped by humans is not intrinsically
inferior to a natural one.

#### And causes global nuclear war --- and counter-geoengineering which makes the environment worse!

When hit by a devastating flood, drought or storm, a community will tend
to see it as an act of God --- a natural event that it just has to cope
with. But what if we believed that the death and destruction were caused
not by nature but by someone manipulating the weather? [If another
nation]{.underline} were [engineering the climate]{.underline}, its
[politicians' denials]{.underline} would [fall on deaf
ears]{.underline}, and not just because humans naturally look for
someone to blame. [[If a nation]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[embarked
on]{.mark} a **[system-altering]{.mark} form** of climate
[engineering]{.mark}]{.underline} like sulphur dioxide spraying, [[it
would be]{.mark} **virtually [impossible]{.mark}** [to work out
whether]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[extreme weather]{.underline}]{.mark}
event somewhere in the world was [[due to natural
variability]{.underline}]{.mark}, human-induced climate change [or
climate manipulation]{.underline}. [And [climate manipulation
would]{.mark} **quite likely** [get the blame]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The government of China, faced with a catastrophic drought in the north
of the country, might decide its survival demanded rapid global cooling.
But sending up planes to spray sulphur dioxide might deprive India and
Pakistan of their monsoon rains, bringing on famine. [Three
**[nuclear]{.mark}-armed [nations]{.mark}**]{.underline} would then be
[[in conflict over **weather patterns**]{.underline}]{.mark} that affect
the survival of millions of their citizens.

It's hard to know who might first be tempted to regulate the global
climate. Given the severe environmental and geopolitical risks, and the
deep ethical divide over whether humans should 'play God', governments
in democratic countries may be hamstrung. Authoritarian leaders who do
not need public approval to act may have a freer hand. Do we want
Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping controlling our weather?

[A [dictator with]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~his~~
\[[[their]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[hand on the global thermostat
is]{.mark} a **[scary]{.mark} prospect**]{.underline}. But imagine if
several poorer nations (let's say Bangladesh, Tuvalu, the Maldives and
Ethiopia) clubbed together and declared: "The rich countries that caused
global warming promised to cut their emissions, but they have not done
so. Our people are dying, so we must take unilateral action. We are
sending up a fleet of planes to spray sulphur dioxide."

Now the moral calculus leaves us uncertain what to think. Don't they
have the right to save themselves from an existential threat, even if by
risky means? What would it mean for floods and storms in other
countries? Would the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [or
China]{.mark}]{.underline} be entitled to [[shoot
down]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[planes]{.underline}]{.mark}?

Reaching a consensus to regulate the Earth's climate would, in the words
of a 2013 study, "pose immense challenges to liberal democratic
politics". But then, liberal democratic politics does not have a great
record responding to climate change, either. The elected president of
the US, Donald Trump, has announced that his country will be pulling out
of the Paris Agreement, an action that will slow emissions reductions
and expose millions of people, especially poorer individuals, to the
devastating effects of a warming world.

In the circumstances, the only acceptable answer is a global agreement
to regulate research into geoengineering. If it ever comes to
deployment, conflict could be avoided only if an inclusive international
institution makes the decision. Without it, [[one
nation]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[control]{.mark} the [climate of
others]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} those
[[others]{.underline}]{.mark} will be [tempted to [engage in]{.mark}
their own]{.underline}
'**[[counter-geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}**'. And [[then we
**really are in trouble**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Jeremy **Lent 21**, author of *The Patterning Instinct*, founder of
Liology, 10-9-2021, \"Solving the Climate Crisis Requires the End of
Capitalism,\"
https://patternsofmeaning.com/2021/10/11/solving-the-climate-crisis-requires-the-end-of-capitalism/,
jy

[The]{.underline} primary [[reason]{.mark} for this
[derives]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[from the **nature of
capital**]{.mark}**ism itself**]{.underline}. Under capitalism --- which
has now become the default global economic context for virtually all
human enterprise --- [**efficiency [improvements]{.mark}** intended [to
**reduce**]{.mark} **resource [usage]{.mark}**]{.underline} [inevitably
[become **launchpads for further exploitation**, leading]{.mark}
paradoxically [to]{.mark} an **[increase]{.mark}**, rather than
**decrease**, [in consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This dynamic, known as [the Jevons paradox]{.underline}, was first
recognized back in the nineteenth century by economist William Stanley
Jevons, who [demonstrated]{.underline} how James [Watts' steam
engine]{.underline}, which greatly [improved the efficiency of
coal-powered engines]{.underline}, paradoxically [caused a dramatic
increase in coal consumption even while it **decreased the amount of
coal required**]{.underline} for any particular application. The
[Jevons]{.underline} paradox [has since been shown to be true in an
**endless variety of domains**]{.underline}, from [the]{.underline}
invention in the nineteenth century of the **[cotton gin]{.underline}**
which led to an increase rather than decrease in the practice of slavery
in the American South, to improved automobile fuel efficiency which
encourages people to drive longer distances.

When the Jevons paradox is generalized to the global marketplace, we
begin to see that [[it's]{.underline}]{.mark} not really a paradox at
all, but rather [[an **inbuilt defining characteristic of
capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Shareholder-owned
[corporations]{.underline}, as the primary agents of global capitalism,
[are]{.underline} legally [[structured]{.underline}]{.mark} by the
overarching imperative [[to **maximize**]{.mark} **shareholder
[returns]{.mark}**]{.underline} above all else. Although they are given
the legal rights of "personhood" in many jurisdictions, if they were
actually humans [they would be **diagnosed as
psychopaths**]{.underline}, ruthlessly [pursuing their goal **without
regard to any collateral damage**]{.underline} they might cause. Of the
hundred largest economies today, sixty-nine are transnational
[corporations]{.underline}, which collectively [represent a **relentless
force**]{.underline} with one overriding objective: [to turn humanity
and the rest of life into **fodder for endlessly increasing
profit**]{.underline} at the fastest possible rate.

Under global capitalism, [this dynamic holds true even
**without**]{.underline} the involvement of transnational
**[corporations]{.underline}**. Take bitcoin as an example. Originally
designed after the global financial meltdown of 2008 to wrest monetary
power from the domination of central banks, it relies on building trust
through "mining," a process that allows anyone to verify a transaction
by solving increasingly complex mathematical equations and earn new
bitcoins as compensation. A great idea --- in theory. In practice, the
[unfettered marketplace for bitcoin]{.underline} mining [has led to
frenzied competition to solve ever more complex equations]{.underline},
with vast warehouses holding "rigs" of advanced computers consuming
massive amounts of electricity, [with the result that the carbon
emissions from bitcoin processing are now equivalent to that of a
**mid-size country**]{.underline} such as Sweden or Argentina.

An economy based on perpetual growth

The relentless pursuit of profit growth above all other considerations
is reflected in the world's stock markets, where corporations are valued
not by their benefit to society, but by investors' expectations of their
growth in future earnings. Similarly, when aggregated to national
accounts, the main proxy used to measure the performance of politicians
is growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although it is commonly
assumed that GDP correlates with social welfare, this is not the case
once basic material requirements have been met. GDP merely measures the
rate at which society transforms nature and human activity into the
monetary economy, regardless of the ensuing quality of life. Anything
that causes economic activity of any kind, whether good or bad, adds to
GDP. When researchers developed a benchmark called the Genuine Progress
Indicator (GPI), which incorporates qualitative components of
well-being, they discovered a dramatic divergence between the two
measures. [GPI]{.underline} peaked in 1978 and [has been **steadily
falling**]{.underline} ever since, [**even while** GDP continues to
accelerate]{.underline}.

In spite of this, the possibility of shifting our economy away from
perpetual growth is barely even considered in mainstream discourse. In
preparation for COP26, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change ([IPCC]{.underline}) modeled five scenarios exploring potential
pathways that would lead to different global heating outcomes this
century, ranging from an optimistic 1.5°C pathway to a likely
catastrophic 4.5°C track. One of their most critical variables is the
amount of carbon reduction accomplished through negative emissions,
relying on massive implementation of unproven technologies. According to
the IPCC, staying under 2°C of global heating --- consistent with the
minimum target set by the 2015 Paris agreement --- involves a heroic
assumption that we will suck 730 billion metric tonnes of carbon out of
the atmosphere this century. This stupendous amount is equivalent to
roughly twenty times the total current annual emissions from all fossil
fuel usage. Such an assumption is closer to science fiction than any
rigorous analysis worthy of a model on which our civilization is basing
its entire future. Yet, even as the IPCC appears willing to model
humanity's fate on a pipe dream, [not one of their scenarios explores
what is possible from a graduated annual reduction in global
GDP]{.underline}. Such a scenario was considered by the IPCC community
to be too implausible to consider.

This represents a serious lapse on the part of the IPCC. Climate
scientists who have modeled planned reductions in GDP show that keeping
global heating below 1.5°C this century is potentially within reach
under this scenario, with greatly reduced reliance on speculative carbon
reduction technologies. Prominent economists have shown that a carefully
managed "post-growth" plan could lead to enhanced quality of life,
reduced inequality, and a healthier environment. It would, however,
undermine the foundational activity of capitalism --- the pursuit of
[endless [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} that has [[led
to]{.underline}]{.mark} our current state of **[obscene
inequality]{.underline}**, **[impending [ecological
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and **climate
breakdown**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The profit-based path to catastrophe

[As long as this **elephant in the room remains unspoken**, our [world
will **continue to careen toward catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline},
even as politicians and technocrats shift from one savior narrative to
another. Along with [the **myth of ["green
growth,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [we are told]{.underline} that [a
solution lies in putting monetary valuations on "ecosystem
services"]{.underline} and incorporating them into business decisions
--- even though [this approach [has been]{.mark} shown to
be]{.underline} **[[deeply flawed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[frequently
counterproductive]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark} **ultimately
[self-defeating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A wetlands, for example, might
have value in protecting a city from flooding. However, if it were
drained and a swanky new resort built on the reclaimed land, this could
be more lucrative. Case closed.

The new moniker arising from the corporate titans at the World Economic
Forum is "stakeholder capitalism": an inviting term that seems to imply
that stakeholders other than investors will play a role in setting
corporate priorities, but actually refers to a profoundly
anti-democratic process whereby corporations assume increasingly large
roles in global governance. This month, [the]{.underline} UN [Food
Systems Summit was]{.underline} essentially ta[ken over by]{.underline}
the same giant corporations, including [Nestlé and Bayer]{.underline},
that are [largely responsible for the very problems the summit was
intended to grapple with]{.underline} --- which led to a widespread
boycott by hundreds of civil society and Indigenous groups.

As [net-zero [targets]{.mark}]{.underline} decades away are formally
announced at COP26, [[built]{.underline}]{.mark} implicitly [[on]{.mark}
a combination of **corporate [procrastination]{.mark}** [and
**speculative tech**]{.mark}**nologies**, we can only [expect]{.mark}
the [climate]{.mark} crisis [to]{.mark} **continue to
[worsen]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ultimately, as [[negative
emissions]{.mark} technologies **[fail to meet]{.mark} their grandiose
[expectations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the same [[voices]{.mark} that
currently promote reliance on them will lend [support]{.mark} to the
**techno-dystopian idea of [geoengineering]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
vast, planet-altering engineering projects designed to temporarily
manipulate the climate to defer a climate apocalypse. A leading
geoengineering candidate, financed by Bill Gates, involves spraying
particles into the stratosphere to cool the Earth by reflecting the
Sun's rays back into space. The [risks are **enormous**]{.underline},
including the likelihood of [[causing]{.mark} **extreme [shifts in
precipitation]{.mark}**]{.underline} around the world. Additionally,
once begun, [it could never be stopped without **[immediate]{.mark}
catastrophic [rebound heating]{.mark}**]{.underline}; it [would [not
prevent]{.mark} the [oceans from]{.mark} **further
[acidifying]{.mark}**]{.underline}; and may [turn the blue sky into a
**perpetual dull haze**]{.underline}. In spite of these concerns,
geoengineering is beginning to get discussed at UN meetings, with
publications such as The Economist predicting that, since it wouldn't
disrupt continued economic growth, it's more likely to be implemented
than the drastic, binding cuts in emissions that would head off climate
disaster.

#### 2) [BEST DATA]{.underline} goes aff. Here's [line by line]{.underline}. 

Rob **Dietz 18**, Program Director at Post Carbon Institute, 11-7-2018,
\"The Secret of Eternal Growth? It's Wishful Thinking,\"
https://www.resilience.org/stories/2018-11-07/the-secret-of-eternal-growth-its-wishful-thinking/,
jy

[I **want to believe** in eternal economic growth]{.underline}. Given
what humanity is facing with climate change and other consequences of
our collective consumption, it must be awfully comforting to have faith
in a cornucopian future where no one ever goes wanting. Especially if
all we have to do is more of the same, sticking to capitalism's
exploitative playbook. I used to have that faith. I was a worshipper of
technological progress and its potential to overcome all the social and
environmental problems that accompany exponentially increasing
population and consumption. I also used to believe in the Easter Bunny.
Unlike Michael Liebreich (author of "The Secret of Eternal Growth," the
article I'm rebutting), however, [I paid enough attention to the
evidence **to put aside such fantasies**]{.underline}.

I intend to provide a blow-by-blow analysis of [Liebreich's]{.underline}
contentions, but I feel compelled to start with a gem near the end of
his article. In a one-sentence paragraph that summarizes his thesis, he
[writes]{.underline}, "The bottom line here is [that the
**[world's]{.mark} most feted [scientists]{.mark} and economists** [have
shown]{.mark} that economic [growth is consistent
with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[environmental protection]{.underline}** and
the **[[mitigation]{.mark} of climate change]{.underline}**." Here's a
small point: his use of a financial metaphor ("bottom line") may reveal
something about how much the culture of money influences his thinking.
But here's the bigger point. [**Really?!?** **[What the hell]{.mark} is
he talking about[?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Let's start with his claim about scientists. [It's a safe bet he hasn't
read the **World Scientists' Warning to Humanity**]{.underline}. This
article appeared in the peer-reviewed journal BioScience in December
2017. In the article, which was [endorsed by more than **[15,000]{.mark}
scientists**]{.underline} at the time it was published, the authors
[[write]{.mark}, "We are jeopardizing our future by not reining in our
intense]{.underline} but geographically and demographically uneven
**[material consumption]{.underline}** and by [not perceiving
**continued rapid population growth**]{.underline} [as a primary driver
behind many ecological and even societal threats]{.underline}." These
**[scientists]{.underline}** [are saying very specifically that
**economic [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which consists of growth in
consumption and population) [[is **inconsistent**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} **[environmental
[protection]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and mitigation of **climate
change**]{.underline}. They also conclude that [it is "time **to
re-examine**]{.underline} and change our individual behaviors, including
limiting our own reproduction (ideally to replacement level at most) and
drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of fossil fuels,
meat, and other resources."

Perhaps Liebreich doesn't feel like the scientists behind the BioScience
article qualify as "our most feted." On that front, though, it's worth
noting that [the article is]{.underline} an update to the original
warning to humanity that was published in 1992 and [endorsed by the
**majority of living Nobel laureates**]{.underline} in the sciences. And
how about Stephen **[Hawking]{.underline}** --- does he count? In 2017,
he made headlines when he [said]{.underline} that [humans need to find a
new planet to inhabit]{.underline} within 100 years, [given]{.underline}
the risks we face from **[climate change]{.underline}**, **[population
growth]{.underline}**, **[epidemics]{.underline}**, and the potential
for asteroid strikes. Maybe Liebreich meant "fetid" instead of "feted."

[Among **economists**, you]{.underline} can certainly [find plenty who
are celebrated for promoting infinite exponential growth. Captains of
industry **love these guys**]{.underline}, because [proclamations from
**[economists]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([who often [have]{.mark} **little
or [no training in physics or ecology]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [give them
the rationale they need to [continue]{.mark} their **programs of
[profiteering]{.mark}**. Neoclassical economists]{.underline} from
universities around the world [have repeatedly **claimed**]{.underline}
that economic growth is consistent with environmental protection, [but
"claiming" and "showing" are **two different things**]{.underline}. In
fact, economic [[growth]{.mark} has been **tightly [correlated with
biodiversity loss]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [[the]{.mark} **theorized
[inverse relationship]{.mark}** between per capita GDP and environmental
damage [has been **debunked**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More on economists
as I get into my blow-by-blow below.

Liebreich gets his thesis rolling in the first paragraph with this
doozy: "...the award of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Romer and
William Nordhaus, in the same week, can only be interpreted as a huge
slap in the face for the champions of 'degrowth'." So what? It's not an
out-of-the-blue slap in the face. The Nobel Prize in Economics is
actually the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel, established in 1968 by Sweden's central bank. The prize,
which was tacked onto the original slate of Nobel Prizes, is rooted in
growth-based economics and has regularly been awarded to neoclassical
economists, including Milton Friedman, Robert Solow, and now Romer and
Nordhaus, all of whom are on board with the capitalist growth paradigm.

Over the next few paragraphs, Liebreich enters the realm of physics and
energy. I give him props --- most growth-obsessed businessmen don't
bother with such topics. But he quickly goes off the rails. His claim is
that [scientifically literate economists and engineers]{.underline},
such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Jay Forrester, Herman Daly, Jeremy
Rifkin, and Tim Jackson, [have all misunderstood the laws of
thermodynamics]{.underline} and their effect on economic processes. He
thinks that because the Earth receives a daily dose of energy from the
sun that we can have endless growth, which may be bolstered or sped up
by nuclear fission and fusion. He calls the notion of a limit to growth
"pure fake science" (This is "fake science" in the same way the New York
Times is "fake news".). Well, [how about checking in with a
**scientist**?]{.underline}

Tom [Murphy, a professor of physics at the University of
California,]{.underline} San Diego, [has done the math on **energy
growth** and **limits**. He exposes just how **ridiculous it is to pine
for ongoing exponential growth**]{.underline} in energy consumption. In
his scenario, [we maintain]{.underline} the rate of growth of energy use
at [2.3%]{.underline} per year, which is less than the 2.9% rate we've
been able to achieve over the last few centuries. And just for fun, he
has us using solar panels that are 100% efficient at turning sunlight
into electricity --- a physical impossibility (solar photovoltaics'
efficiency is currently about 1/5th of that). Given the 2.3% growth
rate, we would have to cover the whole surface of the Earth, land and
water, with solar panels in just 400 years. Murphy doesn't stop there,
though. He also analyzes fusion as a source of energy. At 2.3% annual
growth, [[fusion]{.mark} or any source of energy [would produce **as
much**]{.mark} **energy [as the sun]{.mark}**]{.underline} within 1,400
years, [a virtual drop in the bucket of human history, so [the
surface]{.mark} of the Earth [would have to be **hotter**]{.mark} **than
the surface of the sun**.]{.underline}

I can almost hear [Liebreich's protests]{.underline} right now[:
economic growth isn't the same thing as energy growth]{.underline}! He
and Murphy agree on this point. At first the economy grew more or less
together with energy, but since 1950 economic growth has outpaced energy
growth by a couple of percentage points. Murphy points out that the
difference between economic and energy growth can be split into two
categories: efficiency gains and "everything else" which he classifies
as finance, real estate, innovation, and other aspects of the service
economy (note: Liebreich heaps praise on Romer's Endogenous Growth
Theory that explains how accumulated knowledge contributes to economic
growth --- Romer's "knowledge" component of growth corresponds with
Murphy's "everything else" category).

Murphy quickly discredits the possibility of endless efficiency growth
with a little bit of thermodynamic expertise and some arithmetic. He
then asks the practical question, "[In a future world where energy
growth has **ceased**]{.underline}, and efficiency has been squeezed to
a practical limit, [can we still expect to grow our economy through
innovation]{.underline}, technology, and services?" He again runs the
numbers to test the idea. [He assumes 5% economic growth over the long
term and calculates what fraction of economic activity has to come from
the non-energy-demanding sector. In just a hundred years, that fraction
gets]{.underline} close [to **100%**]{.underline}. Expenditures on food,
energy, and manufactured goods would be negligible. But how massive of a
service sector can be supported on top of a relatively small
agricultural and industrial sector? Just how many people will be engaged
in trading commodity futures, orchestrating credit default swaps, and
writing blogs when the limits of food production have been reached?

Liebreich surprises again by departing from most other critics who deny
the reality or dismiss the seriousness of climate change. He understands
that climate change is "real, serious, and urgent," and goes on to say
that we need to apply technology, "both new and yet-to-be-developed, on
a heroic scale" to avert climate change. Notice how he's proposing we
rely on the same game plan---economic growth plus technology---to solve
the very problem it caused (but at least he concedes we need to do
something). With [this **unoriginal game plan of more
growth**]{.underline} and more technology, he [hands the ball to his
**star player**]{.underline}, William
**[[Nordhaus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nordhaus's work on climate change
and economic growth, which won him the Nobel, [[is
**questionable**]{.mark} when applied to the real world]{.underline}. In
1991 he said, "Agriculture, the part of the economy that is sensitive to
climate change, accounts for just 3% of national output. That means that
there is no way to get a very large effect on the US economy." Hmm, so
[if there's a significant reduction in access to food in this country,
there will be **little effect on the economy**?]{.underline} And what
about all the economic transactions that occur in coastal areas ---
might there be a substantial effect on the economy when those areas are
part of the ocean? Give him another Nobel --- maybe he can share it with
this guy.

After Nordhaus, Liebreich continues on his tour of Nobel laureates with
Simon Kuznets, who won the prize for his work on national income
accounting. Kuznets found that income inequality tended to increase as
economic activity grew in a given nation, but at some point inequality
would level off and then decrease. This relationship became known as
[the **[Kuznets]{.mark} curve**]{.underline}. Liebreich brings up
Kuznets so he can drop a reference to the concept of [the environmental
Kuznets curve]{.underline}, which [has **very little to do with
Kuznets's** actual work]{.underline}. Kuznets came up with the idea of
tracking economic output at the national scale --- he invented what
would evolve into the king of all economic statistics, gross domestic
product (GDP). Kuznets himself was very concerned with how his work
might be misapplied. In a 1934 report to the US Congress, Kuznets said,
"The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of
national income." He went on to advise, "Goals for more growth should
specify more growth of what and for what." What a refreshing sentiment,
but also a sad one, given how Liebreich and other "growthists" in charge
of the economy have completely ignored Kuznets's warning. Two more
points about the oddity of Liebreich's decision to use Kuznets in
support of his contentions:

He states that "[Environmental Kuznets Curves]{.underline} has \[sic\]
been shown to govern most forms of local pollution." That[['s great for
**local pollution**, but if]{.mark} too much [growth causes]{.mark}
**widespread global pollution**]{.underline} ([e.g., **[climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [or other global environmental
calamities]{.underline} ([e.g., biodiversity loss,]{.underline}
including the loss of species we depend upon for pollination, loss of
[topsoil, degradation of ecosystem services]{.underline}), [[there's
**not much to celebrate**]{.underline}]{.mark} in theoretical
environmental Kuznets curves.

Liebreich is aware of the flaws in GDP, and he wants to replace it with
a different measure that adds up natural capital (nature's bounty),
human capital (knowledge), and manmade capital (infrastructure). I share
this perspective, but let's be clear: [**growing the economy** means
**growing GDP**.]{.underline} [Growth is about **quantity**]{.underline}
--- it's an increase in the number of people, or per capita consumption,
or both. If we were to change GDP to reflect "wellbeing" or "true
wealth" (something very different from the dollar value of economic
output), and then we set a goal of optimizing the economy based on this
indicator, we wouldn't prescribe continuous growth. We would balance
economic production and its consequences with preservation of natural
ecosystems and the services they provide.

From Nordhaus, Liebreich continues on his weird journey of Nobel worship
and selects Ilya Prigione (awarded the prize in chemistry in 1977) as
his next stop. His interpretation of Prigogine's work is downright
bizarre. I'm no expert in Prigogine's research on non-equilibrium
dissipative structures, but I'll take at face value Liebreich's
description of it. [He notes]{.underline} that [Prigogine observed "how
a flow of energy across a closed system can drive the creation of 'order
out of chaos']{.underline}." Here's the bizarre part. From that single
observation, [Liebreich **stunningly concludes**, "This is a real
scientific expert on entropy proving that the economy can grow for as
long as there is still a sun in the sky]{.underline} (which would give
us about another five billion years)." [Wait, **what**?!? "Order out of
chaos" is not the same thing as "unending growth out of
chaos."]{.underline} Take, for instance, a snow globe as an example of a
closed system. Applying energy across the snow globe could produce order
from the chaos --- maybe you could get the snowflakes to line up in neat
little rows. But it doesn't mean you could produce an exponentially
growing number of snowflakes for the next five billion years! If I
wanted to make a similar argument, I'd point out that Einstein won the
Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the photoelectric effect. Then
I'd say, "This is a real scientific expert on matter and energy proving
that the economy will infinitely shrink as long as Captain Kirk and
Spock remain pals."

If Liebreich wants to apply the work of a "real scientist" who won the
Nobel Prize in chemistry, why does he select Prigogine, anyway? He
should be reporting the work of Frederick Soddy. Soddy won his prize in
1921, but then he changed course. Disillusioned with how his work and
the work of his colleagues in chemistry was being repurposed for immoral
uses in war, he decided to apply his scholarly skills to economic
questions. In studying economic growth, money creation, and finance,
Soddy noted, "[You cannot permanently pit an absurd human convention,
such as]{.underline} the spontaneous increment of [debt]{.underline}
(compound interest), [against the natural law]{.underline} of the
spontaneous decrement [of]{.underline} wealth ([entropy]{.underline})."
To borrow Liebreich's argumentative structure again, [this is [a
**real**]{.mark} **scientific [expert]{.mark}**]{.underline} [who
[understands]{.mark} that a reliable flow of energy is the key to
economic activity, and that the **[flow is
finite]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's worth pointing out that Soddy's
economics career wasn't a delusion of grandeur born of a midlife crisis
--- he generated original, insightful, and useful ideas. He proposed
five economic policies that were dismissed at the time as outlandish.
Four of the five have since been adopted as standard practice. The fifth
--- remove the power granted to banks to create money out of thin air
--- is still waiting in the wings, because this policy is antithetical
to the pursuit of continuous growth.

The tour of "Nobel-ity" continues. Liebreich unexpectedly highlights the
work of Elinor Ostrom. I say "unexpectedly" because many supporters of
ecological economics and degrowth turn to Ostrom for insight. Liebreich
summarizes her work with this paradoxical statement: "It turns out that
with effective governance and social structures, groups of individuals
are quite capable of managing shared resources without relying on
top-down government edicts." I don't know what he means by "top-down
government edicts," but he is arguing for effective governance and
social structures, an argument which directly opposes his call for
unlimited economic growth. Here's why: the economy grows when shared
resources are removed from the commons and brought into the realm of
economic transactions. If a community publicly owns a lake and shares
the resources it provides (recreation, fish, etc.), no money changes
hands and the economy doesn't grow. But if one enterprising capitalist
gains ownership of the lake and starts charging a price for access, then
he has monetized the activity around the lake and set the economy to
growing. [Everyone, except the one capitalist, may be worse off, but
**we've got growth** --- **hooray**]{.underline}!

Along with his strange interpretations of the work of selected Nobel
laureates, Liebreich also makes strange pronouncements about the
left/right political division. He seems to think there's a sinister
leftist agenda to impose a draconian global governing body and wreck the
economy by preventing perpetual exponential growth. But many people
concerned about the tradeoff between growing the economy and protecting
the life-support systems of the planet aren't all that keen on global
governance. Instead they want stronger, more resilient local economies,
which amounts to greater abilities and power residing in communities.
Even ecosocialists, who are on the opposite side of the political
spectrum from Liebreich, see small farms (not global bodies) as seats of
sustainable governance. The wicked problem of overshoot (overpopulation
combined with overconsumption) is not a left versus right problem; it's
a problem for every single human being on Earth.

I've poked holes in Michael Liebreich's arguments, and along the way
I've poked fun at him. He seems like a smart man, and I actually think
his heart's in the right place --- he wants good things for humanity.
And [unlike **most growthists**, he even wants each country to preserve
a **substantial portion of natural ecosystems**. The trouble is that
**he's got conflicting** goals. Continuous economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline} (increasing population and consumption)
[[is **incompatible**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [both
[preservation]{.mark} of natural ecosystems and long-term sustainability
of human society. [**You don't solve overshoot by overshooting
further**!]{.mark}]{.underline} He is willing to bend facts to fit his
economic-growth-at-all-costs ideology. I used to fall into the same
trap, but [I'm [not waiting around for the **Easter Bunny**]{.mark} **to
deliver some sort of magical eggs that'll save us**]{.underline}. And
unlike Liebreich, I'm certainly not betting the future of humanity or
the planet on Ronald Reagan's Disneyesque "there are no limits"
rhetoric.

If Leibreich is so keen on scientists and Nobel laureates, why leave the
last line to a president whose main gig was playing make believe in
Hollywood? He could have chosen a president with a Nobel Prize and a
background in science (including nuclear physics), farming, and business
--- Jimmy Carter. Carter said, "...too many of us now tend to worship
self-indulgence and consumption. Human identity is no longer defined by
what one does, but by what one owns. But we've discovered that owning
things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.
We've learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of
lives which have no confidence or purpose." We desperately need an
economy that can meet humanity's needs without risking environmental
meltdown and undermining the basis for civilization. It's a smaller
economy, but one concerned with meaning and purpose rather than growth.
In the end, [there is no "**secret of eternal growth**." The secret is
that [we need to **let go of**]{.mark} **the obsession with
[growth]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Cobalt]{.underline}]{.mark}, a key metallic element [[used
in]{.underline}]{.mark} lithium batteries and other
\"[[green]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [[tech]{.mark}nology, [is sourced from
**exploited labor**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Democratic Republic of
Congo. As the West points the finger at China, the US Africa Command is
indirectly policing mining operations that profit US corporations.

Ever since Belgium's King Leopold II (1835-1909) established the Congo
Free State in 1885, international powers have exploited the region's
vast resources. Leading a regime that went on to kill an estimated eight
million people to plunder their gold, ivory, and rubber, Leopold
reportedly described Congo as "a magnificent African cake."

More recently, US President [Biden's]{.underline} International
[Trade]{.underline} Administration [declared: "With]{.underline} total
[[mineral wealth estimated in]{.mark} the]{.underline} tens of
**[[trillions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of dollars," what is now called
[the]{.underline} Democratic Republic of Congo ([DRC]{.underline})
"[offers opportunities for **American firms**]{.underline} with a high
tolerance for risk." [The role of the Africa Command is to **reduce that
risk**]{.underline}. The US Department of Defense says that [Africa "has
a **plethora of strategic materials**, such as cobalt, chromium,
tantalum and more. African resources are **[critical to]{.mark} 21st
century [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (read: US corporate
dominance).

From the late-1990s to the present, [Euro-American mining, processing,
and financial [corporations]{.mark} have [relied on]{.mark}]{.underline}
the **[[slave-labor]{.underline}]{.mark}** of miners [and the muscle of
**armed gangs** to export rare earth metals]{.underline}, such as coltan
and tantalum, to the West for vital components in computers, phones,
missiles, etc. [The rush to renewables ushers in a **new era of
competition**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the rare metal,
**[cobalt]{.underline}**.

The US sets its sights on a mineral rich Congo

DRC has an estimated population of 93 million. The country's entire
gross domestic product is around \$50 billion , making it one of the
poorest countries in the world. [As trillion-dollar companies like
Apple, Microsoft and Tesla rely on DRC's materials, seven in 10
[Congolese survive]{.mark} on [less **than \$1.90 a
day**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Life expectancy is 60 years, compared to 78
in the US, and infant mortality is 66 deaths per 1,000 live births
compared to 5.6 in the US.

The Pentagon's main interest in Congo began during the Second World War
(1939-45). Owned by Belgium's Union Minière, the Shinkolobwe mine in the
southern Katanga province contained the purest known uranium ore, which
the US Army Corps of Engineers used in the Manhattan Project launched in
1942 to construct the world's first nuclear weapon. [Ore]{.underline}
from the mine was [used in the]{.underline} subsequent [manufacture of
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline}.

By the 1950s, the US State Department planned to invest \$660 million
(around \$7 billion today) to "develop" Congo's infrastructure for
corporate exploitation. In 1960, Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba declared
independence from Belgium, naming the country the Republic of the Congo
(RoC), and making relatively mild overtures to the USSR. The politician
Moïse Tshombé declared Katanga's independence from RoC.

MI6 murdered Lumumba and the CIA replaced him with its asset, General
Mobutu Sese Seko, who later renamed the country Zaire and ruled until
his overthrow in 1997.

Throughout the 1960s, [the CIA]{.underline} essentially
[created]{.underline} and managed [the Zairian Armed Forces]{.underline}
(Forces Armées Zaïroises, ZAC), training special air units and hiring
mercenaries to bolster Mobuto's forces. Tshombé's secession was crushed,
as were intermittent struggles, such as the Simba Rebellion from 1963 to
'65; one of whose leaders was future President, Laurent-Désiré Kabila.
The US reluctantly tolerated small Cuban and Chinese military
contingents in Zaire because they did not affect mining operations. By
the 1980s, Belgian, French, German, and Israeli personnel were also
training the ZAC.

Washington plays innocent bystander while fueling intrigues

Geographical considerations, [the involvement of **neighboring
states**]{.underline}, international [**interference**, the role of
specific ethnic groups]{.underline} in particular conflicts, [and
shifting paramilitary alliances make the Congo Wars **extremely
complicated**. What follows is a basic outline focusing on the
**largely-overlooked US role**]{.underline}.

Since at least 1990, the US has used Uganda as a conduit to arm
Zaire/DRC. Until Uganda's role in the wars was exposed, the Bill Clinton
administration's African Crisis Response Initiative saw an initial round
of US military training for the Uganda People's Defense Force. Clinton's
International Military Education and Training programs continued
regardless. Both programs worsened the Congo crises, as we will see.

The centerpiece of the First Congo War that began in 1996 was the
overthrow of Gen. Mobutu, led by Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Congo (Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la
Libération du Congo-Zaïre, AFDL). The AFDL was supported by the Rwandan
Patriotic Front (RPF), whose Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, now the president of
Rwanda, had been trained by the US at Fort Leavenworth. RPF personnel
were trained by the Green Berets.

Described as a "visionary" by US Gen. George Joulwan, Kagame had honed
his craft murdering Hutu during the Rwanda Genocide in 1994. Hundreds of
thousands of Hutu fled into DRC, settling in the eastern regions where
the mineral resources happened to be located. The RPF and its allied
paramilitaries occupied DRC, initially to help build up Kabila's Armed
Forces, but also to avenge massacres of Tutsi and secure the mines.

We can plausibly assume based on chronicles of events that Washington's
role was to play innocent bystander while benefiting from the mining and
supply-chain operations of the RPF, Ugandan military, and related gangs.

Foreign [[demand]{.mark} for rare earth minerals [drives an
**unprecedented death toll**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Even before Kabila seized power, international mining and infrastructure
giants were negotiating contracts with his AFDL party.

American Mineral Fields landed a \$1 billion deal to mine DRC. Bechtel
hired NASA to provide satellite images of mineral-rich regions and
allegedly acquire information on rebel movements for Kabila's military.
As Anglo-American, Barrick Gold, DeBeers, and other corporations signed
mining contracts, Kabila created the Banque de Commerce, du
Developpement et de l'Industrie to finance mining operations. The bank
was based in Rwanda, from which untraceable coltan sourced from DRC
conflict areas was exported to Western corporations, including Afrimex,
Banro-Resources, and Union Transport.

[The]{.underline} Second Congo [War]{.underline}, from 1998-2003 and de
facto to the present, [has led to the [deaths of]{.mark}]{.underline} an
estimated **[[5.4 million]{.mark} people]{.underline}**: most of them
civilians who perished from war-related hunger and disease. [The war
was]{.underline}, in large part, [an effort]{.underline} by different
powers and factions [to]{.underline} back or depose the Kabila family
dynasty, **[seize control of resource-rich areas]{.underline}**, and [to
settle long-standing rivalries]{.underline}. Unlike the first war, [this
one was **explicitly driven**]{.underline} [by demand in Asia, Europe,
and North America for rare materials.]{.underline}

The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that Kabila's
nationalizations "sent a worrying signal ... to foreign companies that
are eager to do business in this mineral-rich country." Kabila soon fell
out with his Ugandan and Rwandan backers, who in 1998 helped to form a
new party: the Rally for Congolese Democracy (Rassemblement Congolais
pour la Démocratie, RCD). The anti-Kabila RCD splintered into militant
rebel groups and advanced across the country. Troops from Angola, Chad,
Libya, and Zimbabwe entered DRC to back Kabila, who was assassinated in
2001, leaving his son Joseph (b. 1971) to rule from 2003 until 2019.

As far as international investors were concerned, the myriad rebel
factions were crucial for maintaining the supply lines of rare
materials. Typically, they were smuggled to Europe-bound cargo planes
via Rwanda.

Kony 2012: a US psy-war op aimed at protecting a key proxy

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni was one of America's top proxies in
DRC, and a UN report describes Uganda as a main sponsor of the conflict.
In his effort to remove Museveni, the so-called Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) led by the cultist Joseph Kony attacked Uganda from DCR. In 2006,
the UN backed Uganda's invasion of DRC to hunt for Kony. The
newly-formed US Africa Command (AFRICOM) provided covert assistance to
Uganda, including training and satellite phones, in a failed
counterinsurgency war which caused the LRA to exacerbate their killings
in DRC.

From 2011 to 2017 , the US initiated the anti-Kony operation, Observant
Compass. As part of the mission, the US Special Operations Command
Africa established a task force "to command and control the operation
that stretched from Uganda, through the eastern \[DRC\] into the Central
African Republic, and across South Sudan." Personnel from the fabled
A-Team "served as advisors to \[the\] African Union Regional Task
Force."

Released in the eponymous year, the documentary Kony 2012 brought the
atrocities of the LRA to international attention. But US Special
Operations Command documents suggest that the film's producer, the NGO
Invisible Children, was unwittingly part of a US psychological warfare
operation. Army Special Operations Forces name the Congolese and Ugandan
militaries, as well as several NGOs including Invisible Children, as
"partners" in their operations.

Unlike the first attempt, Observant Compass reduced the LRA's numbers
and notoriety.

[As China fears rise, **[AFRICOM enters]{.mark} the fray**]{.underline}
--- [[and **atrocities ensue**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Washington and]{.underline} various [European]{.underline} "former"
colonial [powers shifted policy from indirectly backing
proxies]{.underline}, like the Uganda and Rwanda-supported rebels, [to
"professionalizing" the]{.underline} central Armed Forces (Forces Armées
de la République Démocratique du Congo, [FARDC]{.underline}). The George
W. Bush administration introduced a DRC "security sector reform"
program, which included hiring the private "contractor," Camber
Corporation.

The Bush administration's urge to "professionalize" and "legitimize" the
FARDC coincided with China's growing activities in the country. A Fort
Benning Training and Doctrine Command document bemoaned the fact that in
2007 "China signed an agreement with \[DRC\] in which China provides \$5
billion for infrastructure improvements in exchange for rights to DRC's
natural resources."

Now that China was in DRC, human rights and traceable supply lines
suddenly became a concern for Washington. US advanced training of the
FARDC coincided with the passing of Dodd-Frank 2010, which required the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to mandate companies to verify
supply chains.

In the same year, AFRICOM facilitated the US-DRC military partnership.
The objective was "to transform the \[FARDC\]," among other things for
"internal security operations." A new Light Infantry Battalion was
inaugurated by US Ambassador William Garvelink at the Kisangani Base
Camp in north-central DRC. Training was provided under AFRICOM's Special
Operations Command, led by Brig. Gen. Christopher Haas, and unnamed
State Department "contractors."

By September, [750 soldiers had graduated in what AFRICOM describes as
"a model for future reforms]{.underline} within the Congolese armed
forces" [and reveals the creation of a new 391st Commando
Battalion]{.underline}. Commander of training at Camp Base, Maj. John
Peter Molengo, said: "In 2006 our president \[Bush\] promised a
transformation of the \[DRC\] armed forces. I see this as an important
step."

Within a few years, the "important step" was revealed for what it was.
[Members of the [Battalion]{.mark} had been [exposed]{.mark} by the UN
[**looting villages**, **murdering civilians**, and **rap**]{.mark}**ing
dozens of women and girls,**]{.underline} some as young as six. Stars
and Stripes reported: "[AFRICOM **declined to comment**]{.underline}
..., referring questions to the U.S. State Department."

Uganda's military spreads chaos

[[If adding to **chaos**]{.underline} [is the goal, AFRICOM's strategy
is **working**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To date, [there are 4.5 million
internally displaced Congolese]{.underline}, over one million of whom
lost their homes during fighting in 2016-17 alone.

Like the LRA, another rebel group --- this time, Islamic --- called the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), bolted from the Ugandan military and
based itself in DRC where it is now attempting to establish a caliphate.
The UN Organization Stabilization Mission DRC is helping the FARDC.
Operations that began in North Kivu in November 2019 wound up displacing
400,000 people. In a repeat of botched US efforts to conquer the LRA,
FARDC tactics caused the ADF to enter previously peaceful territory.

Founded in the 1970s, the Cooperative for Development of the Congo
(Coopérative de développement économique du Congo, CODECO) is an
umbrella of militia based in Ituri province in the northeast. CODECO
mainly consists of ethnic Lendu whose are engaged in long-standing
conflict with the Hema people. Despite the July 2020 peace agreement,
FARDC operations have exacerbated the violence.

Founded in 1969, the ethno-federalist Kongo-majority Bundu Dia Kongo
(BDK) is a Christian cult that encourages violence against non-Kongo
peoples, even setting up roadblocks to divide communities. The BDK faces
crackdowns by the police and FARDC, which in April 2020 launched
anti-BDK operations in Kongo Central and in the capital, Kinshasa.

**[Greenwashing]{.underline}** [the race for **trillions in renewables
profits**]{.underline}

[As the violence continues]{.underline} across much of the country, [so
do the exports]{.underline} to most of the world. [Corporate
profiteering from the global climate emergency has triggered a **cobalt
rush**]{.underline}. The unreliability of DRC supply chains has also
triggered a move to design cobalt-free renewables.

Concentrated among 3,000 companies, [the]{.underline} so-called global
[green economy is worth \$4.5 trillion ; more than]{.underline} the
international **[oil]{.underline}** and gas sector. The renewables
market alone is worth over \$600 billion . Electric vehicles (EV) are
valued at around \$170 billion and expected to growth to \$700 billion
within the next five years.

Cathodes are an essential part of the lithium ion batteries (LiBs) that,
until recently, had been ubiquitous but tiny, hitherto requiring small
amounts of cobalt. [The emerging **EV market means**]{.underline} that
large [100 kilowatt-per-hour [LiBs contain **20 kg of
cobalt**]{.mark}]{.underline} in their cathode components. The US
Department of Energy explains that in addition to being mined, cobalt
([Co]{.underline}) [is]{.underline} obtained as a by-product of other
materials and almost [entirely sourced from abroad, making US businesses
dependent on metal markets and exporting countries]{.underline}.
American corporations are therefore "looking to secure sources of Co, to
drastically reduce the Co content in LiBs, or both."

At present, [255,000 Congolese mine for cobalt]{.underline}, mainly in
the conflict-free south, [earning less than **\$2 per day**]{.underline}
[with **no benefits**]{.underline} [in conditions that are both
**immediately hazardous**]{.underline} (e.g., collapsing tunnels,
dangerous tools) [and **carry long-term risk**]{.underline} (e.g.,
respiratory, orthopedic). Some 40,000 cobalt miners are children.

Bolstered by their legal obligations to report to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, numerous [US [corporations]{.mark} have attempted
to **[greenwash their]{.mark} supply [chains]{.mark}**]{.underline} by
claiming that they are sourced ethically. The Anglo-Swiss mining giant,
Glencore, has a market capitalization roughly equal to DRC's entire GDP.
In recent years, it has signed partnership pledges with renewables
customers to ethically source cobalt.

Other initiatives include Apple's Supplier Responsibility Progress
reports. BMW, Samsung, and others, meanwhile, have launched the Cobalt
for Development Project. Tesla says that it will phase out cobalt from
its lithium batteries and, in the meantime has, joined the Fair Cobalt
Alliance. But a recent class action lawsuit on behalf of several injured
Congolese miners alleges that Alphabet (Google), Apple, Dell, Microsoft,
and Tesla are "aiding and abetting the cruel and brutal use of young
children ... to mine cobalt."

Playing the blame China game

Despite the greenwashing, the cobalt mining, refining, smelting, and
exportation industries remain dangerous, exploitative, polluting, and
terrible for public relations. On the other hand, these [conditions help
to keep production costs **low** and profits **high**. The]{.underline}
informal [solution]{.underline} for many Western businesses and
governments [is to]{.underline} deploy media, NGOs, and the
intelligentsia to [[point the **moral finger**]{.mark} **of blame [at
China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whose corporations operate extensively in
southern, cobalt-rich DRC.

For example, a recent Guardian article exposes the cruel working
conditions in the town of Fungurume imposed on small and "artisanal"
miners contracted by the big, so-called legitimate companies, like
China's Molybdenum. Describing a "slave and master" relationship, one of
thousands of miners revealed how he works for \$3.50 a day, eating two
tiny bread rolls, with wages deducted for missing work.

The report was funded by Humanity United, an NGO founded by eBay
billionaire and Intercept owner Pierre Omidyar's wife, Pam. Humanity
United has received grant money from numerous sources, including the
William J. Clinton Foundation. "This grant funded Humanity United's
continued contribution and membership to the 2011 Clinton Global
Initiative."

**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** such reports omit that [China's
[Molybdenum is owned by **US**]{.mark} **institutional
investors**]{.underline}: JPMorgan Funds, Vanguard Total International,
Vanguard Emerging Markets, BlackRock, and others. Amnesty International
traces the "downstream" supply chain of Chinese-acquired cobalt to
Asian, European, and US corporations.

Cobalt is typically smelted and refined by China's Huayou and its CDM
subsidiary, put into batteries by Amperex, BYD, LG, Samsung, Sony, and
others, and sold as components in Apple, BMW, Dell, Fiat-Chrysler, GM,
Microsoft, Tesla, and other Western products.

Weaponizing space to win the "Great Power Competition"

DRC is directly linked to Washington's long-term efforts to rule the
world by force. Just as King Leopold II described Congo as a
"magnificent African cake," ex-US Naval Intelligence Officer, Dr. Mir
Sadat, Policy Director of the National Security Council, says:

"Great Power Competition in space is in some ways analogous to the Great
Game of the 19th and early 20th centuries between Great Britain and
Russia, which competed over access to resources and geostrategic
positioning in Central and South Asia. Today, there is a similar great
game brewing between China and other spacefaring nations led by the
United States over access to potential cislunar \[between Earth and
Moon\] resources and overall space dominance."

But it wasn't China that first declared its intention to rule space and
therefore the world. In 1997, the US Space Command published its "full
spectrum dominance" doctrine: to weaponize space by the year 2020 "to
protect U.S. interests and investment" (read: corporate profits).
Endangering us all, "full spectrum dominance" includes hypersonic
missile drones and high-altitude craft that can strike Russia and/or
China with "low-yield" nuclear weapons.

Like other products that emerged from taxpayer funding under the cover
of military research and development (satellites, computers, the
internet, etc.), space exploration is now commercialized through
companies like Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin company, while serving the
Pentagon by, for instance, launching military satellites, as Elon Musk's
SpaceX has done. The Pentagon and other federal agencies describe this
arrangement as the Space Industrial Base.

Sadat helped to establish the Space Force, which largely took over from
the Space Command. Specifically naming cobalt and other rare materials
as the "greatest" supply risks, a fear-mongering report about supposed
lack of US influence, co-authored by Sadat and sponsored by the Space
Force, says: "The United States must compete for global market share and
leadership --- currently dominated by China, Russia over terrestrial
commodities --- basic and manufactured --- into the space economy."

It may turn out that [the [millions of **destitute**]{.mark} **Congolese
sitting on tantalum and coltan**, and the hundreds of thousands of
slave-like and child miners toiling in hazardous conditions [to extract
these]{.mark} products [are **not the only victims**. If]{.mark} the
"Great Game" for "[**full spectrum dominance**" continues
**without**]{.mark} **grassroots [pressure]{.mark} to end it**,
[escalating]{.mark} geopolitical "[competition]{.mark}" [between nuclear
powers could **annihilate the**]{.mark} **rest of the [world]{.mark} as
well**]{.underline}.

Stronger than ever before, [the I]{.underline}ntergovernmental
[P]{.underline}anel on [C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange has
[warned]{.underline} that [climate change is already causing severe and
permanent loss and damage]{.underline} to human and natural systems.

Exceeding 1.5C of warming would cause further irreversible harm --- from
which full recovery is impossible.

The devastating impacts over shooting 1.5C include species extinction,
loss of entire ecosystems on land and in the oceans, and ever more
extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and fires
that endanger water resources, ecosystems, and livelihoods.

It also poses the risk of triggering tipping points and feedbacks in the
climate system that would accelerate the climate crisis.

Some in the scientific community are [[grasping for]{.mark}
technological [fixes in]{.mark}]{.underline} the field of climate
[[geoengineering --- **unproven**, **high-risk
tech**]{.mark}**nologies**[:]{.mark}]{.underline} carbon dioxide removal
(**[[CDR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} solar
radiation management (**[[SRM]{.underline}]{.mark}**).

Interest in such high-risk technologies has grown in some government
circles and, even more notably, in polluting industries such as the
fossil fuel industry, mining, aviation --- as well as in Silicon Valley.

However, the latest IPCC report finds [they [could trigger
**catastrophic events**]{.mark}, particularly in **vulnerable parts of
the world**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} would [introduce a range of
new, **egregious hazards** to people and ecosystems.]{.underline}

Large-scale technological [CDR **[jeopardises]{.mark}
ecosystems**]{.underline}, [**[biodiversity]{.underline}**,
**[food]{.underline}** [and **water security**]{.underline}]{.mark},
livelihoods and [land rights]{.underline}, in particular [for indigenous
people and local communities.]{.underline} The 2018 special report on
1.5C cautioned against heavy reliance on CDR, strongly questioning its
social and environmental feasibility.

[CDR]{.underline} also [faces limitations to its
**effectiveness**]{.underline}: the last IPCC report, published in
August, found that [CO2 [removals will]{.mark} partially **[be
counteracted]{.mark} by CO2 release from oceans**]{.underline} and land
reservoirs, and [only [a smaller fraction]{.mark} actually [remains
**out**]{.mark} **of the atmosphere**. Uncertainties around permanent
storage further undercuts CDR's effectiveness]{.underline} in reversing
temperature overshoot.

[Risks]{.underline} of [[triggering **tipping points** and
**feedbacks**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such as permafrost thawing and
forest ecosystem degradation, drastically]{.underline} **[increase at
warming levels beyond 1.5C]{.underline}**, [further reducing the ability
to **return from an overshoot**]{.underline}.

Finally, other [dramatic [changes]{.mark}]{.underline} in the global
climate system [[would **not be reversed**]{.mark}, but [continue for
**centuries**]{.mark} **to millennia**, such as rising sea levels that
threaten the existence of small island states]{.underline} and low-lying
coastal areas, and the millions of people in those areas.

IPCC: Five takeaways from the UN's 2022 climate impacts report

Some are proposing to deploy solar geoengineering (SRM) to reduce
temperature overshoot.

The IPCC has consistently warned about the severe risks and potentially
catastrophic impacts of a large-scale manipulation of the climate
system. The most recent IPCC report warns in its summary for
policymakers that [[SRM]{.mark} approaches "introduce a **widespread
range of new risks**]{.underline} to people and ecosystems, [which are
**not well understood**]{.underline}".

[SRM [comes with]{.mark} **severe [risks]{.mark}** of
[disrupting]{.mark} regional and seasonal **[rainfall]{.mark}
patterns**, **[ozone]{.mark} depletion**, [**ocean acidification**,
and]{.mark} other known and **[unknown]{.mark} adverse
side-[effects]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Because [SRM would [only **"mask" temperature**]{.mark}]{.underline}
rise and [[not]{.mark} address [the **root**]{.mark} **cause** of the
problem, a sudden [termination]{.mark} would [induce]{.mark} a rapid
**acceleration of climate change**]{.underline} --- a so-called
"**[[termination shock]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [[Adaptation would be
**impossible**]{.underline}]{.mark} for many species and ecosystems.

Opposition to SRM continues to grow outside of the IPCC: over 240
leading international scientists have called for a solar geoengineering
non-use agreement that would effectively prevent SRM from being further
developed.

Opposition is also building on the ground: a recent SRM equipment test
over indigenous territory in Kiruna, Sweden, was cancelled after vocal
opposition by the Saami Council and environmental groups, who deem
climate manipulation to be fundamentally incompatible with indigenous
cosmology.

Revealed: How rich and at-risk nations fought over science of climate
impacts

The only sensible conclusion to be drawn is that [we must]{.underline},
by all means possible, **[urgently embark on trajectories]{.underline}**
[that avoid an **overshoot of 1.5C and climate breakdown.**]{.underline}

No doubt, [[time is **running out**]{.underline}]{.mark}: IPCC working
group I stated that [[the]{.mark} 1.5C [limit is]{.mark} going to be
[breached]{.mark} in the **early 2030s**]{.underline} under most
emissions scenarios. Yet, the 1.5C limit is [imperative]{.underline},
and [bold, resolute, swift measures]{.underline} to embark on
climate-just pathways [can **limit the climate crisis**]{.underline} and
its deleterious impacts.

This means a rapid and comprehensive phase-out all fossil fuels --- oil,
gas, and coal --- led by rich producing countries in the global north,
and needs to happen much earlier than projected in many mitigation
scenarios.

Further pathways to social and climate justice will include democratic
energy systems running 100% on solar and wind, public transportation,
agroecological transformations of our food systems, reductions in energy
and resource consumption in the affluent global north, and a restoration
and regeneration of the world's vitally important ecosystems, protecting
communal land rights, in particular by indigenous peoples and local
communities.

[Dangerous fantasies for]{.underline} **[[hacking the
climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is the **epitome of climate
injustice**]{.underline}: [They distract from the urgency to act on
safe, proven, and viable strategies now. [It's a **diversionary
tactic**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for the fossil fuel industry to
**continue polluting**]{.underline}, and [it [risks **exacerbating
climate chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### ! --- AT: Nuclear Power

#### Nuclear power fails.

**SC '17** --- Sierra Club; most enduring and influential grassroots
environmental organization in the United States. We amplify the power of
our 3.8 million members and supporters to defend everyone's right to a
healthy world April 2017; "How Nuclear Power Worsens Climate Change";
<https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/program/documents/Fact%20Sheet%20Sierra%20Nuclear%20Climate.pdf>;
//CYang

The **[nuclear industry]{.underline}** has been [selling the
world]{.underline} a [story that nuclear power is a solution to climate
change]{.underline} because it does not generate carbon dioxide (CO2), a
major greenhouse gas. While this is true of the nuclear chain reaction
itself, the [front and back ends of nuclear power generate]{.underline}
a [**large volume** of CO2 and leave]{.underline} a [trail of
**endlessly dangerous** radioactivity along the way]{.underline}.

[Nuclear power has a **big carbon footprint**]{.underline}. At the front
end of nuclear power, [carbon energy]{.underline} is [used for uranium
mining]{.underline}, [milling]{.underline}, [processing]{.underline},
[conversion]{.underline}, [and enrichment]{.underline}, as well as for
[transportation]{.underline}, [formulation of rods]{.underline} and
[construction of nuclear reactors]{.underline} (power plants). At the
back end, there is the task of isolation of [**highly radioactive**
nuclear waste for millennia]{.underline} --- a task which science has so
far not been able to address. [Large amounts of water]{.underline} are
also [used]{.underline}, first [in mining and]{.underline} then in
[cooling the reactors]{.underline}. [All along the nuclear fuel
chain]{.underline}, [**radioactive contamination** of air]{.underline},
[land and water occurs]{.underline}. [Uranium mine and mill cleanup
demands large amounts of fossil fuel]{.underline}. Each year [**2,000
metric tons** of high-level radioactive waste]{.underline} and twelve
million cubic-feet of low-level radioactive waste are [generated in the
U.S. alone]{.underline}. None of this will magically disappear. [**Vast
amounts** of energy]{.underline} will be [needed to isolate these
dangerous wastes]{.underline} for generations to come.

[Nuclear power takes **too long to deploy**]{.underline}. Construction
of the [1500 new reactors]{.underline} that the nuclear industry claims
are [needed to address global warming]{.underline} would [mean opening a
new reactor]{.underline} once [**every 2 weeks** for the next 60
years]{.underline}. [Reactors]{.underline} can [take 10-15 years to
build with]{.underline} an estimated [cost of]{.underline} \$12-[15
billion each]{.underline}. In the past, cost and time needed for
construction have each more than doubled from original estimates. We
need to supply low-carbon energy sources NOW.

[Nuclear power]{.underline} is [not suited for **warming
climates**]{.underline}. Nuclear reactors need enormous amounts of cool
water to continually remove heat from their cores.
[Reactors]{.underline} have been [forced to close during heat
waves]{.underline} due to warmth of sea, lake or river water --- just
when electricity is being used most. [Low water levels
during]{.underline} heat and [drought]{.underline} have also [forced
reactors to **shut down**]{.underline}. In addition, cooling [causes
**serious damage** to aquatic life]{.underline}, [killing]{.underline}
millions of fish and [untold]{.underline} numbers of macroinvertebrates,
aquatic eggs and larvae.

Six times as much carbon can be saved with efficiency or wind. Benjamin
Sovacool from the Institute for Energy and Environment at Vermont Law
School averaged the high and low estimates of carbon pollution from
nuclear power. His study revealed that nuclear power's carbon emissions
are well below scrubbed coal-fired plants, natural gas-fired plants and
oil. However, nuclear emits twice as much carbon as solar photovoltaic
and six times as much as onshore wind farms. Energy efficiency and some
of the other renewables also beat nuclear by sixfold or more.

[Nuclear power]{.underline} is [not flexible]{.underline}.
[Nuclear]{.underline} is all-or-nothing power. A reactor [can't be
geared to produce **less power**]{.underline} when electricity from
renewables (like wind and solar) increases on the grid. This can [make
it challenging to increase renewables]{.underline} past a certain point.
When a reactor shuts down due to accident, planned upgrade or permanent
closure, a large amount of power has to be found elsewhere. And [nuclear
plants are being closed]{.underline}, not opened --- some [because they
no longer]{.underline} are [making a **profit**]{.underline}. It's
important to develop renewables NOW to be able to replace the
electricity when utilities announce plans to close reactors.

#### Nuclear energy causes extinction --- creates nuclear explosions every month, proliferation and mineral shortages.

//CYang

There are several reasons why [nuclear energy]{.underline} is [**not
likely** to solve the energy problem and]{.underline}/or [should not be
adopted]{.underline} even if it could.

• Abbott (2012: p. 26) calculates that if [nuclear energy]{.underline}
were expanded to provide all current electricity use (15,000 Twh) it
would [require building **15,000**]{.underline} 1-gigawatt [nuclear
reactors]{.underline} and [all estimated **high-grade uranium reserves**
would be used up in less than five years]{.underline} (and electricity
makes up only one-fifth of world energy use). Even at the present
moderate rate of use, the Energy Watch Group estimates (Zittel et al,
2013) that, peak supply will occur sometime from 2020 to 2045. Uranium
resources could be extended significantly if breeder or fusion reactors
were developed --- but on the viability of these technologies see
further below.

• Apart from uranium scarcity, Abbott (2012) points out that a [nuclear
renaissance would also run into]{.underline} other [**major resource
constraints** such as]{.underline} the [exotic rare metals]{.underline}
([hafnium]{.underline}, [beryllium]{.underline}, [50
zirconium]{.underline} etc.) [used to control and contain nuclear
reactions]{.underline}, which will either be exhausted or become very
costly in a nuclear expansion scenario. Also, such a scenario is likely
to run into the [limit of suitable land sites for nuclear
plants]{.underline}, [which need to be]{.underline} located [away from
major population centers]{.underline} and disasters zones, [and located
near large bodies of water for cooling.]{.underline} Abbott (2012: p.
24) estimates that a nuclear renaissance [would require
4,000]{.underline} nuclear reactors in the US alone [but]{.underline} he
says [finding **100 suitable sites** would be challenging]{.underline}.

• [Nuclear accidents]{.underline} can [have **catastrophic
consequences**]{.underline}. Abbott (2012: p. 26) points out that to
date about 580 nuclear reactors have operated for a total of 14,000
reactor years and resulted in 11 accidents involving 'full or partial
core melt' (writing prior to the Fukushima Daiichi accident). But [if
nuclear energy were expanded]{.underline} to meet all electricity needs
as per the Abbott scenario above, at this rate, '[we]{.underline} might
[expect a **major accident**]{.underline} somewhere in the world [every
month]{.underline}'. While it's true that the industry has worked to
improve on reactor safety design, as Mark Jacobson (2019) notes 'these
designs are generally untested, and there is no guarantee that the
reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly or that a
natural disaster or act of terrorism, such as an airplane flown into a
reactor, will not cause the reactor to fail, resulting in a major
disaster.' No matter how well designed, reactors are operated by humans,
so it is always possible for mistakes to be made, or for operators to
over-ride automatic safety systems, as happened at Chernobyl.

• The '[proliferation]{.underline}' problem. A [nuclear era]{.underline}
would [increase the chances of access to dangerous elements
by]{.underline} criminals and [terrorists]{.underline}, [or governments
seeking to produce **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}.

• There is [**no agreed solution** to]{.underline} the [problem of waste
disposal]{.underline}. It is not possible to be sure that a site that
has been very stable and dry for a long time will remain dry or
earthquake free for hundreds of thousands of years into the future,
through ice ages and greenhouse effects on hydrology. Even the
reprocessing of spent fuel might give terrorists access to highly
radioactive elements. However, breeder reactors might be able to 'burn'
wastes.

• We have no idea what the total long-term health, genetic and mortality
effects of nuclear energy will be. These effects will accumulate over
hundreds of thousands of years as radioactive materials are constantly
cycled through organisms and food chains. Even without accidents, small
quantities of long-lived radioactivity are released. There is no
threshold level below which we can be sure there will be no biological
effect. If we do not have confident estimates of the magnitude of these
long-term biological costs, then it is not possible to say that the
benefits will outweigh the costs in illnesses, mutations and deaths.

• The moral problem: the people living in a nuclear era would get all
the benefit, but many future generations would pay the biological costs
without getting any of the benefit after the fuel has been used up.

• It is uncertain whether [fusion reactors]{.underline} will ever become
viable but if they do, they [will not be scaled up
sufficiently]{.underline} to make much difference before 2050. [They
will be **very costly**]{.underline}. They [require
lithium]{.underline}, [and resource estimates indicate]{.underline} that
[there will **not be enough** to meet demand for electricity storage and
electric vehicles]{.underline}.

There are [so many reasons]{.underline}, all of which have been

The [[atmosphere]{.mark} of Mars]{.underline} is [**considerably

Mars is [coated with]{.underline} a [**[thick]{.mark} field** of

If you've been prepping for a new life on the Red Planet, adjust your
expectations. [There is]{.underline} a [slim chance]{.underline} that
[we may visit Mars]{.underline} within our lifetime, [but]{.underline}

there.

[[At best, Mars]{.mark} will be [a]{.mark} **short-term

appealing in the short-term. It could even be an adventure, like
traveling under the sea.

#### Capabilities -- space might have more resources, but they're too hard to get.

**Daly 17** \[Herman Daly, emeritus professor at the School of Public
Policy of University of Maryland, College Park, "Green Economy Reader \|
A Further Critique of Growth Economics," 2017, Springer, pp. 64-65, EA\]

Of course many technical space accomplishments are real and amazing. But
how do they free us from the finitude of the earth and open up unlimited
resources for growth? [[Space accomplishments have been]{.mark}
**extremely** **[expensive]{.mark}** in]{.underline} terms of
terrestrial resources, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[yielded
**few**]{.underline}]{.mark} extraterrestrial
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [mainly]{.underline} those
[**useless moon rocks**]{.underline} that incited thievery by a NASA
intern. As for new services, [space tourism]{.underline} has [provided
orbital joy rides to a few billionaires.]{.underline} On the truly
positive side of the ledger we can list [communications
[satellites]{.mark}]{.underline}, but they [are oriented to
**earth**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} while they provide valuable
services, they **[[do not bring in]{.mark} new
[resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And apparently some [[orbits are
getting crowded]{.mark} with satellite carcasses.]{.underline}

Robotic space exploration is a lot cheaper than manned space missions,
and may (or may not) yield knowledge worth the investment to a society
that has not yet provided basic necessities and elementary education for
most of its inhabitants. In such a world political willingness to
finance the expensive curiosity of a scientific elite might be less,
were it not for the heavy military connection (muted in the official
NASA propaganda). Cuts in NASA's budget have led to the hyped reaction
by the "space community" in proclaiming a pseudo religious technical
quest to discover "whether or not we are alone in the universe". Another
major goal is to find a planet suitable for colonization by earthlings.
The latter is sometimes justified by the claim that since we are clearly
destroying the earth we need a new home -- to also destroy?

The numbers -- [**astronomical [distances]{.mark}** [and **time**
**scales**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- effectively **[[rule
out]{.underline}]{.mark}** dreams of **[space
[colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But another consideration is
equally daunting. [If we are unable to limit]{.underline} population and
production [growth on earth, which is our natural and forgiving
home,]{.underline} out of which we were created and with which we have
evolved and adapted, then [[what makes us think we can live]{.mark} as
aliens [within]{.mark} the **much tighter and unforgiving discipline of
[a]{.mark} space [colony on a dead rock in a cold
vacuum?]{.mark}**]{.underline} There [[we would encounter **limits to
growth**]{.mark} **raised [to the hundredth
power]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Metabolic rift and overaccumulation-- our problem isn't the amount of resources, it's how we use them.

**Ray & Parson 20** \[Emily Ray and Sean Parson, \* Assistant Professor

Affairs and Sustainable Communities at Northern Arizona University,
"Limits to Terrestrial Extraction \| Star power: Outer space mining and
the metabolic rift," 2020, Routledge, pp. 58-60, EA\]

The work that best explores the dialectical metabolic relationship is
Foster, York, and Clark's work on the metabolic rift, which is useful
for thinking through this attempt to loop outer space into the metabolic
relationship between production and the environment.

> For Marx, [the metabolic rift]{.underline}---the alienated mediation
> between humanity and nature---[was]{.underline} a product of the
> **['robbing']{.underline}** or expropriation of the soil, and thus of
> **[nature]{.underline}**, thereby [hindering]{.underline} the
> operation of the eternal natural condition for the [lasting
> fertility]{.underline} of the soil.10

Here, Marx argues that [ecological [crisis is]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
part, [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**geographic
[separation]{.mark}** [of **production** and **consumption**. Capitalism
takes]{.mark} massive]{.underline} amounts of
[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} and nutrients from the land [[and
**concentrates** **them**]{.mark} in dumps and urban areas. The
metabolic rift is]{.underline} also [a product of **urbanization**
and]{.underline} increase in [**population density.** The ecological
rift shatters the relationship within a local environment by [creating
an **imbalance**.]{.mark} Either there are too many
nutrients]{.underline} being [taken from the land or too much
material]{.underline} being [added to it.]{.underline} That fissure is
the ecological crisis. The ecological crisis is not simply about inputs
or outputs, about extraction or production, but is instead an issue of
relationality.

Marx also argued that [[humans are]{.mark} **innately [driven to
produce]{.mark}**]{.underline}; that [there is a need to creatively
use]{.underline} that capacity for [labor]{.underline}, and this
accounts for a distinction between humanity and other animals. [Non-use
of the environment is]{.underline} therefore [**not an alternative** to
the]{.underline} ruptured [metabolic rift. Rather**,
[non-alienated]{.mark}** [use]{.mark} of the environment, [governed
by]{.mark} a **[different]{.mark} set of [values]{.mark}**
than]{.underline} those of [neoliberal capitalism, [can
provide]{.mark}]{.underline} the foundation for [a
[sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}, just, and responsible [relation
between **human productive energy** and the **foundation of
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the form of the environment.
Steven Vogel has similarly argued that [the problem is not that humans
engage the environment for resource use, but **how they do
so**]{.underline} that is problematic.11 Is it possible to see the cold,
hard [rocks floating in a]{.underline} freezing [vacuum]{.underline} as
part of the environment that requires a new, non-capitalist approach to
managing the conditions for human life? These same rocks
[are]{.underline} already [considered part of]{.underline} the
[available]{.underline} environmental [resources]{.underline} for
Earth-based needs, [and including them in]{.underline} the movement of
[the metabolism on Earth]{.underline}, or even off-Earth but in
conjunction with on-Earth resources, such as space exploration missions,
[only answers the question of their place in the environment **from the
perspective of capital**]{.underline}. As the private sector gains more
control over the governing of these NEAs, the task of social theory is
to determine if, and how, outer space should be ideological and
practically linked into the metabolic relationship between production
and the sustenance of life.

The process of [taking resources from]{.underline} the
[extra-planetary]{.underline} environments of [asteroids
would]{.underline} only **[further exacerbate this
crisis]{.underline}**. One of the primary narratives of contemporary
capitalism is around resource scarcity, which claims that the limits of
human advancement are linked to the amount of resources on this planet.
Defenders of such practices argue that adding resources from an outside
system would address the crisis of environmental degradation from
terrestrial resource extraction. [Looking to [the stars]{.mark} to
address]{.underline} the issue of [resources and growth
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[a means to **circumvent**]{.mark}
**political [discussions]{.mark}** around resource allocations
and]{.underline} radical [shifts to]{.underline} human, economic, and
social [systems]{.underline} that are [conducive to human
survival.]{.underline} In order [[to **avoid**
**addressing**]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[contradictions of
capitalism]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} the [**[ecological
limits]{.mark}** that bind the human species, these [arguments require
**magical** **thinking** and]{.mark} **grandiose** **technological**
**[innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This [sleight of hand distracts
from]{.underline} an analysis of [the root problem]{.underline} of the
crisis [by focusing on [scarcity]{.mark}]{.underline} --
[which]{.underline} Marcuse decades ago had already shown [[is
**illusory**]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 As Marcuse shows, [[the problem
is]{.underline}]{.mark} not one of scarcity but one of
[**[over-abundance]{.mark}**. Adding [additional
resources]{.mark}]{.underline} into the closed system that is the
ecosystem [[would **exacerbate the metabolic rift**]{.mark}, not solve
it. Looping [NEOs]{.mark} into]{.underline} the [industrial metabolism
not only [adds]{.mark}]{.underline} additional materials [[to
an]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[overburdened planetary
metabolism]{.mark} but]{.underline} also [**overlooks** the]{.underline}
troubling [relationship between neoliberalism and outer space,
reconceived as a frontier for **capital** **expansion**]{.underline},
and fraught with difficult questions about national sovereignty. What is
at stake in extending the planet beyond Earth itself?

#### Only public programs have the incentives and resources.

The human place in outer space should be discussed also in financial
terms, because [the [**main** **sponsor**]{.mark} of space programs
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[public]{.underline}]{.mark}** budget of
[**space [agencies]{.mark}.** [Private]{.mark} investors are **not**
**considered**]{.underline} here for a couple of reasons. First, [their
[**budget** is]{.mark}]{.underline} well **[[below]{.mark} the
[minimal]{.mark} safe [level]{.mark}]{.underline}** needed [for
pre-launch **research** and **development**, **launching** the mission,
and **maintenance**]{.underline} of the mission. It is worth mentioning
that [failure or catastrophe may slow down or]{.underline} even [cancel
private space projects, while public space agencies are **not
financially limited**]{.underline} in this sense. Second, a human space
program---at least in regard to **[[interplanetary
missions]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[**[does not offer commercial
applications]{.mark}**, which would]{.underline} be able to [justify an
expensive investment. Private investors]{.underline} by definition
**[require profits]{.underline}**, at least in the capitalistic,
free-market sense of this term. This remark relates to the third
counterargument: [the space [program is]{.mark} a **long-term**
**effort** and is **[not compatible with short-term]{.mark} policies**
of private [investors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fourth, [the level of
[**risk** and **unpredictability** is **too** **high**]{.mark} for
private investors. [While private investors]{.mark}]{.underline}
may---and they really **[[do]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[**invest** in
**[low]{.mark} Earth [orbit activities]{.mark}** [or **try**]{.mark}
**to go [beyond]{.mark}**, [like]{.mark}]{.underline} in the case of
[**planned** **space** **[tourism]{.mark}** around the Moon, **[private
interplanetary plans]{.mark}**]{.underline} like, for instance, the Mars
One initiative [[are **technologically** and **financially**
**infeasible**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Do et al. 2016). In this case,
technological infeasibility is the effect of financial insufficiency.
[Financial insufficiency works like a **vicious** **circle.** Private
investors meet the funding wall because their]{.underline} starting
[budget]{.underline}, which is too small to finance a space program,
[cannot be supported by]{.underline} the lack of [expected benefits**.

in]{.underline} these [space projects.]{.underline}

Abstract: This article argues that, [contra **Bostrom**]{.underline}
(2003), [[**every second** of **delayed space col**]{.mark}**onization**
could be **immensely [desirable]{.mark}**]{.underline}; indeed, [the
longer the delay, the better, with the **[best outcome being no
colonization]{.mark} at all**]{.underline}. The argument begins by
hypothesizing that expansion into space will generate a wide variety of
distinct species, many having their own cultural, political, religious,
etc. traditions. Next, [the paper offers reasons [for expecting]{.mark}
**catastrophic [conflicts]{.mark}** between different civilizations,
both near and far, to be the **default outcome**]{.underline}. Third, it
examines some strategies for mitigating conflict, including (i) the
establishment of a "cosmic Leviathan" that is capable of imposing law
and order within the cosmopolitical arena, and (ii) the implemen- tation
of policies of deterrence to prevent one civilization from attacking
another. Both of these strategies appear problematic, though, due to (a)
fundamental physical limitations on the speed of space travel and the
transfer of information, and (b) the advanced weaponry that future
civili- zations will almost certainly have at their disposal. [The
conclusion is that colonizing our solar system, galaxy, and beyond will
engender a **Hobbesian predicament** in which all actors are perpetually
in **fear** of **being destroyed**]{.underline}---that is, when they
aren't engaged in devastating wars with their neighbors.

**[Space colonization]{.underline}**, the establishment of permanent
human habitats beyond Earth, [has an enormous potential moral
value]{.underline} because successful space colonization is the
necessary condition for trillions of future people to come into
existence. [At the same time, however, [space col]{.mark}onization [is
**not risk-free**]{.mark}. The [risks]{.mark} of space colonization [are
**so grave** that]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a bad-case scenario,
[[successful space col]{.mark}onization [could create **more**]{.mark}

[If a civilization wants to maximize computation it appears rational to

extraterrestrial intelligence 1 Introduction [Answers to]{.underline}
the [Fermi]{.underline} question ("where are they?")
[typically]{.underline} [fall into]{.underline} the groups ["we are
alone"]{.underline} (because intelligence is very rare, short-lived,
etc.), ["aliens exist but not here"]{.underline} (due to limitations of
our technology, temporal synchronization etc.) [or "they're here" (but
not]{.underline} interacting in any [obvious]{.underline} manner). This
paper will examine a particular version of the third category, the
aestivation hypothesis. In previous work \[1\], we showed that [a
civilization with]{.underline} a [certain]{.underline} threshold
[technology could]{.underline} use the resources of a solar system to
[launch colonization devices to]{.underline} effectively every solar
system in [a sizeable part of the visible universe]{.underline}. While
the process as a whole would last eons, the investment in each
bridgehead system would be small and brief. Also, the earlier the
colonization was launched the larger the colonized volume. These results
imply that **[[early]{.mark}
[civ]{.mark}]{.underline}**ilization**[[s]{.mark} have a far greater
chance to colonize and [pre-empt later
civ]{.mark}]{.underline}**ilization**[[s]{.mark} [if]{.mark} they
wish]{.underline}** to do so. If these early civilizations are around,
why are they not visible? [The aestivation hypothesis
states]{.underline} that **[they are
[aestivating]{.mark}]{.underline}**[1]{.mark} **[[until a later]{.mark}
cosmological [era]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The argument is that the
thermodynamics of computation make the cost of a certain amount of
computation proportional to the temperature. Our astrophysical and
cosmological knowledge indicates that [the universe is cooling down with
cosmic time. Not only star formation within galaxies winds down and dies
out on timescales of 109 - 1010 yrs but even the cosmic background
radiation temperature is becoming exponentially colder. [As the universe
cools]{.mark}]{.underline} down, [[one]{.mark} [Joule]{.mark} of energy
[is worth proportionally more]{.mark}]{.underline}. This can be
**[[a]{.mark} [substantial (1030) gain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hence [a
civilization desiring to maximize]{.underline} the amount [of
computation will want to use its energy endowment as late as
possible:]{.underline} using it now means far less total computation can
be done. Hence [an early civilization, after expanding]{.underline} to
gain access to [enough raw materials]{.underline}, [will settle down and
wait]{.underline} until it becomes rational to use the resources. [[We
are not observing]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[aliens]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} the [initial
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} phase [[is brief]{.mark}]{.underline}
and intermittent [and]{.underline} the
[**[aestivating]{.mark}**]{.underline} civilization and its
infrastructure [**[is]{.mark}**]{.underline} also largely
[**[passive]{.mark} and compact**.]{.underline} The aestivation
hypothesis hinges on a number of assumptions that will be examined in
this paper. The main goal is to find what physical and motivational
constraints make it rational to aestivate and see if these can be met.
If they cannot, then the aestivation hypothesis is not a likely answer
for the Fermi question. This paper is very much based on the physical
eschatology research direction started by Freeman Dyson in \[2\]
combined with the SETI approach dubbed "Dysonian SETI" \[3\]. Physical
eschatology attempts to map the long-term future of the physical
universe given current knowledge of physics \[4, 5\]. This includes the
constraints for life and information processing as the universe ages.
Dysonian SETI takes the approach to widen the search to look for
detectable signatures of highly advanced civilizations, in particular
megascale engineering. Such signatures would not be deliberate messages,
could potentially outlast their creators, and are less dependent on
biological assumptions about the originating species (rather, they would
stand out because of unusual physics compared to normal phenomena). It
should be noted that in the physical eschatology context
aestivation/hibernation has been an important issue for other reasons:
[Dyson suggested it as a viable strategy [to stretch]{.mark} available
[energy]{.mark} and heat dissipation resources]{.underline} \[2\], and
Krauss and Starkman critiqued this approach \[6\]. 1"Hibernation" might
be a more familiar term but aestivation is the correct one for sleeping
through too warm summer months. 2 Aestivation The Old Ones were,

[space]{.mark}]{.underline}s [[we know]{.mark}, [but
between]{.mark}]{.underline} them. They walk [**[serene and
primal]{.mark}**, **[undimensioned and]{.mark} to us
[unseen]{.mark}**.]{.underline} H.P. Lovecraft, The Dunwich Horror and
Others [An explanation for]{.underline} the [Fermi]{.underline} question
[needs to account for]{.underline} a lack of observable aliens given
[the existence of human observers]{.underline} in the present ([not
taking humans into accoun]{.underline}t can [lead to anthropic
biases]{.underline}: we are not observing a randomly selected sample
from all possible universes but rather a sample from universes
compatible with our existence \[7\]). The [aestivation]{.underline}
hypothesis [makes the following assmptions]{.underline}: 1. [There are
civilizations that mature much earlier than humanity]{.underline}. 2.
[These]{.underline} civilizations [can expand]{.underline} over sizeable
volumes, gaining power over their contents. 3. These civilizations have
[solved]{.underline} their [coordination]{.underline}
[problems]{.underline}. 4. A civilization [can retain control over its
volume against other civilizations]{.underline}. 5. The fraction of
[mature civilizations that aestivate is non-zero]{.underline} 6.
[Aestivation is largely invisible]{.underline}. Assumption 1 is
plausible, given planetary formation estimates \[8\]. [Even a billion
years of lead time is plenty to dominate the local supercluster, let
alone the galaxy]{.underline}. If this assumption is not true (for
example due to global synchronization of the emergence of intelligence
\[9\]) **[we have [an alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}** answer
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[Fermi]{.underline}]{.mark}**
question. We will assume that the relevant civilizations are mature
enough to have mastered the basic laws of nature and their technological
implications to whatever limit this implies. [More than a million years
of technological development ought to be enough.]{.underline} Assumption
2 is supported by our paper \[1\]. In particular, i[f a civilization can
construct self-replicating]{.underline} technological
[systems]{.underline} [there is essentially no limit to the amount
of]{.underline} condensed [matter]{.underline} in solar systems that can
be [manipulated]{.underline}. These technological systems are still
potentially active in the current era. Nonexpanding aestivators are
entirely possible but would not provide an answer to the Fermi question.
If assumption 2 is wrong, then the Fermi question is answered by a low
technology ceiling and that intelligence tends to be isolated from each
other by distance. Assumption 3: This paper will largely treat [entire
civilizations]{.underline} as the actors rather than their constituent
members. In this regard [[they are "singletons]{.mark}" in the sense
of]{.underline} Nick [Bostrom]{.underline}: [having a highest level of
agency [that]{.mark} can solve internal coordination
problems]{.underline} \[10\]. Singletons may be plausible because [they
provide a solution to self-induced technological risks]{.underline} [in
young]{.underline} technological [civilizations]{.underline} (preventing
subgroups from accidentally or deliberately wiping out the
civilization). [Anecdotally]{.underline}, [humanity has shown an
increasing ability to coordinate]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [ever
larger scales]{.underline} thanks to technological improvements (pace
the imperfections of current coordination). In colonization scenarios
such as \[1\] coordinating decisions made before launch could stick
(especially if they have self-enforcing aspects) even when colonies are
no longer in contact with each other. However, [the paper does not
assume]{.underline} all advanced civilizations will have [perfect
coordination, merely very good]{.underline} [coordination]{.underline}.
Assumption 4 needs to handle both civilizations emerging inside the
larger civilization and encounters with other mature civilizations at
edges of colonization. For the first case the assumption to some degree
follows from assumption 2: [if desired the civilization could
prevent]{.underline} [misbehavior]{.underline} of interior primitive
civilizations (the most trivial way is to [prevent their
emergence]{.underline}, but this makes the hypothesis incompatible with
our existence \[11\]). Variants of the zoo hypothesis work but the
mature civilization must put some upper limit to technological
development or introduce the young civilizations into their system
eventually. The second case deals with civilizations on the same level
of high technological maturity: both can be assumed to have roughly
equal abilities and resources. If it can be shown that colonized volumes
cannot be reliably protected against invasion, then the hypothesis
falls. Conversely, if it could be proven that invasion over interstellar
distances is logistically unfeasible or unprofitable, this could be
regarded as a (weak) probabilistic support for our hypothesis.
Assumption 5 is a soft requirement. In principle [it]{.underline} might
be enough to argue [that aestivation is possible and that
we]{.underline} just [happen to be inside an aestivation
region]{.underline}. However, arguing that we are not in a typical
galaxy weakens the overall argument. More importantly, [the assumption
explains the absence of non-aestivating civilizations]{.underline}.
Below we will show that [there are strong reasons for civilizations to
aestivate: we are not arguing that all]{.underline} civilizations [must
do it but that it is a likely strategy]{.underline}. Below we will
discuss the issues of civilizational strategies and discounting that
strengthen this assumption. Assumption 6 is the key assumption for
making the hypothesis viable as a Fermi question answer:
[aestivation]{.underline} has to leave the universe largely unchanged in
order to be compatible with evidence. The assumption [does not imply
deliberate hiding]{.underline} (except, perhaps, of the core part of the
civilization) **[but rather that advanced
civ]{.underline}**ilization**[s [do not dissipate]{.mark} much
[energy]{.mark} in the present era, [making them]{.mark} effectively
[stealthy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The main empirical prediction of the
hypothesis is that we should observe a strong dampening of processes
that reduce the utility for far future computation. 3 Civilizational
goals While it may be futile to speculate on the values of advanced
civilizations, we would argue that [there likely exists convergent
instrumental goals]{.underline}. What has value? Value theories assign
value to either states of the world or actions. State value models
require resources to produce high-value states. If happiness is the
goal, using the resources to produce the maximum number of maximally
happy minds (with a tradeoff between number and state depending on how
utilities aggregate) would maximize value. If the goal is knowledge, the
resources would be spent on processing generating knowledge and storage,
and so on. For these cases [the total amount of produced value increases
monotonically with the amount of resources, possibly
superlinearly]{.underline}. Actions also require resources and for
actions with discernible effects the start and end states must be
distinguishable: there is an information change. Even if value resides
in the doing, it can be viewed as information processing. The assumption
used in this paper is that [nearly all goals benefit from more resources
and that information processing and storage are good metrics for
measuring the potential of value creation/storage]{.underline}. [They
are not necessarily final goals but instrumentally worth getting for
nearly all goals for nearly all rational agents]{.underline} \[12, 13\].
As we will see below, maintaining communication between different parts
of an intergalactic civilization becomes impossible over time. If
utility requires contact (e.g. true value is achieved by knowledge
shared across a civilization) then these limits will strongly reduce the
utility of expanding far outside a galactic supercluster. If utility
does not require contact (e.g. the happiness or beauty of local entities
is what is valuable in itself) then expanding further is still
desirable. There may also be normative uncertainty: even if a
civilization has a convincing reason to have certain ultimate values, it
might still regard this conclusion as probabilistic and seek to hedge
its bets. Especially if the overall plan for colonization needs to be
formulated at an early stage in its history and it cannot be
re-negotiated once underway it may be rational to ensure that
alternative value theories (especially if easily accommodated) can be
implemented. This may include encountered alien civilizations, that
might possibly have different but valid ultimate goals. 4 Discounting
[Another relevant property]{.underline} of a civilization [is the rate
of]{.underline} its [temporal discounting. How much is the far future
worth relative to]{.underline} the [present?]{.underline} There are
several reasons to suspect **[advanced civilizations have very long time
horizons.]{.underline}** [In a dangerous or uncertain environment it is
rational to rapidly discount the value of a future good since survival
to that point is not guaranteed]{.underline}. [However,
mature]{.underline} expanding [civilizations]{.underline} [have likely
reduced]{.underline} their [existential risks to a minimum]{.underline}
level and would have little reason to discount strongly (individual
members, if short-lived, may of course have high discount rates). More
generally, the uncertainty of the future will be lower and this also
implies lower discount rates. Specific policies that take a long time to
implement such as [megascale engineering or interstellar
travel]{.underline} also [favor low discount rates.]{.underline} There
could be a selection effect here: [high discount rates may prevent such
long-range projects and hence only low-discount rate civilizations will
be actors on the largest scales.]{.underline} It also appears likely
that [a sufficiently advanced civilization could regulate its "mental
speed", either by existing as software running on hardware with a
variable clock speed, or by simply hibernating in a stable state for a
period]{.underline}. If this is true, then [the value of something after
a period of pause/hibernation would be determined not by the
chronological external time but how much time the civilization would
subjectively experience in waiting for it]{.underline}. Changes in
mental speed can hence make temporally remote goods more valuable if the
observer can pause until they become available and there is no
alternative cost for other goods. This is linked to a reduction of
opportunity costs: **[[advanced civ]{.mark}ilization[s]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} mainly ["seen it all" in the present universe]{.mark} [and
do not gain]{.mark} much more]{.underline}** information utility
**[[from hanging around]{.mark} in the early era]{.underline}**2 There
are also arguments that future goods should not be discounted in cases
like this. What really counts is fundamental goods (such as well-being
or value) rather than commodities; while discounting prices of
commodities makes economic sense it may not make sense to discount value
itself \[14\]. This is why **[even a civilization with some temporal
discounting can find it rational to pause in order to gain a huge reward
in the far future]{.underline}**. [If the subjective experience is an
instant astronomical multiplication of goods]{.underline} (with little
risk) [it is rational to make the jump]{.underline}. However, it
requires a certain degree of internal coordination to overcome variation
in individual time preferences (hence assumption 3). 5 Thermodynamics of
extreme future computation Computation is a fundamentally physical
process, tied into thermodynamic considerations. Foremost for our
current purposes is Landauer's limit: at least E ≥ kT ln(2) J (1) need
to be dissipated for an irreversible change of one bit of information
\[15\]. Logically irreversible manipulation of information must be
accompanied by an entropy increase somewhere. It should be noted that
the thermodynamic cost can be paid by using other things than energy. An
ordered reservoir of spin \[16\] or indeed any other conserved quantity
\[17\] can function as payment. The cost is ln(2)/λ where λ is related
to the average value of the conserved quantity. However, making such a
2Some exploration, automated or crewed, might of course still occur
during the aestivation period, to be reported to the main part of the
civilization at its end. negentropy reservoir presumably requires
physical work unless it can be found naturally untapped. 5.1 Reversible
and quantum computation There exists an important workaround for the
Landauer limit: [logically reversible computations do not increase
entropy and can hence be done in principle without any need of energy
dissipation.]{.underline} It has been shown that any logically
irreversible computation can be expressed as a reversible computation by
storing all intermediate results, outputting the result, and then
retracing the steps leading up to the final state in reverse order,
leaving the computer in the original state. The only thermodynamic costs
would be setting the input registers and writing the output \[18\]. More
effective reversible implementation methods are also known, although the
number of elementary gates needed to implement a n-bit irreversible
function scales somewhere between n2 n/ log n and n2 n \[19\]. Quantum
computation is also logically reversible since quantum circuits are
based on unitary mappings. While the following analysis will be speaking
of bits, the actual computations might occur among qubits and the total
reversible computational power would be significantly higher. If
advanced civilizations do all their computations as reversible
computations, then it would seem unnecessary to gather energy resources
(material resources may still be needed to process and store the
information). However, irreversible operations must occur when new
memory is created and in order to do error correction. In order to
create N zeroed bits of memory at least kT ln(2)N J have to be expended,
beside the work embodied in making the bit itself. Error correction can
be done with arbitrary fidelity thanks to error correcting codes but the
actual correction is an irreversible operation. The cost can be deferred
by transferring the tainted bit to an ancilla bit but in order to re-use
ancillas they have to be reset. Error rates are suppressed by lower
temperature and larger/heavier storage. Errors in bit storage occur due
to classical thermal noise (with a probability proportional to e −Eb/kT
where Eb is the barrier height) and quantum tunneling (probability
approximately e −2r √ 2mEb/\~ where m is the mass of the movable entity
storing the bit and r is the size of the bit). The minimum potential
height compatible with any computation is E min b ≈ kT ln(2) +
\~(ln(2))2 /8mr2 (2) \[20\]. If a system of size R has mass M divided
into N bits, each bit will have size ≈ R/N1/3 . If a fraction of the
mass is used to build potential barriers, we can approximate the height
of the barrier Eb in each bit as the energy in all the covalent bonds in
the barrier. If we assume diamond as a building material, the total bond
energy is 1.9 kJ/mol = 1.6 · 105 J/kg. Using a supercluster r = 50 Mpc,
M = 1043 kg, it can be subdivided into 1061 bits without reaching the
limit given the current 3K background temperature. For the future TdS
temperature (see below) the limit is instead near 1075 bits (each up to
13 cm across); here the limiting factor is tunneling (the shift occurs
around T = 10−8 K). However, this would require bits far lighter than
individual atoms or even electrons3 . In practice, the ultimate limiting
capacity due to matter chunkiness would be on the order of 1069 bits.
However, these "heavy" bits would have 15 orders of magnitude of safety
margin relative to the potential height and hence have minuscule
tunneling probabilities. So [while error correction and repair will have
to be done (as noted by Dyson, over sufficiently long timescales (1065
years) matter is a liquid), the rate can be very low.]{.underline}
Quantum computing is also affected by environmental temperature and
quantum error correction can only partially compensate for this \[21\].
In theory there might exist topological quantum codes that are stable
against finite temperature disturbances \[22\] but again there might be
thermal or tunneling events undermining the computing system hardware
itself. Hence, [even civilizations at the boundary of physical
feasibility will have to perform some dissipative computational
operations. **They cannot wait indefinitely**]{.underline} (since slow
cosmological processes will erode their infrastructure and data) **[and
will hence eventually run out of energy.]{.underline}** 5.2 Cooling
While it is possible for a civilization to cool down parts of itself to
any low temperature, [the act of cooling is itself dissipative since it
requires doing work against a hot environment. The most efficient
cooling merely consists of linking the computation to the coldest
heat-bath naturally available. In the future this will be the
cosmological background radiation4]{.underline} , which is also
conveniently of maximal spatial extent. The mean temperature of the
background radiation is redshifted and declines as T (t) = T0/a(t) where
a(t) is the cosmological scale factor \[24\]. Using the long term de
Sitter behavior a(t) = e Ht produces T (t) = T0e −Ht. This means that
one unit of energy will be worth an exponentially growing amount of
computations if one waits long enough. However, the background radiation
is eventually redshifted below the constant de Sitter horizon radiation
temperature TdS = p Λ/12π 2 = H/2π ≈ 2.67 · 10−30 K \[24, 6\]. This
occurs at time t = H ln(T0/TdS), in about 1.4 · 1012 years. There will
be some other radiation fields (at this point there are still 3 In
theory [neutrinos or very light WIMPs such as axions could fulfill the
role]{.underline} but there is no known mechanism for confining them in
such a way that they could store information reliably. [4The alternative
might be supermassive black hole horizons]{.underline} at T = \~c
3/8πGMk, which in the present era can be far colder than the background
radiation \[23\]. Supermassive 109M⊙ black holes will become warmer than
the background radiation in 520 Gyr (assuming constant mass). 8 active
stars) but the main conclusion is that [there is a final temperature of
the universal heat bath]{.underline}. This also resolves a problem
pointed out in \[6\]: [in open universes the total number of photons
eventually received from the background radiation is finite and all
systems decouple thermally from it. In this case this never
happens.]{.underline} One consequence is that there will always be a
finite cost to irreversible computations: without infinite resources
only a finite number of such computations can be done in the future of
any civilization. [This factor also avoids the "paradox of the
indefinitely postponed splurge",]{.underline} where if it is always
beneficial to postpone exploitation. Hence, it is rational at some point
for aestivating civilizations to start consuming resources. The limiting
temperature of T = 10−8 K where error correction stops being
temperaturelimited and instead becomes quantization-limited might be
another point where it is rational to start exploitation (this will
occur in around 270 billion years). Had the temperature decline been
slower, the limit might have been set by galactic evaporation (1016
years) or proton decay (at least 1034 years). 5.3 Value of waiting [A
comparison of current computational resources to late era computational
resources hence suggest a potential multiplier of 1030!]{.underline}
Even if only the resources available in a galactic supercluster are
exploited, later-era exploitation produces a payoff far greater than any
attempt to colonize the rest of the accessible universe and use the
resources early. In fact, the massenergy of just the Earth itself (5.9 ·
1024 kg) would be more than enough to power more computations than could
currently be done by burning the present observable universe! (6 · 1052
kg)5 In practice the efficiency will be lower but the multiplier tends
to remain astronomical. A spherical blackbody civilization of radius r
using energy at a rate P surrounded by a TdS background will have an
equilibrium temperature (neglecting external and internal sources) T =
\[P/(4πσr2 ) + T 4 dS\] 1/4 . (3) For a r = 50 Mpc super-cluster sized
civilization this means that maintaining a total power of P = 1 W would
keep it near 2.8 · 10−11 K. At this temperature the civilization could
do 3.8 · 1033 irreversible computations per second. The number P/kT
ln(2) bit erasures per second increases as P 3/4 . At first this might
suggest that it is better to ignore heat and use all resources quickly.
However, a civilization with finite energy E will run out of it after
time E/P and the [5This might suggest that "[stay at home"
civ]{.mark}]{.underline}ilization[[s]{.mark} might hence
[abound]{.mark}, content to wait out the future in their local
environment since their bounded utility functions can be satisfied
eventually.]{.underline} Such civilizations might be common but they are
not a solid explanation for the Fermi question since their existence
does not preclude impatient (and hence detectable) civilizations.
However, see \[25\]. In addition, [this strategy is risky since
expansive civilizations may be around.]{.underline} total amount of
erasures will then be E/kT ln(2): this declines as P −1/4 . Slow energy
use produces a vastly larger computational output if one is patient. As
noted by Gershenfeld, optimal computation needs to make sure all
internal states are close to the most probable state of the system,
since otherwise there will be extra dissipation \[26\]. Hence there is a
good reason to perform operations slowly. Fortunately, [time is an
abundant resource in the far future]{.underline}. In addition, a
civilization whose subjective time is proportional to the computation
rate will not internally experience the slowdown. The Margolus-Levitin
limit shows that it takes at least time π\~/2E to move to a new
orthogonal state \[27\]. For E = kTdS this creates a natural "clock
speed" of 3.8 · 1011 years. However, some of the energy will be embodied
in computational hardware; even if the hardware is just single electrons
the clock speed would be 2.0 ·10−21 s: this particular limit is not a
major problem for this style of future computation. A stronger
constraint is the information transmission lags across the civilization.
For this example the time to send a message across the civilization is
326 million years. Whether this requires a very slow clock time or not
depends on the parallelizability of the computations done by the
civilization, which in turn depends on its values and internal
structure. Civilizations with more parallelizable goals such as local
hedonic generation would be able to have more clock cycles per external
second than more "serial" civilizations where a global state needs to be
fully updated before the next step can be taken. However, external time
is of little importance given the paucity of external events. Even if
proton decay in 1034 years puts a final deadline to the computation,
this would still correspond to 1025 clock cycles. Heat emission at very
low temperature is also a cause of slowdown. The time to radiate away
the entropy of a single bit erasure scales as trad = k ln(2)/4πσr2T 3 .
For a 50 Mpc radius system this is 5.6 · 10−66T −3 s: for 10−8 K the
time is on the order of 10−42 s but at 10−30 K it takes 1017 years. If
the civilization does have a time limit tmax, then it is rational to use
P = E/tmax and the total number of operations will be proportional to t
1/4 max. Time-limited civilizations do have a reason to burn the candle
at both ends. Time-limited civilizations still gain overall
computational success by waiting until the universe cools down enough so
their long-term working temperature T is efficient. At least for long
time limits like proton decay a trillion years is a short wait. The
reader might wonder whether starting these computations now is rational
since the universe is quickly cooling and will soon (compared to the
overall lifespan of the civilization) reach convenient temperatures. The
computational gain of doing computations at time t is ∝ exp(Ht): it
increases exponentially until the temperature is dominated by the
internal heating rather than the outside temperature. Since most of the
integrated value accrues within the last e-folding and the energy used
early was used exponentially inefficiently, it is not worth starting
early even if the wait is a minuscule fraction of the overall lifespan.
A civilization burning through the baryonic mass of a supercluster
before proton decay in 1033 years has a power of 5.7 · 1021 W (similar
to a dim red dwarf star) and a temperature of 7.6·10−6 K, achieving 1080
erasures. The most mass-limited version instead runs close to 10−30 K,
has a power of somewhere around 10−75 W and achievs 10115 erasures --
but each bit erasure, when it happens causes a 100 quadrillion year
hiatus. A more realistic system (given quantization constraints) runs at
10−8 K and would hence have power 1010 W (similar to a large present-day
power plant), running for 5.7 · 1044 years and achieving 1093 erasures.
6 Resources The amount of resources available to advanced civilizations
depends on what can ultimately be used. Conservatively, condensed
molecular matter such as planets and asteroids are known to be useful
for both energy, computation, and information storage. Stars represent
another form of high density matter that could plausibly be exploited,
both as energy sources and material. Degenerate stars (white and black
dwarfs, neutron stars) are also potential high density resources. Less,
conservatively, there are black holes, from which mass-energy can be
extracted \[28, 29\] (and, under some conditions, can act as heat sinks
as mentioned above). Beyond this, there is interstellar gas,
intergalactic gas, and dark matter halos. For the purposes of this paper
we will separate the resources into energy resources that can power
computations and matter resources that can be used to store information,
process it or (in a pinch) be converted into energy. Massenergy diffused
as starlight or neutrinos, and stars lost from galaxies are assumed to
have become too dilute to be useful. Dark energy appears to be unusable
in principle. Dark matter may be useful as an energy resource by
annihilation even if it cannot sustain information processing
structures. Not all resources in the universe can be reached and
exploited. The lightspeed limit forces civilizations to remain within a
light-cone and the accelerating expansion further limits how far probes
can be sent. Based on the assumptions in \[1\] the amount of resources
that can be reached within a 100 Mpc supercluster or by traveling at
50%, 80% or 99% c are listed in table 1. 6.1 Changes over time 6.1.1
Stellar fusion Stellar lifetime energy emissions are proportional to
mass (with high luminosity stars releasing more faster), Elife = LT =
L⊙(M/M⊙)3.16 · 1017 J, leading to a lifetime mass loss through energy
emission of Mloss = 1.35 · 1027(M/M⊙) kg = 6.79 · 10−4M⊙(M/M⊙). (4)
Lighter stars loose less mass but since the mean mass star is 0.7M⊙ this
is on the order of a typical value. Table 1: Resources available to
civilizations expanding at different speeds, or within a single
supercluster. Estimates based on \[30\] and \[31\]. Distances measured
in co-moving coordinates, mass in kilograms. Hence stellar fusion is not
a major energy waste if mass can be converted into energy. This is
important for the aestivation hypothesis: had stellar fusion been a
major source of mass loss it would had been rational to stop it during
the aestivation period, or at least to gather up the lost energy using
Dyson shells: both very visible activities that can be observationally
ruled out (at least as large-scale activities). Fusion processes also
produce nuclei that might be more useful for computation without any
need for intervention. Long term elemental mass fractions approach 20%
hydrogen, 60% helium and 20% other elements over 1012 year timescales
\[5\]. 6.1.2 Black hole formation Stellar black holes permanently
reduces the amount of baryonic matter available even if their
mass-energy is exploitable. At present a mass fraction ≈ 2.5% of the
star formation budget is lost this way \[31\]. To prevent this star
formation of masses above 25M⊙ needs to be blocked. This could occur by
interventions that cause extra fragmentation of clouds condensing into
heavy stars. Adding extra dust to the protostellar cloud could induce
rapid cooling and hence fragmentation. This would require dust densities
on the order of 10−5ρgas and for a stellar formation rate ≈ 1M⊙ per year
would require seeding galactic clouds with ≈ 10−5M⊙ per year. Average
nucleosynthetic yields are ≈ 0.0025, so there would be enough metals
produced per year to seed the clouds by about two orders of magnitude.
Other ways of inducing premature fragmentation might be to produce
radiation bursts (from antimatter charges or directed illumination from
Dyson-shell surrounded stars) or pressure waves, while magnetic fields
might slow core collapse. The energies involved would be of the order of
the cloud potential energy; for a Bok globule this might require
(3G/5)(50M2 ⊙/1 ly) = 4.2·1036 J, about 103 sun-years of luminosity.
Given that cloud collapse is a turbulent process it might be possible to
prevent massive star formation through relatively energy-efficient chaos
control. While these methods might be invisible over long distances
their effects ought to be noticeable due to a suppression of starbursts
and heavy blue-white stars. 6.1.3 Galactic winds While stars can lose
significant amount of mass by outflows, this gas is recycled through the
interstellar medium into new stars. However, some of this medium may be
lost due to galactic winds and may hence become long-term inaccessible.
Galactic winds are likely proportional to the stellar formation rate
(M′/SF R around 0.01-10) plus contributions from active galactic nuclei,
and may have significantly depleted early galaxies. Starbursts can lose
105 − 106M⊙ in dwarf galaxies and 108 − 1010 in ULIRGs, partially by
entraining neutral matter. \[32\] However, for large galaxies the actual
escape fractions may be low due to dark matter halos keeping the gas
bound and dampening the outflow through drag, keeping it below 4%
\[33\]. There can also be ongoing infall due to the halo that more than
compensates for the loss. Due to the uncertainty about the wind budget
it is not clear whether a civilization prioritizing baryonic matter
might want to prevent galactic winds. A few approaches may be possible.
One way, as described above, is to prevent too vigorous star formation.
Such a civilization would also be interested in keeping the galactic
nucleus quiescent, perhaps using the "stellar billiards" method
suggested in the next section to manipulate orbits near the central
black hole. These methods would likely be hard to detect, except for the
reduction in hot stars6 . 6.1.4 Galaxy collisions Galactic "splashes"
and mergers may lose significant amount of gas, stars and halos to
intergalactic space. Can collisions be prevented? Typical galactic
peculiar velocities are on the order of 200-300 km/s: in order to avoid
a collision the velocity of one or both galaxies need to be changed by
this amount by expelling some mass-energy. The rocket equation hence
implies a final mass m1 = m0e −∆v/ve . If ve ≈ 1000 km/s, such as in the
case of deliberate ejection of hypervelocity stars7 , the mass loss
6Another, somewhat extreme, approach would be to bag the galaxy: at a
surface density of 0.77 · 10−6 kg/m2 a graphene balloon encompassing a
Milky Way-sized galaxy (r = 20 kpc) would weigh 1.8 · 106M⊙. Given a
current carbon mass fraction of 0.0046 this would require mining 0.4 ·
109M⊙ stars or gas clouds, or fusing several million solar masses. Since
the saved gas mass would be just one order of magnitude larger than the
balloon weight, it is likely that this approach is not effective. 7This
can be achieved in a step-wise process. First, Shkladov thrusters \[34\]
are built around many stars. While these thrusters are unable to change
stellar velocities significantly over a Gyr, they are enough to engineer
close encounters with passing stars within a few million years. This
allows a bootstrap process where gravity assists can bring velocity
changes of stars up to the average stellar velocities of 100 km/s as
well as allow course corrections. Stars are then sent on slingshot
orbits past the central black hole, ejecting them and accelerating will
be 10%. For an optimal exhaust velocity of c (using some form of
massenergy conversion) the loss is around 3.5%. While this is a small
fraction of the entire galactic mass, most of it (\> 95%) is in the form
of a dark matter halo: if only baryonic matter can be used to power the
evasive maneuver practically all of it would be lost in the process.
Hence, if a civilization seeks to retain significant amounts of baryonic
matter it is not rational in general to prevent galactic collisions.
Civilizations that instead care about overall mass-energy may be more
motivated to prevent splashes of halo material by sacrificing some
mass-energy in a very visible maneuver. If the maneuver takes one Gyr
and uses mass-energy conversion, the average luminosity will be 3.5% ·
1012M⊙c 2/(109 yr) = 2 · 1041 W = 5 · 1014L⊙. Streams of 1010
hypervelocity stars would also likely be very noticeable. 6.1.5
Expansion Given the current ΛCDM model of the universe, the expansion
rate is increasing and approaching a de Sitter expansion. This leads to
the eventual separation of all gravitationally bound systems from each
other by insurmountable distances, leaving each an "island universe"
within their cosmological horizon. The local group of galaxies will
likely be separated from the Virgo supercluster and in 100 Gyr entirely
separate \[35\]. Busha et al. find a criterion for structures remaining
bound, Mobj/1012M⊙ \> 3h 2 70(r0/ 1Mpc)3 (5) where h70 = H0/70 km/s/Mpc.
The paper also gives an estimate of the isolation time, about 120 Gyr
for typical clusters \[36\]. This expansion dynamics is a key constraint
on the ambitions of far-future civilizations. Most matter within not
just the observable but the colonizable (at least given assumptions as
in \[1\]) universe will be lost. While no doubt advanced civilizations
might wish to affect the expansion rate it seems unlikely that such
universal parameters are changeable8 . Depending on the utility function
of the civilization, this either implies that there is little extra
utility after colonizing the largest achievable bound cluster (utilities
dependent on causal connectedness), or that future parts of the
civilization will be disconnected from each other (utilities not valuing
total connectedness). Civilizations desiring guaranteed separation --
for example, to prevent competitors from invading -- would also value
the exponentially growing moats. Is it possible to gather more mass into
gravitationally bound systems? In order to move mass, whether a rocket
or a galaxy, energy or reaction mass need to the galaxy. This scheme
mainly converts stellar kinetic and potential energy into thrust. 8A
civilization will by necessity be spatially local, so any change in Λ or
dark energy parameters would have to be local; beside the inherent
problem of how it could be affected, any change would also likely merely
propagate at light-speed and hence will not reach indefinitely far.
Worse, even a minor change or gradient in the 68.3% of the total
mass-energy represented by dark energy would correspond to massive
amounts of normal energy: the destructive effects may be as dramatic as
vacuum decay scenarios. be ejected at high velocity to induce motion9 .
This is governed by the relativistic rocket equation ∆v = c tanh((Isp/c)
ln(m0/m1)) (we ignore the need for slowing down at arrival). The best
possible specific impulse is Isp = c. The remaining mass arriving at the
destination will then be m1 = m0 exp(− tanh−1 (∆v/c)). In order to
overcome the Hubble flow ∆v \> H0r (we here ignore that the acceleration
of the expansion will require higher velocities). Putting it together,
we will get the bound m(r) \< 4πρr2 exp(− tanh−1 (H0r/c)) (6) for a
concentric shell of radius r. Setting k = H0/c, this can be integrated
from r0 (the border of the supercluster) to 1/k (the point where it is
just barely possible to send back matter at lightspeed): Mcollect =
(2πρ/3k 3 ) hp 1 − k 2x 2(2k 2x 2 − 3kx + 4) + 3 sin−1 (kx) i1/k r0 (7)
If we use r0 = 50 Mpc (typical supercluster size) we get Mcollect = 3.8
· 1078ρ kg, where ρ is the collectable mass density. For ρ = 2.3 · 10−27
kg/m3 this is 8.9 · 1051 kg. The ratio to mass inside the supercluster
(here densities are assumed to be 20 times larger inside) is
Mcollect/Mcluster = 12, 427. The collected mass is 35% of the entire
mass inside the reachable volume; the rest is used up. Another approach
would be to convert mass into radiant energy locally, beaming half of it
(due to momentum conservation) inwards to a receiver such as a black
hole from which it could be extracted later. The main losses would be
due to redshift during transmission. However, this ignores the problem
that in order to reach remote locations to send back matter home the
civilization needs to travel there. If colonization occurs at lightspeed
the colonies will have to deal with an expansion factor e H0r/c larger,
producing the far tighter bound m(r) \< 4πρr2 exp(− tanh−1 (H0e
H0r/cr/c)). (8) Integrating numerically from r0 to the outer limit
W(1)/k ≈ 2.52 Gpc (where W is Lambert's W function) produces a more
modest Mcollect = 8.32 ·1077ρ and Mcollect/Mcluster = 2, 705. Of the
total reachable mass, only 7.7% remains. This calculation assumes all
mass can be used; if diffuse gas and dark matter cannot be used to power
the move, not only does the total mass yield go down by two orders of
magnitude but there are going to be significant energy losses in
climbing out of cluster potential wells. Nevertheless, it still looks
possible to increase the long-term available mass of superclusters by a
few orders of magnitude. 9 In principle gravitational wave propulsion or
spacetime swimming \[37\] are possible alternatives but appear unlikely
to be useful in this case. If it is being done it would be very visible,
since at least the acceleration phases would convert a fraction of
entire galaxies mass-energy into radiation. A radial process would also
send this radiation in all outward directions, and backscatter would
likely be very noticeable even from the interior. 6.1.6 Galactic
evaporation Over long periods stars in galaxies scatter from each other
when they have encounters, causing a large fraction to be ejected and
the rest are swallowed by the central supermassive black hole. This
occurs on a timescale of 10 19 years \[5\]. However, due to the
thermodynamic considerations above, it becomes rational to exploit the
universe long before galactic evaporation becomes a problem. The same
applies to the other forms of long-term deterioration of the universe,
such as proton decay, black hole decay, quantum liquefaction of matter
etc. \[5\] 7 Interactions with other civilizations [The aestivation

defectors]{.underline} elsewhere). If such civilizations are very large
(as suggested by our intergalactic colonization argument \[1\]) this
would look to us like [global [convergence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[aestivation]{.underline} hypothesis [strengthens [this]{.mark} argument
by [imply]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [a need for [protecting
resources]{.mark} during the aestivation period]{.underline}. [[If a
civ]{.mark}ilization [merely aestivates it may find]{.mark} its grip on
[its domain supplanted by latecomers]{.mark}. Leaving autonomous systems
[to monitor the domain]{.mark}]{.underline} and preventing activities
that decrease its value [[would be]{.mark} the [rational]{.mark}
choice.]{.underline} [They would ensure]{.underline} that parts of the
originating civilization do not start early but also [that **[invaders
or young civilizations are stopped]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
value-decreasing activities. One plausible example would be banning the
launch of self-replicating probes to do large-scale colonization. In
this scenario cultural convergence is enforced along some dimensions. It
might be objected that devices left behind cannot survive the eons
required for restarting the main civilization. While the depths of space
are a stable environment that might be benign for devices constructed to
be functional there, there are always some micrometeors, cosmic rays or
other mishaps. However, having redundant copies greatly reduce the
chance of all being destroyed simultaneously. It is possible to show
that [by slowly adding backup capacity (at a logarithmic rate) a system
can ensure a finite probability of enduring for infinite
time]{.underline}10 \[38\]. The [infrastructure]{.underline} left behind
[could]{.underline} hence [be]{.underline} both [extremely long-lasting
and require a minuscule footprint]{.underline}, even if it is imperfect.
One can make the argument that defenders are likely to win since the
amount of materiel they have at home can easily dwarf the amount of
materiel that can be moved into place, since long-range transport is
expensive. However, an interior point in an aestivator domain can be
targeted with resources rising quadratically with time as the message
goes out. Which effects wins out depends on the relative scaling of the
costs and resources11 . One interesting observation is that [if we are
inside an aestivating civilization]{.underline}, then [other aestivators
are also likely]{.underline}: [the probability of intelligence arising
per spacetime hypervolume is high enough that [the large
civ]{.mark}ilization [will]{.mark} likely encounter external mature
civilizations]{.underline} and [hence needs to [have a strat]{.mark}egy
against them.]{.underline} Two mature large-scale civilizations
encountering each other will be essentially spherical, expanding at the
same rate (set by convergence towards the limits set by physics). At the
point of contact the amount of resources available will be the
intersection of an expanding communications sphere and the overall
colonization sphere: for large civilizations this means that they will
have nearly identical resources. Given the maturity assumption they
would hence be evenly matched12. They have several choices: battle each
other for resources, maintain a tangential hyperboloid boundary, or, if
their utilities are compatible, join. Given the intention of using
resources later, expending them in the present is only rational if it
prevents larger losses in the long run. If both civilizations are only
interested in resources per se, it may be possible to make any invasion
irrational by scorched earth tactics: the enemy will not gain anything
from invading and merely expend its resources. This is no guarantee that
all 10In practice physics places a number of limitations on the
durability such as proton decay or quantum tunneling but these
limitations are largely outside of the timescales considered in this
paper. 11For example, [[using]{.mark} the Lanchester square law model of
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} \[39\] [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} a
spherical defender domain (of value ∝ r 3 ) and quadratically arriving
attackers it will resist for time t ∝ α 1/2r 2/3η−1/2 , where α is the
defender firepower and η is the resource efficiency of transporting
attack materiel. The cost [to]{.underline} the attacker will scale as t
3 ∝ α 3/2 r 2η −3/2 . For sufficiently large α or low η it may hence be
rational to overlook [small [emergent
civ]{.mark}]{.underline}ilization[[s]{.mark} -- **or ensure that they do
not appear in the first**]{.underline} place. 12The smaller civilization
would have a slight disadvantage due to the greater curvature of its
surface but if interaction is settled early this might not come into
play. possible civilizations will be peaceful vis-´a-vis each other,
since [there might be other value considerations (e.g. a negative
utilitarian civilization encountering one planning to maintain a large
amount of suffering: the first civilization would have a positive
utility in reducing the resources of the second as much as possible,
even at the expense of future computation]{.underline}). However, given
the accelerating expansion maintaining borders could in principle be
left to physics. 8 Discussion This paper has shown that [very big
civilizations can have small footprint by relocating most of their
activity to the future.]{.underline} Of the 6 assumptions of the
aestivation hypothesis, 1 (early civilizations) and 2 (broad expansion)
are already likely (and if not true, provide alternative answers to the
Fermi question). The fifth assumption, that many civilizations wish to
aestivate, is supported by the vast increases in computational ability.
The third assumption, that coordination problems can be resolved,
remains hard to judge. It should be noted that planning for
[aestivation]{.underline} [is]{.underline} something that is [only
rational]{.underline} for a civilization [once]{.underline} it has
solved urgent survival issues. **[A species that has not
reduced]{.underline}** its self-generated **[existential
risk]{.underline}** enough has good reason to discount the far future
[due to]{.underline} uncertainty. Conversely, the [enormous]{.underline}
potential value of a post-aestivation future makes the astronomical
waste argument \[40\] stronger: [given]{.underline} the higher stakes,
the importance of early [risk mitigation]{.underline} -- and hence
coordination -- increases. The fourth assumption is at present also hard
to judge. [It seems likely]{.underline} that the technology allowing
long-range expansion (automation, interplanetary manufacturing,
self-replication and long-lived autonomous devices) would enable
maintaining **[arbitrarily large local stockpiles of equipment to fend
off incursions]{.underline}**. Assumption six, [the invisibility of
aestivation may at first appear hard to test -- nearly any number of
advanced civ]{.underline}ilization[s with nearly no energy usage could
easily hide somewhere in the galactic halo]{.underline} \[13\]. However,
in order for it to make sense to aestivate the amount of resources lost
during the wait must be small enough that they are dwarfed by the
resource costs of efforts to prevent them. Are there reasons to perform
visible megascale engineering to preserve resources? This depends
primarily on whether baryonic matter "construction material" or
mass-energy is regarded as the limiting factor for future computation.
If baryonic matter is the key factor considerations of stellar activity,
galactic wind or galactic collision mass loss do not seem to imply much
utility in megascale engineering to preserve matter. However, if dark
matter halos represent significant value (the mass-energy case)
reduction of collision loss would be rational, likely doable and very
visible. The lack of such galactic engineering hence puts a limit on the
existence of such energy-concerned aestivating civilizations [[in the
surveyed universe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Engineering large-scale galactic
movement to prevent separation of super clusters would also be highly
visible and the lack of such activity implies that there are no
civilizations seeking to optimize long-term causally connected
massenergy concentrations. Together, these considerations suggest that
[[if there are aestivating civ]{.underline}]{.mark}ilization[[s]{.mark}
[in our vicinity]{.mark}]{.underline} they are either local (no interest
outside their own galaxies or supercluster, utility functions that place
no or little value extra matter or energy) or they have utility
functions that may drive universal expansion but hold little interest in
causal connectedness. From a Dysonian SETI perspective, [the aestivation
hypothesis makes a very clear prediction:]{.underline} look for
inhibition of processes that permanently lose matter to inter-cluster or
inter-galactic space or look for the gravitationally bound structures
more massive than what the standard ΛCDM cosmology predicts for a given
lengthscale. 8.1 Cosmology/physics assumptions What if we are wrong
about the model of the universe used in this paper? A few "nearby"
models have clear implications. In Big Rip scenarios where the scale
factor becomes infinite at some point due to phantom energy it is
rational to use up available energy before this point. For plausible
values of w this is likely far in the future and hence aestivation still
makes sense. If there is no horizon radiation, then it is rational to
delay until proton or black hole decay, or when the heating due to the
civilization becomes on par with the universe. Again aestivation makes
sense. More fundamentally there is the uncertainty inherent in analysing
extreme future scenarios or future technology: even when we base the
arguments on well-understood and well-tested physics, there might exist
unexpected ways of circumventing this. Unfortunately there is little
that can be done about this. The aestivation hypothesis assumes that the
main driver of advanced civilizations is computations whose cost are
temperature dependent. More philosophically, what if there are other
forms of value that can be generated? Turning energy straight into value
without computation would break the temperature dependency, and hence
the scenario. This suggests an interesting line of investigation: what
is the physics of value? Until recently the idea that information was
physical (or indeed, a measurable thing) was exotic but currently we are
seeing a renaissance of investigations into the connections between
computation and physics. The idea that there are bounds set by physics
on how much information can be stored and processed by one kilogram of
matter is no longer strange. Could there exist similar bounds on how
much value one kilogram of matter could embody? 8.2 Anthropics
[Does]{.underline} [the aestivation hypothesis have any anthropic
implications]{.underline}? The main consequence of the physical
eschatology considerations in this paper is that future computation
could vastly outweigh current computation and we should hence expect
most observers to exist in the far future rather than the early
stelliferous era. The [Self-Indication Assumption (SIA) states that we
should reason as if we were randomly selected from the set of all
possible observers]{.underline} \[7\]. This is normally assumed to
support that we are in a world with many observers. [We should expect
aliens should exist]{.underline} (since a universe with humans and
aliens have more observers, especially if the aliens become a very large
post-aestivation civilization). The aestivation hypothesis suggests that
[initially sparse worlds may have far more observers than worlds that
have much activity going on early (and then run out of resources), so
the SIA suggests we should believe in the hypothesis.]{.underline} The
competing Self-Sampling Assumption states that we should reason as if we
were randomly selected from the actually existent observers (past,
present, future). [This gives a more pessimistic outcome, where the
doomsday argument suggests that **[we may not]{.mark}** be going to
**[survive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, both the SIA and SSA may
support the view that we are more likely to be a history simulation
\[41\] running in the post-aestivation era (if that era is possible)
than the sole early ancestor population. 8.3 Final words The
[aestivation]{.underline} hypothesis came about as a result of physical
eschatology considerations of what the best possible outcome for a
civilization would be, not directly an urge to solve the Fermi question.
However, it does seem to [provide]{.underline} [one new]{.underline}
possible [answer]{.underline} [to the question: **[That is not dead
which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons even death may
die]{.mark}.**]{.underline} H.P.

The writing of history has long been a privileged calling undertaken
within the church, royal court, landed estate, affluent town house,
government agency, university and corporate funded foundation. Michael
Parenti (2003, p. 13) [History is alive. It is neither static nor fixed.
History is the subjective construction of what and how, people and
groups remember. It is the totality of lived experience. While often
perceived as an immovable sort of record, history is better understood
as a site of struggle. There is strategic importance in the who, why,
where and how of knowledge production. The struggle is that of a
prolonged interrogation of competing versions of events, as well as the
power relations implicit in those versions.]{.underline} This paper is
an attempt to begin[, inspire and facilitate an interrogation of
dominant history. Included below is, first, a theoretical framework for
anti-colonial historiography.]{.underline} Second, an analytical case
study of the history textbooks used in Ontario, Canada, from 1866 to
2006. And third, a case specific example of curricular synthesis,
demonstrating one way in which dominant education can be subverted. Upon
beginning this piece, I unconsciously presumed I had license to write
about whatever I pleased. Sadly, this ignorance is the inbred sense of
entitlement of the White (usual male) scholar. As I worked through the
project, I came to better understand [the responsibility of all writers
and researchers to never presume inclusion or entitlement when
approaching a topic or community]{.underline}. I am a White teacher in
Ontario. I have been asked as well as required, to teach a colonizer's
history. I was educated in Ontario -- inundated with the tautology of
Canada's multiculturalism while taught the glories of only certain
peoples' ideas, struggles, epistemologies and ontological perspectives.
Further, my child, as I write this, sits in an Ontario classroom with
(in the Toronto District Schools Board's tribute to empire) a picture of
England's queen, always in view. My people and my society have cultured
within me a racism and a comfort with White supremacy. The racism is a
quiet one, understood best not through my words or actions -- for I have
long spoken anti-racism -- but through the instincts and reactions that
I have come to interrogate and have attempted to change in the last half
of my life. It is understood through my ignorance -- meaning I rarely
know the little pieces are there, until they are gone. One result is

my contextual underpinnings, with a critical eye. This process does not
end with the completion of one paper, book or coversation. It is
something with and through which I must work for as long as inequity is
configured in its current state. To contest dominant
history]{.underline} is for me a professional, personal, academic and
family undertaking. It affects and has meaning in all parts of my life
-- be it playing "castle" with my daughter, or designing courses that
subvert the dominant curricula for my classes. This for me is not a
solitary pursuit[. History is]{.underline} not mine to find or document:
it is a [conversation in which I may, at times,
participate.]{.underline} One of my responsibilities as a White person
within a White supremacist society is to recognize and respect the
places and pursuits best left alone by the dominant. This is not to say
that Whites have no role in the anti-colonial struggle, but rather that
those roles are often best assigned and designed by the oppressed. It is
relevant here to make a distinction between being White (as a subject
location and site of difference) and Whiteness (as a system of
privilege) (see Ruttenberg, 1993). Such distinctions must not obfuscate
the role all White people play in White supremacy -- be it often or
rare, intentional or unintentional. With this said, White people have a
crucial role to play in contesting White privilege. Production and
reproduction of knowledge are ideally, collective pursuits, which
recognize and work to dissolve power inequities -- pedagogically and
epistemologically. This work is thus not prescriptive, but
interrogative. It aims to support an anti-colonial project,
theoretically and practically, by providing both a framework and
examples for and of, anti-colonial historiography. [The anti-colonial
framework casts a critical gaze wherever imposition occurs. It rejects
the etymological implication of the "post" in post-colonialism and
asserts that the colonial encounter is trans-historical rather than
historical -- it persists in colonized and colonizing
nations.]{.underline} As far as education, [we may look to the myriad
ways that difference is ignored, suppressed or taken up in classrooms
and curricula.]{.underline} It is not only under the tutelage of
invading colonizing regimes that people find themselves excluded from
the format and content of their education. The anti-colonial stance
posits that not only are indigenous people made foreigners in their own
lands by way of the colonial encounter, but also that immigrants and
racialized minorities are similarly excluded from/by dominant
pedagogical practices. The international socio-political processes of
displacement, impoverishment and migration (forced and voluntary) are
thus relevant here. So when analyzing colonialism in the contemporary
context, we must relate the legacy of Spanish colonialism in Mexico, to
the lives of Mexicans fighting for health care in California and Texas.
[When looking at the legacy of French imperialism in Africa, we must
look at the struggle for representation by North Africans in Southern
France. How do the educational practices in these regions (the US and
France, as well as Mexico and Northern Africa) reflect power and
competing histories in these multifaceted colonial
encounters?]{.underline} These are but two examples, not of a new
colonialism, but of [the internationalization and extension of
colonialism.]{.underline} This can be understood as one very important
aspect of globalization/imperialism. In the Canadian context, imposition
is thus understood not simply as it affects the indigenous people who
continue to fight for autonomy under the yolk of Canadian colonialism,
but as it affects all those marginalized by the content and contexts of
schooling[. Anti-colonial education interrogates the
Euro-American/Canadian lens and philosophy through which such practices
are developed and invoked. Those who teach history do not simply convey
knowledge, but go much further and construct it through conscious and
unconscious inclusion and exclusion of historical perspectives,
contributions and even]{.underline}ts. To teach history well is to
question and teach questioning, at every turn. A critical approach to
teaching and learning cannot be taken up merely for the sake of being
critical. Our questioning should be both strategic and compassionate.
[The history instructor should not only address historical events, but
also the history of how events in question have been taught hitherto.
Historical events exist in transhistorical contexts and can have
transhistorical relevance. An awareness of these contexts is crucial to
understanding (a) regional power discrepancies, as Said (1993) argues,
and (b) local power inequities and inequalities current and historical.
History is a responsibility; an imperfect pursuit with specific
interests and intentions in play at every turn.]{.underline} Zinn
writes: My argument cannot be against selection, simplification,
emphasis, which are inevitable for both cartographers and historians. .
. . \[T\]he mapmaker's distortion is a technical necessity for a common
purpose shared by all people who need maps. [The historian's distortion
is more than technical, it is ideological; it is released into a world
of contending interests, where any chosen emphasis supports (whether the
historian means to or not) some kind of interest, whether economic or
political or racial or national or sexual. (1]{.underline}999, p. 8)
[The error we must avoid in the telling and teaching of history is thus
not subjectivity, but the denial thereof. To claim that any perspective
is complete and/or neutral, is erroneous. To claim that history is told
or taught without specific objectives (conscious or unconscious) is
inaccurate. We must then acknowledge the purpose and perspective of our
teaching and telling of history -- we must identify the subjectivities
at play in the narratives we convey, lest we fall prey to the
Eurocentric claim of objectivity and its corresponding mask of
universality.]{.underline} Formal curricula, at all levels of study
(elementary, high school and college/university) serve to construct
meaning for students as far as self-identification, cultural belonging
and school engagement. History, with its philological, cultural,
economic, geographic, political and social strands is perhaps unique
among so-called "disciplines" in that the implications for the learner
are so broad. In the case of popular representations of Aboriginal
Peoples and perspectives in dominant Canadian history, not only are the
people and perspectives largely absent, but so too is the story of the
attempted genocide of the People of Turtle Island and their history. A
reconsideration of such history is thus not only a strategic
examination, but also one that quite simply, seeks greater accuracy and
thoroughness in order to combat the removal of so much from the history
of Turtle Island.1 [Historical analyses and the creation of the "other",
either as backward or as outside of history, are present throughout
colonized and colonizing societies currently and
historically.]{.underline} The dominant has for centuries, written the
dominated out 131 KEMPF of the historical material process. The works of
leading European thinkers (like Bacon, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, Kant,
Smith, Ricardo and others) from a variety of fields (such as politics,
mathematics, science, philosophy, economics and others) serve as a
modern foundation and prescription for othering non-dominant knowledges
and peoples (see Shiva, 1997; Wolff, 2000; Bishop, 1990; Joseph, 1987;
and others). The effects of such thinkers are present in educational
practises in almost all colonial contexts. [Educational imperialism is a
crucial element of colonialism, with profound effects on the colonized
and colonizer.]{.underline} Fanon writes: . . . \[C\]olonialism is not
content to impose its rule upon the present and the future of a
dominated country[. Colonialism is not satisfied with holding a people
in its grip and emptying the native's brain of all form and content. By
a kind of perverted logic, it turns to the past of the oppressed people,
and distorts, disfigures and destroys it. This work of devaluing
colonial history takes on a dialectical significance today.]{.underline}
(1963, p. 210). Fanon's work speaks to the mental effects of colonialism
and colonial education. The uni-focal history of dominant/colonial
education serves to amputate marginalized people from their past and
consequently from their present. In Canada today, the histories of
Aboriginal people are excluded from dominant education. Spivak's (1996)
work with community groups and scholars on the historiography of the
Subaltern in India, is a relevant example not only of historical
interrogation, but of the creation of a revised popular history. The
subaltern can be loosely understood in the Gramscian sense as comprised
by "non-elite or subordinated social groups" (Landry and MacLean, 1996,
p. 203). The knowledge and practices of these groups are understood for
the purposes of an anti-colonial historiography, as relevant in and of
themselves, as well as informative for positive (action-oriented) social
change. The anti-colonial critique must be pointed at all thinkers and
philosophies, on the left and the right. Two hundred years ago, even
revolutionary European thinkers partook of the oppressive practice of
"othering". In the Introduction to A Critique of Political Economy, Marx
writes: "Tribes living exclusively on hunting or fishing are beyond the
boundary line from which real \[historical\] development begins" (from
Eze, 2000, p. 234). The telling, or omission, of the history of the
colonized by the colonizer, is part of the reproduction and preservation
of what Eze calls the "neocolonial setup" (2000, p. 242). He writes:
They speak of the colonized or of the subjects of neocolonial
exploitation in biological terms and declare them to be the antagonists
of history. The native, or the neocolonial peasantry is said to be
inferior and have no appreciation of values . . . Thus the settler, or
neocolonial elite, has no regrets or qualms of conscience for he does
violence not to humans but to strange entities located between humanity
and undifferentiated history. (2000, p. 242) [When students see neither
themselves nor their histories reflected in their education,
disengagement understandably follow]{.underline}s. In Decolonizing
Methodologies, Smith writes: "[Schooling is directly implicated in this
process. Through the curriculum and its underlying theories of
knowledge, early schools redefined the world and where indigenous people
were positioned within the world"]{.underline} (1991, p. 33). In many
cases, Aboriginal people have been located outside of the world: the
world of progress, the world of goodness, the world of history. In the
capitalist epoch, history decidedly begins and ends with capitalism. For
orthodox Marxists, history begins and ends with class struggle. Cabral
says in a 1966 speech: \[T\]his leads us to pose the following question:
does history begin only with the development of the phenomenon of
'class', and consequently of class struggle? To answer in the
affirmative would be to place outside history the whole period of life
of human groups from the discovery of hunting, and later of nomadic and
sedentary agriculture, to the organization of herds and the private
appropriation of land. It would also be to consider . . . that various
human groups in Africa, Asia and Latin America were living outside of
history. (1969, p. 77) Although Cabral is speaking in the African
context almost forty years ago, his words are true today in many
colonial settings and speak to the global nature of the oppression
implicit in so much colonial pedagogy -- currently and historically. The
education system in Ontario, Canada for example, ignores the content and
practice of Aboriginal history and epistemology. It instead provides
compulsory Canadian settler history that preserves the salience of
settler domination. Inaccurate and oppressive histories are thus thrust
upon Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Peoples alike. Edward Said (1997)
argues that although Marx was sympathetic to non-EuroAmerican peoples
suffering under the yolk of European imperialism, he saw the suffering
as the beginning of the reorientation of a backward society, toward the
possibility of a better future. Marx was concerned with oppressed people
but was guilty of the paternalistic western discursive position that
"they" need civilising, if only on an economic level, by "us". Marx was
content to form his understanding of the non-European Subaltern from
problematic symbols of Orientalism, created and maintained by the
dominant political project; a project which Marx himself purported to
reject (Said, 1997). Said quotes Marx and his racist conclusion about
Asian Peoples, "they cannot represent themselves; they must be
represented" (1997, p. 93). Marx falls into the trap of essentializing
the non-dominant world by assigning a false homogeneity to all of its
peoples. Aboriginal Peoples struggle against not only a western view of
history, but also against a western presentation of history, which
ignores among other things, oral histories and the value of story
telling (Smith, 1991). A failure to contest this approach allows for the
continued amputation of people from their cultures and histories. Fanon
writes: Every people in whose soul an inferiority complex has been
created by the death and burial of its cultural originality -- finds
itself face to face . . . with the culture of the \[dominant\] mother
country. The colonized is elevated above his jungle status in proportion
to his adoption of the mother country's cultural standards. (1967, p.
18) Fanon's analyses are as relevant today in colonial educational
settings globally, as they were to the Caribbean and Africa (about which
he was writing) in 1967. As many authors have argued, [a multicentric
approach to knowledge and learning is]{.underline} possible and I would
add [necessary, in a number of different contexts]{.underline} (see
Agrawal, 1995; Yakubu, 1994; Dei, 2000; Hodson, 1998). Similarly, a
number of applications of this knowledge are possible. It is necessary
then, that teachers operate pedagogically only on a multicentric
understanding and articulation of principles, strategies and goals. This
[multi-focal approach can contribute to]{.underline} what Dei has called
[a "complete history of ideas]{.underline} which have shaped and
continue to shape human growth and development" (2000, p. 17). Raising
these issues in the Canadian context [sheds light on broader questions
of knowledge production, the validation and dissemination of
information, and roles of power and representation in
education]{.underline}. Canada's [failure to teach and value accurate
and inclusive history must not be understood as benign omission, but
rather as part of its ongoing colonial project in which the power of
representation is paramount. Anticolonial historiography differs from
typical historical re-telling in that it takes an overtly strategic
approach to the telling of things past. Its]{.underline} focus is two
pronged, [working to interrogate and rupture dominant history on one
hand, while focusing on the achievements, practices and resistance of
oppressed peoples to colonial imposition on the other.]{.underline} It
is not the existence of a political project within anticolonial
historiography that distinguishes it from mainstream history, but rather
its [unabashed articulation of its political aims from the
start]{.underline}. This does not mean that we should dispense with
accuracy as a goal or direction for study. It means that [we must
contextualize the telling of history as well as history itself so the
why, who, where and how of knowledge production are brought into focus.
Objectivity is better sought through an interrogation of subjectivities
than through a denial that such competing perspectives
exist.]{.underline} In Discourse on Colonialism, Césairé (1972)
problematizes the subversive notion of history as a monologue. I argue
here that [history must be a dialogue -- a continually evolving
contestation of perspectives, versions and memories. History must move
beyond the notion of fractious divisions of time into past, present and
future]{.underline}. In place of such a partition, [a continuum of
knowledge must be fostered wherein knowing itself is understood as
embodied as well as temporal, and both as an individual and communal
path and practice, which identifies and values the subjectivities of
learners.]{.underline} The aim here is not a post-structuralist one,
wherein all perspectives are valued equally, but one in which light can
be shed on all experiences to reveal the bad and celebrate the good; one
in which invalid histories are exposed as such. On an individual level
this can assist in the development of what Freire has called "complete
humanism" (1997, p. 25). [On a community level, it can help to
facilitate the empowerment of marginalized groups.]{.underline}

imperialism. It should not be surprising, then, that the [[great
transformations on]{.mark} the [**world scale** originated
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[revolt of peoples in the
**peripheries**]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the Russian Revolution (the
weak link of that time) to the Chinese Revolution and [the [Non-Aligned
Movement]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Bandung]{.underline}) that, for a time,
forced imperialism to "adjust" to demands that conflicted with the logic
of its expansion. The page of the [[Bandung Conference]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the [[Tricontinental]{.underline}]{.mark} (1955--1980),
of a globalization that was multipolar, has turned.

The conditions of existing globalization prohibit a remake of the
Bandung Conference. The current ruling classes in the countries of the
South are attempting to be part of this globalization, which they
sometimes hope to bend in their favor, but which they do not fight.
These can be divided into two groups: those who have a "national"
project, the nature of which --- mainly capitalist, but nuanced by
concessions (or not) to the working classes, yet in open or muted
conflict with imperialism --- should be discussed on a case-by-case
basis, such as China or the emergent countries of Asia and Latin
America; and those who do not have such a project and accept having to
adjust unilaterally to imperialist requirements (these, then, are
comprador ruling classes).

Various kinds of alliances are emerging between states (governments),
some of which can be seen within the WTO. We should not spurn the
possibilities that such alliances might open for movements of the
working classes (without, of course, having any illusions).

Is a front of the peoples of the South possible, one that goes beyond
the rapprochements between the ruling classes? The construction of such
a front is difficult since it is set back by the "culturalist"
deviations mentioned above, and results in confrontations between
peoples of the South (on pseudo-religious or pseudo-ethnic bases). It
will be less problematic if and insofar as the [[states]{.mark} that
have a project could]{.underline} --- [under pressure from their
peoples]{.underline} --- [[move in a]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[**resolutely anti-imperialist** direction]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
that implies that their [projects [set aside]{.mark} any
[illusions]{.mark}]{.underline} that "[[national
capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[governments]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} resolutely and [[exclusively able to modify
**imperialist globalization**]{.underline}]{.mark} in their favor [[and
become **active agents**]{.underline}]{.mark} in that globalization,
participating in forming the world system (and not unilaterally
adjusting to it). These [[illusions]{.mark} are **still
[widespread]{.mark}** [and reinforced]{.mark}]{.underline} by the
rhetoric that flatters the "emergent countries," on the way to "catching
up," developed by institutions in the service of imperialism.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} insofar as [[facts]{.underline}]{.mark} come
to [**[contradict]{.mark}** these illusions]{.underline},
[[national]{.mark} popular and **[anti-imperialist
blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline} might once again [[pave the way
to]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[internationalism of
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can only hope that [[**progressive
forces** in the North]{.mark} will [**understand** and **support**
this]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **The alternative is collective action.**

[[Collective action]{.underline}]{.mark} had brought about a [**profound
[restructur]{.mark}ing** in **[global]{.mark} health
[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[allowing]{.underline}]{.mark}
significantly [[less powerful actors to be]{.underline}]{.mark}
relatively [[successful]{.mark} against more powerful ones]{.underline}.
**[[Discourse]{.mark}-making]{.underline}**, moreover, [was
**[vital]{.mark}**]{.underline} to their accomplishments. The [strategic
[displacement]{.mark}]{.underline} of "virus sharing" to "benefits
sharing" [[destabilized]{.underline}]{.mark} the entire discursive
[scaffolding of]{.underline} "[[global]{.underline}]{.mark} health
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}." [Benefits]{.underline} sharing
[reversed]{.underline} the construction of [vulnerability]{.underline}:
if the existing [view]{.underline} was a Eurocentric one premised on the
notion that the [Global North needed to be protected from
the]{.underline} diseases of the **[Global South]{.underline}**, the
[[new paradigm highlight]{.mark}ed]{.underline} that [it was [the Global
South]{.mark}]{.underline} that was [made vulnerable through the North's
**biocolonial extraction**]{.underline} of disease data and samples.

This was a hard-won paradigm shift, as illustrated by the U.S. pushback
in the struggle to obtain MTAs for originating countries. The United
States had a strong stake in a system that gave global powers prime
access to the data and samples furnished to the WHO. Accordingly, the
United States rejected the Global South's attempt to redistribute power
through the MTA regime. At the World Health Assembly meeting in May
2007, the United States presented its draft resolution, which argued
that adding MTAs would hinder the unfettered, immediate transfer of
materials, and thus negatively impact vaccine production (Franklin 2009;
Khor 2007; WHO 2008). In essence, the United States stuck to the notion
that vaccine production was the sole goal, ignoring the crucial step
that followed --- how those vaccines would be distributed.

The paradigm shift to benefits sharing also challenged another
fundamental premise of global health security --- that international
authorities should supersede national ones. Benefits sharing
repositioned national sovereignty over biological resources as the key
mechanism for giving impacted nations control over their health
outcomes. The focus on national sovereignty was, in the terms of
sociocultural anthropologist Aihwa Ong (2008), a strategic insertion of
"the nation as a scale of ethical exception to the global
commodification of health" (126). The concept of national sovereignty
[[prioritized]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[well-being of people]{.mark}s
actually affected]{.underline} by H5N1, [[and
interrupted]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[predatory
[extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}** of samples [from the Global
South]{.underline}. Thus, national sovereignty was articulated not as
selfish or provincial, but as key to ensuring the health of those most
impacted.

The [discourse of national sovereignty]{.underline} also [chipped away
at the rhetorics of security that]{.underline} had helped justify
pandemic preparedness as a security imperative. It was certainly a
difficult battle: the discourse of global health security had not only
diminished national autonomy, but also coded nations such as China and
Indonesia, who asserted their authority, as security threats. At a March
2007 WHO meeting held in Jakarta, for example, a WHO press release
called Indonesia's withholding of viruses a "[[threat to
global]{.underline}]{.mark} public health
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}" (WHO 2007). This [[married **false
universalism**]{.underline}]{.mark} (a disaggregated globe) [[with
**alarmist**]{.mark} **security [rhetoric]{.mark}** [to
sideline]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[equity]{.mark}
issues]{.underline}** that had been highlighted by Indonesia and its
allies.

U.S. government officials, along with much of the **[U.S. popular
press]{.underline}**, had also [frequently deployed]{.underline} these
[**security frames** in response to Indonesia's actions]{.underline}.
Prominent public health journalists Richard Holbrooke and Laurie
Garrett, in their denouncement of Indonesia's position, published an
article in August 2008 in the Washington Post that described Indonesia's
failure to provide viruses as posing a "pandemic threat to all the
peoples of the world." The authors followed this with further security
discourse: "Disturbingly, however, the notion \[of viral sovereignty\]
has morphed into a global movement, fueled by self-destructive,
anti-western sentiments" (Holbrooke and Garrett 2008; emphasis added).
This [characterization invoked]{.underline} the [trope of the
**West-hating terrorist**]{.underline}, but also the post-9/11 frame
that was its complement---U.S. vulnerability, here [aimed at cowing
Global South nations that refused to comply with the North-led
international system]{.underline}. The authors ended their article by
calling on Indonesia to conform to the demands of "globally shared
health risk," further coding Indonesia's challenge to the international
health system as a global threat and [upholding]{.underline} the
[[myth]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
[[international]{.underline}]{.mark} pandemic preparedness
[[regime]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and its fortification --- [[benefited
**all**]{.mark} **nations**]{.underline}. Indonesia finished what China
had started when the latter briefly staged a flu sample sharing
stoppage. The [[shift to benefits sharing]{.mark} and national
sovereignty]{.underline}, [and [away from]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[rhetorics of [global]{.mark}]{.underline} health
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[diminished]{.underline}]{.mark} both
the [[discursive]{.mark} and the **institutional [power]{.mark}** [of
the North-led]{.mark} **international [system]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Indonesia, along with its allies, [[interrupted]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**biocolonial [extraction]{.mark}** of resources [from the Global
South]{.mark}]{.underline} and [altered the system itself]{.underline},
[[institutionalizing]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[redistribution of power to
give the Global South a]{.mark} **greater [role]{.mark}** [in
**global**]{.mark}]{.underline} health
**[[governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Transnational (in)security governance through the lens of
postcoloniality We claim that [the point of departure for any research
endeavour sensitive to the postcolonial condition of contemporary forms
of transnational (in)security governance consists in]{.underline} what
authors in other fields have called 'provincializing' (Chakrabarty,
2000) or '[decolonizing']{.underline} (Rodríguez et al., 2010) security
studies. This means [avoiding practices of analytical othering by
emphasizing the analytical 'limits of the European experience'
(]{.underline}Wong, 1997). Seth (2009) contrasts two strategies in this
regard: One consists in [providing a different account of history
through the lens of historical sociology]{.underline}. The other,
informed by postcolonial theory, implies [showing the limitations and
non-universality of European analytical categories.]{.underline} While
the latter tradition thus sensitizes us to the fact that 'the central
categories of the social sciences are the product of a European history
and are not necessarily adequate everywhere, even in their amended
versions' (Seth, 2009: 336), historical sociology, according to Seth,
can provide original accounts of subaltern or non-European history.
Seth, however, is more in favour of the postcolonial approach and argues
that non-Eurocentric historical sociology is mainly about 'producing
"better" knowledge on the grounds that it more accurately re-presents
what really happened'. By missing the fact that [knowledge is not only
about re-presenting the world but also about creating it]{.underline},
historical sociology, according to Seth (2009: 336), tends to produce an
external relationship between knowledge and object, a situation that, in
contrast to postcolonial studies, the discipline seems incapable of
overcoming. In contrast to such a rather rigid juxtaposition, we think
[that taking historical sociology seriously is indispensable for a
postcolonial security studies research programme]{.underline}, but that
[in order to unfold its anti-Western-centric potential, historical
sociology, national as well as international, must engage more deeply
with postcolonial studies.]{.underline} As Boatcă and Costa (2010: 14)
have argued in their call for [a 'decolonized' sociology, it is through
such an approximation between sociology and postcolonial studies that
the epistemological limits of sociology that are the result of a
particular academic and epistemological institutionalization of the
discipline, and 'that so far have prevented the emergence of a global
sociology of colonial, neocolonial and postcolonial
contexts',]{.underline} can be overcome. [It is such a 'decolonized'
historical sociology through which 'historical contextualization as a
postcolonial method']{.underline} (Boatcă and Costa, 2010: 17) [can be
productively integrated]{.underline} into a postcolonial security
studies research programme,2 [by highlighting subaltern knowledge and
entangled histories of non-Western societies. Decolonized historical
sociology can also call our attention to phenomena that, while
frequently considered to be occurring only beyond the West, characterize
Western societies themselves, including, for example, areas hardly
reached by the state]{.underline} and where the state's monopoly of
force is absent or strongly compromised (e.g. marginalized urban spaces,
such as the banlieues in France, ETA strongholds in Basque country, and
urban and rural spaces controlled by the mafia in Italy or with forms of
vigilante justice in the United States). [Taking such insights seriously
illustrates the limitations of analytical categories bound to the idea
of a Western-centric methodological nationalism for understanding
(in)security governance even in our contemporary world more
generally.]{.underline} Consequently, our critique of Western-centric
analytical categories does not imply a call for abandoning all Western
theory. Without denying that much, if not most, European theory is
marked by the above-mentioned problems stemming from Occidentalism and
Western-centrism, instead of simply abandoning these theories, we share
Bhabha's (1994: 18--28) 'commitment to theory'. While challenging the
'fictitious universalism' (Bourdieu, 2000: 65) of Western theories, such
a commitment, in our understanding, enhances their analytical scope
through what Jackson, following Hall, called 'theoretical
transculturation'. This implies 'demonstrating that such \[Western\]
theory does not in fact describe or map the entire planet, and that
despite pretensions to universalism it suffers from gaps and lacunae,
and for this reason needs to be revised in the light of local empirical
conditions' (Jackson, 2003: 73). But the argument for provincializing
security studies can even be pushed further. [Writing from an African
perspective, Mbembe and Nutall (2004: 348) argue that our task is not
simply to demonstrate the fallacies of knowledge derived from a
particular European experience, but rather to engage in a 'worlding' of
the African experience. Africa is fraught as an idea and object of
academic research, as it has become a sign in public debates for the
'other', the 'failed', the 'incomplete' and something apart from the
world]{.underline}, probably more so than Latin America and Asia.
[Constructed as 'out of the world' by policymakers and academics, a
postcolonial security studies perspective would require 'reinscribing'
African (in)security knowledge, experiences and practices into the world
and thereby depicting these as 'normal' and relevant parts of the human
experience, not an exotic exception.]{.underline} This would imply
[recognizing the African experience of 'indeterminancy',
'provisionality', 'contingency' and uncertainty as a basic condition of
life, and as a reality that requires analytical lenses and gives rise to
relevant research questions in its own right (]{.underline}Mbembe and
Nutall, 2004: 349). Recent scholarship in urban studies has not only
stressed the 'ordinary' character of (postcolonial) urban experiences
across the world (Robinson, 2006) but also suggests that postcolonial
cities like Shanghai, Dubai or Lusaka, rather than Western cities, might
be the avant-garde of global metropolitan developments (Myers, 2011; Roy
and Ong, 2011) -- including the governance of (in)security. Postcolonies
might in fact offer 'privileged insight into the workings of the world
at large' (Comaroff and Comaroff, 2012: 1[). This calls for an
engagement with site specific modernities and ways of constructing
security governance in 'ex-centric sites']{.underline} (Bhabha, 1994: 6)
in [the peripheries of world society in which the Western narrative of
modernity is but one among others informing people's ways of imagining
and constructing the world. Taking such a perspective seriously produces
new understandings of the dynamics of peacekeeping, state-building and
anti-terror interventions -- which security studies often deals with as
though an innocent division could be drawn between interveners and
intervened, a liberal 'us' and another 'them', or as though these
interventions are the only privileged sites for the globalization of
security knowledge and technologies in our contemporary
world.]{.underline} However, [security interventions also take place in
indirect ways. Dominant (in)security discourses constitute situations
and particular actors as transnational security risk]{.underline}, with
important repercussions for individual security. A case in point is the
'discovery' of diaspora communities as partners in conflict prevention
in 'developing countries', highlighted in Laffey and Sutharan's article
in this issue with reference to the international engagement with the
Tamil diaspora. Considering the above-mentioned entangled histories of
(in)security governance, [the analytics of postcoloniality also remind
us that security practices are globalized through borrowing and
emulation by local elites -- be that through forced geopolitical
pressures or as a result of instrumental calculation -- as well as
through indirect effects of hegemonic discourses and
practices]{.underline} in transnational fields (Bilgin, 2010: 618; 2009:
340). Jacobsen's article in this issue on the introduction of the Unique
Identity Number biometrical identification system for Indian citizens,
which is inseparable from globally dominant discourses on technology,
knowledge and development, is illustrative in this regard.
[Postcoloniality pervades security knowledge and practices in all these
spaces in which security governance is strongly shaped by external
actors and/or transnational discourses and practice fields.]{.underline}
However, few studies have looked into the de facto effects of these
transnational influences on local (in)security governance and on the
agency of those people involved and affected -- both in and beyond the
postcolony. Where such agency has been taken seriously, such efforts
have mostly focused on the hybrid nature of the outcomes of external
security interventions at the local level (e.g. Mac Ginty, 2010). By
localizing the scope and effects of local agency to the local arena,
such a perspective, however, downplays [how 'local' agency and security
practices may transform the transnational security field
itself]{.underline}. While security studies has thus dealt with the
transnational entanglements of (in)security governance in postcolonies
and the 'local' repercussions of transnational security governance, much
of the literature buys into the research objects, binary categories and
unidirectional travelling of knowledge and institutions established in
Eurocentric narratives of security governance. In the remainder of this
article, we will therefore highlight three methodological moves that in
our view provide the basis for overcoming these deficits and rendering
security studies research more sensitive to the postcolonial condition.

#### This resolution holds radical potential -- vote affirmative to transform debate into a decolonial site of study for technological security governance -- challenging the power relations of debate as an academic practice should frame your ballot.

Is it possible to [create a field of security studies that is
"decolonized,]{.underline}" so to speak, and [attuned to the multiple
forms of power relations that affect everyday security
practices---beyond those embedded in powerful states]{.underline}? In
this essay, I have suggested that it [is worth exploring "decolonial"
perspectives as an alternative means of shedding light on dynamics of
inclusion and exclusion in global security.]{.underline} Decolonial
approaches focus on [transforming structures, rather than simply
diversifying them, and provide an alternative to more "problem-solving"
approaches to inclusion and exclusion]{.underline}. The literature on
decolonial theory and its application is vast, and this brief commentary
has only touched on some representative arguments in a somewhat
superficial manner. Nevertheless, it is worth asking to what extent
incorporating principles of decoloniality could open up broader
discussions on "inclusion" and "exclusion" in ways that might [help
transform the field.]{.underline} Security studies, perhaps more than
any other field, has had a close link with the policy interests (and
worldviews) of the most powerful. [Decolonial approaches provide a means
of shedding further light on this, by examining how and why the field
legitimizes some voices while silencing others. A decolonial lens
provides the means of excavating the history of such exclusions, by
pointing to their connection with unresolved colonial, racial, and
imperial histories.]{.underline} A number of decolonial scholars have
provided practical guidance on how to promote more inclusive
conversations in IR and security studies in ways that would [expand who
"speaks" in the discipline (]{.underline}see, e.g., Sabaratnam 2011).
Yet, decolonial approaches have also been criticized for the way they
can also reproduce the very colonial categories and hierarchies that
they challenge, rather than move beyond them (Murray 2019). This has led
some to connect decolonial approaches with the need to move to a more
planetary form of politics and collective solidarity, in which the
underlying logic is one of entanglement, interdependence, and dialogue,
rather than binary forms of inclusion and exclusion (Stengers 2010;
Burke et al. 2016; Conway 2019). Such strategies may be in[creasingly
necessary under rapidly changing conditions of technological
change]{.underline} and planetary environmental destruction. For
example, [the rise of big data and the increased role that algorithms
play in shaping the lifeworlds of individuals lead to a type of
universal "colonization" of life by technology in ways that decolonial
approaches can help to shed light on.3]{.underline} Similarly, [the
notion of the Anthropocene can be seen as being characterized by the
colonization of nature by humans, in ways that actively exclude and
threaten the security of many of the nonhuman inhabitants of the
planet]{.underline}. Clearly, there is still a long way to go in the
task of theorizing dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in global
security studies. This special issue, however, has made an [important
step forward in raising the question]{.underline}, and in bringing to
the fore cases that address issues of gender, religion, national
identity, and refugees. The question the special issue ultimately leaves
us with is: What other forms of exclusion may we still be blind to, and
how can we begin the process of excavating and addressing them?

#### [Surprise]{.underline}! We are [blowing it up]{.underline}.

Impact

Given the centrality of economic growth in the mainstream,
[degrowth]{.underline} has largely [hovered on the margins]{.underline}
of debate. That [seems to be **changing**]{.underline}.

"[I noticed a **shift in mood** two or three years]{.underline} ago,"
reports Simon Michaux. "Instead of hitting my head against the wall, all
of a sudden [I started to **get results**.]{.underline} I'm not sure how
this happened, but now [I'm getting my work in front of]{.underline}
senior **[policy decisionmakers]{.underline}**. I'm presenting to
ministers and parliaments in multiple countries."

But, he cautions, that hasn't yet translated into altered policies,
either at a political level or even in terms of technological research.
"The best and brightest are working on things that, I won't say they
won't work, they do work, but they are not the ultimate solution. We are
forced to work on lithium-ion battery chemistry when there are other
chemistries. I've shown that there are not enough minerals in the ground
to make those batteries. I've used their data. They have no choice but
to see it."

When a financial crisis happens or a sympathetic political party takes
power, the terms of reception can change dramatically. Peter Victor
remembers when a social democratic government took over in Ontario after
a surprise election result in 1991. "I was given a job there, and just
being able to work with a government that was interested in social
change was incredible," he says. "You couldn't give them enough ideas!
They didn't accept them all, but they listened."

Fifteen years later [it was]{.underline} a **[crisis]{.underline}**
[that gave]{.underline} his [ideas]{.underline} more
**[prominence]{.underline}**. "My book Managing Without Growth came out
in 2008 at the time of the financial crisis," he recalls. "What
otherwise would have been a marginal document published by an academic
publisher and sold at a high price became more well-known. The media was
looking for an economist who could say something positive about
no-growth. I was invited all over the world. I got a sense that I was
being listened to. But 99 percent of the time, the audience already
agreed with me."

Victor adds, "[It takes a **chorus**. If lots of us do these things, it
**will make an impact**]{.underline}."

[Degrowth is]{.underline} often [associated **with
doom-and-gloom**]{.underline} scenarios. "No one wants to hear that
everything is going to go poorly," Simon Michaux notes. "They want a
solution. If you can't promote a solution, they are not prepared to hear
the problem." As the economist Herman Daly used to say, "If you're
falling out an airplane, it's not an altimeter you need but a
parachute."

Finland, Michaux continues, sits on a lot of minerals integral to
battery production such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and graphite. "If
I'm right, in a few years' time, the global production of minerals will
not be sufficient to meet demand. The captains of industry will then
turn to the geological surveys in Europe and say, 'why didn't you tell
us?' The Geological Survey of Finland (GDK) manages a battery portfolio
and they will be first in the firing line. I can have a frank discussion
with their executive board members about hyperinflation, peak oil,
currency default. They are enlightened, but they don't understand the
implications." Still, GDK is giving him the opportunity to develop his
ideas about the circular economy and cooperate with other Finnish
research groups in the industrial sectors.

"It's pretty clear that [we **don't have enough resources to go
around**]{.underline}," Michaux concludes. "[If we do the
**conventional**]{.underline}, each nation for itself, [it will give
**war a chance until the population** reduces. If we actually have a
**transparency of information**]{.underline} and we all agree to share
those [resources, we'll have a form of socialism to **distribute those
resources**]{.underline} and a form of capitalism to exploit those
resources."

To help generate and test new ideas, Joshua Farley recommends creating a
knowledge commons. "[Any university can unilaterally declare that all
the knowledge we create to address social ecological problems is
**freely available**]{.underline} to all on the condition that any
improvements to it are also freely available to all," he suggests.
[Even]{.underline} geopolitical [rivals like the **United States**,
**Iran**, and **North Korea** could be part of this commons. Small-scale
knowledge]{.underline} commons, like this working group, [can provide
help in developing certain ideas and marshalling the **defense of such
ideas in the public sphere**]{.underline}.

### Alt --- Difference 

#### The alternative is a [rejection]{.underline} of unified culture --- that makes a new international system that accommodates cultural difference possible.

//CYang

Far from seeing culture as complex and contradictory, Martin Wight, one
of the school's founders, held in Systems of States that an
[[international society]{.underline}]{.mark} "[will [not come into being
without]{.mark} a **degree of [cultural unity]{.mark}** [among its
members]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[Modern international
society]{.underline}]{.mark}, he argued, [[had]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[origins in Europe]{.mark}an civilization]{.underline}, [[and when
decolonization admitted]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[host of [non-Western
states]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[international
society]{.underline}]{.mark} had "**[[outrun cultural and moral
community]{.underline}]{.mark}**." The idea that pragmatism could only
ever sustain a thin social order --- and that a [[common
culture]{.underline}]{.mark} was [[needed to undergird robust]{.mark}
bonds]{.underline}, [[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
practices]{.underline} --- focused much of the school's
post-decolonization research on the possibility of international society
in a culturally diverse world.

[[IR's failure to integrate **contemporary**]{.mark} **conceptions** of
[culture]{.mark}]{.underline} is more than an academic curiosity --- it
[[has **far-reaching implications** for how we understand]{.mark}
today's **[global politics]{.mark} of culture**]{.underline}. Take one
critical issue: the [impact of rising non-Western powers on the modern
international order]{.underline}. At present,
[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[dominated by
**culturalists**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[who think]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the [[order will **collapse** as]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[Western
**cultural foundations** erode]{.underline}]{.mark}, and liberals, who
deny that cultural differences matter, holding that liberal institutions
can accommodate states and peoples of diverse cultural complexions.

[[But what if we take seriously]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[insight]{.underline} that [[there is **no such thing**
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[unified culture]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
all culture is complex and contradictory? We would have to assume, first
of all, that the modern order arose under conditions of cultural
diversity, not unity. And [we would]{.underline} then have to [[ask
how]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[heterogeneous conditions
shaped]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[order's evolution
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[how]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[order's institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[constructed to
**govern** and **order** that diversity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Doing so]{.underline} would [[bring]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[conquest
of the Americas]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[Protestant
Reformation]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [post-Versailles [division of
Europe into **ethnically defined** nation-states]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and decolonization into **new focus**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most
importantly, it would lead us to ask not whether sudden onset diversity
will destroy a formerly Western order, but whether [post-decolonization
practices for governing global diversity]{.underline} can [[accommodate
**new arrangements** of power and]{.mark} expressions of **[cultural
difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Alt --- Failed IR

#### Vote negative to affirm the [night side]{.underline} of IR theory --- circulating pessimistic readings IR as a [failed project]{.underline} is a generative practice that refuses the violence of the Eurocene.

[Why would I bother with the "**night side" of ir
theory**?]{.underline}47 In part[, I wish to **move away from the
rationalist fallacy** among both defenders and critics of
empire.]{.underline} [There is a **shared belief in the strategic
competence** of nations like the United States]{.underline}. [Even those
most vocally critical often see in the **covert operations** and **vast
military occupations** a kind of purpose or conspiracy. The debate about
empire then becomes about its moral virtue rather than the factual
question of the strategic competence of imperial states]{.underline}.
However, [the **lives of millions annihilated** in **Iraq**, **Yemen**,
**Afghanistan**, and]{.underline} now increasingly throughout the
[**continent of Africa** do not reflect an amoral strategic
competence]{.underline}. [The **mass murder** in pursuit of the **war on
terrorism** and its **vision of nation-building** is the result of
**lethal \[ignorance\]**]{.underline} ~~stupidity~~.48 In some sense,
the investigative journalism of Jeremy Scahill and Glen Greenwald
attributes too much reason and order to the catastrophic floundering of
the American empire.49 [To see even a dark vision of order in the last
thirty years of U.S. policy is itself a form of optimism. **No one is in
control**, **there is no conspiracy**, and **yet the killing
continues**]{.underline}. [A pessimistic reading of U.S. empire and the
geopolitical history that precedes it is neither tragedy nor farce. It
is a catastrophic banality lacking in any and all history, a pile of
nonevents so suffocating that we often hope for a conspiracy,
punctuating event, or villain worthy of the scale of
violence]{.underline}.50 For those of us who continually rewatch the
reruns of The Walking Dead and Jericho on our laptops in bed, we are
waiting for relief in our privileged but increasingly fragile bubble. I
know I am not the only one who finds respite from the weight of
politics' "cruel optimism" by watching fantasies of cruel pessimism. [A
pessimistic understanding of global politics helps explain how we could
come to a place where there is a sense of relief in watching everything
come to an end.]{.underline}51 [**Failed ir** affirms the power of this
kind of negative thinking as an **alternative** to the **endless
rehearsing of moralizing insights** and **strategic foresight.** The
negative is not "against" or reacting to something]{.underline}. Rather,
[it is the affirmation of a freedom beyond the limits of life and death.
That is, it is making a life by continuing to think about the world,
even if that thinking is not recuperative, and even if nothing we think
can save us]{.underline}. In the face of it all, one celebrates useless
thinking, useless scholarship, and useless forms of life at the very
moment we are told to throw them all under the bus in the name of
survival at all costs. This is a logic referred to lately as hope and it
is as cruel as it is anxiety inducing. [Hope is a form of extortion. We
are told that it is our obligation to bear the weight of making things
better while being chided that the failure of our efforts is the result
of not believing in the possibility of real change.]{.underline} In such
an environment, pessimism is often treated as a form of treason, as if
only neoliberals and moral degenerates give up---or so goes the op-ed's
insisting upon the renewed possibility of redemption. In response to
these exhortations, pessimism offers a historical atheism, both
methodologically and morally. The universe does not bend toward justice.
Sometimes the universe bends toward the indifference of gravity wells
and black holes. [Affirming negativity]{.underline}, inspired by Achille
Mbembe, [is grounds for freedom,]{.underline} even if that freedom or
relief is only fleeting and always insecure. I am not arrogant enough to
think a book can attain freedom of this sort, but this book is inspired
by refusals of critique as redemption in favor of useless critique and
critique for its own sake. That the pursuit of knowledge without
immediate application is so thoroughly useless, even profane, is a
diagnosis of our current moment. The neoliberal assault on the
university is evidence of this condition, as is the current pitch of
American politics. Our indifference as intellectuals to maximizing value
has not gone unnoticed. We are still dangerous, worthy of vilification,
of attack, sabotage, and derision because we fail so decadently. We are
parasites according to Scott Walker, Donald Trump, and the rest. So be
it. We are and shall remain irascible irritants to a worldwide assault
on thinking that is well underway and facing few obstacles in other
jurisdictions. What would failed scholarship do? Learn to die, learn to
live, learn to listen, learn to be together, and learn to be generous.
These virtues are useless in that they do not prevent or manage things.
They do not translate into learning objectives or metrics. Virtues of
this order are selfsame, nontransferable experiences. They are
meaningful but not useful. These are luxurious virtues. Like grieving or
joy, they are ends unto themselves. But how will these ideas seek
extramural grants, contribute to an outcomes-based education system, or
become a policy recommendation? They will not, and that is part of their
virtue. [Even if there is no straight line to where we are and where we
ought to be]{.underline}, I [think we should **get over the idea** that
somehow **the U.S. project of liberal empire is conflicted**, or **"more
right than it is wrong,"** or **pragmatically preferable to the
alternatives**. I hope this book can contribute to the urgent necessity
to get out of the way by reveling in the catastrophic failure that
should inspire humility but instead seems to embolden too many to seek
global control yet again. Demolition may be an affirmative act if it
means insurgents and others can be better heard.]{.underline} And yet
this may fail too. If we can accomplish nothing at all, we can at least,
as Ta-Nehisi Coates and other pessimists have said, refuse to suborn the
lie of America any longer. [Telling the truth, even if it cannot change
the outcome of history, is a certain kind of solace.]{.underline} In
Coates's words, [there is a kind of rapture "when you can no longer be
lied to, when you have rejected the dream]{.underline}."52 Saying the
truth out loud brings with it the relief that we are not ~~crazy~~.
Things really are as bad as we think. [If there are those of us who want
to break from this one-hundred-year-old race to be the next Henry
Kissinger, then **why do we continue to seek respect in the form of
recognizable standards of excellence**?]{.underline} I am not sure where
the answer finally lies, but I do know that [professionalization will
not save us. To appear as normal and recognizably rigorous will not be
enough to stave off the neoliberal drive to monetize scholarship, or to
demand of us strategically useful insights]{.underline}. The least we
can do in the face of such a battle is to find comfort in meaningful
ideas and the friendships they build rather than try to perform for
those we know are the problem. Some will ask, who is this "we" or is
that "they"---where is your evidence? More will know exactly what I am
talking about. [The virtues I seek are oriented toward an academy of
refuge, a place we can still live, no matter how dire the conditions of
the university and the classroom. It is not the think tank, boardroom,
or command center. We are, those of us who wish to be included, the last
of the philosophers, the last of the lovers of knowledge]{.underline},
the deviants who should revel in what Harney and Moten have called the
undercommons. 53 In one of his final lectures, Bataille speaks of the
remnants of a dif­ferent human species, something not quite so doomed,
something that wasted its newly discovered consciousness and tool-being
on the art that still marks the walls of prehistoric caves.54 This
lingering minor or vestigial heritage is philosophy's beginning.
[Philosophy survives war, atrocity, famine, and crusades. Thinking
matters in a very unusual way]{.underline}. Thinking is not power or
emancipation. [Thinking matters for a sense of belonging to the world,
and for believing in the fecundity of the world despite evidence to the
contrary.]{.underline} How do you get all this from pessimism, from
failure? Because [willing failure is a temptation, a lure to think
otherwise, to think dangerous thoughts. Pessimism is a threat to
indifferentism and nihilism]{.underline} in the sense of the phenomenon
of Donald Trump. [Pessimism is a provocation and an enemy of skepticism,
particularly of the metaphysical variety]{.underline}. It is not
redemption from these afflictions, but in pessimism there is solace in
the real. To put it another way, [to study the world as it is means to
care for it. The exhortation that our care or interest should be
contingent on how useful the world is and how much of it conforms to our
designs is as much opposed to care as it is to empiricism]{.underline}.
We can study airports, poetry, endurance races, borders, bombs, plastic,
and warfare, and find them all in the world. [To consider the depth
of]{.underline} their [existence can be an invitation to the world
rather than a prelude to another policy report.]{.underline} One cannot
make a successful political career out of such pursuits, but you might
be able to make a life out of it, a life worth repeating even if nothing
else happens. At the end of Jack Halberstam's The Queer Art of Failure,
we are presented with the Fantastic Mr. Fox's toast as an exemple of
something meaningful in these dark times of ours. They say all foxes are
slightly allergic to linoleum, but it's cool to the paw---try it. They
say my tail needs to be dry cleaned twice a month, but now it's fully
detachable---see? They say our tree may never grow back, but one day,
something will. Yes, these crackles are made of synthetic goose and
these giblets come from artificial squab and even these apples look
fake---but at least they've got stars on them. I guess my point is,
we'll eat tonight, and we'll eat together. And even in this not
particularly flattering light, you are without a doubt the five and a
half most wonderful wild animals I've ever met in my life. So let's
raise our boxes---to our survival. Halberstam says of this queer moment:
Not quite a credo, something short of a toast, a little less than a
speech, but Mr. Fox gives here one of the best and most moving---both
emotionally and in stop-motion terms---addresses in the history of
cinema. Unlike Coraline, where survival is predicated upon a rejection
of the theatrical, the queer, and the improvised, and like Where the
Wild Things Are, where the disappointment of deliverance must be
leavened with the pragmatism of possibility, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a
queerly animated classic in that it teaches us, as Finding Nemo, Chicken
Run, and so many other revolting animations before it, to believe in
detachable tails, fake apples, eating together, adapting to the
lighting, risk, sissy sons, and the sheer importance of survival for all
those wild souls that the farmers, the teachers, the preachers, and the
politicians would like to bury alive.55 Although not as much fun as
Halberstam's monument to low theory, [Savage Ecology is for all the
other wild animals out there studying global politics. May we be buried
alive together.]{.underline}

The occasion of this collection is the problem of worldviews for the
field of international relations (IR). I want to invoke this problem in
more than one sense. First, I am interested in how the kinds of
[**worldviews** we inhabit **change** the way we study international
relations]{.underline}. In my case, [I will]{.underline} try to [present
the reasoning behind my **methodological decision** to adopt a
**relational** world view as opposed to a **mechanistic** world view
made up of **discrete objects**]{.underline} [with specific and stable
essences]{.underline}. Second, I want to show the way that worldviews
function in our relational world --- that is, in practice.

In an attempt to create a conversation across the different chapters, I
offer an account of what I think relationalism is and its origins within
the tradition of international relations. As is often the case of
adherents to a particular position, I want to show that [we are **all
relationalists**, just some]{.underline} better and **[more
explicit]{.underline}** [than others]{.underline}. I also want to dispel
a few presumptions about what I think relationalism can and cannot do,
and give a sketch of what a relational approach could look like in
addressing a seemingly straightforward legal or technical question about
nuclear authority.

4.1 What is Relationalism, for Me?

First and foremost, [relationalism is an **is**, not a
**should**]{.underline}. [I mean it as a claim to how I believe the
world **actually works**]{.underline}. For me, it comes primarily from
the radical empiricist tradition of William James, C.S. Pierce, Alfred
North Whitehead, John Dewey, and Gabriel Tarde. Second, [the **goal** of
a relational approach is to figure out how things]{.underline} ---
[including **people**, **states**, and **technological
systems**]{.underline} --- **[actually work]{.underline}**, [rather than
to make **claims** about how things **should work**]{.underline} [or
**predictive claims**]{.underline} [about how things will **continue to
work**]{.underline}. Therefore, [it is]{.underline} in the philosophical
sense [a **realist position** not primarily interested in questions of
representation or interpretation, but also not indifferent to
them]{.underline}. [Relationalism sees problems of human access to the
world]{.underline} (**[representation]{.underline}**) [and problems of
meaning-making and communication]{.underline}
(**[hermeneutics]{.underline}**) [as being **horizontal**]{.underline}
[with other relations, such as those we think of as **biological** or
**technological**]{.underline}. [This has been described]{.underline} by
Manuel Delanda as [a]{.underline} "**[flat ontology]{.underline}**."1
[Human observation and interpretation is on the **ground floor** with
everything else, rather than above it, **apart from** it, or **looking
down** at the world]{.underline}.

Although it certainly has a strong claim to ontology --- how things are
--- [relationalism is an **ontology of becoming**]{.underline}.
[**Process** is privileged over structure or fixity in the traditional
sense]{.underline}. [Highly **dynamic** and **transversal** ecosystems
are privileged over equilibrium systems]{.underline} such as those
imagined by Talcott Parsons or other Hegelian inheritors who see the
world as turgid and therefore only open to gradual and often purposive
change.

The correlate to an emphasis on becoming or [the dynamic evolutionary
character of change]{.underline} within systems and of systems [directs
us to **investigate processes**]{.underline} --- stories about
distributed formations and deformations --- [rather than agents or
variables which could be said to be the]{.underline}
"**[effect]{.underline}**" [of a process]{.underline}. In part, the
so-called "[flat ontology]{.underline}" of relational worldviews
[renders distinctions between independent and dependent variables, and
agents and structures, somewhat **arbitrary**]{.underline}. As an aside,
[arbitrary here does not mean meaningless]{.underline}. [It simply means
**not essential**]{.underline} --- that is, not bearing an essence.
[What is **causally significant**, what is an agent, what is a system
instead is most often an **effect of investigation**]{.underline}. At
what scale one asks the question, and the scale of the investigator,
radically alters what appears as a part and what appears as a whole. For
instance, from this perspective, the methodological individualism of
social theory and many other theories is not a natural unit of analysis.
Instead, the focus on the individual as a causal principle comes from
the unity we "feel" as an "I."

We rarely experience ourselves as disaggregated (although drug-induced
effects, bouts of madness, dreaming, etc., are exceptions most people
experience over the course of their lives). However, [we are
**disaggregated**]{.underline}. From William James' Principles of
Psychology, in which [we are a]{.underline} "[bundle of **affects** and
**perceptions**]{.underline},"2 [through]{.underline} to [**contemporary
neuroscience investigations** of mood-altering gut **bacteria**,
**preconscious decision-making**, and increasingly compelling
philosophical accounts of a **subjectless human**]{.underline} by Galen
Strawson and others, [we have strong reason to believe that even this
most basic unit quickly begins to **come apart** at the seams as we zoom
in for **closer investigation**]{.underline}.3 **[\<\<\<FOOTNOTE 3
BEGINS\>\>\>]{.underline}** 3 Many philosophers of mind,
**[neuroscientists]{.underline}**, and political theorists [have given
compelling, **data-rich** accounts of human action and will that do not
require a knowing, prospective subject]{.underline}. Consciousness is
for many contemporary neuroscientists perpetually late to the party. [We
act and experience and reflect in that order not the other way
around]{.underline}. Of the many claims for which Nau is most concerned,
this issue raises a serious conundrum for his world view. Nau wants a
world of realist, rigorous science to act as a foundation for
scholarship and a self-possessed, autonomous scholar to conduct that
rigorous science that is in contradiction with the findings of science
and much of contemporary philosophy of mind. For me, whether we are free
in the way that Nau discusses mind and agency is an empirical question
long since discounted by the modernist western scientific culture he
seeks to defend. See Strawson 2018; Edelman 2007; Connolly 2002.
**[\<\<\<FOOTNOTE 3 ENDS\>\>\>]{.underline}**

[As we zoom out, the litany of parts reveals more and **more
wholes**]{.underline}. [Consider **group behavior**]{.underline} in the
form of riots and crowds, which exhibit flocking behavior even in
humans. [Extending the view]{.underline} just a little further,
[**communities** and]{.underline} then [**societies** appear in which
the **lack of central planning**]{.underline} (and even contrary to
central planning) [there is repetitive behavior]{.underline},
**[cooperation]{.underline}**, [and **transactions**]{.underline} [of
all kinds]{.underline}. [An aerial view of a major highway system
exhibits behavioral phenomena **vastly beyond** the **conscious
coordinating capability** of **individual humans** or the
**technology**]{.underline} [they are interfacing with]{.underline}.
Despite the high number of auto fatalities, that there are not more is
astounding. The average daily commute is more than an hour a day of
barely conscious muscle memory playing out amongst thousands of actors
with little to no communication beyond turn signals and the occasional
horn. And what about zooming out much further? If we occupy the space
between the earthrise and Carl Sagan's little blue dot, [the entire
planet becomes something like **James Lovelock's Gaia**]{.underline}.
[The earth from this perspective is a kind of **superorganism** of
**feedback mechanisms**]{.underline}, from the carbon cycle to the
birth, death, and reabsorption of all of the necessary chemical and
mineral components, as well as the creative drive to incorporate them
into newly innovative forms of life. [Scale as a spacetime]{.underline},
how close and for how long, [drives the units of analysis and not the
"natural" or "essential" unity of those units]{.underline}. Instead,
[there are relations at **every scale** crossing into every other
scale]{.underline}. Which relations are most important, most operative,
and most determinative of change or stability depends upon the region
investigated.

Finally, we have the very strange and exotic wholes which make up much
of international relations. So far, the descriptions of parts have been
in some sense mechanical, or could be interpreted as such (i.e. brains
or weapons, etc.). However, what about Benedict Anderson's imagined
communities? Collectivities can feel history and connection with those
they have never met, and will show up to fight a war for the injury of
those anonymous brethren. Even the strange magic of memory and
consciousness scales very differently when considered at different
scales. However, we should not separate consciousness or memory from the
networks of neurons, perceptions, gut bacteria, print media, and social
network platforms that make it possible for consciousness to travel,
imitate, innovate, and reaffirm conceptual habits.

At all scales, [relationalism describes a multitude of **relay** and
**feedbacks** constitutive of the processes that give form to what we
experience]{.underline} as part--- whole relationships in time. Many
endure at different scales (plate tectonics for eons, species
differences for shorter durations, fashion trends or diplomatic crisis
for durations of hours or days) but [they **only exist**]{.underline},
in some sense, [solely in their **process**]{.underline}. When the
relations change, the process is over or altered, and the only thing
that remains is the impression left on the new arrangement by the
arrangements that preceded it. This is true, according to relationalism,
from the intimacy of identity all the way to the formation of stars.

While I follow a relational and primarily historical and interpretive
approach, I do depart from many other adherents of relationalism in two
significant ways.4 The first involves the assumption of an ethical or
normative content to what Milja Kurki calls the "relational cosmology"
of the "relational revolution" (Chapter 3, this volume). Kurki believes
an ethical impulse is "baked into" a relational worldview. There are a
number of examples of this in contemporary theory inside and outside of
IR. Two variants are those following Judith Butler and her debt to
Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah Arendt, who account for violence as an
abrogation of relations and a possibility of nonviolence in relations
themselves. Here, violence is in some sense the ignoring of a
fundamental relationality among human beings that would, if recognized,
create an understanding mutuality opposed to violence. From these
accounts, consciousness-raising about the fact of relationality is a
solution to global violence just as "realizing" and "experiencing"
relationality makes us open or indebted to "the other," to use Levinas'
terms. The second variant focuses more on the natural environment and
violence against nonhuman others. From this perspective on
relationality, environmental destruction and extreme cruelty toward
nonhuman animals is, like the Levinasian/Arendtian account, the result
of a loss of relationality often attributed to modernist accounts of
mind/body and nature/culture dualisms, or, more generally, of
anthropocentrism. Like normative relationalism, the environmental strand
believes that an awareness of this fact, or a cultivation of an ethos of
interdependence beyond the human species, will reduce violence and
possibly may make planetary life more sustainable. It is not unusual to
take as evidence of this position the confluence of environmental
protections by indigenous peoples with relational cosmologies.

Both variants conflate the methodological insights of relationalism with
a relational worldview. One is empirical while the other is
aspirational. The risk, I believe, in this conflation is a confusion of
expectations and a false sense that one has solved more philosophical
questions than are possible to solve. It is enough to have an account of
the world that integrates ideational and material forces into a single
substance and ontology. We ought not expect that this, in addition,
restores the world to some perfect order, or that striving for a more
universal notion of the good escapes somehow the deep problems of
competing interests, relativism, or incommensurable worldviews. Too
often the appeal to relationalism's debt to science or fundamental,
ancient ontologies is used to depoliticize its normative commitments.
However, the ambivalent relationship between relationalism's
cosmological and scientific origin stories ought to demand the inverse.
Rather than seeing relationality as an ethical exit from particularity
and the divisions in politics, it ought to insist upon both as the
beginning of inquiry.

While an ethics can be built within a relational ontology, it does not
necessarily follow from the ontological insights. After all, seals and
great white sharks are deeply relational and aware of each other, and
yet could not easily arrive at a common sense of the good. If any
interspecies consensus could be reached between predator and prey, it
would be minimal (maybe a consensus value on saving the ocean, for
instance) and not as a mere result of their relationality, which is
mostly characterized by teeth and blood. Could such a relationship be at
least free of violence? Even that seems far-fetched given the findings
of animal behaviorists that predators enjoy their hunt; killing for fun
has been observed in orcas, dolphins, and cats.

In fact, rather than say that relationality and violence are opposed, I
believe that the opposite claim can and should be made. If everything is
relational --- from our cells to our consciousness --- then certainly
violence is relational too. To go a step further, violence --- a
thoroughly human concept --- only distinguishes itself from force or
change because of the particular relationships of attention and intimacy
which make cruelty possible. What makes an earthquake tragic --- that
is, unavoidable and indebted to no misanthropy or purposive end --- is
precisely what makes an act of war violent. Malice, sadism, cruelty,
cultivated indifference --- all of these extra characteristics are what
change the ecological and political relations of actions such that they
are violent as opposed to something else.

[The]{.underline} second [error of many relational approaches is to
treat relations as a **metaphor**, or an **independent
substance**]{.underline}. [This is a **common error**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} network theories and [assemblage theories]{.underline}.
In both cases [relations are abstracted from the environment, resulting
in an image of]{.underline} "**[nodes]{.underline}**" [which fall back
into the original trap of **agents**]{.underline} --- that is, unified,
essential entities, independent of relations and surrounded by a "web"
of connectors. This image is often borrowed from the internet existence
we all live amidst. The vast series of "tubes" connecting things are
either thought of as an independent substance, like the wires and
fiberoptic cables of the network society, or as a kind of metaphor for
communication across the ether between nodes.

Either way, [treating relations as a]{.underline} "thing" [misses the
**entire point** of the ecological approach]{.underline}. [We are not
constituted by relations]{.underline}. [We **are
relations**]{.underline}. Or, more accurately, [everything is an
**unfolding** and **refolding** process of relations]{.underline}.
[There are no solid inputs or outputs]{.underline}. [All of life is
**origami**]{.underline}. The differences are in the folds, not the
substance. A relational approach does not study relations instead of
actors or instead of parts. A relational approach studies the folds and
processes that make differences, hence the ability to differentiate the
therapeutic cut of a scalpel to remove a gangrenous hand, the punitive
surgical removal of a hand because someone has been convicted of theft,
and the horror of having your hand blown off by an adversary trying to
kill you. Mechanistically they are all similar at one level, in that
they all involve pain, a missing hand, or another actor creating the
condition of losing a hand, a weapon, or a tool. At another level ---
that of the psycho-social economy, the chances of survival, the
character of the trauma, and the feelings of gratitude or revenge --- it
is the variability of the relations of the process which will be the
basis for creating these differences. This is what I mean by an
ecological approach. [There are not entities with relations; it is
relations **all the way down**.]{.underline}

For me, [relationalism is an **entry point** into the **complexities**
of **global violence**]{.underline} rather than an exit from or
prophylactic against it. Similarly, [the highly complex and dispersed
systems which make violence possible, from **breathable air** to
**enmity** to the **technological systems**]{.underline} [of enacting
violence on larger and larger scales, to the rich histories of
**national belonging**]{.underline} [as well as forms-of-life which form
the basis of legible differences, suggest to me that a relational
approach is **incredibly productive**]{.underline} [for studying such
the **variable** and **unstable arrangement** of the things that
constitute global orders]{.underline}. In what follows, I will present
one example of how a relational approach would alter our discussion and
research. The example focuses on nuclear weapons, particularly the
relationship between constitutional authority and command, and control
capability, which are often treated as completely separate questions. My
discussion of nuclear weapons command and control is not meant to offer
comprehensive accounts of the vast literatures on this question.
Instead, I want to show what kinds of questions or research might become
visible with a shift to a relational ontology and an ecological research
agenda.

### Alt --- Revolution

#### The alternative is a tactical ecological revolution against capitalism. When faced with "ruin or revolution" side with the ecological proletariat.

\(4\) Whatever one may think of his particular stance---which derives
from a view that we must now be prepared to consider using all the means
necessary to save the earth as a home for humanity---Malm has done the
movement a favor in How to **[[Blow Up a Pipeline]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(a work that is more reasonable than its provocative title suggests), by
[raising]{.underline} some of the most [difficult concrete issues of
**[tactics and militancy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Specifically, Malm asks
us to [consider to [what extent]{.mark} and in what ways the [climate
movement]{.mark} will [respond to]{.mark} the [violence]{.mark} of
ecocide/omnicide [with its own tactics]{.mark}, including [sabotage and
violence against property]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Nonviolent mass
protest]{.underline}]{.mark} is obviously to be
[[preferred]{.underline}]{.mark}. Still, we live [in the context of a
capitalist state,]{.underline} which defines itself in terms of a
self-referential system of law, [designed to protect and legitimize the
existing exploitative order and]{.underline}, as Max Weber stressed
(only a decade and a half before the rise of the Nazi regime), [confers
on itself "the monopoly of the legitimate use of force]{.underline}." It
often responds to threats to established authority with the use of force
and violence, including---where necessary to preserve the existing
property order---martial law/states of emergency and imperial war, which
today has become permanent. [There is a dialectic of violence in how the
system operates and through which it constitutes itself.]{.underline}

[[Sabotage]{.underline}]{.mark} (which of course derives etymologically
from the French sabot, wooden shoe, and from workers throwing shoes in
machines) [will [necessarily]{.mark} be [part of an ecological
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [so will [attacks on private
property]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} given that [the [owners
of]{.mark} the [means of production]{.mark}]{.underline} (the wealthy
and corporations) [are destroying the earth itself so as to expand their
financial holdings]{.underline}. Malm quotes Nelson Mandela, in the
struggle against Apartheid, in which he declared: "'[I called for
[non-violent]{.mark} protest [as long as it was effective']{.mark} as 'a
tactic that should be abandoned when it no longer worked.]{.underline}'"
It seems inevitable to me that as the stakes for humanity rise, more and
more people will inevitably take this general stance, recognizing that
human survival (as well as human freedom) is at issue. How could it be
otherwise, if the system refuses to respond to human needs to the point
of endangering human survival? I think Kim Stanley Robinson was quite
realistic in his recent novel The Ministry for the Future in making the
recourse to violent resistance by some revolutionary ecological groups
part of the mix and helping people develop a sympathetic understanding
of why and how this could happen, while not actually advocating it.

One example of a [tactic]{.underline} that I do support at present is
that [of the [valve turners]{.mark} in North America]{.underline}. On
October 11, 2016, five [climate activists [closed]{.mark} the [valves on
four]{.mark} of the [pipelines]{.mark} carrying tar sands oil from
Canada into the United States.]{.underline} A full [[**15 percent** of
U.S]{.mark}. crude [oil]{.mark}]{.underline} imports were [[closed down
for]{.mark} nearly [a day]{.mark}]{.underline}. To make sure worker
safety was not violated, a [call was made to each company's emergency
response]{.underline} around fifteen minutes [before the valve turners
entered]{.underline} the sites, giving the corporations plenty of time
to shut each pipeline down. The valve turners were [charged with
felonies, including criminal sabotage]{.underline}. They are being
defended by Lauren Regan, one of the foremost environmental and civil
rights lawyers in the United States, as well as an MR author. Regan and
her organization, the Civil Liberties Defense Council, where I am an
advisory board member, has relied, with considerable success, on
employing the necessity defense, not used for many years in U.S. law,
arguing that the valve turners had no choice, since their actions were
not only necessary but morally and legally justified in order to avoid
catastrophic harm to humanity and all life on Earth. Juries several
times refused to convict the valve turners, agreeing with their
necessity defense.

JM/OM: What do you think should be the [immediate [demands]{.mark},
goals, and tactics [of the]{.mark} climate
[movement]{.mark}]{.underline}?

JBF: This is a very big question. Since we have been talking already
about tactics, I will focus on demands and goals.

Clearly the goal, at a minimum, has [to be to [stay below]{.mark} a
[1.5°C]{.mark} increase]{.underline} in global average temperatures,
which is the most optimistic scenario of the IPCC, which will then, it
is hoped, allow a [[return to]{.mark} a [1.4°C]{.mark}]{.underline}
increase [[by the end of the century]{.underline}]{.mark} or into the
next century. This until 2040, as the IPPC says in its leaked Part III
report, however, [requires]{.underline} facing the fact that
[fundamental structural [change]{.mark} in the present [socioeconomic
system]{.mark}]{.underline} is needed and that [capitalism, as a system,
is "unsustainable]{.underline}." Here, the IPCC cites figures like
Hickel and Malm. The [only real hope]{.underline} in the years
immediately ahead, the leaked "Mitigation Report" suggests, [is
[low-energy strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can [[reduce
energy]{.mark} use [by 40 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}, while at the
same time [[improving]{.mark} the [human condition]{.mark}. It is
[this]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[not]{.mark} the
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, [which now cannot be introduced fast
enough.]{.underline} ([[Solar and wind]{.mark} account for [only 7
percent]{.mark} of total energy]{.underline} consumption worldwide at
present; [direct air capture and [Bioenergy and **C**]{.mark}arbon
**[C]{.mark}**apture and **[S]{.mark}**equestration [do not
exist]{.mark} on an adequate scale]{.underline} as technologies today;
[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} with all its attendant problems [[cannot
fill the gap]{.mark}, nor should it.)]{.underline} [[Negative
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the science tells us, are
[[necessary]{.mark} on a supplemental basis]{.underline}, if we are to
not break the climate budget, but this can be [achieved by improved
forestry, agricultural and soil methods, such as maintaining soil
organic matter, without geoengineering]{.underline}. Basically,
**[[humanity needs a quick transition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and this
can **[[only occur]{.mark} by the self-[mobilization]{.mark} of
populations and fundamental alterations in social
relations.]{.underline}**

**[Whatever way we look at it, it means an [ecological
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**, affecting social relations, [on a
scale [beyond anything humanity has ever seen]{.mark}
before]{.underline}---[**[or we will not make it]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
As Marx said **[[when confronted]{.mark} with the severe ecological
problems]{.underline}** in Ireland, **[[it is a question of "ruin or
revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Moreover, the [burden]{.underline}
in our time has to be [put]{.underline} primarily [on the rich
countries,]{.underline} since they are the ones that have used up most
of the global carbon budget, have higher per capita wealth, the highest
per capita energy consumption, the highest carbon footprints per capita,
and also monopolize much of the technology. The core [capitalist system
in the Global North is primarily responsible for most of the increases
in carbon dioxide accumulated]{.underline} in the atmosphere [since the
Industrial Revolution]{.underline}. Today, the bulk of worldwide carbon
dioxide emissions are concentrated in a few hundred global corporations
and military spending. All of this underscores that the rich capitalist
countries at the center of the world system owe an ecological debt to
the rest of the world. They thus have the main responsibility for fixing
the problem by bringing their economies more in line with the world
average energy consumption. This requires going against the logic of
capitalism in order to save the planet as a safe home for humanity.

[Part III of the [leaked IPCC report]{.mark} explicitly [supports
**climate strikes**]{.mark}, a [just **transition**, **environmental
justice, mass movements**]{.mark}, protecting the vulnerable, and
fundamental, "transformative change" in society]{.underline}. It says
**[no new coal-fired plants]{.underline}** can be started up from now on
and that all existing ones have to be eliminated in a decade; [sports
utilities have to go]{.underline}; we need "[new cities" that are not
engines of ecological destruction]{.underline}; [public
transportation]{.underline} has to be [expanded]{.underline};
[[pipelines]{.mark} have to be [removed]{.mark}]{.underline}; [fossil
fuels have to stay in the ground]{.underline}, made possible by
low-carbon pathways. Our whole production and consumption system has to
change and to do this people will have to change it, going against
corporations.

However, [mitigation itself is no longer enough]{.underline}, because
**[[catastrophe is at our doorsteps]{.underline}]{.mark}** at present,
even if we still have time to avoid the point of no return if we act
decisively enough and on a big enough scale. [Humanity needs to mitigate
the problem]{.underline}, that is, to [stop global heating and reach net
zero carbon emissions by 2050 (]{.underline}net zero is significant
because we no longer have the possibility of meeting the below-1.5°C or
even the below-2°C targets without negative emissions). But we are also
[facing the reality that]{.underline}, even in the most optimistic
scenario, [climate conditions will deteriorate for most of this
century]{.underline}. [We have to act to protect]{.underline} what Marx
called "[the chain of human generations]{.underline}," reconstituting
society on an ecosocialist basis---not just for the future, but also now
for the present. [This can help the cause of ecological
revolution]{.underline}, propelling people into action.

#### The alternative accelerates history -- this leads to a radical transformation of relations and cracks the class-power edifice

JM/OM: You often say, "it is ruin or revolution." What do you think that
revolution will look like, and how can and should we work toward
revolution today?

JBF: [A [revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}---as the cultural theorist
Jacob Burckhardt said in the nineteenth century---[[is an]{.mark}
enormous "[acceleration of history]{.mark}]{.underline}." The [[only way
to address capitalism's disruption]{.mark} of the ecological cycles of
the planet [is]{.mark} such an [acceleration]{.mark} of history, one [in
which humanity mobilizes on the largest scale possible, based on]{.mark}
a new [environmental proletariat]{.mark}, encompassing the full range of
material needs]{.underline} (environmental and economic, productive and
reproductive), [[aimed at]{.mark} the [**radical transformation**
of]{.mark} existing social **[relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
**[[creation of a socialist ecological society]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Such a [[movement]{.underline}]{.mark} will have to [[take place
globally]{.underline}]{.mark} and [at numerous levels]{.underline}, with
[[breaks within the existing order]{.underline}]{.mark} not simply at
the bottom, but [[cracking]{.mark} the **[entire class-power
edifice]{.mark}** and its political-economic hegemony]{.underline},
**[[reflecting]{.mark} that [this is an existential
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It will need [simultaneously to be a
**[cultural, ecological, social, and economic
revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In my 1994 book The Vulnerable
Planet, I argued that the economic impact on the earth due to capitalism
was accelerating to the point that the economy was now rivaling the
ecological cycles of the entire planet. In the second edition of the
book, in 1999, I argued that [the only answer was to accelerate history
beyond the current mode of production through a social and ecological
revolution]{.underline}---so as to **[[transcend]{.mark} the
accumulative society of [capitalism]{.mark} and [create a community with
the earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} The issues remain the same,
but [we are much further down the garden path.]{.underline}

#### There's a paradigm shift now towards the alt.

**[Change from below]{.underline}** Many [[analysts are taking notice
of]{.mark} this **[paradigm change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Paul
McCulley, a business professor at Georgetown, told the New York Times
earlier this week, "[Having the tools of economic stabilization work a
whole lot more **through the fiscal channel** and a whole lot less
through the monetary channel is a profound, **pro-democracy policy
mix**.]{.underline}" In plainer language: [[It's better to have
**elected representatives**]{.mark} rather [than **unelected
bankers**]{.mark} [making the call]{.mark} on how public money is
spent]{.underline}. Some media commentators are seeing the shift, but
they're missing the real reasons for why it's happening. Times opinion
writer Neil Irwin, for instance, characterizes it as a battle between
"pointy-headed technocrats" and lawmakers, or as the headline of his
article earlier this week put it, "Move over, nerds. It's the
politicians' economy now." Without the insights that come from a class
analysis of the situation, Irwin and other [commentators in the
bourgeois press continue to look only at the differences among those at
the top of society to explain social change]{.underline}. The truth,
however, is that [the [pressure]{.mark} now being applied to neoliberal
ideology [is]{.mark} the result of **[class struggle from
below]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the last recession, [[working-class
action has been]{.mark} **steadily [building]{.mark}** and **gaining
strength**]{.underline}. The [first sparks came in the [Occupy]{.mark}
Wall Street]{.underline} movement that emerged in the wake of the
financial crisis. There were the [two [Bernie]{.mark} Sanders
[campaigns]{.mark} for president as well as that of Elizabeth
[Warren]{.mark}, which [inserted **explicitly social democratic
demands**]{.mark} like Medicare for All into public
conversation]{.underline}. [The trade union movement has begun to
reverse its decades-long decline, with new organizing efforts like the
campaign by Alabama Amazon workers]{.underline} showing that more and
[more workers are looking to **collective action** as the way to improve
their lives]{.underline}. The [Black Lives Matter]{.underline} national
uprising, with its demand to defund policing and militarization and
redirect funds toward human needs, has melded together the fights to end
racism and economic inequality. Opinion polls have shown interest in
[the ideas of socialism **gaining steam** for several years
already]{.underline}, showing up also in the fact that [left-wing
organizations like Democratic Socialists of America and the Communist
Party USA have seen **explosive growth**]{.underline}. [The 2018 and
2020 [elections were]{.mark} **further [proof]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
the caucus of progressive legislators swelled. Bold women of color
leaders like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan
Omar, and Pramila Jayapal now lead the charge in Washington on
everything from the Green New Deal to the Fight for \$15 and more. The
mass death and destruction experienced in the past year because of
[coronavirus have only accelerated the trend of people questioning the
status quo and **looking for alternatives**]{.underline}. [[The pandemic
has **accelerated class struggle**]{.mark} trends that were already
becoming apparent]{.underline}. Increasingly, millions are questioning
capitalism, as shown by this message spray-painted onto a wall in
Toronto. \| C.J. Atkins / People's World [All [this]{.mark} simmering of
organized working-class activity and political
growth]{.underline}---[driven by the material conditions workers and
oppressed people]{.underline} find themselves living in---[[is having an
impact at the **national level** of **policy and
debate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Marxist terms, [changes in the
economic foundation of society are [affecting **mass
consciousness**]{.mark} and therefore prodding change in the
**superstructure**]{.underline}---[the legal, political, and
philosophical ideas of our times]{.underline}. [Old ideologies like
neoliberal capitalism are under pressure from new ones arising out of
class struggle]{.underline}. Those new ideas are not yet fully formed,
though, and the forces pushing them are not yet strong enough to assert
their power at all times. The new is still in conflict with the old, and
the outcomes are uneven. Allies (like politicians) will at times waver.
[Victories will be real, but incomplete]{.underline} (like the dropping
of the \$15 minimum wage from the ARA). [Defeats are not
unavoidable]{.underline}. As Frederick Engels wrote, "[History makes
itself in such a way that the final result always arises from
conflicts]{.underline}...there are innumerable intersecting forces." So
the American Rescue Plan, despite whatever we didn't get out of it, is a
big win for the working class. [The people have been demanding a change
in how our economy operates and whom it benefits]{.underline}.
**[[Organization and unity are making it
happen]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the 2020 election was proof of that as
well.

#### Conceded try-or-die framing de-fangs utopian fiat AND is an independent disad to the perm

All of this [may sound utopian]{.underline}, but [the [negative sense of
utopian]{.mark} as an ideal dream,]{.underline} reflecting the original
Latin meaning of nowhere that Thomas More played on, has [[no real
meaning in our time]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[nor can we afford to
dwell on dystopia]{.underline}]{.mark}**---when [the]{.underline} world
[[scientific consensus tells us]{.mark} that [we either make]{.mark}
fundamental, rapid, social-structural [change]{.mark} on a global basis
[or]{.mark}]{.underline} industrial civilization and [the future of
[humanity is crushed]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is [only human struggle
in an increasingly harsh environment]{.underline}, the [product of the
Capitalinian Age of the Anthropocene Epoch.]{.underline} The planetary
environment as a whole is rapidly changing around us as a result of the
system that we have created and there is no standing still. [None of our
existing social institutions will survive existing trends]{.underline},
which, if we [continue much longer]{.underline} on the present path
during this century, [will almost certainly]{.underline}, the world
scientific consensus suggests, [bring down industrial civilization
itself.]{.underline}

[Capitalism]{.underline} is rapidly carrying out environmental changes
that have already compromised the planet as a safe space for humanity
during this century. Its [famous creative destruction is now undermining
the earth itself.]{.underline} There is **[[no option left but
ecological revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which means simply that
[[the people]{.mark}, in their endless numbers, will once again be
[compelled to take history into their own hands]{.mark}, in a [struggle
that is]{.mark} likely to be [**stormy and chaotic**, but]{.mark} that
[will]{.mark} also [demonstrate]{.mark} the [power and endless
creativity]{.mark} of humanity, [offering]{.mark} the possibility of a
**[new ecological renaissance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There is no
guarantee, of course, that in such a struggle we will succeed. Marx once
said no attempt at world-historical change is ever undertaken on the
basis of infallible guarantees. [All that we know for certain, is that,
with whole generations seeing their future being stripped away, and
humanity's existence imperiled, [it is **inevitable**]{.mark} that
hundreds of millions of people, if not reaching into the [**billions,
will resist**, leading to]{.mark} what will undoubtedly be [the
greatest]{.mark} series of [revolts in history]{.mark}, taking place
[throughout the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can already see this in
the [[farmers' revolt]{.mark} in India]{.underline}, the [school
[climate strikes]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}, and the [battle over
[Standing Rock]{.mark} in North America]{.underline}. This points to a
[[new **environmental proletariat**]{.underline}]{.mark}, responding to
the material needs that are equally economic and ecological, productive
and reproductive. [It is there that [our hope]{.mark} [lies]{.mark}: the
creation of a whole new geological (and historical) age of the earth,
**[the Communian]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### Alt --- Quantum

#### The alternative is [quantum holography]{.underline}. That challenges the [tautological]{.underline} ontology of the Newtonian narrative.

Chengxin **Pan 20**, Faculty of Arts and Education, Deakin University,
Australia, 2020, "Enfolding wholes in parts: quantum holography and
International Relations," European Journal of International Relations
2020, Vol. 26(S1) 14--38

Despite its name, International Relations (IR) has long been predicated
on a Newtonian substantialist ontology of things, rather than an
ontology of relations, which are "the important missing dimension in
most theories of IR" (Wight, 2006: 296). In recent years, IR's "deep
Newtonian slumber" (Ruggie, 1998: 194) has been disturbed by a
"relational turn["]{.underline} (Bousquet and Curtis, 2011; Jackson and
Nexon, 1999; Kavalski, 2018; McClurg and Young, 2011; Neumann, 2013;
Nexon, 2010; Nordin et al., 2019; Nordin and Smith, 2018; Qin, 2018;
Shih, 2016; Trownsell et al., 2019). [[Challenging]{.mark} two versions
of]{.underline} [Newtonian substantialism]{.underline}:
**[atomism]{.underline}** (individualism) [[and
**structuralism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (structuralistsubstantialism)
(Zanotti, 2017; see also Wendt, 1999: 26), [[the gist]{.mark} of this
turn [is that the]{.mark} fundamental [**reality** is **not
independent** things]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Focusing on "a relation between
entities" (Jackson and Nexon, 2019: 584--585, emphases in original), the
relational scholarship also departs from the agent-structure and
level-of-analysis debates. Yet, [**[despite this]{.mark}**
significant]{.underline} and welcome development, [[**IR's relational
turn** suffers]{.mark} several **[drawbacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
First, [[it lacks a]{.mark} clear [**conception** of
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}/relationality [[beyond]{.mark} often
**[tautological definitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, [insisting
on the temporal priority of relations over entities]{.underline},
[[much]{.mark} of the literature [sidesteps an implicit]{.mark}
**["chicken-egg" dilemma]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between entities and
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Further [and]{.mark} more
importantly]{.underline}, [the relational turn [has
not]{.mark}]{.underline} yet [seriously [engaged
with]{.mark}]{.underline} another important development in the social
sciences in general and IR in particular, namely, [[the **"quantum
turn"**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Keeley, 2007; Wendt, 2015), or according
to Der Derian and Wendt (2020), [a permanent quantum
revolution]{.underline}. This neglect is both surprising and lamentable.
[Both turns share an anti-Newtonian stand]{.underline}, and as a
"momentous shift in metaphysical outlook" (Seager, 2018: 5), [[**quantum
mechanics** espouses]{.mark} a doctrine of **[relational
holism]{.mark}** "in an all pervasive way"]{.underline} (Teller, 1986:
71), [[which would make **quantum theory** a valuable
source]{.underline}]{.mark} in IR's relational quest. To be fair, at
least in the IR context the neglect seems mutual. With few exceptions
and some general references to relational ontology (e.g. Wendt, 2015;
Fierke, 2017; Zanotti, 2017), the burgeoning quantum turn literature in
IR has not focused extensively on relations either.
[Wendt's]{.underline} pioneering work on quantum theory, for example, is
[driven primarily by the need to "reconcile consciousness]{.underline}
and meaning [with the material world]{.underline}" (Wendt, 2006: 218),
though he acknowledges that quantum mechanics' holistic and relational
contribution is "a thematic that needs to be developed down the road"
(Wendt, 2015: 35). Therefore, [[the gap between these two]{.mark}
turns]{.underline} in IR [[calls for an explicit **quantum**]{.mark}
**relational [perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is what this
article sets out to do, [[by offering]{.underline}]{.mark}, more
specifically, **[[a]{.mark} quantum [holographic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The]{.mark} basic [notion of
**holography**]{.mark} is that an "object" is "**[part of the
whole]{.mark}** [while it]{.mark} simultaneously **[contains the
whole]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Van Daele, 2018: 651, emphases added).1
In quantum theory, [the holographic [principle promises]{.mark} a
solution]{.underline} to the well-known tensions [[between
**atomic-level**]{.mark} quantum physics [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
Albert [Einstein's [**planet-level** theory]{.mark} of gravity [by
suggesting]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the universe is a **holographic
[projection]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[what appears on]{.mark} the
surface]{.underline} (**[[event horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [of a
black hole [is **encoded information**]{.mark} [about **what is
inside**]{.mark},]{.underline} "just as a two-dimensional hologram
encodes a three-dimensional image" (Merali, 2013: 517). So far still
largely alien to this field (few exceptions include Pan, 2018; Wendt,
2015), quantum holography adds value to IR in several important ways.
First, [as a specific form of relationality]{.underline}, [quantum
holography helps mitigate the existing definitional vagueness about
relations]{.underline}. Second, instead of asserting relations' priority
over entities, quantum [[holography]{.mark} [accentuates
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**ontological [duality]{.mark}** [of
**relations** and **things**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Avoiding the
ontological chickenegg]{.underline} [dilemma]{.underline} over which
comes first, [[the]{.mark} duality [proposition suggests that]{.mark}
**[relations do not exist either before or after]{.mark}**

or embodied in things]{.underline}. Relations-in-things are implicate
relations that can be better understood through quantum mechanics,
whereas things-in-relations (and relations-between-things) represent
more classical understandings of relations as something external,
compositional, and derivative. Third, [**quantum [holography]{.mark}**

understanding of]{.mark} relations]{.underline}, [including
**[whole-part]{.mark} relations**]{.underline} [[and **internal

### Alt --- Transmedial Storytelling

#### Thus we affirm a methodology of transmedial storytelling -- an academic pedagogy that disrupts the linearity and universality of Western thought and travels across time and space to unearth the hidden histories of coloniality -- rather than invest in liberal techno-futurity we seek radical possibility by shifting our gaze to the past.

While the research on reader response has accounted for the ways that
[[colonial histories shape the present]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[there has
been]{.mark}, to date, [little exploration of the ways]{.mark} that
[reading practices]{.mark} can, at times, [keep us stuck in an affective
time warp]{.mark} -- that is, how the [past]{.mark} continually [merges
with the present and future in]{.mark} [potentially threatening
ways]{.mark}.]{.underline} We are especially interested in how
[**[transmedial]{.underline}** **[storytelling]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[might [function as]{.mark} a [relational and ethical process of
disruption]{.mark} in order [to make visible]{.mark} [that which "cannot
be easily seen in]{.mark} the [conventional]{.mark}
[methodological]{.mark} [sense]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Blackman, 2019,
p. 18). As such, [we explore literacies/reader responses as a queer form
of storytelling and time-travel: "not queer as in strange, but queer as
undoing, queer as 'trans/ formation'" (p. 247). Using the
postqualitative approach of thinking with theory (Jackson and Mazzei,
2012), we think with theories of affect -- specifically, cruel optimism
(Berlant, 2011) alongside transmediality (Blackman, 2019, p. 23) -- as
methodological and analytical tools.]{.underline} [Thinking with theory
is an embodied engagement that calls on researchers to read data through
particular theoretical lenses.]{.underline} While difficult to capture
with words (Jackson and Mazzei, 2012), [this process involves "poring
over the data, annotating, describing, linking, bringing theory to bear,
recalling what others have written and seeing things from different
angles]{.underline}" (MacLure, 2013, p. 174). [[Rather than
treating]{.mark} [data]{.mark} here [as]{.mark} a still [object]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [code, dissect]{.mark} and [examine]{.mark} for conclusive
patterns, **[we see it as agential matter]{.mark} [that calls forth
new]{.mark} and different [possibilities]{.mark}. In other words, the
ongoing and [open-endedness of thinking with]{.mark}
data/[theory]{.mark} [open us]{.mark} up [to multiple ways of engaging
with]{.mark} [literacy]{.mark} learning and instruction, [as well
as]{.mark} [different times and spaces]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Less
concerned, then, with representational fidelity (Dernikos, 2018;
Niccolini, 2016), we position [[transmedial]{.underline}
[storytelling]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a radical politics that invites
us to [consider moments within educational spaces as affective "scenes
of entanglement]{.mark}": "disjointed, emotional, bent and [other
wordly]{.mark}" (]{.underline}Blackman, 2019, p. 57) scenes that serve
[to [highlight]{.mark} the "[normalised" fantasies]{.mark} we have
created in terms of who counts as literate and what counts as proper
aesthetic responses to text which, in turn, become enmeshed with what
counts as proper personhood.]{.underline} According to Blackman (2019),
[science is a "storytelling machine" with the propensity to "sanitise,
excise or even exorcise narratives, actors, agents and
entities]{.underline}" (p. 41). This [machine furthers a dominant
narrative that not only decontextualises time and space, but also
affectively circulates to re/produce student bodies in myriad ways, for
example, as "struggling," "unsuccessful" and even learning
"disabled]{.underline}" (see e.g. Dernikos, 2018; Souto-Manning,
Dernikos, and Yu, 2016). As a larger destructive force, [it has the
potential to violently impact our capacity to read, write, think,
imagine and respond otherwise, thereby closing off other ways of
knowing, being and doing.]{.underline} Yet, as Blackman argues**[,
[there is always more than one story]{.mark} being told at a time, as
[any narrative is "multiplatform]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p. 19[): **[It
does not exist in one place]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, is [distributed
across time and space and]{.mark} is [enacted by multiple agents,
actors, agencies, entities and objects]{.mark} ... the history of
storytelling is one that is transmedial ...]{.underline}**
.**[[transmedial storytelling]{.mark} is a form of storytelling that
[sets in motion fugitive and fossilised times and]{.mark} that [allows
new visibilities to be shaped]{.mark}]{.underline}** ...(pp. 22, 51)
Through transmedial storytelling, we **[[seek to unearth the dominant
stories]{.mark} that are [often held as truths]{.mark} so as [to create
moments of possibilities]{.mark}, or different narratives, [that]{.mark}
"[enliven]{.mark} rather than report, to render rather than represent,
to resonate rather than validate, to [rupture]{.mark} and
[reimagine]{.mark} rather than to faithfully describe"]{.underline}**
(Vannini, 2015, p. 15). In this way, [we think with data/theories of
affect as "scenes of entanglement" (]{.underline}Blackman, 2019, p. 23)
so as to [reimagine standardised understandings and taken for granted
notions of what it means to be successfully literate]{.underline}. The
data that we explore here derived from a larger 6-month post/
qualitative study examining the affective encounters that impacted the
making of first grade students as "un/successful" readers (see Dernikos,
2015, 2018). As we share these scenes of entanglement, we offer a
glimpse of two young people who are considered "good" readers and
explore the affective potentialities that social, political and economic
forces unknowingly impose on their reading lives.

#### Reject the techno-liberal dream of the resolution \-- we take refuge in forgotten narratives, venture into the affective terrain of the unknown and the unseen, in order to create decolonial futures.

Since [most of us have been conditioned to think of literacy as "power,"
a "state of grace", or a necessary skill needed to function in the
modern world]{.underline} (Scribner, 1984, p.8), it might seem odd to
think about [literacy as a problematic object of attachment]{.underline}
-- as cruelly optimistic. Yet here we are. It is clear in the case of
both Carl and Beth that being a "good" reader comes with fraught
decisions and the ability to navigate relations of attachment that are
either "impossible, sheer fantasy, or too possible, and toxic" (Berlant,
2011, p. 24). Take reading standards. They are supposed to be helpful,
fill in gaps and open a world of possibilities, but for both Carl and
Beth --both considered "good" readers-- these standards produced
something else, something cruel. According to Ahmed (2011), forces mold
and shape us, where any given moment can be impressive and/ or
oppressive. But interestingly enough, this pressing -- in whatever form
it takes -- is often meant as good will. Perhaps this is what is most
cruel (Berlant, 2006) about mainstream literacy policies/practices and
national efforts to standardise literacy education -- they are actually
meant to help students, like Carl and Beth, achieve [the [dream of a
"good]{.mark}" or "better [life]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Jones and Vagle,
2013). However, this promise [[will never be achieved if we
ignore]{.mark} the precarities of the past:]{.underline} **[The
[aftermath of colonialism and]{.mark} the [ways]{.mark} our
[reading]{.mark} [practices]{.mark} [are shaped in relation to other
times, spaces, people and places]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sharpe, 2016).
[As literacy educators and researchers committed to other ways of
knowing/being/doing]{.underline}, **[[transmedial storytelling]{.mark}
helps us to [mediate]{.mark} "[possible (lost) futures in the
present]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Blackman, 2019, p. 53). **[Mediating
[disrupts]{.mark} the [rigid normativity of dominant stories that keep
us affectively stuck in time(s]{.mark}).]{.underline}** That said, our
intent here is not to forward a prescriptive approach to literacy, as we
imagine engaging in [[transmedial storytelling involves zigzagging
unknowable pedagogical terrain,]{.mark} thereby [opening up]{.mark}
multiple [possibilities for practice]{.mark} and for bodies read as
un/successful.]{.underline} We would, nevertheless, like to offer the
following questions as provocations for educators to consider so that
things might be otherwise (see also Dernikos, 2018; Thiel and Kuby,
2019): • In [[what ways do affective forces]{.mark} (social, political,
economic, racial, gendered, etc.) [shape]{.mark} and re/orient
[pedagogical acts]{.mark}?]{.underline} • **[[What hidden histories are
lodged in the present]{.mark} to make certain identities im/possible for
students]{.underline}**, both as literacy learners and human beings?3 •
[What do certain literacy pedagogies produce? Who do they
serve]{.underline} -- at what cost and to whom? • **[[How can
transmedial storytelling guide curricular choices]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--e.g. by inviting educators to expand their idea of the classics (see
also Dernikos, 2018; McNair, 2010) so as to embrace literature written
by and about people from varied racial and ethnic backgrounds?4 •
**[[How]{.mark} else [might literacy and teaching be practiced]{.mark}
if we remember literacy [as affective
time-traveling?]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Questions]{.mark} like these
pro[vide small openings for displaced, devalued]{.mark} and/[or]{.mark}
simply [forgotten narratives]{.mark} and possibilities [to
unfold]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Attending to affect, then, reminds us
that [matter is not only lively but also historical; this [historicity
makes time-travel possible by]{.mark} [displacing]{.mark} the [binary
logic that strictly separates]{.mark} the [past, present and
future.]{.mark}]{.underline} In other words, **[[transmedial
storytelling "sets in motion fugitive and fossilised times ... that
allow\[s\] new visibilities to be shaped]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (p. 51)
and offers different insights into literacy practices. As Beth's scene
of entanglement teaches us, engaging in critical literacy practices by
simply introducing a book with diverse characters is not enough. [We
must also address the larger affective forces (e.g. social, historical,
political and economic) that shape children's interpretative responses
to literature in both expected and unexpected ways.]{.underline}
Ultimately, [attachments to happy objects]{.underline} such as
fairytales often operated to compromise Ms. Rizzo's students, while at
the same time, [[promisi]{.mark}ng [to help]{.mark} them become
successfully [literate bodies]{.mark} who can [have "the good life" if
they]{.mark} just [follow the rules]{.mark}.]{.underline} But for Carl,
Beth and other young people in this first grade classroom, learning to
read was, [in large part, [tied to]{.mark}]{.underline} Core Knowledge
read alouds and the kinds of information that presumably made for a
"culturally literate" somebody: [a [subject]{.mark} [aligned
with]{.mark} a "[White \[middle class\] and heterosexually]{.mark}
[normative narrative]{.mark} of the world"]{.underline} (Muñoz, 2000, p.
75). The problem is, as Carl suggested, that [this narrative of the
world is in direct opposition to the social worlds these young children
lived and breathed]{.underline}. The [hope, then, or promise of a
happier "better life" inevitably begins to crumble as happy objects
cling to other relational forces (e.g., gender, sexuality, race and
heteronormativity) that work to limit capacities to think and feel
differently -- to move throughout the social in cruelly optimistic
ways.]{.underline} We call on educators to recognise that standardised
literacy policies (such as Common Core), practices and
**[[pedagogies]{.mark} often [cruelly privilege colonial
histories]{.mark} and dominant narratives circulating within classroom
spaces -- impacting students in ways we may not even be aware.
[Transmedial storytelling]{.mark} offers possibilities to not only
notice but also [unsettle these histories]{.mark} and narratives. And
while [histories cannot be erased, futures are yet to be
written]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Relations at the University of Sydney; *International Relations and the
Challenge of Postmodernism*, *University of South Carolina Press*,
"Continental Drift," p. 128-129\]

More is the pity that such irrational and obviously abstruse debate
should so occupy us at a time of great global turmoil. That it does and
continues to do so reflect our lack of judicious criteria for evaluating
theory and, more importantly, the lack of attachment theorists have to
the real world. Certainly, it is right and proper that we ponder the
depths of our theoretical imaginations, engage in
**[[epistemological]{.mark} and ontological
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and analyze the sociology of our
knowledge. But [to support]{.underline} that [this is the **only task**
of international theory]{.underline}, let alone the most important one,
[[smacks of]{.mark} **intellectual [elitism]{.mark}** [and
displays]{.mark}]{.underline} a certain [[**contempt** for
those]{.mark}]{.underline} who search for guidance [[in]{.mark} their
[]{.mark}**daily [struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline} as actors in
international politics. [[What do]{.mark}es Ashley's
project]{.underline}, [his **deconstructive
[efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or valiant fight against positivism
[[say to the]{.underline}]{.mark} truly marginalized,
**[[oppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and destitute[[**?** How does it

[speak]{.mark}** [to those who]{.mark}se actions]{.underline} and
thoughts [[comprise]{.mark} the **[policy]{.mark} and
practice**]{.underline} of international relations?

On all these questions one must answer **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This is not to say, of course, that all theory should be judged by its
technical rationality and problem-solving capacity as Ashley forcefully
argues. But [[to support that **problem-solving**]{.underline}]{.mark}
technical [[theory is]{.underline}]{.mark} not necessary---or in some
way [[bad---is a]{.mark} **contemptuous [position]{.mark}** [that
**abrogates** any **hope**]{.mark} **of [solving]{.mark}**]{.underline}
some of the [**nightmarish [realities]{.mark}** [that **millions

of these theorists and their theories the ultimate question, "So what?"
To what purpose do they deconstruct, problematize, destabilize,
undermine, ridicule, and belittle modernist and rationalist approaches?
Does this get us any further, make the world any better, or enhance the
human condition? [[In what sense can]{.mark} this ["debate toward

### FW --- Fiat Good

#### Fiat is [good]{.underline} --- foreign policy [simulations]{.underline} teach students how [allies and adversaries]{.underline} respond to [U.S. policy]{.underline} --- fosters [ideological reflexivity]{.underline}, accurate [policy prediction]{.underline}, and [argumentative agency]{.underline}.

**Esberg and Sagan '12** \[Jane and Scott; 2012; Special assistant to

Cooperation; Professor of Political Science and Director of Stanford\'s

These [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} or quasi-government think tank
[**[simulations]{.mark}** often [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} very
similar [[**lessons** for]{.underline}]{.mark} high-level players as are
learned by **[[students]{.underline}]{.mark}** in educational
simulations. Government [[participants learn]{.mark} about [the
**importance** of]{.mark} **understanding [foreign
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the need to practice internal
coordination, [[and the **necessity** to **compromise**]{.mark} **and
coordinate**]{.underline} with other governments in negotiations and
crises. During the Cold War, political scientist Robert Mandel noted how
**[crisis [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}** and war games
[[forced]{.underline}]{.mark} government officials to overcome
''bureaucratic myopia,'' moving beyond their normal organizational roles
and thinking more creatively about how others might react in a crisis or
conflict. [The **skills of [imagination]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
subsequent [ability to predict]{.mark} **foreign interests and
[reactions]{.mark}** [remain critical for]{.mark} **real-world foreign
[policy makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, simulations of the
Iranian nuclear crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings
Institution's Saban Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center,
and involving former US senior officials and regional
experts\*highlighted the dangers of misunderstanding foreign
governments' preferences and misinterpreting their subsequent behavior.
In both simulations, the primary criticism of the US negotiating team
lay in a failure [[to **predict**]{.mark} **accuratel[y]{.mark}**
[how]{.mark} **other [states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both
[**[allies]{.mark} and adversaries**[, would behave **in response** to
**US policy**]{.mark} **initiatives**.]{.underline}

[[By **university**]{.mark} **age**[, students]{.mark}]{.underline}
often [[have a]{.mark} **pre-defined [view]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**international [affairs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the literature on
simulations in education has long emphasized how such [[exercises
**force students** to challenge]{.mark} **their [assumptions]{.mark}**
[about how]{.mark} other [governments **behave** and]{.mark} how their
own government [work]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Since simulations became
more common as a teaching tool in the late 1950s, educational literature
has expounded on their benefits, from encouraging engagement by breaking
from the typical lecture format, to improving communication skills, to
promoting teamwork. More broadly, [**[simulations]{.mark}** can [deepen
**understanding** by asking **students** to link **fact and
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}, providing a context for facts while
bringing theory into the realm of practice. These exercises are
particularly valuable in teaching international affairs for many of the
same reasons they are useful for policy makers: [they force
**[participants]{.mark}** to [''grapple with]{.mark} the issues arising
from **[a world in flux.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Simulations have been
used successfully to teach students about such disparate topics as
European politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US response to the mass
killings in Darfur. Role-playing [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}
certainly [[encourage **students** to learn **political**]{.mark} **and
technical [facts]{.mark}**]{.underline}\* but they learn them [[in
a]{.mark} **more [active style]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rather than
sitting in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, [students
actively research]{.underline} ''their'' government's positions
[and]{.underline} actively [argue]{.underline}, brief, and negotiate
with others. Acts can change quickly; [[**simulations** teach]{.mark}
students [how to]{.mark} **contextualize and [act]{.mark}** [on
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.

#### Fiat teaches empathy.

**Craps '12** \[Steph; 2012; Professor of English at Ghent University,
Director of Centre for Literature and Trauma; *Postcolonial Witnessing:
Trauma Out of Bounds*, *Palgrave*, "Conclusion," p. 126-127; GR\]

Cogent though these various critiques are in their own terms, it seems
to me that they unduly homogenize and simplify different forms of
interest in and inquiry into trauma. While it is true, of course, that
trauma research does not in and of itself lead to political
transformation, I would argue that a **[[trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**
theory revised along the lines I have suggested [[is not]{.mark}
destined to serve as the handmaiden of the status quo or [a]{.mark} mere
academic [**alibi** for]{.mark} the indulgence of **[voyeuristic
inclinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[it can]{.mark}
help identify and [understand]{.mark} situations of
**[exploitation]{.mark} and abuse**[, and act as]{.mark} an
[**incentive** for]{.mark} the kind of sustained and systemic [critique
of]{.mark} **societal [conditions]{.mark}** called for by Berlant and
Brown]{.underline}. In fact, [the expanded **model of [trauma]{.mark}**
I have proposed, [based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the work of Laura Brown,
Frantz [**[Fanon]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} others, bears a close
resemblance to the model of suffering that [Berlant [puts
forward]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[an
**alt**]{.mark}**ernative**]{.underline} to the (traditional) trauma
model, which she finds inadequate: \"[a model of suffering, whose
etymological [articulation of **pain**]{.mark} and patience [draws its
**subject** less as an **effect** of]{.mark} an act of [**violence** and
more as]{.mark} an effect of [a]{.mark} **general [atmosphere]{.mark}**
[of it, peppered by **acts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to be sure, but not
contained by the presumption that trauma carries, that it is an effect
of a single scene of violence or toxic taxonomy\" (338). Berlant\'s
observation that \"the pain and suffering of subordinated subjects in
everyday life is an ordinary and ongoing thing that is underdescribed by
the (traumatic) identity form and its circulation in the state and the
law\" (344) is perfectly in line with the argument I have presented in
this book.

[That **trauma [research]{.mark}** [can act as a **catalyst**
for]{.mark} astute **[political]{.mark} analysis** and **meaningful
[activism]{.mark}**]{.underline} would seem to be borne out by the \[END
PAGE 126\] development in Fanon\'s writing, from Black Skin, White
Masks, which describes the psychological impact of racial and colonial
oppression, to the overtly political The Wretched of the Earth, which
confronts the source of the mental strife he saw in the clinic.3 Since
Douglas Crimp\'s plea for \"\[m\]ilitancy, of course, then, but mourning
too: mourning and militancy\" (18) in relation to the AIDS movement back
in 1989, several scholars have argued that an interest in issues of
[trauma, loss, and mourning is in fact compatible with a commitment to
radical activism. A desire [to make **visible** the]{.mark} creative and
[**political**-rather than **pathological**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
negative-aspects of an [**attachment** to loss]{.mark}]{.underline} is
the thread that binds together the essays gathered in David Eng and
David Kazanjian\'s volume Loss: The Politics of Mourning (2003), which
seeks to \"extend\[\] recent scholarship in trauma studies by insisting
that ruptures of experience, witnessing, history, and truth are, indeed,
a starting point for political activism and transformation\" (10). Eng
and Kazanjian see their collection as moving \"from trauma to prophecy,
and from epistemological structures of unknowability to the politics of
mourning\" (10). As one of the contributors, Ann Cvetkovich, puts it,
[trauma can be \"the provocation [to create]{.mark} **alternative
[lifeworld's]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (\"Legacies of Trauma\" 453).

[Recognition of suffering serves as [a]{.mark} **necessary first
[step]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}wards the [amelioration]{.mark} of that
suffering]{.underline}. In Judith Butler\'s words, \"The recognition of
[**shared [precariousness]{.mark}** [introduces]{.mark} strong
[normative]{.mark} commitments of [equality]{.mark} and invites a more
robust universalizing of rights that seeks [to address basic]{.mark}
**human [needs]{.mark}**]{.underline} for food, shelter, and other
conditions for persisting and flourishing\" (28-29). Without wishing to
overstate its likely impact, I believe that rethinking trauma studies
from a postcolonial perspective and providing nuanced readings of a wide
variety of narratives of trauma and witnessing from around the world can
help us understand that shared precariousness. By fostering attunement
to previously unheard suffering and putting into global circulation
memories of a broad range of traumatic histories, an inclusive and
culturally sensitive trauma theory can assist in [raising awareness of
injustice]{.underline} both past and present [and opening up the
possibility of a more just global future]{.underline}-and, in so doing,
remain faithful to the ethical foundations of the field.5

### FW --- Scenario Planning

#### Scenario planning is good -- a model of dialectical negation enables the transcendence of entrenched political ideologies and trains debaters to imagine radical alternative worlds guided by pragmatic strategy -- their author concedes we're right.

**Ossewaarde '17** \-- Associate professor in governance, society and
technology, University of Twente (Marinus Ossewaarde, 7-21-2017,
"Unmasking scenario planning: The colonization of the future in the
'Local Governments of the Future' program", Futures, Volume 93, pg.
80-88, <http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.futures.2017.07.003>, accessed
7-4-2022) \-- nikki

[Scenario planning can be understood as a dialogical enterprise or
'dialectical negotiation']{.underline} (Bowman 2016: 90). It therefore
[involves the 'art of friendly dispute' or 'clash of minds', which in
turn enables the critique, negation, and transcendence of established
ideologies, imaginaries and frames that determine the present and
future. Scenario planning is a quest for alternative]{.underline}, still
to be decided, [open futures, in which different understandings of the
world are reconciled]{.underline} through compromises. Chosen courses of
actions informed by various (conflicting) possible scenarios reflect
such compromises. As Habegger (2010: 51) emphasizes, in scenario
planning 'there is no such thing as "the future".' [Clashes between
ideologies, imaginaries and frames, accordingly, are not problems a
scenario planning must get rid of; instead, they must be embraced as a
sine qua non for advancing the knowledge of futures, if only because
such contradictions or different intellectual orientations increase the
awareness of possible future worlds]{.underline} (cf. Mannheim 1954:
241). [There is no one necessary or inevitable path to one future. A
scenario planning is a dialectical process involving the creative quest
for futures]{.underline} (Barber 1998). Contemporary scholars therefore
draw a parallel between scenario planning and the writing of futuristic
stories (Korte and Chermack 2007). Science fiction, for instance, is
widely recognized as a valuable asset for envisioning undetermined or
undecided futures and stimulating utopian (or, dystopian) enquiries
(Birtchnell and Urry 2013). Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George
Orwell's 1984 are examples of literary works that provide the
imaginative component of scenario planning (cf. Schulz, 2015: 133). The
purpose of scenario planning is, of course, not to produce science
fiction-like stories as such; 'scenarios are far more than stories'
(Chermack and Coons 2015: 189). Instead, [scenario planning generates
scenarios that are not simply linear extrapolations of the present. It
involves reckoning with -- imagining -- unpredictable or possible
events. The resulting scenarios, in turn, entail and demand a wide range
of policies hitherto unheard of]{.underline} (Volkery and Ribeiro 2009;
Habegger 2010[). The imaginative part of scenario planning is therefore
intimately connected to world-making, to decisions and strategic
actions, which are directed to changing the course of
history]{.underline} (Korte and Chermack 2007; MacKay and McKiernan
2010; Amer, Daim and Jetter 2013). Along this line, [scenario planning
always involves and requires (1) new imagination of future worlds, (2)
debate about alternative futures, and (3) the creation of manoeuvring
room for strategic actions that correspond to different
scenarios]{.underline} (Chermack 2004; Korte and Chermack 2007; Volkery
and Ribeiro 2009). The imagination of future worlds is enabled by
literary methods that evoke distrust of fixed images and iconic
representations (Shapiro 2016). Hence, parables, the articulation of
paradoxes, allegories, symbolisms, and metaphors make it possible to
understand and reckon with ambiguous, elusive, or latent (not yet fully
manifest) phenomena in scenario planning (Levine 1985: 29; 218).
Literary methods, and writers (poets in particular) can inspire truly
new insights and strengthen the belief in different possible worlds,
past, present and future. In other words, in these works, the reader
comes to the realization that what is, or what has passed, could have
been different; or what possibilities have been missed (MacKay and
McKiernan 2010; Dufva and Ahlqvist 2015; Shapiro 2016). From such
literary angle[, futures unfold when events -- which may be the results
of strategic decisions -- rupture ongoing trends and disrupt established
patterns.]{.underline} In contrast with trends, events happen suddenly
and can evoke shocks (MacKay and McKiernan 2010; Schulz 2015). A
scenario planning has to include the possibility of such surprising
historical moments through organizing so-called 'what if' scenarios, and
must, accordingly, be organized in 'an atmosphere detached from daily
routines' (Dufva and Ahlqvist 2015: 265). In this way, the enthusiasm
for and openness to unexpected events, for ungrounding the present and
the emergence of newness and radical transformations, is not stifled.
[The imagination of futures beyond current trends require a particular
kind of radicalism from participants in the scenario planning process,
namely, the transcendence of their current assumptions regarding the
world.]{.underline} In other words, their capacity to invent new futures
depends on their willingness and capacity to critically re-examine what
they conceptualized as trends that would continue into the future
(Chermack 2004; Korte and Chermack 2007; Van Wijck and Niemeijer 2016;
Bowman 2016). They must, accordingly, abandon any pretence of knowing
the 'laws' of the world, thereby leaving open the possibility that the
world might have been very different if other power constellations had
been in place. Concretely, [such attitude requires giving up biases,
dogmas, ideological distortions, and compulsive identifications with a
particular (well-known) order, stereotypes, and clichés. Indeed, it is
only through the critique, negation and transcendence of established
conceptual frameworks, practices and current policies that it is
possible to generate new ways of seeing the world, and hence to envision
alternative worlds (]{.underline}Amer, Daim and Jetter 2013).
Ideological discourses freeze (reify) established patterns (typically
described as 'progress,' 'development,' or 'transformation') and obscure
ambiguities. Scenario planning results in increased scope for strategic
action to realize undetermined possible futures. Though it tends to
limit itself to descriptions of alternative futures (Amer, Daim and
Jetter 2013; Van Wijck and Niemeijer 2016; O'Brien 2016), without
prescriptive claims, it is a powerful instrument that can serve or
undermine democracy and its future (Barber 1998). Its liberating
potential depends on the range of different accounts of the world and of
possible future worlds that is taken into account during the process.
The exclusion of alternative images of the future on the basis of
current assumptions and beliefs -- for instance, the salvation of the
world lies in technology -- from scenario planning makes the latter a
sham. Since the inclusion of conflicting worldviews is the hallmark of
democracy, [a pseudo-scenario planning that presumes and legitimizes one
desirable future clearly undermines the democratic ideal of debate or of
the publics]{.underline} (cf. Ravetz, 2011).

[[Every policy is a **prediction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Tax

[[Sanctions]{.mark} will [slow Iran's nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Travel bans will limit]{.mark} the
**spread of [COVID]{.mark}-19**]{.underline}. These [[claims all posit a
**causal relationship**]{.mark} between **means** and
**ends**]{.underline}. Regardless of party, ideology, or motive, no
policymaker wants ~~his or her~~ \[their\] recommended course of action
to produce unanticipated consequences. This makes [[every policymaker a
**forecaster**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [But forecasting is
difficult]{.underline}, [[particularly when it comes to
**geopolitics**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a domain in which the rules of
the game are poorly understood, information is invariably incomplete,
and expertise often confers surprisingly little advantage in predicting
future events.

These challenges present practical problems for decision-makers in the
U.S. government. On the one hand, the limits of imagination create blind
spots that policymakers tend to fill in with past experience. They often
assume that tomorrow's dangers will look like yesterday's, retaining the
same mental map even as the territory around them changes dramatically.
On the other hand, if policymakers addressed all imaginable threats, the
United States would need so large and expensive a national security
establishment that the country could do little else. By many measures,
it is nearing this point already. The United States has military bases
in more than 70 countries and territories, boasts more than four million
federal employees with security clearances, and fields 1.3 million
active-duty troops, with another million in reserve. According to one
estimate, the United States spends \$1.25 trillion annually on national
security. When it comes to anticipating the future, then, the United
States is getting the worst of both worlds. It spends untold sums of
money preparing yet still finds itself the victim of surprise ---
fundamentally ill equipped for defining events, such as the emergence of
COVID-19.

There is a [[better way]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that would [allow the
United States [to make decisions based not on **simplistic
extrapolations**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the past [[but]{.mark} on
**smart [estimates]{.mark}** [of the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} reconciling two approaches often seen to
be at philosophical loggerheads: [[**scenario planning** and
**probabilistic forecasting**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each approach has a
fundamentally different assumption about the future. Scenario planners
maintain that there are so many possible futures that one can imagine
them only in terms of plausibility, not probability. By contrast,
forecasters believe it is possible to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes, thereby transforming amorphous uncertainty into quantifiable
risk. Because each method has its strengths, the [optimal
approach]{.underline} is [to **combine them**]{.underline}. This
**[[holistic method]{.underline}]{.mark}** would [[provide policymakers
with]{.underline}]{.mark} both a [[range of **conceivable futures**
and]{.mark} regular updates as to [which]{.mark}]{.underline} one [[is
likely to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. For once, they could
[make]{.underline} shrewd [bets about tomorrow]{.underline},
[today]{.underline}.

PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTY

Although widely used in business today, the first element of this duo
--- [[scenario planning]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grew out
of]{.underline}]{.mark} post--World War II national security concerns,
specifically the [**overwhelming [uncertainty]{.mark}** of the nuclear
revolution]{.underline}. Previously, martial experience was thought to
offer some guidance through the fog of war. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, however, [presented a novel problem]{.underline}.
With the newfound ability to destroy each other as functioning societies
in a matter of minutes or hours, the United States and the Soviet Union
[faced an **unprecedented situation**]{.underline}. And unprecedented
situations are, by definition, uncertain. They lack any analogy to the
past that would allow decision-makers to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes.

Still, early U.S. efforts at nuclear-war planning sought to turn that
problem into a calculable one. During World War II, the Allies had great
success with the new field of operations research, the application of
statistical methods to improve the outcome of tactical engagements.
After the war, the RAND Corporation --- a "think factory" that the U.S.
Air Force established as a repository for leading researchers --- hoped
to parlay this success into a new, more rational approach to war, based
less on the intuition of generals and more on the quantification
afforded by models and data.

Unfortunately, methods that worked at the tactical level proved nearly
farcical at the strategic level. As the historian David Jardini has
chronicled, RAND's first attempt to model a nuclear strategy ignored so
many key variables that it nonsensically called for deploying a fleet of
aging turboprop bombers that carried no bombs because the United States
did not have enough fissile material to arm them; the goal was simply to
overwhelm Soviet air defenses, with no regard for the lives of the
pilots. In the wake of such failures, it became clear that [[analysts
could not]{.mark} **entirely [banish]{.mark}**
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1960, even Charles Hitch, a man
predisposed to calculation by dint of being RAND's top economist and
president of what was then the Operations Research Society of America,
cautioned, "[No other characteristic of decision-making is as
**pervasive** as uncertainty]{.underline}."

That, of course, [[raised]{.mark} the [question of how to formulate
**sensible strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unexpectedly, it was a RAND
mathematician and physicist, Herman Kahn, who offered an answer. If the
lived past could not shape strategy, perhaps [[the **imagined
future**]{.mark} could]{.underline}. Frustrated with RAND's attempts to
scientize war, Kahn devoted himself to [[crafting
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} in the pursuit of "ersatz experience"
that would [[prepare the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [for the
future through]{.mark}]{.underline} what were essentially [[thought
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[scenarios
as]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[artificial]{.underline}]{.mark} '[case
histories]{.underline}' [and]{.underline} '[historical
[anecdotes]{.mark}]{.underline},'" Kahn wrote, thus [[making up
for]{.mark} a [lack of **actual examples** or]{.mark} **meaningful
[data]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They would [provide analogies where there
were none]{.underline}.

Early methods of generating scenarios were often freewheeling and
discursive. But after scenario planning migrated to the business world,
it took on more structured forms. The most recognizable is a two-by-two
matrix in which planners identify two critical uncertainties and, taking
the extreme values of each, construct four possible future worlds.
Regardless of the specific shape they take, [**[rigorous
scenario-planning]{.mark}** exercises]{.underline} all involve
[[identifying key **uncertainties** and]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[imagining]{.mark} how [different combinations]{.mark}]{.underline}
could [[yield situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[vastly
different from]{.underline}]{.mark} what [**[mere
extrapolation]{.mark}** of the present]{.underline} would suggest. By
then "backcasting" --- taking one of these imagined futures as a given
and asking what conditions produced it --- [scenario planners
[derive]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[a **story** and a
**system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They come up with a plausible narrative
of how a future happened and an internal logic that describes how it
operates. [[Scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} are not supposed to be
predictive. They are meant to be provocative, [[challenging]{.mark}
**planners' [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[shaking]{.underline}]{.mark} up their [**mental [models]{.mark}** [of
how the world works]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[giving
them]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cognitive flexibility to better
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[shape]{.mark}, [and adapt to the]{.mark}
**emerging [future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The pandemic has occasioned a renaissance in the use of scenarios, as
organizations from think tanks to technology companies grapple with the
question of what a "new normal" might look like and how soon it might
arrive. But the national security community has long used scenarios to
address some of its most wicked problems --- particularly high-stakes
issues that are in flux, such as the U.S.-Chinese relationship. This
past summer, RAND released a report on Chinese grand strategy. It
concluded with four scenarios that offered brief vignettes of China's
possible place in the world 30 years from now. "Triumphant China"
dominates the world stage in most domains, with a modern military and an
innovative economy. "Ascendant China" is the preeminent power not only
in Asia but in other regions, as well. "Stagnant China" has suffered
from low growth and faces social unrest. And "Imploding China"
experiences a crisis of existential proportions, in which domestic
instability undercuts the country's international influence.

Although comprehensive, the wide range of these scenarios highlights the
chief challenge of the method: If China's potential futures encompass
rise, fall, and everything in between, how can they aid in the
formulation of strategy and policy? Although this cornucopia of
scenarios could lead policymakers to develop strategies that would
improve the United States' position no matter which future comes to
pass, in practice, having too many different versions of the future can
make it nearly impossible to act. [**Good [scenario planning]{.mark}**
[puts boundaries on the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, but those limits
are often not enough [[for **decision-makers** to work
with]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} need to [[know
which future is **most likely**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[TURNING **UNCERTAINTY** INTO **RISK**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the second element
of the duo --- tries to [[address]{.mark} that
**[shortcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forecasters see scenario
planning as]{.underline} maddeningly vague or, worse, [dangerously
misleading]{.underline}. They not only point to the lack of consistent
evidence to support the alleged benefits of scenario planning; they also
argue that the compelling nature of a good story can trigger a host of
biases. Such biases fuel irrationality, in part by tricking
decision-makers into making basic statistical errors. For example, even
though a detailed narrative may seem more plausible than a sparse one,
every contingent event decreases the likelihood that a given scenario
will actually transpire. Nevertheless, people frequently confuse
plausibility for probability, assigning greater likelihood to specific
stories that have the ring of truth. They might, illogically, consider a
war with China triggered by a clash in the Taiwan Strait more likely
than a war with China triggered by any possible cause.

In contrast to scenario planning's emphasis on imagination, forecasting
tends to rely on calculation. Deductive approaches use models or laws
that describe the behavior of a system to predict its future state, much
like Newtonian mechanics allows astronomers to anticipate the position
of the planets. Inductive approaches do not require such understanding,
merely enough data and the assumption that the future will in some way
reflect the past. This is how Netflix anticipates what you might like to
watch or Amazon what you might want to buy, based purely on your
previous actions. Increasingly, thanks to advances in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, analysts use hybrid approaches.
Meteorology is a good example, in which researchers combine
sophisticated models and big data collection, which feed into each other
and enable ever-better weather forecasts.

International politics poses a challenge for these methods because the
laws governing the system are elusive or highly debatable, relevant data
points are often unavailable or unprecedented, and thousands of
variables interact in countless ways. History functions as a series of
unfolding events, with highly contingent branching paths sometimes
separated by mere happenstance. Tectonic shifts can hinge on seemingly
mundane occurrences. That makes it hard to deduce future events from
theoretical principles or to induce them from past experience.

As a result, historians and foreign policy experts are often bad
forecasters. In 2005, one of us, Philip Tetlock, published a study
demonstrating that seasoned political experts had trouble outperforming
"dart-tossing chimpanzees" --- random guesses --- when it came to
predicting global events. The experts fared even worse against amateur
news junkies. Overconfidence was the norm, not the exception. When
experts expressed 100 percent certainty that events would occur, those
events materialized only 80 percent of the time. Yet there were pockets
of excellence amid this unimpressive performance. Those who were surest
that they understood the forces driving the political system
("hedgehogs," in the philosopher Isaiah Berlin's terminology) fared
significantly worse than their humbler colleagues, who did not shy from
complexity, approaching problems with greater curiosity and
open-mindedness ("foxes").

This distinction caught the eye of the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity, which set up a geopolitical "forecasting tournament,"
in which Tetlock participated. He recruited a team of volunteers to
provide probabilistic answers to sharply defined questions, such as
"Will the euro fall below \$1.20 in the next year?" or "Will the
president of Tunisia flee to exile in the next six months?" By measuring
the difference between estimates and the actual occurrence of events,
Tetlock and his colleagues could calculate a score showing how
"well-calibrated" the expectations of any given forecaster were with
reality. By analyzing these data, Tetlock discovered that the [[key to
more accurate **geopolitical forecasting** was]{.mark} to take
people]{.underline} who were [naturally **numerate** and
**open-minded**]{.underline}, [train them [to think
**probabilistically**]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid common biases, and
then group them so they could leverage the "wisdom of the crowd." The
**[[best forecasters]{.underline}]{.mark}** would
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} seemingly intractable [[questions by
decomposing them]{.underline}]{.mark} into parts, researching the past
frequency of similar (if not precisely analogous) events, adjusting the
odds based the uniqueness of the situation, and continually updating
their estimates as new information emerged. By the end of the
tournament, Tetlock's top performers had achieved scores that were 30
percent better than those of career CIA analysts with access to
classified information. Somehow, they had [[transmuted **uncertainty**
into **measurable risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The advantages of being able to put realistic odds on possible futures
are obvious. It gives you a peek into the future. But even the best
forecasters have their limits. If asked to predict events three to five
years out, their performance becomes increasingly indistinguishable from
random guessing. Still, many [[**critical policy questions** are **short
term**]{.underline}]{.mark}: perhaps the most famous recent example
concerned whether Osama bin Laden was in the Abbottabad compound in May
2011. Highly consequential short-term questions now include when a
COVID-19 vaccine will be widely available. As of this writing, the smart
money (68 percent probability) is on or before March 31, 2021.

But to the extent that leaders need to make consequential,
difficult-to-reverse decisions that will play out over the long run ---
the strategic choices that will give the United States an advantage over
time --- it becomes more difficult to link forecasts to policymaking.
Well-calibrated forecasters, for instance, can estimate the likelihood
that a skirmish with the Chinese navy in the South China Sea will result
in at least two American deaths by December 31. But what policymakers
really want to know is the extent to which China will threaten U.S.
interests in the coming years and decades.

Answers to that type of inquiry are beyond the reach of forecasters
because it is impossible to define precisely what constitutes an
interest or a threat. To provide forecasts, questions must pass the
"clairvoyance test," which is to say that were it possible to pose the
question to a genuine clairvoyant, that omniscient seer must be able to
answer it without having to ask for clarification. "Will I fall in
love?" is not a forecasting question. "Will I marry Jane Smith by this
time next year?" is.

From a policy perspective, then, the greatest challenge to forecasts is
that although they can clarify slices of the future, they do not
necessarily provide enough information to inform decision-making.
Indeed, making a decision based on one specific forecast would be a
mistake: the estimated probability of an event is a poor proxy for the
significance of that event. "Will Vladimir Putin relinquish power within
the next two years?" is a far different question from "What would
Vladimir Putin's abdication of power mean for U.S.-Russian relations?"
The problem with forecasting is thus the exact opposite of the problem
with scenarios: if the latter often provide too panoramic a view of the
future to be useful, the former provides too narrow a glimpse.

AN ANSWER FOR THE FUTURE

How should these different approaches to anticipating the future be
linked? The answer lies in developing clusters of questions that give
early, forecastable indications of which envisioned future is likely to
emerge, thus allowing policymakers to place smarter bets sooner. Instead
of evaluating the likelihood of a long-term scenario as a whole,
question clusters allow analysts to break down potential futures into a
series of clear and forecastable signposts that are observable in the
short run. Questions should be chosen not only for their individual
diagnostic value but also for their diversity as a set, so that each
cluster provides the greatest amount of information about which imagined
future is emerging --- or which elements of which envisioned futures are
emerging. As a result, the seductiveness of a particular narrative will
not tempt decision-makers into mistaking plausibility for probability.
Instead, preliminary answers to specific questions can provide a simple
metric for judging in advance how the future is most likely to unfold
--- a metric that analysts can then refine once the event in question
takes place or not.

Consider the scenarios RAND produced as part of its analysis of China's
grand strategy. The four scenarios envisioned for 2050 --- "Triumphant
China," "Ascendant China," "Stagnant China," and "Imploding China" ---
can be roughly placed on a classic two-by-two matrix, with the strength
of China's political leadership on one axis and the strength of China's
economy on the other. A cluster of questions that would give a heads-up
that history is on a "Triumphant China" trajectory might include "On
December 31, 2020, will China exercise de facto control over Itu Aba (or
Taiping Island) in the South China Sea (which is currently under the de
facto control of Taiwan)?" "Will China's GDP growth in 2023 exceed ten
percent?" and "Among African audiences, when will the China Global
Television Network have a higher weekly viewership than Voice of
America?"

These questions are useful both individually and collectively. Knowing
that top forecasters see an increased chance of China controlling the
island (from, say, a ten percent probability to a 20 percent
probability), for instance, would provide immediate tactical value to
the U.S. Navy. It should not necessarily tip the balance in the debate
over whether China will be "triumphant," but if all the forecasts
resulting from the question cluster are trending in the same direction,
the United States may want to recalibrate its strategy. As forecasts
change and individual questions are answered by the course of events,
the view of the far-off future becomes a little bit clearer. Analysts
can then update their scenarios and generate new clusters of questions.
They can thus develop a continually evolving sense of plausible futures,
as well as a probabilistic estimate of which policies will yield the
most bang for the buck today.

This method resembles the U.S. defense and intelligence community's use
of indications and warnings. In the early 1960s, for example, the
National Intelligence Council developed a list of actions --- large
troop maneuvers, for instance --- that might precede an attack by the
Sino-Soviet bloc. The idea was that tactical changes might provide an
early warning of future strategic shifts. Indications and warnings have
come to play an important role in many national security scenarios.
Unfortunately, there are potential problems with scouring today's
environment for hints of tomorrow. For one thing, as psychological
research shows, having envisioned a particular scenario, humans are not
only inclined to consider it more likely; they are also more prone to
see evidence of its emergence---a form of confirmation bias that U.S.
intelligence has battled for decades. For another, analysts are not
particularly good at discerning in real time which events matter---which
signposts are actually indicative of a particular future. Developments
initially considered to be earthshattering may turn out to be
significantly less important, whereas a story buried well beneath the
day's headlines can end up changing the course of history. In a
statistical analysis of nearly two million State Department cables sent
in the 1970s, for instance, one recent study demonstrated that U.S.
diplomats were often bad at estimating the historical importance of
contemporaneous events.

[[Linking scenarios to]{.underline}]{.mark} clusters of [forecasting
[questions mitigates]{.mark} these [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
First, because the questions must be precise enough to pass the
clairvoyance test, there is no wiggle room about what constitutes, say,
large troop maneuvers. Second, because questions that disprove
hypotheses often yield the greatest information, selecting questions for
their diagnostic value [[decreases]{.mark} forecasters' susceptibility
to **[confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, much as
diversified stock portfolios spread risk through multiple, uncorrelated
investments, the diversity of question clusters
[[prevents]{.underline}]{.mark} forecasters from [[overweighting]{.mark}
a [potentially **unimportant signpost** and **mistakenly
concluding**]{.mark}]{.underline} that a [particular scenario is coming
to pass]{.underline}. Finally, and most important, because [[question
clusters yield]{.mark} forecasts]{.underline}, [one can attach
[**meaningful probabilities** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[likelihood]{.mark} that [**particular events** will occur]{.mark} in
the future]{.underline}. This [provides]{.underline} a sort of advance
[**e**arly **w**arning **s**ystem]{.underline}. An event does not need
to actually transpire for the United States to have actionable
information. That, more than anything else, gives question clusters an
advantage over traditional indications and warnings.

PLANNING IN PRACTICE

To be useful, any vision of the future must be connected to decisions in
the present. Scholars and practitioners often claim that [[scenario
planning and probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} are
incompatible given their different assumptions and goals. In fact, they
[[mesh]{.mark} well]{.underline}. A scenario planner's conviction that
the future is uncertain need not clash with a forecaster's quest to
translate uncertainty into risk. Rather, the challenge lies in
understanding the limits of each method. Question clusters [make it
possible [to leverage]{.mark} the [strength of **each
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[transforming]{.mark} the [**abstract
long term** into]{.mark} the [**concrete short term**
so]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[understand the future **quickly** and act to **stave off
danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}, seize opportunity, and strengthen
national security.

The [[greatest barrier]{.mark} to]{.underline} a [**clearer vision** of
the future [is not **philosophical** but
**organizational**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [[potential]{.mark} of
combining scenario planning with probabilistic forecasting [means
**nothing** if it is not **implemented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
occasion, the intelligence community has used forecasting tournaments to
inform its estimates, but that is only a first step.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and consumers of intelligence are
the ones who [[must]{.mark} understand]{.underline} the [importance of
forecasts and [**incorporate them** into]{.mark} their
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Too often, operational demands --- the
daily business of organizations, from weighty decisions to the mundane
--- fix attention on the current moment.

[[Overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tyranny of the present
requires]{.mark} **high-level action** and broad]{.underline},
[[sustained effort]{.underline}]{.mark}. Leaders across the U.S.
government must cultivate the cognitive habits of top forecasters
throughout their organizations, while also institutionalizing the
imaginative processes of scenario planners. The country's prosperity,
its [[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, [ultimately]{.underline}, its
power all [[depend on policymakers' ability to envision **long-term
futures**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[anticipate **short-term
developments**]{.underline}, [and use]{.underline}]{.mark} [both
[**projections** to inform everything]{.mark}]{.underline} from the
budget to grand strategy. Giving the future short shrift only
shortchanges the United States.

currently [ambiguous]{.underline}. [Polling]{.underline} data [indicates
that **public support**]{.underline} for most key aspects of American
internationalism [**has recovered** somewhat]{.underline} from where it
was in 2012--13, [and is again]{.underline} at or [near postwar
average]{.underline}s.[^[32]{.underline}^](javascript:void(0)) [But [the
**2016 election**]{.mark}]{.underline} cycle [and its]{.underline}
eventual [outcome **[revealed]{.mark}** strong [**support** for
candidates]{.mark}]{.underline} who advocated [**[rolling back]{.mark}**
key elements of post--Cold War]{.underline} (and post--World War II)
**[[grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[from]{.underline} [**free
trade** to]{.underline}]{.mark} [U.S.
**[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This atmosphere [[reflects
**discontent** with the **failures**]{.mark} and **frustrations**
[of]{.mark} U.S. **grand [strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
post--Cold War era, no doubt, yet it also [reflects the fact that
**American [strategy]{.mark}** seems **[at risk of]{.mark} becoming [a
victim of its]{.mark}** own
**[success]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[^[33]{.underline}^](javascript:void(0)) By

American [policies have made it more difficult for Americans to
**remember why** significant **[investments]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the global order [**[are needed]{.mark}** in the first
place]{.underline}.

Today, [[this]{.mark} ambivalence is becoming]{.underline} increasingly
[problematic]{.underline}, for the simple reason that properly
[resourcing American **strategy** [**requires** **making**]{.mark}
politically **[difficult trade-offs]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[with]{.mark} respect to [**entitlements** **and** other
**ballooning**]{.mark} domestic **[costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is
also becoming problematic, of course, because [even if the American
public seems to support particular aspects of American grand strategy,
[the **public has shown** itself **willing to elect a president**
who]{.mark} appears to **[care little]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the
successful postwar and post--Cold War tradition, [even if he

#### Researching and debating IR is good. 

**Ettinger, 20**---Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science,

[The first benefit is]{.underline} generating [a **well-trained
[pipeline]{.mark}** [of future IR scholars]{.mark} and practitioners.
Today's students are the **scholars** and **practitioners of tomorrow**,
and sparking **curiosity** in students, [especially
**undergraduates**]{.mark}, has the potential to [**rejuvenate the
field** from within]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Hagmann and Biersteker
(2014, 292--293) argue, [IR scholars should "take a **more direct
interest** in]{.underline} how world politics is explained to [students
in everyday schooling practices]{.underline}." This is eminently
sensible. International relations' [preoccupation with]{.underline} "the
cult of research intensivity" (Nossal 2006, 737), and to a lesser extent
[political practice]{.underline}, [**[misleads]{.mark}** the
[professoriate into believing]{.mark} that the very people who sustain
universities as institutions and who are the future of the
discipline---[student]{.mark} subscribers---[can be
**ignored**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has]{.underline} also [led the IR
professoriate [to **undervalue**]{.mark}]{.underline} the contribution
that the taught discipline makes to disciplinary renewal through [the
[**training** of]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [next generation]{.underline}.

[For future practitioners, whether in **government** or **elsewhere**,
an [IR education provides]{.mark} the [**conceptual architecture**
needed to **make decisions**]{.mark} about policy and its place in the
world]{.underline}. In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger emphasizes this
point: "The convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high
office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they
continue in office. There is little time for leaders to reflect" (as
quoted in Desch 2019, 153). While Kissinger is talking about the highest
level of elected office, it is equally true that [policymakers
throughout government come in equipped with the **intellectual capital**
and **technical skills** learned in the classroom]{.underline} (Biswas
and Paczynska 2015). [For future scholars, early lessons have
**downstream effects** on the very content of IR knowledge]{.underline}.
After all, [the [**classroom** is where IR theory gets reproduced "**for
the first time**" to]{.mark} future generations of IR
[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Newsom (1995, 64--65) put
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark}, "\[t\]eachers [**[plant the seeds]{.mark}**
that shape the thinking of each new generation; this is]{.underline}
probably [the academic world's **most lasting
contribution**]{.underline}." [It is also a place where the durability
and centrality of the field's major theories are reinforced as a matter
of course and **not necessarily for the better**]{.underline} (Vitalis
2015, 6). [Early undergraduates **carry** the assumptions they are
taught **throughout** their undergraduate and graduate careers, and
**beyond**. A discipline that **cannot connect** with students or is
inward-looking and esoteric risks **putting off** its next
generation]{.underline}. Thus, [the classroom needs to be treated with
**greater regard** as a site of **knowledge production** and
**dissemination** in the intellectual life of the field]{.underline}. In
this sense, [curiosity can be provoked among students that may continue
**beyond** an undergraduate career]{.underline}. Take, for example, the
observation of one student on her intellectual awakening in the
classroom:

Despite a Eurocentric and male-dominated ethos, what ultimately
convinced me to stay in IR was my exposure and inability to detach from
what was first described to me as the politics of the "postcolonial." A
lecturer holding up a roughened paperback copy of Edward Said's 1979
acclaimed work Orientalism originally introduced me to
postcolonialism...Hearing Said's words being reiterated back to me in my
predominately white and conservative-leaning lecture theater was a
defining moment in my education. Orientalism provided an experience that
I could finally connect with: one where political power was not about
who had the most weaponry or democracy, but instead about who held
political control over the reality of the racialized person (Abu-Bakare
2017).

The moment captured in this tableau is the [[intellectual
awakening]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is possible]{.mark}
when]{.underline} pedagogy is carefully considered. From [the
student]{.underline} perspective, well-taught courses
**[prepare]{.underline}** them better [for the next stage in their
education, [starting with **superior**]{.mark} **foundational
[training]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the early undergraduate levels [and
[progressing to **improved research**]{.mark} **capabilities**
[and]{.mark} **substantive [knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the
higher undergraduate levels, and then to advanced skills training in
graduate school. [Well-trained cohorts]{.underline} coming up the ranks
[will be **highly proficient** in a **wider range** of IR topics,
theories, ideas, and methods and will be **well prepared** to make the
jump to fluency]{.underline}. Similarly, [future practitioners will be
equipped with **superior substantive** and **technical
training**]{.underline}. This is especially true with "experiential
learning." Done in purposeful ways, learning through experiences outside
the classroom generates employable skills for students.

Social and Institutional Context of Teaching and Disciplinary
Reproduction

Directly related to the question of the future of international
relations is the social context of teaching and the discipline's
reproduction in the classroom. IR [scholars must recognize that the [IR
classroom is the site of]{.mark} **ideational [preferences]{.mark}**,
clashes of **favored** or **disfavored paradigms**, of **personal
authority**]{.underline}, generational difference, [**social
privileges**, and **prejudices**. At **every point** in]{.underline}
professional [i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [there
are implications for how knowledge is **produced**, **taught**, and
**passed on**]{.underline} (Ettinger 2016; Colgan 2017; Fattore 2018;
Knight 2019). Indeed, [the intellectual output of IR scholars does not
exist independent of the **lived context** in which it is
produced]{.underline}. Gaining insight into the social context of
international relations' taught discipline can help begin to correct the
pathologies that are affecting the way the next generation of IR
scholars are being taught right now and how future scholars and
practitioners will be taught next year and beyond.

It begins by addressing the social identity of the instructor and how it
contributes to the reproduction of IR knowledge. After all, the
instructor does not speak from a position of nowhere and an account of
IR pedagogy should address the personal features of the instructor, her
place within the discipline's division of labor, and its effect on the
delivery of course content (Biswas and Deylami 2017). For international
relations especially, it is the site of entrenched male and
Euro-Atlantic dominance with cascading implications within the classroom
and beyond. The 2014 TRIP survey shows that the global IR professorate
is two-thirds male (Maliniak et al. 2014). In the United States and
British IR "core" and in the Anglo "noncore" (Cox and Nossal 2009), the
professoriate is overwhelmingly white and male. Australia is 72.11
percent male and 76.87 percent white. Canada is 70.83 percent male and
83.4 percent white. The United Kingdom is 64.83 percent male and 85.23
percent white, while the United States is 68.33 percent male and 85.21
percent white non-Hispanic. New Zealand, a slight outlier, is 81.82
percent male but only 34.78 percent identifying as NZ European (Maliniak
et al. 2014). Given what has been shown about the American dominance of
the discipline, the insularity of national IR communities, and the
gender gap in citations, it is reasonable to conclude that the bulk of
the most influential IR scholarship is produced and disseminated by
white men in the West (Maliniak et al. 2018; Maliniak et al 2013).

Understanding this relationship can improve IR pedagogy by recognizing
how diverse student populations interact with an overwhelmingly white
Euro-Atlantic intellectual tradition and by remedying some of the
attending limitations such as geohistorical narrowness, state-centrism,
epistemological positivism, and phallocentric authorship (Fonseca 2019).
In this regard, the taught discipline of international relations should
be intellectually responsive to a diversifying discipline and to a
diversifying student population. Such circumstances call for a broader
approach to teaching courses in a field whose heavy Euro-American
centrality can alienate students when their backgrounds are not
reflected in the course material. This is not simply a matter of
curriculum design that tries to mirror or "look like" the students
(Appiah 2019, SR7). Rather, it is one that balances disciplinary
foundations with broadened ontological scope of what "matters" in IR in
order to generate betterinformed teaching. It is widely recognized that
international relations is a very traditional field of scholarship, but
this should not preclude perspectives beyond the canon or case studies
from outside the empirical mainstream. More ambitious and, especially,
diverse content helps adapt teaching to changing student audiences. This
is especially true at the undergraduate level. What is important to
avoid is the "pipeline problem" that has discouraged women and
minorities from progressing through the scholarly ranks in STEM fields
(Brown et al. 2016; Branch 2016). By the same token, bringing more and
more diverse young students into the discipline of international
relations and encouraging their growth can bear intellectual fruit down
the line. At very least, we avoid artificially restricting the
development of the next generation of scholars.

[By **no means** is this a call to **jettison** the
classics]{.underline}. To the contrary, [[the field's canon is
**irreplaceable**]{.mark} as a foundation, as the **intellectual
inheritance** of the present, [as the **prevailing ideas** of]{.mark}
foreign [policymakers, and]{.mark} as **[points of
disagreement]{.mark}** for critical traditions]{.underline}. However,
[the scope of [IR]{.mark} pedagogy can [be
**expanded**]{.mark}]{.underline} to make it relevant for a twenty-first
century classroom. Primarily, this means expanding the theoretical and
empirical scope of international relations [[**beyond** its]{.mark}
traditional **Eurocentric** and **male-dominated**
[parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Acharya 2016). This is
discussed below. Granted, there will be no singular population to which
an IR curriculum will be pitched. Variation in student population
profiles based on race, gender, class, geography, and other identity
markers complicate the decisions that an instructor has to make. The
point is that there are intellectual gains to be had when the taught
discipline takes seriously the social context of international
relations' disciplinary reproduction. With a more diverse pedagogy in
place, it is possible that, with more eyes on the subject matter and
more minds from different backgrounds at work, [the IR classroom can
generate greater interest in **fundamental theoretical questions** for
the next generation of scholars to solve]{.underline}.

Institutional context of teaching matters too. The vast majority of IR
practice takes place in university institutions. Therefore, the material
institutional setting must enter in as a condition of international
relations' intellectual life. Consider first, the matter of basic
institutional survival. In an era where public universities around the
world face funding problems, there are immediate economic imperatives
for taking the taught discipline of international relations seriously.
In the short term, survival in unforgiving economic times requires
student enrollment and retention (Conley 2019). Systematic accounts of
US undergraduate enrollment since the Great Recession of 2008 show
majors in the "traditional disciplines" declining by 21 percent
(philosophy) to 30 percent (history). Political science and
international relations fare less badly, declining "only" by 11 percent
and 15 percent over ten years (Schmidt 2018). Put differently, the
classroom is on the front line in the battle for resources. Student
recruitment and retention are essential to the economic viability of
academic departments including political science and international
relations. Turning students off the subject matter through an
unreflexive pedagogy, boring classes, or mediocre lecturers has real
economic implications for the future. Without students prepared to part
with tuition dollars, or governments prepared to unlock activity-based
funding, no department can thrive, even with a roster of productive
researchers. Concretely, this means no new hiring and reduced budgets---
a recipe for contraction. In this context, the systematic neglect of the
classroom by IR stocktakers is entirely inexplicable given the parlous
financial state of most public universities. Trends in expanded
enrollment compound or create new problems. Universities that pack
classrooms with hundreds, if not thousands, of more students---many of
whom are international and pay exorbitant tuition fees---put revenue
generation above pedagogy (Schulmann 2019).

The disciplinary division of university labor must be factored into an
understanding of the context of IR teaching and its implications for the
intellectual life of international relations. In this sense, debate
about the taught discipline must grapple with question of resources,
division of university labor, teaching assignments, pressures of the
tenure track, the precarity of contract faculty, and other aspects of
university governance as conditions that influence the classroom. One of
the most striking trends in university governance is the increasing role
of contingent instructors. In the United States, some 73 percent of
instructional positions were nontenure track in 2016 (AAUP 2018). This
is consistent with longer-term trends. The percentage of postsecondary
instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6
percent in 1995 to 71.6 percent in 2011. In that time, the number of
full-time tenure-track positions increased by 10 percent while the
number of full- or part-time contingent positions doubled (GAO 2017,
8--9). This is not to say that contingent faculty are worse teachers,
but the contingent nature of the work creates impediments to teaching.
Fewer institutional resources, the constant need to reapply for jobs,
and the need for part-time work outside the university are all matters
that detract from time dedicated to students, improving pedagogy, or
learning new content. Downstream, the design of an IR class or the
delivery of an IR curriculum may not be nearly as effective as it could
be.

Intellectual Reflection and Renewal from the Inside Out

Taking teaching seriously as part of [the intellectual life of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [can]{.underline}
lead to intellectual renewal and self-reflection for individual
professors and for the discipline as a whole. At the individual level,
teaching has the ability to [catalyze an **intellectual
renewal**]{.underline} in the mind of the individual professor. [The
intellectual challenges of the classroom can provoke **[new]{.mark}
avenues of [research]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the instructor. [The
classroom is a **much more permissive intellectual environment** than
academic publishing. It affords]{.underline} the professor [a degree of
freedom to **explore topics**, **ideas**, and **arguments**, outside of
their research expertise. Making use of the opportunity to teach beyond
one's comfort zone [permits **thinking**]{.mark} **out loud**,
[**working through ideas**, and **entanglement in**]{.mark} **analytical
[puzzles]{.mark}**. Doing so is demanding, and it is much easier to fall
back on existing]{.underline} teaching [content. But an
ambitious]{.underline} teaching [agenda can lead to **new research
questions**, **new** and **unexpected intellectual horizons**, and
**better background context** for existing expertise]{.underline}.
Indeed, there is truth to the aphorism that there is no better way to
learn than to teach.

[This kind of renewal turns on the "**eureka**" moment when research
ideas **flows directly** from classroom activities]{.underline}. A more
systematic approach to renewal that is less reliant on serendipity
begins by asking discipline-wide questions. The first is this: what is
the purpose of teaching international relations? It is a variation on a
core concern to the discipline and one that remains unresolved (Dyvik,
Wilkinson, and Selby 2017)? Is it for disciplinary self-reproduction, to
train future practitioners, or more broadly, citizens and knowledge
workers in the twenty-first century economy (Darling and Foster 2012;
Szarejko and Carnes 2018; Zartner et al. 2018)? [Arriving at an official
"purpose" for i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is
probably **pointless**]{.underline}, and it is best left to the
decentralized community of scholars to decide. IR scholars have debated
this question widely within the published discipline but far less so in
the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of
options betrays a lack of focus that is symptomatic of the wider field
(Albert 2010). However, [this permissive intellectual environment is
beneficial for **wide-ranging intellectual pursuits**, **teaching
styles**, and **pedagogical agendas**]{.underline}. [It
**may**]{.underline}, though, [come at the cost]{.underline}. The
institutional underpinnings [of]{.underline} the discipline---faculty
administrators, editorial boards, funding agencies, hiring committees,
and so on--- may end up doing as much to shape the boundaries of the
discipline as the substantive output (Albert and Buzan 2017, 908). The
alternative, though, is subjecting intellectual and academic freedom to
[an **institutionalized orthodoxy**]{.underline}. In teaching,
decentralization may be intellectually permissive but may come at the
expense of disciplinary coherence.

[This concern]{.underline}, though, [may be **overstated**]{.underline}.
TRIP **[data]{.underline}** on curriculum design [gives an indication of
the **competing** and sometimes **overlapping pedagogical
priorities**]{.underline} among the IR professoriate. In a question on
introduction to IR classes, respondents were asked whether their
introductory courses are designed more to introduce IR scholarship
within the discipline or to prepare students to be informed about
foreign policy and international issues. The result favors a mix of both
with 80.83 percent incorporating scholarship and issues in some balance.
The remaining 19.17 percent come down in favor of one to the exclusion
of the other. At the master's level, the ratio is a bit narrower (73 to
27 percent) but still overwhelmingly embraces a mixture of academic
scholarship and international issues (Maliniak et al. 2014). Respondents
are a bit more divided on what undergraduate courses should be mandatory
in an IR program. They overwhelmingly agree (73.25 percent) that IR
theory should be a required subject. However, they differ on other
options. The next most popular candidates for a required course are
international/global political economy (45.37 percent), international
security (38.87 percent), and research methods (35.22 percent), followed
by international organizations (27.59 percent), comparative foreign
policy (22.86 percent), home country foreign policy (19.95 percent),
international law (19.85 percent), diplomatic history (19.11 percent),
and international economics (15.17 percent) (Maliniak et al. 2014). The
point is that [resolving what IR teaching is supposed to accomplish is
**hardly settled**]{.underline}, but there is some convergence on
certain issues.

So, [what]{.underline} then, [is the purpose of teaching
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations? Ultimately, it is up
to the individual instructor to answer and to enact a program
accordingly. But [[it is up to]{.mark} the community of [scholars to
**debate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may well be that the enormous
variation in the purpose of teaching international relations and the
radical decentralization is an inescapable feature of the taught
discipline. [Though [IR teaching]{.mark} may be **wildly
divergent**]{.underline} around the world, [there [is]{.mark} **always
some purpose** to it, and]{.underline}, however defined, [this is an
**intrinsic feature** of an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [education]{.underline}. Here, Cox's (1981, 128)
famous admonition that "[theory is **always for someone** and **for some
purpose**]{.underline}" serves as the anchor concept for
[such]{.underline} pedagogical [framing]{.underline}. It [frames IR
theories as **political things** and **not just abstractions** to be
memorized or [a]{.mark}n **analytical [template]{.mark}** to be applied
uncritically]{.underline}. Similarly, [it helps [to **frame thematic**
and **empirical**]{.mark} **cases** in the classroom]{.underline} so
that course material is not merely a reflection the professor's
unexamined preference. In the classroom, it is up to the professor to
articulate. Beyond the classroom in administrative meetings, academic
conferences, and in print, it is up to the field to debate.

The next question asks what is the proper scope of IR teaching? This
question has also been asked before of the field but not directly about
the IR classroom (Albert and Buzan 2017, 898). The answer to this
question connects different themes of this article: intellectual
rejuvenation and disciplinary renewal, diversity, and the future of
international relations as an intellectual project. In substance and in
design, [the scope of IR teaching should [**embrace pluralism** in
paradigm, empirical remit]{.mark}, and criticism]{.underline}. A great
deal has been made of pluralism in international relations (Levine and
McCourt 2018; Eun 2016), but pluralism in the taught discipline is far
different from pluralism in the published discipline, where differences
accrue over the merits of accumulation and diversity. Here, [the scope
of possibility in the classroom is **far more intellectually
permissive**. Teaching international relations can be **theoretically**
and **empirically promiscuous**]{.underline}. It can respect the canon,
its inner logic, and its external life, as well as contemporary
alternatives (Ferguson 2015). [This]{.underline} is an "integrative
pluralism" (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416) that [embraces diversity
as a means of "providing **more comprehensive** and **multidimensional
accounts** of complex phenomena" and a pedagogical engagement with the
world that includes, but **hardly limited** to the Euro-Atlantic
theater, that has dominated]{.underline} generations of [IR
thinking]{.underline} (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416).

Pedagogical pluralism in international relations flows from intuitions
about balancing theory and empirics, the canon and its alternatives,
being current while eschewing presentism, being "useful" without being
instrumentalist, and drawing on instructor expertise without being
constrained by the hyperspecialized knowledge attendant to the published
discipline. Of course, this is easy to say. But operationalizing these
intuitions into a pluralistic teaching program is much more difficult.
Complicating the matter is the relative absence of explicit theoretical
guidance for making IR pluralism work in the classroom. The insights of
proponents of a "Global IR" can help, including some critiqued above for
their neglect of the classroom. In particular, Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 300--308) program for developing a Global IR provides concrete
steps toward curriculum design as much as is does for research.

Regarding the IR theoretical parts of their program, Acharya and Buzan
(2019, 301) say that Global IR respects existing theories while "giving
due recognition to the places, roles, and contributions of non-Western
peoples and societies," which entails "pluralization within theories,
rather than just between them." There are issues here. First,
[[pluralization between theories requires **expanding**]{.mark} **the
remit** of [IR]{.mark} theory beyond the grand IR paradigms [to include
**non-Western contributions**]{.mark}]{.underline} to international
thought (Acharya and Buzan 2010; Acharya 2011). [But this is not
easy]{.underline}. Tickner and Wæver (2009) make it clear that
[Anglo-American IR looms impossibly large around the world. Without
jettisoning this intellectual inheritance]{.underline}, Thinking
International Relations Differently (Tickner and Blaney 2012) provides a
route to [pluralism]{.underline}. That volume [**interrogates
alternative meanings** to some of i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [central
concepts]{.underline}---security, state, sovereignty and authority,
globalization, secularism, religion, and the international. A professor
committed to [this kind of [pluralism]{.mark} can **[expand]{.mark} the
conceptual [vocabulary]{.mark}** of international relations in a way
that **encourages**]{.underline} undergraduate [**conversancy** in
multiple IR vernaculars **within** and **beyond** the Anglo-American
core]{.underline}.

[There is also the matter of what do with the **existing**,
**Western-centric canon**]{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan (2019, 301)
also say that [a global international relations would **subsume** rather
than **supplant** existing IR theories and methods. The purpose here is
**not to displace** Western-dominated IR knowledge but to **situate** it
within the global context]{.underline}. This is an entirely attainable
objective for an IR theory instructor. IR teachers should have full
command of some IR theories while being conversant in nearly all anyway.
[Integrating a fuller slate of intellectual content into teaching IR
theory permits]{.underline} a **[cognitive pluralism]{.underline}** that
is rarely available in the published discipline. The point here is that
teaching narrowly and to the expertise of professors may suit their
interests, but it puts blinders on the students. Upper-year and graduate
studies can explore specific pathways, but only after international
relations' map has been presented. This likely means instructors must
venture out of their preferred intellectual comfort zones and teach to
their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Doing so, however, requires
breaking through disciplinary walls and should not be underestimated. It
requires breadth of knowledge, disciplinary literacy beyond the
scholar's training, and language skills (usually beyond English) that
can take many years to develop, while the imperatives of the published
discipline stress specialization.

Regarding the empirical subject matter, a pluralistic IR agenda would
ground its empirics in world history rather than just Western history
(Acharya and Buzan 2019, 301) This is demanding on an instructor whose
subject-matter expertise will be narrow (by dint of academic training)
and whose time will be short given other professional and personal
commitments. Without considerable effort, this is more of an ideal than
a reality. But a good start would be to follow Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 303) admonition to integrate the study of regions, regionalism,
and area studies into the curriculum. In particular, this means offering
case studies, examples, and illustrations drawn from parts of the world
outside the Euro-Atlantic zone. To this we can add Buzan and Lawson's
(2015) case for expanding the temporal remit of international relations
to the nineteenth century. This would break free of the apocryphal
founding myths (Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson 2011) and temporal myopia of
the orthodox discipline (Buzan and Lawson 2014) in order to draw upon a
richer and more global context for the emergence of the modern world. A
worldly curriculum will likely begin rather thin, but over time become
much deeper and more inclusive. Perhaps [more attainable in the
short-term is a pluralistic [pedagogy]{.mark} that [recognizes]{.mark}
**multiple forms of [agency]{.mark}** beyond the state and material
power. Such]{.underline} an approach would entail [a
pedagogy]{.underline} addressing a diverse constellation of actors in
world politics that [offers a faithful representation of an
overwhelmingly complex environment **without reducing it** exclusively
to a handful of Western powers]{.underline}.

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to [**fill the gap**
between]{.mark} **IR [theory]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **real-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of **intellectual [openness]{.mark}**, recognizing both the need for
**greater [flexibility]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **theoretical
formulations** [and]{.mark} the **possibility of complementarity** by
**[other theories]{.mark}** and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in]{.mark} its [ability to **tackle future**]{.mark}
**event[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think**]{.mark}
caused by the **subconscious** and **simplified information processing
of humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants t]{.mark}o **reveal**
and [**question convictions**]{.mark} which have **so far remained
unchallenged**, [and]{.mark} to **question the [linearity]{.mark} of
world developments**.]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both **innovative** in terms of
**scholarship**, and **[policy-relevant]{.mark}** by offering a
**reflection** on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline} Thus, [it
can facilitate the **intellectual capability** to **think the
unthinkable**]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[innovative research topics **confront the uncertainties** that are
**crucial for policymakers** to be monitored closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[[possibility to **accommodate multiple**]{.mark} **driving
[forces]{.mark}**, to **take into account different values** they might
take and finally to **[combine them]{.mark} with each other** [and **see
how they affect the**]{.mark} **dependent [variable]{.mark}**, makes the
scenario approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work with a
limited number of independent variables]{.underline}, formulate and test
hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single causal
variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and [provid]{.mark}ing academia with a tool for
"[**actionable clarity** in **understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary
global [issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool
towards]{.mark} **more exchange between academia and
[policy-making]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} can [contribute to]{.mark} a
**better [understanding]{.mark} between the two** worlds. For
policymakers, it provides the opportunity to consider **[long-term
trends]{.mark}**]{.underline} (an occasion not often found in the
day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides insight into
which trends are most concerning for policy-makers, allowing them to
check and ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the **[relevance of]{.mark} their
research agendas**.]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

### Perm

#### The perm uses NATO as a [force for good]{.underline}. Rejecting NATO [enslaves]{.underline} the world under Russia and China's [gangster mafia totalitarianism]{.underline}.

we must fight for a socialist NATO --- The Canada Files\"; Canada Files;

[Admitting NATO'S crimes and anti-democratic effects is]{.underline},
however, **[only the first step]{.underline}** to understand the actual
bind in which we progressives are stuck. Too many among progressives and
radical socialists are trapped in this stunted way of thinking because
of how we understand neoliberal capitalism as a uniquely American
project.

[[Movements]{.mark} for social progress around the world **[grow
precarious]{.mark}** [in the shadow of]{.mark} the **geopolitical
games** of our **[great state powers]{.mark}** [jockeying for
**military** and **economic** influence]{.mark} and
domination]{.underline}. The socialist left has long been well aware of
the brutality and rapaciousness of capitalism.

Decades of research and journalism have demonstrated the central role of
American military and economic policy in pressing capitalist development
around the world. The intellectual tradition of studying how capitalism
began with Karl Marx himself and continues through generations across a
variety of disciplines. Many well-educated progressives have studied
these traditions, whether in the formal settings of universities to our
own learning. But much of this tradition focuses on the American role in
promoting global capitalism.

We progressives today must face a terrifying truth: [the
[America]{.mark}n state [is **not alone**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
enforcing the brutal innovations in capitalism that have developed over
the last generation.

Monstrosities of Mafia Fascism and Absolutism

Russia was once an ally of socialist liberation movements around the
world, though their own revolution under Josef Stalin had collapsed into
state-controlled capitalism and government by secret police.

Now, Vladimir [[Putin has restored **totalitarian principles**]{.mark}
of government to Russia, as [their]{.mark} domestic [policy is
the]{.mark} **economic** and **political [devastation]{.mark}** [of
the]{.mark} **[Russian people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words,
[[Putin facilitated the]{.mark} **wholesale [theft]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**[hundreds of billions]{.mark}** [of dollars]{.mark} in wealth from the
Russian state and its industries [to a]{.mark} **[clique]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} former **bureaucratic**]{.underline} [and **secret police
[apparatchiks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of which is he leader. [Those
oligarchs are also leaders and financiers in Russia's **international
mafia**]{.underline}. Putin has explicitly built his new Russian
totalitarianism with significant influence from the fascist political
philosophy of Ivan Ilyin.

Russia is emerging again as a major power in our century's geopolitics,
but the collapse and corruption of much of the American government under
Trump, as well as their homicidal approach to COVID, has made China the
most powerful military and economic state in the world.

For decades, [[the Chinese state]{.mark} has [governed]{.mark} its
people [with]{.mark} **[brutal police enforcement]{.mark}** of **regime
loyalty**, even [deploying]{.mark} **[concentration camps]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[ethnic cleansing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to its
conquered territories of **East Turkestan** and **Tibet**]{.underline}.
More recently, [Xi Jinping's regime has been **especially devoted** to
institutionalizing his **absolute rule** over China, and the country's
highest political leaders are themselves embedded in **corrupt
relationships**]{.underline} [with their most powerful **billionaire
businessmen**]{.underline}.

[[One need **only count** the]{.mark} **many [murdered
journalists]{.mark}** in Russia who have investigated the details of
Putin's **gangster regime**]{.underline} [[to know]{.mark} that [this
geopolitical enemy]{.mark} of America is **[no friend]{.mark}** of the
progressive]{.underline}. [The same goes for dissidents and
whistleblowers who have **defied Xi's official truth**: they **rot in
prison**]{.underline} like Liu Xiaobo [or **disappear from
humanity**]{.underline} like Li Wenliang.

Three Militaries Against Democracy, Not Just One

Despite the destruction that the NATO military alliance has caused in
Europe and Asia, [we progressives face an **uncomfortable truth**: [we
need a]{.mark} **[military powerful enough]{.mark}** [to stand
against]{.mark} the many threats that **[Russia]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[China]{.mark}** pose to democracy around the world]{.underline}. As
well, [[we **must never** let our opposition to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
threat that [[America]{.underline}]{.mark} poses to global democracy
[[make us **patsies**]{.mark} [for Russian or Chinese
control]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **most potent** threat]{.underline} to our own democracies [is the
**destabilization**]{.underline} [of our **democratic
societies**]{.underline}. [A foundation of modern Russia's foreign
policy is to **aflame social conflicts**]{.underline} [inside of
**democratic polities**, and use weapons of **cyber-warfare**, such as
viruses and disinformation]{.underline}.

China has taken a more traditional route to global dominance. [Chinese
[investments in]{.mark} **massive resource [extraction]{.mark}**
projects [across **Africa**]{.mark}]{.underline} follow the model of the
old British East India Company. [Take almost **all profit** from mines
and oil wells, while [trap]{.mark}ping their African [partner states
in]{.mark} **[unsustainable debt]{.mark}**]{.underline} from project
financing.

How do we progressive and other ordinary people escape this triple
squeeze between three militarized, aggressive superpower states run by
mafiosi and billionaire power brokers? Anti-capitalist, socialist, and
democratic organization and agitation across the world is really our
only answer.

**[[We need NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but only because socialist and
democratic movements are closer to taking some measure of control away
from the corrupt in Europe and the Americas, pessimistic though even
these prospects often feel. A socialist Europe and North America would
stand against Russia and China as the weapons of war move to the
internet and public political movements themselves.

[If the NATO states]{.underline} of Europe and North America [could
unite]{.underline} in an aggressive cyberwar [to encourage **popular
resistance** to the **brutal mafia totalitarianism** of Russia and
China, then we will have a chance]{.underline} for global democracy,
socialism, a green economy, and a sustainable civilization on Earth.

Until those revolutions happen, we remain in our triple bind. But
[[**collapsing** our military]{.mark} entirely, [while geopolitical
enemies]{.mark} **[expand]{.mark}** and **consolidate** [theirs]{.mark},
[is a recipe for our **enslavement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We remain
slaves under]{.mark} neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}, [our opportunities
**ground to dust**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conclusion: the paucity of 'better' It seems appropriate to conclude by
commenting on why [it would be futile to attempt to provide a
justification for why postcolonial approaches offer a "better"
explanation of world politics in comparison to other IR
theories.]{.underline} The analysis has shown that traditional IR
theories, and even critical theories such as poststructuralism and
Marxism, operate within the limitations of an epistemology that is
inherently Eurocentric and attached to a vision of world politics that
is excessively temporal, with ontological categories that reflect this
point of view. Even when the European vision of modernity is criticised
from within, this criticism is prone to falling back on these same
categories in order to do so. Instead, a [decolonial epistemology can
create space for a universal that incorporates rather than excludes
difference,]{.underline} while ontological concepts derived from this
epistemology and the non-Western experience can elaborate a vision of
world politics that is more holistic and nuanced. Yet [to say that such
an explanation is "better" seems to negate the very purpose of
postcolonial approaches to IR; to draw attention to the hierarchies
embedded in the international sphere]{.underline} through the past and
ongoing practices and discourses of colonialism and imperialism[.
Describing these approaches as "better" merely engages in the same
tendency towards hierarchy, binaries, and reductionism critiqued in
other approaches.]{.underline} It is for this reason that this essay has
[argued strongly for the importance of postcolonial approaches to
explaining world politics but refuses to reduce these attributes to a
better or worse distinction]{.underline}. Suffice it to say that
postcolonial approaches encourage an understanding of world politics
that truly merits the name.

Bull notwithstanding, [there have been attempts in international re-
lations to address the cultural realm]{.underline}.32 Ali Mazrui
confronts interna- tional relations head-on by claiming that [\"culture
is at the heart of the nature of power in International
Relations]{.underline}. \"33 Mazrui sees [ideol- ogy, political economy,
and technology as deeply rooted in the cul- tural realm]{.underline},
and views the North-South divide as an increasingly cultural one.
Cultural identity is held to be an issue of increased sig- nificance in
the contemporary world - so much so that, according to Mazrui, we may be
witnessing the \"gradual unravelling of identities based on the state, a
declining of identities based on political ideol- ogy - and the revival
of identities based on culture.\"34 Peter Worsley\'s earlier account of
world development makes similar claims.35 [The in- ternationalization of
culture - youth cults, religious revivalism, con- sumerism, feminism -
are seen as \"powerful evidence that a sense of common identity and a
shared culture can give rise to social move- ments that quickly
transcend the boundaries of any particular soci- ety.\"]{.underline}36
Both Mazrui and Worsley thus see culture as a key determinant of
political and economic processes. [Even the generally econocentric
Immanuel Wallerstein has shifted ground to view culture as \"the key
ideological battleground\" of the opposing interests within the mod- ern
world capitalist system.37]{.underline} These attempts to engage culture
seemingly amount to [a re- spectable interest on the part of
international relations]{.underline}, and it is in- structive to
consider the intellectual background of the three writers discussed.
Wallerstein is a sociologist, and the essay cited above was published in
a collection of sociological articles on nationalism, glob- alization,
and modernity. Mazrui has always cut a distinctive path in international
relations, and his concerns have had more to do with the problems of
Third World justice and identity than with main- stream issues. Worsley,
similarly, has been steeped in the problems of development and
dependency in the Third World. We thus see that many of the perspectives
that have enlivened the discipline have come from outside it and draw on
different source material. Something similar may be said of R. B. J
Walker. Certainly he ha ried a consideration of culture with the issues
of order, power states, but his bearings have been taken from broad
modernity.38 Without belaboring the point, such an analysis is very much
the exception. Walker himself recognizes as much: \'This kind of
literature . . . has emerged largely on the margins of International
Relations as an institutionalized discipline. It remains obscure, even
alien to those whose training has been primarily within the positivis-
tic, realist, or policy-oriented mainstreams.\'139 The contrast with
postcolonialism could not be starker. Where in- ternational relations
has ignored culture, or at most grudgingly con- ceded it a minor role,
postcolonialism has elevated culture to an extraordinary degree.
Although the understanding of culture has changed as the discourse has
evolved, culture has been at the heart of postcolonialism from the
outset. In the first phase of postcolonial- ism, culture was grounded in
the literary context and understood very much in terms of the clash of
values engendered by the colonial encounter. Following
postcolonialism\'s move away from specific texts to a more generalized
account of domination and resistance between North and South, culture
has attained larger explanatory significa- tions. It has come to
encapsulate the very site of struggle and differ- ence between the
so-called margin and the center; the pivot upon which an emergent
postcolonial identity develops. On one view, how- ever, [culture has
been overdone. In its attempt to be at the cutting edge of academic
discourse, postcolonialism can be accused of hav- ing overstretched the
analytical utility of culture]{.underline}. Yet such a perspec- tive
underplays the significance of the cultural reorientation; it is
precisely through culture that postcolonialism mounts a fundamental
challenge to the epistemological bases of established regimes of
thinking such as international relations. In this respect its effect has
been overwhelmingly positive. To this point, the burden of our analysis
has been to suggest that [international relations and postcolonialism
pass like ships in the night. We have highlighted possible intersections
and potential sites of engagement, the idea being that both discourses
might be en- riched through a process of cross-fertilization. Such
enrichment would follow partly from the very fact of
difference]{.underline}. We now want to direct attention to three key
areas of difference in which [engagement might have real significance,
not only for each discourse but more generally for our broader concern
with approaches to the North- South divide. The first relates to power
and representation, the sec- ond to modernity, and the third to
emotional commitment and radicalism.]{.underline} In the process of
contestation and comparison, the hope is that [we can get a better
handle on understanding issues such as power and modernity as they bear
upon the relationship between the North and South. Both discourses have
distinct strengths and weak- nesses and bring different perspectives to
bear on the issues at hand. In seeking a dialogue and making assessments
about what we might learn from their diferences, we can begin to bridge
the discourses to their mutual benefit.]{.underline}

CHINA KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-REFLECTION

Until now, my focus seems to have been mainly on how not to understand
China's rise. While deconstruction is all well and good, one cannot help
but wonder: How to study China? If those paradigms are problematic or
less than adequate, what are the alternative ways of knowing this
important country? These questions sound reasonable enough. Be it
scholars or practitioners, when faced with an apparently unprecedented
transition from a transatlantic century to a transpacific century led by
the 'rise' of China (and India), one is naturally anxious to know what
China is up to and how to best respond to it. Yet, however
understandable this desire may be, this book has hesitated to directly
volunteer answers to those questions, or at least its implicit answers
would be unlikely to satisfy those demands on their own terms. There are
several reasons for this. To begin with, I am sceptical of some of their
underlying ontological and epistemological premises about what China is
and what China knowledge should mean. For example, those questions seem
to assume that this book is merely a study of China studies (or a
particular section of China studies), rather than a study of China per
se. Hence their insistence on knowing how we might go about studying
China proper. Yet, [from the beginning, this knowledge/reality dichotomy
has been problematised. Since there is no China-in-itself outside
knowledge, representation or discourse, what we refer to as 'China' must
already be coloured by such representations]{.underline}.
[Without]{.underline} **[reference to representations]{.underline}** [we
cannot]{.underline} for a moment [speak of China or do China
studies]{.underline}. Given that China does not exist independently of
discourse and that any study becomes part of its object of study, I
should say that this analysis of Western discourses of China is already
a study of China in the proper sense of the word. Also, underlying those
question is the belief that deconstruction is essentially destructive
and thus has little constructive to contribute to China studies.
However, [as Derrida notes, deconstruction is 'a way of taking a
position' rather than merely 'a flourish of irresponsible and
irresponsiblemaking destruction']{.underline}. 8 By way of
deconstruction, this book has hoped [to generate both critical and
constructive reflections on the way we think about the nature of China
knowledge as well as the way such knowledge can be better
produced]{.underline}. To the extent that methodology is always implied
in ontology and epistemology, my ontological and epistemological
critique is not an exercise of esoteric verbal incantation, but carries
important methodological messages for China watching, even though such
messages could well be dismissed as hollow, mystifying or even alien by
conventional standards. One message from this study [is that it is no
longer adequate for us to be merely 'China' specialists who are
otherwise blissfully 'ignorant of the world beyond China']{.underline}.9
**[Self-watching]{.underline}**, I suggest, [requires]{.underline} at
once **[discarding]{.underline}** [this positivist]{.underline}
**[self-(un)consciousness]{.underline}** [and cultivating a]{.underline}
**[critically reflective, philosophising mind]{.underline}**. '[The
philosophizing mind']{.underline}, wrote Collingwood, 'never simply
thinks about an object, it always, while thinking about any object,
[thinks also about its own thought about that object']{.underline}.
[China watching needs autoethnography or 'self-watching' to consciously
make itself part of its own object of critical analysis]{.underline}
whereby the necessary but often missing comparative context can help us
put China in perspective. All research, to be sure, must already contain
some level of reflectivity, be it about methods of inquiry, hypothesis
testing, empirical evidence, data collection, or clarity of expression.
And the Western representations of China's rise, predicated on some
particular ways of Western selfimagination, are necessarily
self-reflective in that sense. And yet, such [narrow technical
reflectivity or narcissistic posturing is not]{.underline} what I mean
by ['self-watching']{.underline}. In fact, [the]{.underline}
**[unconscious Western self-imagination]{.underline}** [as the modern
knowing subject]{.underline} ([who sets itself apart from the
world]{.underline} and refuses to critically look at itself) [is the
very]{.underline} **[antithesis of self-watching]{.underline}**. 10 This
position is similar to that of 'ironists'. According to Richard Rorty,
ironists are 'never quite able to take themselves seriously because
always aware that the terms in which they describe themselves are
subject to change, always aware of the contingency and fragility of
their final vocabularies, and thus of their selves'.11 In the concluding
chapter of his Scratches on Our Minds, Harold Isaacs seemed to have
endorsed such 'ironist' approaches to China studies: 'we have to
examine, each of us, how we register and house our observations, how we
come to our judgments, how we enlarge our observations, how we describe
them, and what purposes they serve for us'.12 Back in 1972, John
Fairbank put [such reflection in practice]{.underline} by
[suggest]{.underline}ing [that America's Cold-War attitude towards China
was based less on reason than on fear]{.underline}, a fear inspired not
by China but by America's experience with Nazi and Stalinist
totalitarian regimes. 13 These [examples clearly show the possibility of
reflective China watching]{.underline}, but alas, as noted from the
beginning, such reflectivity is [hardly visible in today's 'China's
rise' literature]{.underline}. Indeed, without the trace of a single
author, [the two dominant China paradigms hinge onto a ubiquitous
collective psyche and emotion that is often **difficult to
see**]{.underline}, let alone to criticise from within. Yet [it is
imperative that such self-criticism should occur, which entails
**problematising** China watchers' own thought, vocabularies and
taken-forgranted self-identity as disinterested rational
observers]{.underline}. [It requires us to]{.underline} **[pause and
look into ourselves]{.underline}** [to examine]{.underline}, for
example, [why we constantly fear China, rather than taking that fear as
given]{.underline}: 'We are wary of China because we are wary of China'.
Self-watching [demands]{.underline} an ironist [awareness
of]{.underline} the contingency, instability, and provinciality of
mainstream China knowledge, [its intertextual and emotional link to the
fears and fantasies in the Western self-imagination, the political
economy of its production, and the attendant normative, ethical and
practical consequences both for dealing with China and for serving the
power and special interests at home]{.underline}. Put it differently,
[it requires a]{.underline} **[deconstructive move of intellectual
decolonisation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the latent
**[(neo)colonial desire]{.underline}** and mindset that, despite the
formal end of colonialism decades ago, continues to actively operate in
Orientalism knowledge and China watching, [facilitated by its various
scientific, theoretical, and pedagogical guises]{.underline}. In this
context, self-reflection cannot be confined to individual China watchers
or even the China watching community. Never a purely personal pursuit or
even a disciplinary matter, China knowledge is always inextricably
linked with the general dynamism of Western knowledge, desire and power
in global politics. Its self-reflection should thus extend to the shared
collective self of the West, its assumed identity and associated foreign
policy (China policy in particular). If China can be seen as a
being-in-the-world, these issues are part and parcel of the world in
which China finds itself and relates to others. But until now they have
largely escaped the attention of China watchers. Maybe it is because
these are primarily the business of scholars of Western/American
culture, history and foreign relations, rather than that of China
scholars. After all, there is a need for division of labour in social
sciences. True, for various reasons it is unrealistic to expect China
scholars to be at the same time experts on those 'non-China' issues.
Nevertheless, [since China watchers both rely on and contribute to their
collective Western self-imagination in their understanding of China, it
is crucial that they look at their collective Western self in the
mirror]{.underline}. Take the negative image of China's brutal
Soviet-style sports system for example. Every now and then, such an
image will be reliably brought up to reinforce China's Otherness more
generally. But if the ways American young talents are trained are put
under the same spotlight, the difference between the US and China is no
longer as vast as it appears. 14 In doing so, the previous China image
is no longer as defensible as it seems. In brief, the broader point here
is that the same China may take on quite different meanings when we are
willing to subject ourselves to similar scrutiny. [We may **better
appreciate** why China looks the way it does when we are more
self-conscious of the various lenses, paradigms, and
fore-meanings]{.underline} through which we do China watching.
Conversely, we cannot fully comprehend why the Chinese behave in a
certain way until we pay attention to what we have done (to them), past
and present. Such [self-knowledge on the part of the West is essential
to a better grasp of China. Without the former, China knowledge is
incomplete and suspect]{.underline}. Yet, to many, self-reflection is at
best a luxurious distraction. At worst it amounts to navel-gazing and
could turn into 'a prolix and self-indulgent discourse that is divorced
from the real world'. 15 Such concern is hardly justified, however. [The
imagined Western self is integral to the real world, and critical
self-reflection also helps reconnect China watching to the 'real' world
of power relations]{.underline} to which it always belongs. [By making
one better aware of this connection, it helps open up space for
emancipatory knowledge]{.underline}. As Mannheim notes: The criterion of
such self-illumination is that not only the object but [we ourselves
fall squarely within our field of vision]{.underline}. We become
[visible to ourselves]{.underline}, not just vaguely as a knowing
subject as such but [in a certain role hitherto hidden from us, in a
situation hitherto impenetrable to us, and with motivations of which we
have not hitherto been aware]{.underline}. In such a moment
[the]{.underline} **[inner connection]{.underline}** [between our
role]{.underline}, our [motivations]{.underline}, and our [type and
manner of experiencing the world suddenly draws upon us.]{.underline}
Hence the paradox underlying these experiences, namely the opportunity
for relative emancipation from social determination, increases
proportionately with insight into this determination. 16 Still, there
may be a lingering fear that excessive reflectivity could undo much of
the hard-won China knowledge. But again to quote Mannheim, 'the
extension of our knowledge of the world is closely related to increasing
personal self-knowledge and self-control of the knowing personality'.17
Even when that does expose our lack of knowledge about China, **[all is
not lost]{.underline}**. Such [revelation is not a sign of ignorance,
but an essential building block in the edifice of China
knowledge]{.underline}. Confucius told us that 'To say that you know
when you do know and say that you do not know when you do not know---
that is \[the way to acquire\] knowledge'. 18 Thus, [the knowing subject
can emancipate itself from its delusion about its own
being;]{.underline} 19 [the real meaning of ignorance is that one claims
to know when one does not or cannot know.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} cynical [brilliance]{.underline} [of Vladimir
**Putin's** **propaganda**]{.underline} campaign [is that it
**exploited** **America's foundational commitment** to white
supremacy]{.underline}. [The term itself is so raw]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [so hideous]{.underline} that [it inspires an
allergy]{.underline} [to its usage within]{.underline} [mainstream
political]{.underline} [discourse]{.underline}. But no other
term---racism, white privilege, etc.---better captures the dynamic at
issue. White supremacy is exactly what it says on the label: a social
structure by which whites, a pseudoscientific grouping with [a
definition that changes over time as is
convenient](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003HQ3XHQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),
dominate America's complex and often informal hierarchies of power.

American history is many things, but among them is a catalog recording
the mutating shape of a white power structure and how that structure
responds to various challenges to its existence. Amongst white
supremacy's greatest contemporary triumphs is its portrayal of racism as
individual prejudice rather than maintenance of the social order. Our
schools teach children that racism is about hatred, and hatred is
disreputable---not that racism is about power, with hatred merely one
downstream effect amongst many. And so, nearly every day, the public
discourse shows another white person objecting that the definitions have
changed on them in a dizzying way. [Those]{.underline}
[objections]{.underline} [predictably]{.underline} [run a gamut
from [left](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/donald-trump-white-supremacy-and-the-discourse-of-panic.html) to [right](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/09/media/fox-news-laura-ingraham-tucker-carlson-white-nationalism/index.html)]{.underline},
[since]{.underline} [white supremacy's roots sink deeper]{.underline}
[in America than any mere political persuasion]{.underline}. [Putin\'s
trolls]{.underline} **[wisely selected a fuel source]{.underline}**
[that white Americans of all political stripes, **consciously** **or
not, ensure is inexhaustible**.]{.underline}

[With every tweet, Facebook post, YouTube]{.underline}
[video]{.underline} [and Tumblr page, Russia]{.underline}
[showed]{.underline} that [it understands America]{.underline} [with a
depth]{.underline} **[that prompts much of white America to avert its
eyes.]{.underline}** [Russian propaganda]{.underline} expertly
[grasped]{.underline} that [even the most meager challenges]{.underline}
[to white supremacy]{.underline} [prompt]{.underline} **[a politically
powerful]{.underline}** **[and useful white resistance]{.underline}**,
[and that]{.underline} this **[dynamic is a persistent
feature]{.underline}** [of American]{.underline} [life]{.underline}. All
[Russia]{.underline}---or any foreign power, or no foreign power at
all---needs to do is [**breathe** on the **embers** **until they
ignite**]{.underline}. [White supremacy **murders millions of people**,
**steals their wealth** to distribute]{.underline} [it up the social
ladder]{.underline}, **[and denies untold millions their true human
potential]{.underline}**. America does this to itself, and left
undisturbed, will continue doing it. Russia's only unique contribution
in 2016, and beyond, was to underscore the threat white supremacy poses
to U.S. national security.

The reactionary Russian political theorist [Alexander
Dugin](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-far-right-book-every-russian-general-reads) has
written explicitly on the benefits of operationalizing American white
supremacy for Russian benefit. While Dugin's true influence on Putin
remains a subject of debate, his 1997 tome The Foundations of
Geopolitics presaged the Russian active-measures campaign of the past
three years.   

"[It is]{.underline} especially [important]{.underline} [to introduce
geopolitical]{.underline} [disorder]{.underline} into internal American
activity, **[encouraging]{.underline}** all kinds of [**separatism**
**and ethnic, social and racial conflicts**]{.underline}, [actively
supporting all dissident movements]{.underline}---[extremist, racist,
and sectarian groups]{.underline}, thus **[destabilizing internal
political processes]{.underline}** in the U.S.,"
Dugin [wrote](https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/the-dangerous-philosopher-behind-putins-strategy-to-grow-russian-power-at-americas-expense).
His clarity might have benefitted the 2017 CIA-FBI-NSA intelligence
assessment.

To credibly put that into practice 20 years later, Russians merely
needed to be ready online. They observed the idioms adopted by left and
right online political subcultures and repurposed them, using "cultural,
linguistic and identity markers in their Twitter profiles to align
themselves with the shared values and norms of either the left- or
right-leaning clusters," write University of Washington researchers
Ahmer Arif, Leo G. Stewart and Kate Starbird in
a [paper](http://ahmerarif.com/papers/BLM-IRA.pdf) to be presented at an
academic conference in November.

IRA stereotypes were crude, speaking to how Russians understood the
social currency of their marks. One fake profile, hilariously titled
\@USA_Gunslinger, read: "They won't deny us our defense! Whether you're
agree \[sic\] with me or not, you're welcome here! If you don't want to
be welcomed, go f\*ck yourself." Another, anticipating Atlantic writer
Adam Serwer's thesis that contemporary white supremacy portrays itself
as[ disgusted by
racism](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-nationalists-delusion/546356/),
included "Anti Racism" in its profile alongside "Southern. Conservative.
Pro God." IRA Tumblrs attempting to portray themselves as black were
titled such things as [Hustle In A Trap and Ghetta
Blasta](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-believes-there-is-a-conspiracy-to-submarine-the-kavanaugh-nomination?ref=scroll).
But the accounts, whether left or right, showed more sophistication---at
least on a level analogous to what a machine could spit out, given
enough data---in their appropriation of how authentic accounts within
the targeted groups spoke to one another.

"[What]{.underline} [really]{.underline} [struck me i]{.underline}n
studying the activities of these accounts up close, [was the level of
knowledge]{.underline} [they demonstrated of American
culture]{.underline}," Arif told The Daily Beast. "They talked about the
movies, they talked about specific holidays and things like that, so it
speaks to an organized, kind of a digital marketing operation, almost,
knowing your audience really thoroughly ... \[For\] a country that is
already divided in some ways by things like race and politics, this is a
case of someone coming along and giving us just a little nudge."

Arif and his colleagues didn't set out to study the IRA. As academics
examining human-computer interaction, they wanted to examine the online
discourse around Black Lives Matter. But last year, after Twitter and
Facebook began shuttering accounts associated with the IRA, they noticed
Russian accounts popping up with sufficient frequency in Black Lives
Matter discussions that they studied that phenomenon on its own. Their
preliminary work has already attracted coverage in [Mother
Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/russian-trolls-hyped-anger-over-black-lives-matter-more-than-previously-known/), [The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/trump-russia-twitter/551093/) and [Mashable](https://mashable.com/2018/01/22/drawing-lines-of-contention-study-twitter-university-of-washington/#zUuNBZbpbmq8),
but their final product has more information about, among other things,
"what content they were propagating," Arif said.

[What they found matched]{.underline} [a series]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} 2017 exclusives from The Daily Beast that showed [white
supremacy]{.underline} was never far from the surface of surreptitious
[Russian propaganda]{.underline}. [The fake]{.underline} [group
**SecuredBorders**]{.underline} [urged a real-life rally]{.underline} in
Idaho in August 2016 under the cry, "[We must stop taking in Muslim
refugees!](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russia-used-facebook-events-to-organize-anti-immigrant-rallies-on-us-soil)"
[The **IRA** Twitter account]{.underline} Being Patriotic [**called on**
**followers** **to** actually **kill Black Lives Matter
activists**:]{.underline} "[[Arrest and shoot every sh\*thead taking
part in burning our flag! #BLM vs
#USA](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-appear-to-use-facebook-to-push-pro-trump-flash-mobs-in-florida)."]{.underline}

It's true that the Russians also impersonated what they saw as left-wing
and nonwhite American audiences. Arif and his colleagues have documented
the IRA pretending to be both #BlackLivesMatter and its white-backlash
antagonist #AllLivesMatter. But a look at the substance of the messaging
the Russians geared to an ostensibly non-white audience looks distinctly
congruent with the prejudices reflected by its white right-wing one.
When the IRA pretended to be non-white, it portrayed its fabricated
in-group as threatening, provocative or anti-American.

A Facebook page [impersonating the United Muslims of
America](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russians-impersonated-real-american-muslims-to-stir-chaos-on-facebook-and-instagram) pushed
memes falsely claiming the U.S., and particularly the Russian
adversaries Hillary Clinton and John McCain, created ISIS---before
claiming that Clinton was the guardian of Muslim interests. Arif's paper
notes that the IRA impostor group BlackMatters pushed a series of
inflammatory gifs purporting to show police officers sexually assaulting
a black teenage girl---which participants in the #BlackLivesMatter
hashtag subsequently debunked. "\[T\]he video incident functioned both
to further stoke anti-police sentiments on the left and, once it was
debunked, increase anti-BlackLivesMatter sentiments on the right," Arif,
Stewart and Starbird write.

The Russians posturing as Black Lives Matter "favored an uncompromising
and adversarial stance towards law enforcement," they found. "This
activity feeds directly into attempts to frame #BlackLivesMatter as an
anti-police hate group. From prior research we know that such framings
were actively resisted and addressed by #BlackLivesMatter activists...
\[T\]hese accounts did not just speak to the communities that they were
pretending to be a part of, but also aimed to communicate an
antagonistic representation of those communities to others."

That strategy is on display in Europe as well as America. According to a
knowledgeable European Union official who was not cleared to talk to a
journalist, social media accounts strongly suspected of being Russian
cutouts are waving digital red flags to ideologically contrary
audiences. In the run-up to the September 9 election in Sweden, the EU
official noticed pro-refugee messaging emanating from suspected
Russia-controlled accounts, aimed this time at audiences expected to
feel anxious about immigration. "You strengthen the grievances, and then
exploit" them, the official told The Daily Beast.

While each surreptitious Russian influence campaign is distinctly
tailored to its particular audience, [continuities amongst
them]{.underline} [point to the particular sort of chaos]{.underline}
[in the West]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Kremlin
considers beneficial. **It inflames**]{.underline} a sense of grievance
amongst a **[white overclass]{.underline}** [which fears the collapse of
its social, political and economic supremacy]{.underline}. It inflates
even the most modest challenge to that supremacy as an attack on its
fundamental way of life, essentializing entire national histories to
nothing more than white prerogatives. This is how immigration becomes
perceived as an invasion, [Black Lives Matter becomes a "[domestic
terror
outfit](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/25/vermont-high-school-fly-black-lives-matter-flag/),"]{.underline}
[and the [poor white masses feel besieged into
silence](https://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/03/07/people-tiny-irish-town-taking-hundreds-migrants-no-say-scared-called-racist/)]{.underline} [before
crying out for a champion to make them feel great again.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON --- The **[Russian]{.underline}**
**[government]{.underline}** [has **stepped up efforts**]{.underline}
[to inflame racial tensions]{.underline} in the United States [as part
of its bid to [influence November's presidential

**trying to incite violence** by white supremacist groups]{.underline}
[and to stoke anger among African-Americans]{.underline}, according to
seven American officials briefed on recent intelligence.

[Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/world/europe/russia-school-shooting.html)'s
lead intelligence agency, the S.V.R., has apparently gone beyond 2016
methods
of [interference](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/us/politics/election-interference-russia-2020-assessment.html),
[when operatives tried]{.underline} [to stoke racial

Matter groups** and spreading disinformation to **[depress black voter
turnout](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/us/politics/russia-2016-influence-campaign.html).**]{.underline}
Now, [Russia is]{.underline} also [trying to influence white
supremacist]{.underline} [groups]{.underline}, the officials said; they
gave few details, but one official said federal investigators are
examining how at least one neo-Nazi organization with ties to Russia is
funded.

[Other Russian efforts]{.underline}, [which American intelligence
agencies have tracked]{.underline}, [involve]{.underline} [simply
prodding white nationalists]{.underline} [to more aggressively
spread]{.underline} [hate messages and amplifying their]{.underline}
[invective]{.underline}. [**Russian** **operatives** are]{.underline}
also **[trying to push black extremist groups toward
violence]{.underline}**, according to multiple officials, though they
did not detail how.

[Russia's]{.underline} more [public influence operations]{.underline},
[like state-backed news organizations]{.underline}, have [continued to
**push divisive racial narratives**]{.underline}, including stories
emphasizing allegations of police abuse in the United States and
highlighting racism against African-Americans within the military.

And [as social media companies]{.underline} [more vigilantly
monitor]{.underline} [for foreign activity]{.underline} than they did in
2016, Russia has also adjusted its methods to evade detection. Rather
than disseminate messages as widely as possible, as in 2016, Russian
operatives are using private Facebook groups, posts on the online
message board 4chan and closed chat rooms that are more difficult to
monitor, according to intelligence officials.

[Russia's primary goal]{.underline}, according to several officials
briefed on the intelligence who spoke on condition of anonymity to
discuss sensitive information, **[is to foster a sense of
chaos]{.underline}** in the United States, though its motivations are
under debate and difficult to decipher in the absence of high-level
intelligence sources inside Moscow.

The direct effect of its interference on presidential politics is less
clear, though some American officials said that Russia believed that
acts of violence could bolster President Trump's re-election bid if he
could argue that a response to such an episode demanded continuity and
that he represented a law-and-order approach.

The F.B.I. and other intelligence agencies declined to comment on
specific Russian activities.

"[We see Russia is willing to conduct more brazen]{.underline} [and
disruptive influence operations]{.underline} [because of how it
perceives its conflict with the West]{.underline}," David Porter, a top
agent on the F.B.I.'s Foreign Influence Task Force, said last month at
an election security conference in Washington.

He added, "To put it simply, in this space, Russia wants to watch us
tear ourselves apart."

Because Russia is trying to amplify the messaging of existing groups,
its interference is difficult for American officials to combat given
First Amendment protections for speech. The government does have the
legal authority to stop hate speech that explicitly advocates violence,
and social media companies continue to take down accounts linked to
Russian intelligence or disinformation groups.

[Attempts]{.underline} [to exacerbate racial divisions]{.underline} [are
**only one strand**]{.underline} [of Russia's influence
operations]{.underline} in 2020; [Moscow's intelligence]{.underline}
[agencies]{.underline} [promote a variety of narratives]{.underline}
a[nd divisive issues.]{.underline} But [perhaps no more difficult issue
exists]{.underline} in the United States **[than racial justice and
privilege]{.underline}**, and [officials]{.underline} expressed
[worry]{.underline} that **[amplifying divisions]{.underline}** [among
races]{.underline} [could do the most damage to]{.underline} [the
country's social fabric.]{.underline}

The Russian intelligence services took note of the divisive nature of
the 2017 white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., which led to
the death of a counterprotester, and concluded that promoting hate
groups was the most effective method of sowing discord in the United
States, according to American intelligence reports described by the
officials.

Some American officials believe that Russia is trying to undermine
American democracy and the nation's standing in the world by driving
debate to the extremes.

"One of [Russia's]{.underline} [goals]{.underline} [is weakening
institutions]{.underline} [and the **weaponization of
race**]{.underline} is a way they can do that," said Laura Rosenberger,
the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. "A divided America
is a weaker America. When we are unable to solve our challenges
together, [Russia is more able to flex its power around the
world."]{.underline}

[Unprecedented]{.underline} [growth]{.underline} [in the
number]{.underline} [and influence]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
right-wing [nationalist populist]{.underline} [movements]{.underline}
and political parties [have]{.underline} [characterised]{.underline}
[the first two decades]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [21st
century.]{.underline} 

[Brexit]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [election of
Trump]{.underline} [represent **only the tip**]{.underline} [of this
global iceberg]{.underline}. Brazil has seen the election of Bolsonaro,
a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage and race equality initiatives; in
**[France islamophobic]{.underline}** National Front
**[leader]{.underline}** [Marine Le Pen]{.underline} [was the
**runner**]{.underline} [**up** in the 2017 presidential
election]{.underline}; **[Austria's Freedom]{.underline}**
**[Party]{.underline}**, which [has vowed to ban]{.underline}
[free]{.underline} [distribution of the Koran]{.underline}, **[has won
over 25 per cent]{.underline}** of the national vote and has been part
of a coalition government. 

[Meanwhile]{.underline}, in Germany, the **[Alternative for
Germany]{.underline}**, a party with distinct neo-Nazi overtones, now
**[has 94 seats in the Bundestag]{.underline}** (parliament) and is the
largest opposition party. [Likewise, in]{.underline} [Switzerland, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden,]{.underline} [Finland and Norway,
right-wing national populists]{.underline} [have]{.underline} **[gained
a significant share of votes]{.underline}** and parliamentary
representation. In Italy the xenophobic Legal Nord has been in
government, while in Hungary and Poland authoritarian populist parties
have been in government and have begun to dismantle independent
judiciaries, repress dissent and even explicitly call for illiberal
democracy. And so on.

But how and in what ways is racism involved in the phenomenal growth of
this nationalist right-wing populism? First, it helps to define
populism. At a minimum, populist ideology posits an opposition between a
'pure' people and a 'corrupt' political elite which is out of touch and
is responsible for the damage caused to the nation or people. Populist
electoral strategy is then based on a promise to rein in the power of
this elite, rid it of corruption, and restore the fortunes of the
people. There is usually a crucial element in which populists argue that
there are internal or external 'others' who are involved in the downward
fortunes of the genuine 'people' of the nation. It is in this way that
racism can be inserted as an important part of the message. These others
may be the EU, minorities, recent or even third generation immigrants,
refugees or economic migrants, such as the Mexicans so strongly evoked
by Trump as posing a strong economic and cultural threat to white
Americans. Even the EU has created an external, xenophobic and
racialised threat by a short-lived attempt to rebrand the head of the
EU's migration policy as 'the commissioner for protecting the European
way of life'. 

Sociologists and political scientists have argued that there are four
main causes that explain the rise of nationalist right-wing populism,
some aligned with the definition above. The four components are: a
distrust of corrupt or out of touch power elites; a fear of the
destruction of national cultures and identities; relative deprivation;
and a dealignment between mainstream parties and electorates. This last
issue is a phenomenon particularly reflected in the poor showing of
social democratic, labour parties which have seen their working- class
voter base eroded by the nationalist populists.

Each of these four main causes are intertwined with racism or
racialisation in one form or another. The distrust of political elites
is partly related to the unwillingness or inability of national elites
to curb immigration, especially Muslim immigration. Muslims are
racialised as practising a distinctly non-white way of life that is
supposedly completely at variance with the 'Western' or 'European'
culture. Relative deprivation in the form of a fall in living standards
is easily blamed on the arrival of immigrants and refugees, and this is
indeed what right-wing populists tend to do. The restructuring of the
usual pact between working-class electorates and social democratic
parties has occurred in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis in
which social democratic parties, rather than the financial sector and
its elites, are blamed for profligacy and being supposedly 'soft' on
welfare 'scroungers', especially non-white immigrants (although white
Eastern Europeans have also been caught up in a form of racialised,
xenophobic framing).

[What brings all these]{.underline} [elements]{.underline}
[together]{.underline} [is]{.underline} what has been called the
**[ideology of 'nativism']{.underline}**. "[Britain]{.underline}
[first]{.underline}", as the murderer of the British MP Jo Cox shouted
as he killed her**[,  echoes Trump's 'America first']{.underline}**, and
'[Germany for Germans']{.underline} [or 'Sweden for the
Swedes',]{.underline} always with the strong sense that the 'true' or
'genuine' natives who are being defended are white. Trump's rallying cry
'[**Make America Great Again'** has been]{.underline} [**perceived**
**as** a thinly veiled call for making America]{.underline} '**[white
again']{.underline}**, notwithstanding the fact that the earliest
Americans we know were non-white indigenous peoples (formerly labelled
'Red Indians'). In the case of Britain (and this might be extended to
the whole of Western Europe), [**the fantasy of an original**, **pure**
**white population is belied**]{.underline} [by the fact that the
earliest Briton discovered so far]{.underline} (the so-called 'Cheddar
Man' whose remains were found in the Cheddar gorge) [would today be
identified as black]{.underline}.

[Right-wing national populism,]{.underline} **[then, is a
thoroughly]{.underline}** **[racialised phenomenon]{.underline}**. Not
all those who support nativism would see themselves as racist, but
[the]{.underline} [consequences of adopting]{.underline} [a nativist
stance]{.underline} **[draws one into territory that is certainly
stained with racism.]{.underline}**

Indigenous Resurgence"; Chapter 10 in *Pessimism in International

[**Pessimism [Trap]{.mark}** 2]{.underline}: The [[State is **Unified**,
**Deliberate** and **Unchanging** in]{.underline}]{.mark} Its [[Desire
to Dispossess Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} and Gain]{.underline}
Unfettered [Access to Indigenous Lands and Resources]{.underline}

In other words, [[colonialism]{.mark} by settler states
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[constant]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[variable]{.underline}]{.mark}, in both
outcome and intent. Further, the state is not only intentionally
colonial, but it is also unified in its desire to co-opt Indigenous
peoples as a method and means of control.

In 2005\'s Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, \'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart\'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
\'self-termination movement\', Alfred states, \'It is senseless to
advocate for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and
intense ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful
to us: our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to
land\'.23

Alfred\'s Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that \'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories\'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but \'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream\'.25 According to Alfred, the
state \'relegates indigenous peoples\' rights to the past, and
constrains the development of their societies by allowing only those
activities that support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous
peoples today do not present a serious challenge to its legitimacy\'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state\'s desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
\'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny
it a voice\', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years,
\'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to
it\'.27 According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders
and \'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands
to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a \"solution\" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie\'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard\'s central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
\'colonized subjects\', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
\'misrecog-nition\' granted through the state but can even come to
identify with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now
works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping
their perspectives in line with state discourses, rather than merely
excluding them, as in years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek \'the
reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still
colonial insofar as it remains structurally committed to the
dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and self-determining
authority\'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples\' self-determination claims in ways that \'jeopardize the
futures of indigenous communities\'.31 He claims that states first
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deem-phasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} move, Corntassel [[limits and]{.mark}
**actually [demeans]{.mark}** [Indigenous agency]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[overlooking]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[reality]{.mark} that
**[Indigenous organisations]{.mark} themselves**
[chose]{.mark}]{.underline} the human rights [framework and rights
discourse [as]{.mark}]{.underline} a [target [sphere of
action]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely [[because]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
was evident in [earlier [struggles like slavery]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[civil rights or women\'s rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, these were
[[tools]{.underline}]{.mark} available to them that [[had a
proven]{.mark} track [record of opening up]{.mark} **new
[possibilities]{.mark}** [and shifting previous **state**]{.mark}
**positions** and [behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous advocates
also cleverly realised, by the 1970s, that the anti-discrimination and
decolonisation frames could be used together against states. States did,
in no way, nefariously impose a rights framework on Indigenous peoples.
Rather, [Indigenous organisations and]{.underline} savvy [[Indigenous
political actors]{.mark} **[deliberately chose]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
frame their self-determination struggles within the human rights
framework in order to bring states into a double bind where they could
not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim that they uphold
equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous peoples\' human rights
and leaving them with a diminished and unequal right of
self-determination. But, because he is caught [in the **pessimism
[trap]{.mark}** [of seeing the state]{.mark} only [as]{.mark} unified,
deliberate and [unchanging]{.mark}]{.underline}, Corntassel [[overlooks
and diminishes]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**clear story** of Indigenous
agency and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for **positive
change**]{.mark} in advancing self-determination in]{.underline} a
[multitude of ways]{.underline}.

[**Pessimism Trap** 3]{.underline}: [Engagement with]{.underline} the
[Settler State is Futile]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive

Since the state always intends to maintain, if not expand, colonial
control, and is seeking to co-opt as many Indigenous peoples as possible
in order to maintain or expand its dispossession and control, it is
therefore futile, at best, and actually dangerous to Indigenous
existence to engage with the state. Furthermore, all patterns of
engagement will lead to co-optation as the state is cunning and
unrelenting in its desire to co-opt Indigenous leaders, academics and
professionals in order to gain or maintain control of Indigenous
peoples.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and \'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating\'.32 Alfred states that a \'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions\'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is \'precluded by the
state\'s insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of
sovereignty\'.34 Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous
communities frame their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal
rights and title, but do so within a state framework, rather than
resisting the state itself, it \'represents the culmination of white
society\'s efforts to assimilate indigenous peoples\'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, \'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position
that calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to \"turn away\" from
the assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
\"traditional\" political values and practices\'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1\. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples\' existence;

2\. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\. Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
need for Indigenous resurgence movements \'to address the interrelated
systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples\' experiences in
both urban and land-based settings\'38;

4\. Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and reflective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state\'s political and legal
system, he does assert that \'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political configurations of power that we
initially sought.to challenge\'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for
\'critical self-reflection, skepticism, and caution\' in a \'resurgent
politics of recognition that seeks to practice decolonial,
gender-emancipatory, and economically non-exploitative alternative
structures of law and sovereign authority grounded on a critical
refashioning of the best of Indigenous legal and political
traditions\'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel\'s observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink \'boomerang model\' and \'channels the energies
of transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries\', by which an \'illusion of inclusion\' is created.41
He argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel finds that \'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities\'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly \'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice\'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide \'illusions of
inclusion\' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
\'channeled\' and \'blunted\' by colonial state actors, \'it is a
critical time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to
bringing Indigenous rights concerns to global forums\'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic \'Resurgence\' Versus the
Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

All of these writers advocate Indigenous resurgence, through a
combination of rejecting the current reconciliation politics of settler
colonial states, coupled with a return to land-based Indigenous
expressions of governance as the only viable, \'authentic\' and
legitimate path to a better future for Indigenous peoples, which they
refer to as decolonisation. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, all three theorists are also caught
in the same three pessimism traps: authenticity versus co-option; a
vision of the state as unified, deliberate and never changing in its
desire to colonise and control; and a view of engagement with the state
as futile, if not dangerous, to Indigenous sovereignty and existence.
When combined, [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} three pessimism traps [aim
to [inhibit Indigenous peoples\' engagement with]{.mark} the [state
in]{.mark} **any [process]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}]{.underline} could
potentially [re-imagine and [re-formulate]{.mark} their **current
[relationship]{.mark}** [into one]{.mark}]{.underline} that could be
[[transformative and post-colonial]{.underline}]{.mark}, as envisioned
by the [**[UN]{.mark}** **[D]{.mark}**eclaration on the
**[R]{.mark}**ights of **[I]{.mark}**ndigenous
**[P]{.mark}**eoples]{.underline}. The [pessimism traps together
work]{.underline} to [[foreclose]{.mark} any
[possibility]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[there could be]{.mark}
**credible [openings]{.mark}** [of opportunity to negotiate]{.mark} a
[fairer]{.mark}]{.underline} and just [[relationship]{.mark} of
co-existence [with]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
most progressive [[state]{.mark} government]{.underline}.

This pessimistic approach is not innocuous. By [**over[emphasising
structure]{.mark}** and granting the state]{.underline} an [enormous
degree of agency]{.underline} as a unitary actor, this [pessimistic
approach [does]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**remarkable
[disservice]{.mark}** [to Indigenous resistance]{.mark} movements [by
proscribing]{.mark}]{.underline}, from academia, [an **extremely
[narrow]{.mark}** [view of what]{.mark} Indigenous
[self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline} can and [[should
mean]{.underline}]{.mark} in practice. By [[overlooking
and]{.underline}]{.mark}/or [[discounting Indigenous]{.mark}
agency]{.underline} and [not]{.underline} even [considering]{.underline}
the [possibility]{.underline} that [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}
could [themselves]{.underline} be [calculating]{.underline},
**[strategic [political actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their own
right, and vis-a-vis states, the [pessimistic lens]{.underline} of the
resurgence school [unnecessarily]{.underline}, [unproductively and
[unjustly limits]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[field of possibility]{.mark}
for Indigenous peoples]{.underline}\' decision-making, thus actually
countering and inhibiting expressions of Indigenous self-determination.
By [condemning]{.underline}---writ large---all [Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} and organisations [that wish]{.underline} to seek
[peaceful co-existence with the state]{.underline}, negotiate mutually
beneficial agreements with the state, and/or who have advocated on the
international level for a set of standards that can provide a positive
guiding framework for Indigenous-state relations, the [pessimistic
lens]{.underline} of resurgence forecloses much potential for new and
improved relations, in any form, and is [very likely to lead to **deeper
conflicts**]{.underline} between states and Indigenous peoples,
[and]{.underline} potentially, even [violent action]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. The [pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are]{.underline} therefore,
likely [[self-defeating]{.underline}]{.mark} for all but the most remote
and isolated Indigenous communities. Further, this [approach
is]{.underline} quite [[out of step with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
actions and [[vision of]{.mark} **many [Indigenous]{.mark} resistance**
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} on the ground who have been [working for
decades to advance Indigenous self-determination]{.underline}, both
domestically and globally, [in ways that transform the colonial
state]{.underline} into something more just [and]{.underline} may
[eventually present **creative alternatives** to]{.underline} the
[Westphalian state form in ways that]{.underline} could respect and
[accommodate Indigenous nations]{.underline}. Rather, it [aims to
**shame** and **blame**]{.underline} those who wish to explore creative
and innovative post-colonial resolutions to the colonial condition.

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration
or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 after 25
years of development. The Declaration is ground-breaking, given the key
leadership roles Indigenous peoples played in negotiating and achieving
this agreement.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN history, the
rights holders, Indigenous peoples, worked with states to develop an
instrument that would serve to promote, protect and affirm Indigenous
rights, both globally and in individual domestic contexts.46

Many Indigenous organisations and movements, from dozens of countries
around the world, were involved in drafting and negotiating the UN
Declaration and are now advocating for its full implementation, both
internationally and in domestic and regional contexts. In Canada, some
of the key organisational players --- the Grand Council of the Crees
(Eeyou Istchee), the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British
Columbia Indian Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations --- were
involved in the drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration
during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations
like the American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights
Fund have been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous
peoples\' governing institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council
and the Sami Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous
rights. In Latin America, organisations like the Confederation de
Nationalidades Indfgenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de
Sud America (CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration.
The three, major transnational Indigenous organisations --- the World
Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty Council
and the Inuit Circumpolar Council --- were all key members of the
drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration, and the latter
two, which are still in existence, continue their strong advocacy for
its full implementation.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires [[fundamental]{.mark} and **significant
[change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, on both the international and domestic
levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights essentially calls
for a complete and fundamental restructuring of Indigenous-state
relationships, it expects states to enact and implement a significant
body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy changes that can
accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights, free, prior and
informed consent, redress and a variety of self-government, autonomy and
other such arrangements. States are not going to implement this
multifaceted and complex set of changes on their own, however. They will
require significant political and moral pressure to hold them
accountable to the rhetorical commitments they have made to support this
level of change. They will also [[require]{.mark} ongoing
conversation]{.underline} and negotiation [with Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} along the way, [lest]{.underline} the [process
becomes **problematically one-sided**]{.underline}. Such processes
ultimately [require [sustained **political**]{.mark}
**will**]{.underline}, [commitment]{.underline} and [[engagement]{.mark}
over the long term]{.underline}, to [[reach]{.mark} the [end result of
**radical**]{.mark} **systemic [change]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
Indigenous state relationships grounded in mutual respect, co-existence
and reciprocity. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} type of fundamental change
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} creative thinking, careful diplomacy,
tenacity, and above all, [optimistic [vision]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[on
the part of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. The pessimistic
approaches of the resurgence school are ultimately of little use in
these efforts, other than as a cautionary tale against state power, of
which the organisational players are already keenly aware. Further, [by
[dismissing and discouraging]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[efforts at
engagement with states]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
especially with the [blanket [accusations]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[all]{.mark} who engage]{.underline} in such [[efforts
are]{.underline}]{.mark} \'[[co-opted]{.underline}]{.mark}\' [[and
not]{.underline}]{.mark} \'**[[authentically]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'
[[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}, the resurgence school actually
[[creates **unnecessary**]{.mark} **negative** feelings and
[divisions]{.mark} amongst Indigenous movements]{.underline} who should
be pooling limited resources and working together towards better
futures.

#### Putin's disinformation is disguising food crisis in Africa

European governments have been alarmed by [a Russian]{.underline}
[disinformation]{.underline} campaign that **[seeks to deflect
criticism]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin's
wa]{.underline}r [with]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline} [risks leaving
**millions of people in Africa**]{.underline} [facing
famine.]{.underline}

[**Russian diplomats** have gone on a **media offensive**]{.underline}
**[in recent months]{.underline}** [**to push the narrative** **that
sanctions**,]{.underline} [**rather than Russian** **blockades, are
causing shortages of grains and fertilizer in Africa**]{.underline}. The
public-relations onslaught shows how the monthslong war in Ukraine is
becoming a global propaganda battle as food, fuel and crop-nutrient
prices surge.

EU and U.K. officials who've recently met their African counterparts at
meetings in New York and Rwanda expressed concern that the Russian
message is gaining traction, said senior European diplomats who asked
not to be identified. In response, [European governments
are]{.underline} [increasing]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
[engagement]{.underline} [with leaders]{.underline} [on the]{.underline}
[continent]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [boosting]{.underline} [their
own information]{.underline} [campaigns to counter the
Russian]{.underline} [narrative]{.underline}, the diplomats said.

A senior European intelligence officer said the Kremlin had manufactured
the debate as a means to get sanctions lifted and was intent on using
the threat of global hunger as a bargaining tool in any future peace
talks. [Moscow has focused much of its influence]{.underline}
[operations on Africa and the Middle]{.underline} East, the official
said.

The Ideals of the American Republic

[The stakes in the Russo-American conflict are **high**]{.underline}.

[and]{.underline} [the **institution of democracy itself** in the United
States and the West.]{.underline}1 [He [is trying to interfere

**choose their leaders freely**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and is
undermining]{.mark} the **[rules-based international

**prosperity** and [**security** rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. [His actions
in Ukraine and Syria have driven the **world** toward **greater

likely **[prompt other s]{.mark}tates [to emulate his behavior]{.mark}**
[and cause]{.mark} further **[deterioration of]{.mark} the international
[system.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Moscow's war on]{.mark} the **very idea of [truth]{.mark}** has been
perhaps the most **damaging** Russian undertaking in recent
years]{.underline}. [The most basic element of the Russian information
strategy]{.underline}, which we will consider in more detail presently,
[is the creation of a sense of **uncertainty** around **any important
issue**]{.underline}. [Russia's strategy does not require persuading
Western audiences that its actions in]{.underline} Ukraine's
[Crimea]{.underline}n Peninsula [or the Kerch Strait]{.underline}, which
connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, for example, [were legal or

falsehoods and accusations of falsehoods which]{.underline}, **[[if left
unchecked]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[will]{.mark} ultimately [make civil

#### Russian misinformation causes sexism

Eric

She is far from alone. [Female politicians]{.underline} [and other
high]{.underline} [profile]{.underline} [women]{.underline} **[worldwide
are facing a deluge]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} what you could call
**[sexualized disinformation]{.underline}**. It mixes old ingrained
sexist attitudes with the anonymity and reach of social media in an
effort to destroy women's reputations and push them out of public life.

Several female politicians in the small Caucasian nation of Georgia were
the victims of a sexualized disinformation campaign last year, in the
run-up to parliamentary elections. [A series of videos]{.underline}
[purportedly]{.underline} [showing them having sex]{.underline} [were
released online]{.underline}, with intimidating messages. [The goal was
to **spread "fear"**]{.underline} **[among women]{.underline}**
**[involved in politics]{.underline}**, says Tamara Chergoleishvili, a
prominent journalist and activist, whose husband is a well-known
opposition politician. Georgia is a very conservative country where
patriarchal attitudes remain strong, so that made the attack more
potent. To underline the point, [the message was]{.underline}
[accompanied]{.underline} [by doctored images]{.underline} [purporting
to show]{.underline} [her totally naked.]{.underline}

Chergoleishvili was targeted too, in a video supposedly showing her
engaged in sex with two other people. But Chergoleishvili says it was a
fake. "They didn't know I've had a huge tattoo on my back since, like,
2000," she laughs.

Though it backfired in her case, another female politician implicated in
an extramarital affair as a result of the videos has all but retreated
from Georgian political life.

By contrast, [the men who featured have not suffered]{.underline},
["because male adultery is a common thing]{.underline}," says
Chergoleishvili. "Maybe the family suffered, but society would be less
judgemental, whereas women are supposed to be the Virgin Mary. They're
not supposed to have sex."

There was one exception. A man who appeared in the video aimed at
Chergoleishvili was labelled as "gay," which put him at extreme risk
because of deep-seated homophobic attitudes in Georgia. "It took a long
time for him to get over that," she recalls.

Like Chergoleishvili, Zalishchuk has withstood the attacks against her,
and continues to maintain a high profile. But she can't escape her naked
doppelganger. "Whenever I speak publicly somewhere abroad, someone will
comment on it \[on social media\]," the Ukrainian MP says, often adding
a link to the photo. "I have no resources to fight that." "It was all
intended to discredit me as a personality, to devalue me, and what I'm
saying." Ukrainian MP Svitlana Zalishchuk

[Zalishchuk]{.underline} **[suspects a pro-Kremlin hand]{.underline}**
[in the]{.underline} abuse she has experienced, **[as it started at the
height of the conflict with Russia.]{.underline}** [And the **fake
claims** and **doctored images** **first** **appeared** **on pro-Kremlin
platforms.**]{.underline} But whatever the case, it has become a
worldwide problem for any women who takes a position online.

[The use of realistic pictures]{.underline} --- which [is easy to
achieve]{.underline} [with modern software]{.underline} --- [adds to the
potency]{.underline} **[of these misogynistic disinformation
campaigns]{.underline}**, says Sandra Pepera, director of Gender, Women,
and Democracy programs at the National Democratic Institute, in
Washington, D.C. "[Obscene harassment is]{.underline} [bad
enough,]{.underline} [but the visualization of it is what tips
the]{.underline} [balance]{.underline}."

Such abuse is becoming almost part of the job for female politicians.
But logging off to try to escape is not really an option, as being on
social media is such a crucial part of being a modern-day politician.

In Georgia, the government eventually condemned the release of the sex
tapes, and they were removed from YouTube. But that could not mitigate
the damage entirely, as the names of those shown in the videos spread
widely. And intimidation like this can have a smothering effect on
female engagement in politics, says the NDI's Pepera, "limiting both the
number of women able to participate online and the range of issues
discussed."

And in countries where violence against women is common, [online slurs
can **quickly translate into direct**]{.underline} **[physical
threats]{.underline}**. "If it happens to you and you're Hillary Clinton
that's one thing," says Pepera. "If that happens to you and you're in
Indonesia, Malaysia, or Pakistan, you could pay for it with your life."

[There is more awareness]{.underline} [now of the the
threat]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [sexualised abuse
online]{.underline}, [but both governments]{.underline} [and
the]{.underline} [social media giants]{.underline} **[have yet to
come]{.underline}** **[up with an]{.underline}** **[effective
response]{.underline}**. [Sexualized disinformation]{.underline}
[mixes]{.underline} [old ingrained sexist attitudes]{.underline} [with
the anonymity]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [reach of social media in
an effort to **destroy women's**]{.underline} [**reputations and push
them out of public** **life.**]{.underline}

**Kamanā 22**, ABC News, (Lia, "As tensions rise in Ukraine, impacts
will be felt in Hawai\'i", ABC News, February 22,

//CHC-DS

President Joe Biden announcing major economic sanctions against Russia
on Tuesday, following Russian president Vladimir Putin\'s move of troops
into the eastern region of Ukraine. While Putin called it a peacekeeping
mission, the U.S. calls it a flagrant violation of international law. In
Hawaii, Ukraine may seem like a world away, but the impacts of the
situation in eastern Europe will be felt on its shores. \"When you are
in a place like Hawaii and you are thinking thank goodness we aren\'t
right next door to the war, you need to start questioning what does it
mean, what kind of precedent does it mean that international boundaries
don\'t matter,\" said Jairus Grove, associate professor of international
studies at the University of Hawaii Grove says how the situation in
Ukraine plays out, could have lasting consequences. [\"This is calling
into question what NATO is for, this is calling into question what the
U.S. can do without firing shots,\" Grove said.]{.underline}

Using an example from Thomas C. Schelling\'s, \'Arms and Influence,\'
[Grove says there are two different things that military power does.
\"**First it deters**, it prevents another state from attacking you,\"
said Grove. \"**Then, there is** having so much power because of
military might you can have **compellence** which means without firing a
shot you can compel a state to do what you would like it to
do.\"]{.underline} Grove says for most of our lifetimes, we have lived
with the belief that the United States has compellence. Now, [he thinks
Putin has kind of called the bluff on that belief, and how the U.S.
continues to react will be watched closely by other adversaries. \"Once
one state calls your bluff, you kind of wait for the next one to do it
and the United States will be put to a choice, when do we decide that
it's not a bluff, when are we actually willing to fight and that is the
conversation we need to have,\" said Grove]{.underline}. Among the
sanctions issued Tuesday, Feb. 22: cutting off Russia\'s government from
western finances, which means the country can no longer trade in its new
debt on U.S. or European markets. But [Grove was quick to point out,
sanctions only work if they are painful and if they are a painful they
are probably working in a way we aren\'t going to like]{.underline}. One
example is at the gas pump where Hawai\'i will continue to see prices
rise. \"We are market takers and so we tend to purchase the oil on the
market where we can get it cheapest and over the last few years, 34% or
about 1/3 of all oil comes from Russia so from that stand point it has a
major impact on us,\" said Chris Yunker, Managing Director, Resiliency,
Clean Transportation, and Analytics, with the Hawai\'i State Energy
Office. [According to Grove, the problem lies in if the sanctions don\'t
work though. \"That means **we don\'t have a way to constrain Russia
without using military force**,\" said Grove]{.underline}. [Grove says
he thinks Putin over the last several years has built a large enough
counter financial network outside of the sanctions that he can keep
investment and capital coming in]{.underline}. \"He has a lot to lose
politically by kowtowing to the sanctions,\" said Grove. \"I would be
surprised. The domestic costs would be high for him and I don't know if
he will even feel the pinch.\" [Only time will tell whether or not
sanctions work to deter Russia, but Grove says this will be a period of
tremendous uncertainty and rapid change.]{.underline}

He does believe the probability of a direct war between the U.S. and
Russia is less than zero, saying he doesn\'t see Biden committing U.S.
troops to this particular conflict. [\"]{.underline}But what this can
do, is this conflict can spread and that poses the question of [**if
Russia takes Ukraine too easily, will Putin set his eyes elsewhere**,\"
said Grove.]{.underline}

//CHC-DS

"We ... have a lot of anti-war activists in the state who watch these
kinds of humanitarian catastrophes very closely," said Grove. "We have a
lot of people who are uniformed members of the U.S. military, who I\'m
sure are already thinking, 'Is this a conflict that the United States is
going to become involved in? Are we going to be sent to Europe to
reinforce NATO allies?'" He also encouraged anyone who might feel
Ukraine is far away to take the time to engage, as everyone\'s
participation is important for a flourishing democracy. ["That's what
makes us different than Russia ... our foreign policy is shaped
by]{.underline} our discourse and [our elections and who represents us,"
Grove said.]{.underline}

Russia's Fake News

Olga Sousa moved to San Francisco when she was 19 years old, after
growing up in the city Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, where
Russian forces have been fighting and seized a large nuclear power plant
on March 4. Sousa has now lived in Hawaii for the last eight years.
After learning that Russia had invaded Ukraine, Sousa told Spectrum News
Hawaii that she called her mom, who currently lives in San Francisco,
and they talked about their worry for Sousa's 33-year-old brother. He
lives in Hawaii, but had returned to Zaporizhzhia the week before the
war started, trying to help his wife get out of Ukraine. "She was just
crying," said Sousa about her mother. "I have such a heavy guilt that
I\'m here safe. I\'m thankful that I\'m here, but at the same time I
feel guilty that I\'m here." Sousa is half Ukrainian and half Russian,
as her Russian mother moved to Ukraine in the 1980s, where she met her
Ukrainian father. Her mom's sister and her cousins still live in Russia,
but she said her mom and aunt stopped speaking five years ago, because
her aunt claimed Russia is helping Ukraine and the country should
surrender. Sousa said Russian President Vladimir Putin's rhetoric has
brainwashed people. "It\'s very heartbreaking," said Sousa about her
family's division. [Grove said that]{.underline} **[Russia is good at
defining the narrative]{.underline}** [of what's taking place
**through** strategic communications and]{.underline} **[fake
news]{.underline}**, [including perpetuating the **false claim that**
"**this is a defensive invasion** (and) that (attacking) Ukraine is
about protecting Russia."]{.underline} ["Russia is very good at building
stories, which draw people in and they can be conspiratorial (or) they
can merely go with people\'s already existing political preferences, but
they\'re very good at inflaming differences," said Grove]{.underline}.
Still, Grove said Putin can't control all the information that comes
into the country, especially with the internet. This is part of the
reason some Russians are protesting the war in Ukraine.

War crimes

When Sousa first found out that Russia was attacking Ukraine, she said
she was in disbelief; despite Russia's escalation of troops, she never
thought they would attack. She checked news reports, but information was
just starting to come in, so she called a friend in Ukraine, who told
her the apartment building next to her had just been bombed. "It was so
surreal. I felt like I was watching a movie," said Sousa. Sousa\'s
grandparents and some of her other friends still live in Ukraine. "I
have a lot of family and friends pretty much all over Ukraine and have
my grandparents in Kharkiv, which has been heavily attacked for the last
two days," said Sousa in an interview with Spectrum News Hawaii on Feb.
28. Kharkiv is the second-largest city in Ukraine, with a population of
1.5 million, and Russia has been attacking the city with airstrikes and
rockets. Residential buildings have been damaged and a missile hit the
city's central square on March 1. The city has put up a resistance to
Russia's fighting, with Russian planes shot down and advancing troops
slowed. "Ukraine is so little compared to Russia on the map. Yet, we\'re
sticking up to Russia," Sousa said. "The strongest feeling I have right
now is definitely pride. I\'m proud for my people." "I\'m sad to see
people dying, to be honest, on either of the sides," Sousa added.
[Grove]{.underline}, the university professor, [told]{.underline}
Spectrum News Hawaii that [it is clear Russia is committing war crimes
in Ukraine right now. "I think whenever you move heavy artillery, and
you\'re bombing in civilian areas, that is by definition, a war crime,"
said Grove]{.underline}. ["We may be seeing **unprecedented dangerous
events** unfolding before us."]{.underline} The 1949 Geneva Convention
Article 8, 2.b defines war crimes, in part, as "intentionally directing
attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual
civilians not taking direct part in hostilities; intentionally directing
attacks against civilian objects, that is, objects which are not
military objectives..." and "intentionally launching an attack in the
knowledge that such an attack will cause incidental loss of life or
injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects ..." The International
Criminal Court launched an investigation on March 2 into whether Putin
is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide as the
civilian death toll rises and widespread destruction is inflicted on
Ukraine.

University of Hawaii associate professor Jairus [Grove]{.underline} says
many in the islands view the war in Ukraine as a far away crisis, and
that makes him sad. He [thinks more people should be
shocked]{.underline}. "It is a watershed moment for global order. [It is
no coincidence that China sent nine warplanes into Taiwan's secure
airspace the same day that Russian tanks rolled into
Ukraine]{.underline}. [He says Russia's naked aggression could
**embolden China** to go after disputed land it claims it owns and wants
to take back. And it could make China more **eager** in the future to
**test agreed-upon international boundaries**.]{.underline} Grove is
chairman of the political science department at UH Manoa and the
director of the Hawaii Research Center for Future Studies. [He thinks
that even the increased support from Germany and other Western allies
for swift sanctions still may not be enough to change what Russia has in
mind. He says even stronger sanctions may push Russia closer to China,
which already signaled it might bail out Russia with economic support
behind the scenes as it has done in the past. **"It is a different kind
of world when China and Russia no longer see each other as
competitors,"** says Grove.]{.underline}

Where [I **disagree** with the]{.underline} author, however, is his
[**very concept** of the '**Eurocene**.' [If the]{.mark} present

states across the globe [it would be **dying**]{.mark} **out**, [but it
seems]{.mark} to **strengthening**. [There is **no way** we]{.mark} are
[get]{.mark}ting [through]{.mark}]{.underline} what I will remain
calling [[the anthropocene without **some**]{.mark} **level** of a
command [economy for]{.mark} resources and research direction for
[technologies]{.mark}. Many of these [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}
will be scare and [[will be **competed over**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
competitive nature of the state system means something Darwinistic is
occurring, which is good as [we **do not yet have the answer** for
surviving our current era and so **multiple approaches** must be tried
and the **best will serve as models** for others and the **worst will
die out**]{.underline}.

[[I]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[do not see anything]{.mark}
particularly [European]{.mark}** [about modernity]{.mark} anymore. While
a new era **did begin** with the]{.underline} biological and demographic
[takeover of the western hemisphere and its forceable wedding to
Europe]{.underline}-previously a minor and not particularly important
subcontinental peninsula of Asia-[**[any Eurasian]{.mark} actor** [could
have]{.mark} potentially [done the same thing. The]{.mark} bureaucratic
[state was]{.mark} **first [born in China]{.mark}** and the
[agricultur]{.mark}al state [came from the **Middle East**]{.mark}, and
those strike me as **just as relevant** to where we are now than the
maritime-industrial states of post medieval Europe]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [as [**India** and **China** move]{.mark} their way
[into]{.mark} **full [industrialization]{.mark}** on their own terms and
countries like **Japan** have long held that position dating back to the
colonial era, I find **little** to argue for something called
specifically 'The Eurocene.']{.underline} That being said, the author is
entirely correct that our currently unsustainable methods of development
are a type of self-replicating virus imposed by force. But so too will
any solutions have to follow that path.

It may come as no surprise that I, a person very into geopolitics (and
making speculative realist geopolitics in particular) also take a more
neutral tone on the field than this author. I think [[geopolitics
are]{.mark} **as likely [to get us out of this mess]{.mark}** as they
are to dig us deeper]{.underline}. Aside from general environmental
goals, [[I see **little universal** in how we]{.mark} will [escape
from]{.mark} **pollution** and **mass [extinction]{.mark}** and [more a
**variety of paths** which depend on]{.mark} the **varying ecologies of
different [countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As it is, some countries
will benefit from climate change and their interests cannot be said to
be comparable with those who will suffer. [[A **stateless** world
is]{.mark} a **de facto [neoliberal]{.mark}** world in practice and the
author's fear of political [homogenization is **not caused by
realism**]{.mark} or **geopolitics** [but]{.mark} rather
**[prevented]{.mark} by those same actors**. Diversity can only thrive
in the **absence of grand universal projects**]{.underline}.

So our approaches are very clearly different as [I see realist
geopolitics as the]{.underline} garuntor [\[**guarantor**\] of
ideological, economic, and ecological diversity, **not its
foe**]{.underline}. But Grove is an excellent writer so I enjoyed his
take on it anyway.

#### Grove is [too pessimistic]{.underline} about modernity's potential --- means at [best]{.underline} they solve nothing and at [worst]{.underline} "martial empiricism" [actively empowers]{.underline} fascists. 

**Tallis, 20**---senior researcher, Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy, University of Hamburg (Benjamin, "Un-cancelling the
future," New Perspectives, OnlineFirst, July 8, 2020, dml)

Examples of this way of thinking are plentiful but, for convenience, one
need to look no further than Jairus [Grove's]{.underline}
scintillatingly pessimistic keynote at the Hamburg Sessions (forthcoming
as an essay in NP and based on his 2019 book, Savage Ecology).3 It is
not that Grove doesn't make compelling critical [arguments]{.underline}
-- he does and in brilliant, imaginative ways -- but that they [**lack
balance**. And balance **matters**, whether we are reckoning with
horrendous pasts or trying to boldly imaging new futures.]{.underline}

[To see, or]{.underline} certainly to [dwell on, **only the bad** in
what we in the West have collectively done]{.underline} (however, Grove
or anyone else defines who we are), [over the entire course of our past
and present is **grossly unfair**. It also amounts]{.underline}, in
effect, [to a counsel of **despair**, however much Grove protests to the
contrary or claims to eschew nihilism]{.underline}. In his keynote,
having written off our past and present, [Grove]{.underline} also
explicitly [urged us]{.underline} in Europe and the West [to **stop
imagining better**, **progressive futures**]{.underline}, arguing that
this has led to precisely the problems he identified. [Grove's
critique]{.underline} thus not only leaves us out of time (without an
avowable past, present or future) but also [leaves us **without space**
for contesting negative, regressive and repressive political
trends]{.underline}. In his book, he laments the 'debilitating stupor'
in which the work of thinkers like Theodor Adorno and Giorgio Agamben
leaves us (Grove, 2019: 238). But [Grove's]{.underline} own [pessimism,
if we took it seriously]{.underline}, would leave Europeans without a
political leg to stand on. It [would leave us in]{.underline} just such
[a **stupor** -- or **worse** -- with no **solid ground** and no
**lever**: no way to **move the world** and no platform for
**positive**, **progressive change**]{.underline}.

**[Why bother, if everything we do only makes things
worse?]{.underline}**

[[However much harm we]{.underline}]{.mark} Europeans and [Westerners
[have done, we **haven't**]{.mark} **done**, [**don't** and **won't only
do harm**]{.mark}. The real danger of [Grove's]{.mark} type of
**timelessly [pessimistic]{.mark}** [and **literally hopeless**
critique]{.mark} is that]{.underline} (again, if taken seriously) [it
[breeds **only damaging inertia**, **inaction** and
**resentment**]{.mark} -- its hopelessness makes it a **debilitating**
critique; its timelessness offers **no possibility of salvage**, let
alone **progress**. [It **cedes**]{.mark} **the ground** of action [to
those who many of us (including Grove) would]{.mark} **explicitly
[disagree with]{.mark}** -- [whether]{.mark} to [exponents of
'**traditional**']{.mark} approaches to [IR]{.mark} who are **more than
happy** to offer policy advice [or]{.mark}, worse, to
[**authoritarians** and **populists**]{.mark} in practical
politics]{.underline} (as ably described in Johanna Sumuvuori's essay in
this issue). [Critical scholars **too rarely** see it as their task to
construct **positive visions** of better worlds. Instead, too often they
content themselves]{.underline} (if no one else) [with evermore
thoroughgoing deconstructive critique]{.underline} -- including of other
critical academics. Whether totalising or parasitic, even some of its
leading proponents admit that IR's critical project has, thus far, had
insufficient impact on the world at large (Austin, 2017, 2019).

Few critical scholars will thank me for this comparison, but, in their
pessimistic, misanthropic zeal, they echo what French President Emmanuel
Macron called the 'sad passions' of the author Michel Houellebecq4
(Carre\`re, 2017). They may not share Houellebecq's politics, but many
critical scholars certainly share his exhaustive (and exhausting)
disenchantment with contemporary (neo)liberal societies, the state of
Europe and of the West. Too often they also share his miserabilist
outlook on the impossibility of change for the better and the futility
or harm of even trying to improve things.

[[Grove does propose]{.mark} several forms of political action:
[**micro-kindnesses**, however **vague**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. 'the
impossible generosity and affirmation of deconstruction', 2019: 231);
[**[resistant acts]{.mark}** by brave individuals]{.underline} (e.g.
'William ''Fox'' Fallon, who sacrificed his prestigious position as head
of \[US Military\] Central Command because he would not go along with
the plan to attack Iran', 2019: 232); [embracing]{.underline} entirely
new '**[forms of life]{.underline}** 5 '; [[or **welcoming
apocalypse**]{.mark} as driver of change]{.underline} (2019: 229--248).
[Grove **will not be confused with Goldilocks anytime soon** -- these
forms of action each seem either **too little** or (**much**) **too
much**]{.underline}.

[Few of us would question the value of and need for
kindness]{.underline} and, indeed, the most hopeful part of Grove's book
is the touching introduction where he details many of the kindnesses he
has himself benefitted from, mainly from people in the West where he has
spent most of his life. [There is also, clearly, a role for
resistance]{.underline} and for the kinds of acts that Grove notes have
prevented executions and even nuclear war. [Yet [without a **wider
programme**]{.mark}, without a **bigger positive vision**, [kindness and
resistance **cannot**]{.mark} **sufficiently [change our world]{.mark}**
for the better. [Apocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the contrary,
[changes **too much**, [**junks too much** that is good and is
**rarely**]{.mark} **likely** to be an **[appealing]{.mark}** option, or
something we **can all get behind**. The apocalyptic aspect of Grove's
position]{.underline}, like that of many critical scholars, [seeks to
inflict **destructive harm** on Western institutions rather than
**constructively reform** them]{.underline} -- something Houellebecq
would also relish. [[Apocalyptic change]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[smacks of]{.mark} the **[recklessly callous]{.mark}**, **negative
sides** of]{.underline} early 20th-century [futurism]{.underline}
(Marinetti, 1909), [as Grove acknowledges when asking 'How do we go wild
without the cruelty of [indifference]{.mark}?']{.underline} (2019: 280).
Again, a more balanced approach to boldness would help.

[To be clear, major change is needed]{.underline} -- that was the whole
point of the Hamburg Sessions and the motivation behind giving it the
theme of 'Un-Cancelling the Future'. I've argued elsewhere that the kind
of socio-economically regressive, technocratic, defensive liberalisms
that have dominated large parts of the last 40 years in the West have a
lot to answer for (Tallis, 2018). So too, of course, does the type of
narrowly, teleological individually atomising (neo)liberalism that
neither saw (Fukuyama, 1992) nor allowed (Fisher, 2009) alternative
visions of politics, societies and economies. Mark Fisher (2009),
echoing the artist Gerhard Richter (Elger, 2009), called this myopic
liberalism 'Capitalist Realism'. [You don't have to be a Marxist or even
a leftist to see that a **mandated lack of alternatives** and a
**commensurate narrowing of possibilities** and **horizons** is a bad
thing]{.underline}. As noted above, [both climate change and
sociotechnical upheavals in the ways we work and live **need bold
visions** to address the challenges they pose while also seizing the
opportunities they present.]{.underline}

[[It is,]{.mark} however, eminently [possible to **recognise**]{.mark}
**the full horrors** of Europe's ([colonial]{.mark}) [pasts and presents
**without**]{.mark} **immediately [discounting the possibility of
improvement]{.mark}** coming [from the West]{.mark}]{.underline}, from
Europe. Similarly, [one can recognise the myriad problems]{.underline}
that Europeans have caused [while also **celebrating the many positive
things** they have]{.underline} also [achieved]{.underline}. Moreover,
[[it is possible to use]{.mark} those [achievements as
**inspirations**]{.mark} for better ways of doing things -- as
**catalysts** to new, progressive creativity and to positive visions of
the future]{.underline}. Just as Kraftwerk did in the fragile yet
fertile Germany of the second half of the 20th century when they
acknowledged the abyss yet still sought a better future, including as
atonement for that past.

The cancellation of the future

William Gibson recently tweeted ''In the 1920s, the phrase 'the 21st
Century' was already popubiquitous. How often do we see the phrase ''the
22nd Century'', now?''. And it's true -- we don't have these dates
anymore. As a boy, as a young man, I had mental pictures of the 21st
Century. But I don't have any sense of 2050 or 2100 -- except as a
deterioration or a collapse. (Simon Reynolds, Hamburg Sessions 2019, see
essay in this issue)

I return to Kraftwerk below but first, a little more is needed on the
ramifications of contemporary hopelessness. Rather than striving to
create new and compelling positive, progressive visions, many thinkers
content themselves with critique (Austin, 2017) while others, like
Grove, see positive, progressive visions and futures -- especially those
coming from Europe or the wider West -- as being necessarily harmful in
themselves.

This is postmodernism as hangover. The depressed -- and depressing --
aftermath of the shortcomings, broken promises and unintended
consequences of modernisms of different kinds, in which strange
connections are made and selective, guilty memory runs amok (Fisher,
2014). Forgetting the good, it fuses the bewitchingly pertinent aspects
of the post-positivist critical project (which influenced many of us,
myself very much included), with more zealously (self-)destructive and
paralysing tendencies. As Fisher puts it: 'Deconstruction \[is\] a kind
of pathology of scepticism, which induced hedging, infirmity of purpose
and compulsory doubt' (2014: 16). In this mode, scholarship no longer
seeks to invent the train but fixates on the train crash or even
pre-empts and precludes the train's invention for fear of the seemingly
inescapable imagined train crash to come.

Like [[Grove's denunciation]{.mark} of the future]{.underline}, many of
the critiques of (popular) modernisms [are not so much **wrong** as
**imbalanced**]{.underline} (although some are wrong of course, others
not even). [They [take **insufficient account** of modernisms'
**multiple** and **meaningful successes**]{.mark}]{.underline} (there's
no time here, but see, e.g. Fisher, 2014: 22; or Meades, 2014, for a
flavour). This leaves us in an odd situation where many of [the
[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}, commentators and others [[who criticise
neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, capitalist realism and so on, [[find
themselves in **de facto agreement** with its notion that there should
be no alternative.]{.mark} In this view, we **simply shouldn't do big
vision politics** because our 'schemes to improve the human condition'
have not only 'failed' but will **always**, **inevitably**, do **more
harm than good**]{.underline} (Scott, 2008). [This approach, all post
and no modern, will take us **nowhere**, even as it **fast-forwards the
academic careers** of its exponents]{.underline}.

The future visions that are left, on the left, tend to be Marxist ones
(see, e.g. Grove, 2019: 198-- 202). Tarred not only by the brush of the
communisms that actually existed (and their distinctly less balanced
ledger than that of modernism more widely) they understandably fail to
inspire mass enthusiasm. Many of their proponents are still really more
interested in explaining the failure to bring about the inevitable (full
communism) in the past and present than in imagining new futures that go
beyond the narrow world view and limiting subjectivity of too many
Marxist approaches (see, e.g. Scribner, 2003; Sˇitera, 2015). This has
done little to address the crisis of hope or to countervail prevalent
contemporary pessimism.

[The loss of the belief in the progressive future]{.underline} -- that
tomorrow can be better than yesterday and today -- [and the related
erosion of faith in our ability to **positively shape our own
destiny**]{.underline} are what Berardi (2011: 13) called 'the slow
cancellation of the future'. As Simon Reynolds noted in his Hamburg
Sessions keynote (included in this issue of NP), the cancellation may
have started slowly in the 1970s, but, by the 2000s, it had picked up
speed and its effects could start to be seen. The first of these -- its
more (neo)liberal variant -- was the feeling of living in an endless
present. For a lot of people in the West, this has been comfortable in
many ways (although often unevenly and unfairly) and has had distinct
advantages over the past (the extension of rights and opportunities to
broader swathes of the population) but without much hope, optimism or
greater purpose. Unless it provokes the nostalgic responses outlined
below, this endless present [can lead to a sense of **ennui**, a **lack
of direction** and **loss of momentum**]{.underline}.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} second, **[more overtly
[sinister]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[variant that fills the vacuum left
by the dearth of positive]{.mark}, progressive [visions]{.mark} for the
future [takes the form of]{.mark} **darker re-enchantments** focused on
the (imagined) past]{.underline} (e.g. Campanella and Dassu\`, 2019).
[Whether '[**making America great again**', '**taking back
control**']{.mark} in the United Kingdom or claiming to offer [an
'**alternative for Germany**']{.mark}, [these]{.mark} movements
[are]{.mark} fundamentally premised on [a **backward-looking
politics**]{.mark} of nostalgia]{.underline}. The [pessimism about the
present and worries about the future]{.underline} on which these
movements have each capitalised [have given rise to an **increasingly
defensive politics** of closing down and protecting, at the expense of
opening up and integrating. [Nativism and pessimism]{.mark} tend to [go
**hand in hand**]{.mark}: shrinking pies bring narrowed horizons and
hasten the circling of wagons around **exclusive** and **chauvinistic
visions** of national communities]{.underline}. Too often, this
retro-rightism has been met only with retro-leftism or a tired centrism
that merely seeks more of the same, to smooth the endless present. But
that can change \...

Reclaiming the spirit of Kraftwerk

[[COVID]{.mark}-19]{.underline} has cancelled the endless present6 -- or
at least it can if we make the best of it. The scale of the response to
the pandemic [highlights the degree to which **radical change is
possible** if people are **persuaded** of the need. This crisis [**will
be** (and is]{.mark} **already [being]{.mark}**[) used
politically]{.mark}. [The challenge]{.mark} for those of us who want a
more progressive future [is to ensure]{.mark} that the
[disruption]{.mark} caused by COVID-19 is put to **positive effect** --
to ensure that it [is **creative** rather than **wanton**]{.mark}
**disruption** -- and to spur the kind of action that can **address our
biggest challenges** but also to create new opportunities to **make a
better**]{.underline} 'Post-Coronial' **[world]{.underline}** (Tallis
and Renic, 2020).

From climate change to the changing world of work, [bold action is
needed to address the causes of our biggest problems rather than simply
alleviating their symptoms]{.underline}. But also [[seeing]{.mark} these
issues as [**possibilities** to be seized]{.mark} for progressive
improvement, [rather than]{.mark} just seeing them as [**problems** to
be managed will be **key**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Merje Kuus was at
pains to emphasise in her Hamburg Sessions keynote, perspective is vital
(see her essay in this issue). [Building]{.underline} resilient
societies and [a more equitable global order calls for the political
will to **[formulate]{.mark}** and **make the case for positive
[proactive policy]{.mark}**[, not]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[piecemeal
passivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, timid tinkering [[or (**critical**)
**conservatism**]{.underline}]{.mark} that have characterised too much
of European politics and public debate in recent times.

#### Grove says we should replace calculative rationality with a focus on affect. Don't do that.

**Boler and Davis, 18**---Department of Social Justice Education,
OISE/University of Toronto (Megan and Elizabeth, "The affective politics
of the "post-truth" era: Feeling rules and networked subjectivity,"
Emotion, Space and Society Volume 27, May 2018, Pages 75-85, dml)

[While the [attention to affective attunement is]{.mark} **potentially
[useful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in deploying a definition of affect as
quantitative, pre-personal, non-conscious, and non-signifying, [[one is
left with **myriad questions** about how particular emotions are
**targeted**, **produced** and **manipulated**]{.mark}
within]{.underline} the [affective politics]{.underline} of digital
media. Papacharissi characterizes affective transmission as follows: "So
digital, among other media, invite and transmit affect but also sustain
affective feedback loops that generate and reproduce affective patterns
of relating to others that are further reproduced as affect --- that is,
intensity that has not yet been cognitively processed as feeling,
emotion, or thought" (23). Following the popular reification of affect,
Papacharissi sharply distinguishes affect from emotion (2015, 13).
"Affect explains the intensity with which something is experienced; it
refers to just that: intensity" (2015, 135). For her, affect is a
central component of how stories are formed and circulated within media
flows, and affect helps provide an index of how some stories end up
being salient in social media, and thus potentially have more or less
political impact. While this account of affect resonates prima facie
with Hochschild\'s concept of "deep stories" and felt truths which shape
the feeling rules we see defining partisan polarization, [[readers are
**left wanting a full articulation**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
**[significance]{.mark}** (rather than simply the **alleged presence**)
of affect as it circulates]{.underline} in and through digital media.
[This reflects a **more widespread [tendency]{.mark}** in much
scholarship [to invoke "affect]{.mark}"]{.underline} in Massumi\'s
"autonomous" sense [[with **little exploration** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[complex [relational manifestations]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
emotions.

[Affect **all too often** [becomes a **mystified idea** akin to]{.mark}
force or energy and intimates an **[abstract celebration]{.mark}** of
the uncontainable]{.underline}:

Disorder, marginality, and anarchy present the habitat for affect,
mainly because order, mainstreaming, and hierarchy afford form that
compromises the futurity of affect. Because marginal spaces support the
emergence of change, [[affect]{.mark} is **inherently political**,
although it [**does not conform** to the structures we symbolically
internalize as political]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, per affect theory,
[[empowerment lies]{.underline}]{.mark} in liminality, in pre-emergence
and emergence, or [[at]{.mark} the point at which [new
formations]{.mark} of the political are in the process of being imagined
but **[not yet articulated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The form of affective
power is pre-actualized, networked, and of a liquid nature.(2015, 19)

["Affect" so understood [**pales in analytical resonance** or
**utility** in contrast with]{.mark}]{.underline} earlier feminist
[[analyses]{.underline}]{.mark} of emotion,
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}, as in the bitterness example above,
[[describe the **actual shape** and **flow** of social life]{.mark} as
it is intersubjectively [produced in **specific**]{.mark} **micro-** and
**[macro-political contexts]{.mark}** of power relations]{.underline}.
The qualitative descriptions of "affect" in social media are
conceptually overshadowed by the language of emotion --- and yet
emotions are presented as simply what people "express", not a web of
intersubjectively produced sociality (see, e.g., Papacharissi, 2015, 15,
22, 53--54). As a result, [the account is able **only to suggest broad
quantitative measures** of]{.underline} the rate and flow of retweets as
exemplifying [affect]{.underline}.10 [[Affect understood as "intensity"
**all too often** gestures at something it **does not explain**, while
using rhetorical strategies that **further mystify** ]{.mark}**the
term**]{.underline}.

"Securitization Forum: The Transatlantic Divide: Why Securitization Has
Not Secured a Place in American IR, Why It Should, and How It Can," Duck
of Minerva, 9-18-2015,
http://duckofminerva.com/2015/09/securitization-forum-the-transatlantic-divide-why-securitization-has-not-secured-a-place-in-american-ir-why-it-should-and-how-it-can.html

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **[securitization]{.mark} has
[failed to gain traction]{.mark} in North America**]{.underline}. First,
and [most important, securitization describes a process but leaves us
well short of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper
account of the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}.
According to the foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School,
actors, usually elites, transform the social order from one of normal,
everyday politics into a Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a
dire threat to the political community. [They conceive of this
"securitizing move" in linguistic terms, as a speech act]{.underline}.
As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues, "By saying it \[security\], something
is done (as in betting, a promise, naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word
'security' is the act . . ." \[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a
powerful discursive process that constitutes social reality. Countless
articles and books have traced this process, and its consequences, in
particular policy domains. [Securitization presents itself as a
**[causal]{.mark}** account. But its [**mechanisms remain
obscure**,]{.mark} as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **[speech acts]{.mark}** often [seem]{.mark} to
be **[magical]{.mark} incantations** that upend normal politics through
pathways shrouded in mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why
**[some]{.mark}** securitizing moves [resonate]{.mark}, while [others
\[are **ignored**]{.mark}\]]{.underline} ~~fall on deaf ears~~.
[Certainly not all attempts to construct threats succeed]{.underline},
and this is true of both traditional military concerns as well as "new"
security issues. [Both [neocons]{.mark}ervatives [and]{.mark} structural
[realists]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have
long [insist]{.mark}ed that **[conflict]{.mark} with China [is
inevitable]{.mark}**[, yet]{.mark} China has [over the]{.mark} last **25
[years]{.mark}** been [more opportunity than threat]{.mark} in US
political [discourse]{.mark}---**[despite]{.mark}** these **[vigorous
and persistent securitizing moves]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In very
recent years, the balance has shifted, and the China threat has started
to catch on: **[linguistic processes]{.mark} alone [cannot
account]{.mark} for this change**]{.underline}. The US military has
repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound implications
for national security---but that has hardly cast aside climate change
deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks supposedly
deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers have
varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W. Bush
powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against American
values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator, struggled to
convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an imminent threat to
the United States. [After thirty years as an active research program,
securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer acceptable answers**
to these questions. **Brief [references to "facilitating conditions"
won't cut it]{.mark}**. You don't have to subscribe to a covering-law
conception of theory to find these questions important or to find
securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part of the
problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the politics of
security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded an oddly
apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation, the
Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must be
followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as Thierry
Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely rule-driven
process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the politics of
securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a conventional
procedure such as marriage or betting in which the 'felicity
circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for the act to
go through" (2005:172). [[Absent]{.mark} from this picture [are]{.mark}
fierce rhetorical battles, where [coalitions counter
securitizing]{.mark} moves with their own appeals that strike more or
less deeply at underlying narratives. Absent as well are the public
[intellectuals and media]{.mark}, who question and [critique]{.mark}
securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not others), [sometimes
to good effect (and sometimes [with little impact]{.mark})]{.underline}.
[[The **audience**]{.mark} itself---whether the mass public or a
narrower elite stratum---[is **stripped of**]{.mark} **all
[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Speaking security]{.mark}, even when
the performance is competent, **[does not sweep]{.mark} this [politics
away]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only by delving into this politics can we
shed light on the mysteries of securitization. We see rhetorical
politics as constituted less by singular "securitizing moves" than by
"contentious conversation"---to use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end,
we would urge securitization theorists, as we recently have elsewhere,
to move towards a "pragmatic" model that rests on four analytical
wagers: that actors are both strategic and social; that legitimation
works by imparting meaning to political action; that legitimation is
laced through with contestation; and that the power of language emerges
through contentious dialogue. We are heartened that our ambivalence
about securitization---the ways in which we find it by turns appealing
and dissatisfying---and our vision for how to move forward have in the
last decade been echoed by (mostly) European colleagues. These critics
have laid out a research agenda that would, if taken up, produce more
satisfying, and more deeply political, theoretical accounts. In our own
work, both individual and collective, we have tried to advance that
research agenda. So long as securitization theorists resist defining the
theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long as it remains wedded to
apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely to gain a broad following
on this side of the pond. [Second, securitization has been held back by
another way in which it is apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to
its Schmittian commitments and political vision. [Successful
securitization, in seminal accounts, replaces normal patterns of
politics with the world of the exception]{.underline}, in which contest
has no place. [They imagine security as the ultimate trump card. But, in
reality, the divide is not nearly so stark. Security **[does not crowd
out]{.mark} all [other spending priorities]{.mark}**---or states would
spend on nothing but defense and "securitized" issues. **[Nor]{.mark}**
does simply declaring something a matter of national security
**[guarantee]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

University of Westminster, 2009, accessed on 3-22-2022, Routledge,

Emancipatory Approaches",

HBisevac)

In chapter 7 I engaged with the human security framework and some of the
problematic implications of 'emancipatory' security policy frameworks.
In this chapter I argued that [the **[shift]{.mark} away**
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [pluralist [security]{.mark}
framework]{.underline} and the elevation of cosmopolitan and
emancipatory goals [has [served to **enforce**]{.mark} international
**[power inequalities]{.mark}** rather than lessen them]{.underline}.
Weak or unstable states are subjected to greater international scrutiny
and international institutions and other [[states have greater freedom
to intervene]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} the [citizens]{.mark}
of these states [have no way of]{.mark} controlling or
[influencing]{.mark} these **international
[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} or powerful states. [This [shift
away from]{.mark}]{.underline} the pluralist [[security]{.mark}
[framework]{.mark} has **[not]{.mark} [challenged]{.mark}** the
**[s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which may help to explain
why major [international institutions and [states can]{.mark} **easily
[adopt]{.mark}** a more **[cosmopolitan]{.mark} [rhetoric]{.mark}** in
their **security policies**]{.underline}. As we have seen, the shift
away from the pluralist security framework has entailed a shift towards
a more openly hierarchical international system, in which states are
differentiated according to, for example, their ability to provide human
security for their citizens or their supposed democratic commitments. In
this shift, the old pluralist international norms of (formal)
international sovereign equality, non-intervention and 'blindness' to
the content of a state are overturned. Instead, international
institutions and states have more freedom to intervene in weak or
unstable states in order to 'protect' and emancipate individuals
globally. Critical and emancipatory security theorists argue that the
goal of the emancipation of the individual means that security must be
reconceptualised away from the state. As the domestic sphere is
understood to be the sphere of insecurity and disorder, the
international sphere represents greater emancipatory possibilities, as
Tickner argues, 'if security is to start with the individual, its ties
to state sovereignty must be severed' (1995: 189). For critical and
emancipatory theorists there must be a shift towards a 'cosmopolitan'
legal framework, for example Mary Kaldor (2001: 10), Martin Shaw (2003:
104) and Andrew Linklater (2005). For critical theorists, one of the
fundamental problems with Realism is that it is unrealistic. Because it
prioritises order and the existing status quo, [Realism attempts to
impose a particular security framework onto a complex world, ignoring
the myriad threats to people emerging from their own
governments]{.underline} and societies. Moreover, traditional
international theory serves to obscure power relations and omits a study
of why the system is as it is: \[O\]mitting myriad strands of power
amounts to exaggerating the simplicity of the entire political system.
Today's conventional portrait of international politics thus too often
ends up looking like a Superman comic strip, whereas it probably should
resemble a Jackson Pollock. (Enloe, 2002 \[1996\]: 189) Yet as I have
argued, contemporary [critical security theorists seem to show a marked
lack of engagement with their problematic]{.underline} (whether the
international security context, or the Yugoslav break-up and
[wars]{.underline}). [[Without]{.mark} concrete [engagement]{.mark} and
analysis, however]{.underline}, [[the **critical project**]{.mark} is
**[undermined]{.mark}** and [critical theory becomes **nothing more**
than]{.mark} a **[request]{.mark}** that [people behave]{.mark} in a
**[nicer]{.mark}** way to each other]{.underline}. Furthermore, whilst
contemporary crit[ical security theorists argue that they present a more
realistic image of the world, through exposing power
relations]{.underline}, for example, [their **[lack of concrete]{.mark}
[analysis]{.mark}** of the problematic considered [renders]{.mark} them
actually [unable to engage with existing power structures]{.mark} and
the way in which power is being exercised in the contemporary
international system]{.underline}. For critical and emancipatory
theorists the central place of the values of the theorist mean that it
cannot fulfil its promise to critically engage with contemporary power
relations and emancipatory possibilities. Values must be joined with
engagement with the material circumstances of the time.

As provided by the Copenhagen School [**securitization theory** is
**comprised** by **speech act**]{.underline}, acceptance of the audience
and facilitating conditions or other non-securitizing actors contribute
to a successful securitization. [The [causality]{.mark} or a one-way
relationship [between]{.mark} the [speech act]{.mark}, the audience [and
securitizing actor]{.mark}, where politicians use the speech act first
to justify exceptional measures, has [been
criticized]{.mark}]{.underline} by scholars, such as Balzacq. According
to him, the one-directional relationship between the three factors, or
some of them, is not the best approach. To fully grasp the dynamics, it
will be more beneficial to "rather than looking for a one-directional
relationship between some or all of the three factors highlighted, it
could be profitable to focus on the degree of congruence between them.
26 Among other aspects of the Copenhagen School's theoretical framework,
which he criticizes, the thesis will rely on the criticism of the lack
of context and the rejection of a 'one-way causal' relationship between
the audience and the actor. [The [process of threat
con]{.mark}struction, according to him, [can be clearer]{.mark} if
external context, which stands independently from use of language, can
be considered]{.underline}. 27 Balzacq opts for more context-oriented
approach when it comes down to securitization through the speech act,
where [[a single **speech does not create**]{.mark} **the
[discourse]{.mark}**, [but it is **created** through a **long
process**]{.mark}, where **context is vital**]{.underline}. 28 He
indicates: [In reality, the **speech act itself**, i.e. literally a
**single security articulation** at a particular point in time, will
**at best** only **very rarely explain** the entire social process that
follows from it]{.underline}. In most cases a security scholar will
rather be confronted with a process of articulations creating
sequentially a threat text which turns sequentially into a
securitization. 29 This type of approach seems more plausible in an
empirical study, as [it is more likely that [a single speech will
not]{.mark} be able to [securitize an issue]{.mark}, but it is a lengthy
process]{.underline}, where a the audience speaks the same language as
the securitizing actors and can relate to their speeches.

The reality is that [[foreign policy]{.mark} has **always been
contested**]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline}, more often than not,
[linked to]{.underline} questions of [**identity** and
**ideology**]{.underline}. But [debates about war]{.underline} are [so
[interwoven with]{.mark}]{.underline} our [larger [culture-war
politics]{.mark}]{.underline} now [that]{.underline} most [[questions
of]{.mark} how to handle [military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} have
been [**largely [reduced]{.mark}** [to partisan
scoring]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [that's a problem]{.underline} --- not
because we need to get back to some bygone bipartisan era, but because
[**real dissension** is vital in a democracy]{.underline}, [especially
in]{.underline} matters of [foreign policy]{.underline}.

The seeds of war politics' merging with culture-war politics arguably
date back to the late 1960s, when anti-Vietnam War protests overlapped
with civil rights protests and other social movements that challenged
the existing social order. Over time, conservatives and liberals
diverged in their attitudes toward the war, especially as liberal elites
began to criticize it. Starting with the 1968 presidential election,
being anti-war became more closely associated with being a liberal
Democrat. And the accusation that George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee, was all for "acid, amnesty1 and abortion" helped
solidify this cultural connection.

And this larger cultural split between the two parties came to a head
during the Iraq War. In many ways, it's connected to the political
discourse we're seeing with Russia and Ukraine now. Unlike now, though,
the discourse during the Iraq War --- in the beginning at least ---
exemplified the idea that politics stops at the water's edge. Critics of
then-President George W. Bush rallied behind him after the 9/11
terrorist attacks, and public opinion on the war was initially quite
favorable, even though Democrats were far more split than Republicans.

That national unity turned out to be short-lived, though. As political
communications scholar Mary Stuckey has observed, it was during the Iraq
War that the two parties began to make very distinct arguments about
what it meant to be an American in relation to the war.
[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, often
[[framed]{.underline}]{.mark} the [war on terror]{.underline}, including
the U.S. invasion of [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in terms of **good**
and **evil**]{.underline}]{.mark} as he tried to establish the GOP as
the party of faith and strength. Democrats, meanwhile, in their 2004
party platform accused Bush and the [Republicans]{.underline} of
[[having]{.mark} an]{.underline} "[[**insufficient understanding**
of]{.mark} our enemy]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} a [failure to
comprehend]{.underline} the [[complexity of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[situation in [the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While the Iraq War was not directly related to Bush's religious faith,
both supporters and opponents alike depicted his [approach to
war]{.underline} as [[reflective of]{.mark} his **overall [philosophical
approach]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The president [[relied on **gut** and
**instinct**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[not expertise]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[to make decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Likewise, Bush's 2004
presidential campaign portrayed his Democratic opponent, then-Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, as a waffling intellectual who lacked conviction
and patriotic dedication.

In other words, the debate over the Iraq War quickly became an extension
of the debates Democrats and Republicans were already having in the 2000
presidential election --- and even earlier --- about religion, culture
and Bush's intellect and qualifications.

Ultimately, the Bush administration's justification for the Iraq War
became the subject of widespread criticism across the ideological
spectrum since the rationale for invasion was shaky at best. But the
[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} Democrats and Republicans [employed
during]{.underline} the [invasion of Iraq]{.underline} and the war on
terror [were **still [powerful]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
[ways]{.mark}]{.underline} in which [[they preyed on]{.mark} domestic
and **[cultural]{.mark} disagreements** and
[anxieties]{.mark}]{.underline}.

These arguments also had important implications for debates over
presidential war powers. While many Republicans embraced an expansive
role for the president --- a strong leader asserting U.S. dominance on
the world stage --- Democrats said in their 2008 presidential platform
that they "reject\[ed\] the sweeping claims of 'inherent' presidential
power," and that their candidate, then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois,
would better grasp intercultural nuance and policy detail.

But as president, Obama struggled with questions of war and war powers
as well. Although his administration was committed to a less
interventionist approach, world events still demanded attention. There
were new questions to answer about American intervention in the Middle
East and North Africa, as civil wars broke out in Libya and Syria. And
like Bush, Obama often found himself the subject of criticism --- first
for going too far in Libya and then for not going far enough in Syria.

In other words, the [[debate]{.underline}]{.mark} around the Iraq War
[[didn't]{.mark} help]{.underline} either Democrats or Republicans
[[create]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[coherent]{.mark} set of
[ideas]{.mark}** [about how to engage with]{.mark} foreign
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, how to [[prepare for]{.mark} the
[aftermath]{.mark}]{.underline} of one, [[or when]{.mark} it
makes]{.underline} the most [sense [to]{.mark} avoid [get]{.mark}ting
[involved]{.mark}]{.underline} at all. Obama was different from Bush,
but the [foreign-policy [questions]{.mark}]{.underline} he faced were
still [[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
domestic [[culture-war disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[not]{.mark}
**especially [useful]{.mark}** in resolving them]{.underline}. Yet,
because of the Iraq War, the [[country]{.underline}]{.mark} was now
[[set on]{.mark} a [political course that
undermined]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[goal of
**meaningful**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**reasoned dissent** on foreign
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Figuring out]{.underline} the role [the U.S. should play
following]{.underline} the [Russian invasion of [Ukraine
requires]{.mark}]{.underline} answering a [**completely
[different]{.mark}** set of [questions than]{.mark}]{.underline} the
global [[war on terror or]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. response to the
war in [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} required, but as we saw in Vietnam,
Iraq and elsewhere, [[culture-war politics are]{.underline}]{.mark} once
again **[[overshadowing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[discussion of what
to do]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Instead of debating]{.underline} the
[extent to which Americans should intervene]{.underline} in Ukraine,
[Republicans]{.underline} have [attacked Biden as]{.underline} a [weak
leader]{.underline} --- and that's the PG-rated stuff: Many attacks from
the far right have veered into even uglier culture-war territory and
praise for the Russian president.

So far, most rank-and-file Republicans have unfavorable views of the
Russian invasion, not sympathy toward Putin. (Instead, a partisan divide
is emerging over whether the U.S. should be "doing more.") Still, it's
not hard to figure out why the [[discussion of whether and how America
gets involved]{.mark} in armed conflict]{.underline} has [[devolved into
**partisan point-scoring**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nearly everything has.
[But this has a **real cost**]{.underline}, and the answer isn't for
politics to stop at the water's edge.

[Dissenting viewpoints and **serious debate**]{.underline} are [crucial
in]{.underline} a [democracy]{.underline}, and foreign policy is not an
exception. [Politics]{.underline} can and [should be a place for **real
[debate]{.mark}** [and **multiple viewpoints**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is [[**imperative** to hold public officials
accountable]{.underline}]{.mark} for their decisions. [[When we treat
foreign policy as]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[extension of]{.mark}
domestic [cultural politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, [we lose]{.underline}
almost [as much as we do when [we act as though it's **not up for debate
at all**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Many **[restraint]{.mark}** [proponents]{.mark} use a]{.underline}
second major [**[claim]{.mark}** to buttress their argument that [**US
strategy** is]{.mark}]{.underline} fundamentally [**invalid** and should
be radically scaled back]{.underline}: [US **overreach** reflects [the
**malign influence** of]{.mark} a]{.underline} devious [**national
[security elite]{.mark}** fired with dangerous visions of primacy and
liberal hegemony]{.underline}. Not all restraint advocates make this
argument, but it is a dominant theme in some of the literature's most
important works. [Stephen Walt]{.underline}'s 2018 book The Hell of Good
Intentions, for example, is an extended indictment of this
group---including current and former US officials, congressional staff,
think tank experts, and others---which [he describes as a]{.underline}
"[**dysfunctional elite** of privileged insiders]{.underline} who are
frequently disdainful of alternative perspectives." 35 [According to
Walt]{.underline}, [**promoting** an **interventionist** foreign
**policy** provides]{.underline} jobs, status, and access to [high-paid
consultancies]{.underline} and political power to this group, which
comprises an exclusive clique of insiders who attend the same schools
and clubs and believe, for the most part, the same things about US
power.

[The historian]{.underline} and writer Andrew [Bacevich]{.underline}
[denounces the same alleged cabal]{.underline}, [agreeing]{.underline}
that "[the **ideology of national security**]{.underline} ... [serves
the **interests** of those who **created** the national **security
state**]{.underline} and those who still benefit from its continued
existence"---interests that include "status, influence, and considerable
wealth." 36 [The result is an **addiction** to global
**hegemony**]{.underline} and military force, [a tendency to seek out
**unnecessary** enemies and **commitments**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} a ~~crippling~~ [conformism that quashes
dissent]{.underline}.37 [US]{.underline} national [security
elites]{.underline} at the end of the Cold War, he argues in his most
recent book, [**coalesced** around **primacy**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} "something close to [unanimity]{.underline}." 38

[It is not clear how to treat [such]{.mark}]{.underline} sprawling
[**[assertions]{.mark}** when the reality]{.underline}---[the
**[jumble]{.mark}** of **motivations**]{.underline}, views,
[[relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} [ambitions
of]{.mark} the]{.underline} tens of [thousands of
[people]{.mark}]{.underline} who comprise the national security
community---[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} obviously [[so]{.mark} **much more
[complex]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Do all US foreign policy officials or
experts support global engagement because it grants them jobs or
speaking opportunities? How many actually attended the same schools or
even know one another, and what effect does this have on their views? Do
all of them embrace primacy, and to the same degree? Apart from
collections of anecdotes, [[those]{.mark} [convinced of the]{.mark}
existence of such a **homogenous [elite]{.mark}** [offer
**no**]{.mark}]{.underline} objective
**[[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[such as surveys]{.underline},
[interviews]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} comprehensive [literature
reviews]{.underline}---to back up these sweeping claims. "By and large,"
[Bacevich insists]{.underline} in just one example, "[members of
the]{.underline} national security [elite hold the public
in]{.underline} remarkably [low regard]{.underline}," [**citing** as
proof a **single**]{.underline}, dated [**quote** from Dean
Acheson]{.underline}.39

[[The]{.mark} **[real]{.mark}**]{.underline} "[national security

[[profound **arguments**]{.mark} have **[erupted]{.mark}** within this

[Brands]{.underline}, Peter [Feaver]{.underline}, and William
[Inboden]{.underline} [explain]{.underline} that "[intense disputes

officials]{.underline}]{.mark}** or experts [[may **rail
against**]{.mark} the broad principle of US global
**[engagement]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But on specific policy
questions---whether to go to war or conduct a humanitarian intervention,
or what policy to adopt toward China or Cuba or Russia or Iran---
[**[debates]{.mark}** in Washington [are]{.mark} deep,
**[intense]{.mark}**, and sometimes bitter.]{.underline}

To take just a single example from recent history, the
[Obama]{.underline} administration's [decision to **endorse** a
**surge** in **Afghanistan**]{.underline} [came only after extended
**deliberation** and **soul-searching**]{.underline}, and [it included a
major]{.underline}, and highly controversial, [element of
**restraint**]{.underline}---[a]{.underline} very [public **deadline**
to begin]{.underline} a graduated **[withdrawal]{.underline}**.41 [If
one were to choose the less **aggressive** or **interventionist**
side]{.underline} of this and a dozen other recent debates, in fact,
[one could **assemble** a reasonable **facsimile** of the more
**circumscribed** foreign policy]{.underline} that [proponents of
**restraint**]{.underline} themselves [suggest]{.underline}.

It is true that [[**groupthink** often **grips**]{.mark}
tighter]{.underline}, and dissent ebbs, [during **times of
[crisis]{.mark}** or]{.underline} war--- during the crucial escalation
years [[in]{.mark} **Vietnam**]{.underline}, [[for
example]{.underline}]{.mark}, [or]{.underline} in the weeks after
**[[9/11]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The national security community has
closed ranks to an unhealthy degree at such moments. [[But **these are
exceptions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and they deeply complicate the
argument for restraint]{.underline}: [if US foreign policy excesses tend
to emerge during emotionally charged crises]{.underline} or periods of
rabid threat perception, [[the **problem** is **not**]{.mark} a
[**relentless** hegemonic **impulse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is

[as]{.mark} a club of **like-minded [elite]{.mark}**
[insiders]{.mark}]{.underline} who control everything, take care of one
another, [and brush off challenges to]{.underline} conventional
[wisdom]{.underline}. [**[In reality]{.mark}**, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} actually [[has a]{.mark} **healthy
[marketplace]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} foreign policy
**[ideas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Discussion** over]{.underline}
American [foreign policy **is** loud]{.underline}, contentious,
[diverse, and]{.underline} generally **[pragmatic]{.underline}**---and
as a result, [the nation gets the opportunity to learn from its
mistakes]{.underline}, build on its successes, [and **improve** its
**performance**]{.underline} over time.

In both absolute and relative terms, [[the]{.mark} **expert
[community]{.mark}**]{.underline} dealing with foreign policy and
national security in the United States [[is]{.mark}
remarkably]{.underline} large and
**[[heterogeneous]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Inside government, [cadres of
professionals make vast]{.underline} [amounts of **technocratic
knowledge** and **institutional memory** available]{.underline} to
policymakers. Every department and agency with an international role
has distinctive regional or functional expertise it can bring to bear.
[This in**-house [knowledge]{.mark}** is [complemented by]{.mark}
an]{.underline} even larger and more [**diverse** network of
**[experts]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the many hundreds of **[think
tanks]{.mark}** and contract research **institutions** that surround the
government]{.underline} and [[offer views]{.mark} ranging [from **right
to left**]{.mark}, **[hawk to dove]{.mark}**, **free trader to
protectionist**, **technocratic to ideological**]{.underline}. [Pick any
policy issue and **you can put together** a lively
**debate**]{.underline} with ease. Should the United States [[engage
with
China](https://www.brookings.edu/research/u-s-policy-toward-china/) or
contain it?]{.underline} [Negotiate with Iran or squeeze it? [Withdraw
from the Middle
East](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2020-02-10/price-primacy) or
redouble its efforts?]{.underline} Reasoned [arguments on all sides
are]{.underline} widely [available]{.underline}, in any form you
want---[all **supplied** from within the]{.underline} supposedly
monolithic **[establishment]{.underline}**.

Moreover, unlike such communities in other leading powers,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} American [foreign policy [**establishment**
is **connected to society**]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than cut off
from it, because [the top]{.underline} several [layers of]{.underline}
U.S. national [security]{.underline} bureaucracies [are staffed
by **political appointees** rather than civil servants]{.underline}.
[[The **Blob** comprises]{.underline}]{.mark} government
[[officials]{.mark}, **outside [experts]{.mark}**, [and many]{.mark}
**people** who [go **back and forth**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the
two. Insiders know how government works and what is practical.
[Outsiders think independently]{.underline}. [And in-and-outers
**[bridge the gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Other countries]{.underline}
simply [do not have]{.underline} comparably [large,
diverse]{.underline}, permeable, [expert communities that **encourage
vigorous debate**]{.underline} over national policy---which is why, say,
[the **caliber of** U.S. **debate** about nuclear policy is more
**nuanced** and better informed]{.underline} than in other nuclear
powers, and which is why [**other countries** would
**love**]{.underline} to have such [a **Blob** of their
own]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} American **foreign policy**
[establishment]{.mark}]{.underline}, finally, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
generally [**more** **[pragmatic]{.mark}** than
**ideological**]{.underline}. [It values]{.underline} prudence and
[security over novelty]{.underline} and creativity. [It knows that
thinking outside the box may be useful]{.underline} in testing policy
assumptions, [but **the box is**]{.underline} usually **[there for a
reason]{.underline}**, and [so reflexively embracing the far-out option
is dangerous]{.underline}. [Its members have made]{.underline} many
[mistakes]{.underline}, individually and collectively, [but]{.underline}
several [**features** of the system **enforce
accountability**]{.underline} over time. [Foreign [policy
**failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [**[are]{.mark}**
politically **[toxic and]{.mark}** often **[spur]{.mark}** **positive
[change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The monumental intelligence
failures that allowed the September 11 attacks to happen were followed
by policy and institutional reforms that have helped prevent other
mass-casualty terrorist attacks on U.S. targets for almost two decades.
Early [[[**misjudgments** in]{.mark} the **[Iraq]{.mark}**
war ](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2003-09-01/stumbling-war)**[led
to]{.mark}** the adoption of a **[new]{.mark}
[co]{.mark}unter[in]{.mark}surgency** strategy that restored
stability]{.underline}, at least for a while. [The]{.underline}
international economic **[imbalances]{.underline}** and financial
procedures [that **led to** the **2008** global financial crisis were
**addressed by policies**]{.underline} that contributed to a decade-long
recovery.

Taken together, [these **virtues reinforce** one another]{.underline}
and [**help** the United States **tackle** the countless]{.underline}
national and [**global challenges** that confront a
**superpower**]{.underline}. [Blob [critics claim]{.mark} there are
[no]{.mark} meaningful [arguments]{.mark} over]{.underline} U.S.
[foreign policy]{.underline}. But [[this is]{.mark} just [not
true]{.mark}]{.underline}. Intense [disputes over the **[Korea]{.mark}n
War**]{.underline}, [the **[Vietnam]{.mark} War**]{.underline},
[**détente** and **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [opening to
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and policies in [**Central America**
and]{.mark} the **[Middle East]{.mark}** were followed]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} battles over [the **Gulf War**]{.underline}, [**NATO**
expansion]{.underline}, [military **interventions** in
**Haiti**]{.underline}, **[Somalia]{.underline}**, [and the
**Balkans**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the wars in [**Afghanistan**
and **Iraq**]{.underline}---[[not to]{.mark} mention [heated arguments
over]{.mark}]{.underline} positions toward [**[China]{.mark}**,
**[Iran]{.mark}**, **[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea**,
**[Russia]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} [other]{.mark}
issue[s]{.mark}]{.underline} today. It is true that [[beneath]{.mark}
all [this]{.mark} controversy [lies]{.mark} a]{.underline} relatively
[**stable [consensus]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the value of
power]{.underline}, [alliances]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
constructive [global **[engagement]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Most [members
of the establishment believe]{.underline} that [global
**problems**]{.underline} usually [**improve** when the]{.underline}
[**U**nited **S**tates **engages** responsibly and **worsen when** the
United States **retreats**]{.underline}. Yet [that [**reflects not**
some]{.mark} nefarious **[groupthink but]{.mark}** the
**[wisdom]{.mark}** of professional crowds]{.underline}, [arrived at
**through** painful **trial and error**]{.underline} over more than a
century.

WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

If the Blob is not a cabal, neither is its record one of dismal failure.
[Critics argue]{.underline} that [the United States entered
the]{.underline} 19[90s]{.underline} [in a position of **great power**
and **prestige**]{.underline} [and squandered that legacy through
misguided wars and **interventions**, geopolitical **hubris**, and the
**aggressive pursuit** of a global liberal **order**]{.underline} [at
the **expense** of]{.underline} the nation's economic and
**[security]{.underline}** interests. But [the story they tell doesn't
match what]{.underline} actually [happened]{.underline}. American [grand
strategy did not change radically after the Cold War]{.underline},
because it was developed not just as a response to the Soviet challenge
but to the foreign policy disasters of the 1930s and 1940s. After World
War II, [**U.S. officials** decided to **maintain**]{.underline} the
nation's **[primacy]{.underline}**, [**thwart** dangerous
**aggressors**]{.underline}, and [build a **secure**]{.underline},
prosperous [international **order**]{.underline} in [which the United
States could thrive]{.underline}. After the Cold War, [they decided to
**keep this strategy** going]{.underline}, even in the absence of an
immediate peer competitor.

[From]{.underline} George H. W. [Bush to]{.underline} Barack
[Obama]{.underline}, post--Cold War [[presidents]{.mark} worked hard to
further]{.underline} the efforts their predecessors started, [**shaping
an environment** conducive to **American interests**]{.underline} and
ideas. [They]{.underline} promoted free trade and globalization,
[maintained]{.underline} and even [**[expanded]{.mark}** the
country's]{.underline} global network of [[**alliances** and]{.mark}
**military [bases]{.mark}**]{.underline}, policed the global commons,
[and tried [to **stabilize**]{.mark} regional **[conflicts]{.mark}** and
promote **h**uman **r**ights]{.underline}. [Unchecked by **great-power
rivals**]{.underline}, [[Washington]{.mark} did become more willing to
use military force]{.underline} in the periphery on behalf of national
ideals. But even then, [it **[hardly ran amok]{.mark}** [in search of
**monsters**]{.mark} to **destroy**, [**abstaining**]{.mark} from
**[interventions]{.mark}** in **[Rwanda]{.mark}**, the
**[A]{.mark}frican [G]{.mark}reat [L]{.mark}akes**, **[Sudan]{.mark}**,
the **Caucasus**, **[Ukraine]{.mark}**, **[Myanmar]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} **[other]{.mark}** potential
**case[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The basic outlines of recent American
strategy would be recognizable to officials stretching back generations,
because [its goal has remained constant]{.underline}: [**fostering** a
**world** guided by **American leadership**]{.underline}, rooted in
American values, and [protected by American power]{.underline}.

**[[Have there been]{.underline}]{.mark}** disappointments and even
[**[disasters]{.mark}** along the way?
**[Absolutely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Globalization]{.underline} and
democratization [were supposed to [mellow China and
Russia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-02-10/new-spheres-influence)]{.underline} and
help them fit easily into the U.S.-led order. [That hasn't worked out as
well]{.underline} as hoped. [**No**rth **Ko**rea **went nuclear**
despite a series of]{.underline} U.S. [presidents swearing they would
never let it happen]{.underline}. [Before **9/11**, Washington didn't
take **terrorism** seriously]{.underline} enough;
[afterward]{.underline}, [it became obsessed with stopping
it]{.underline} at all costs. [And]{.underline} far too many **[military
interventions]{.underline}**---from [**Somalia** to **Afghanistan**,
**[Iraq]{.mark}** to **Libya**]{.underline}---[have been]{.underline}
misconceived and **[[mishandled]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[As serious as these]{.underline} failures [were]{.underline}, however,
[they were no worse than those]{.underline} occurring [during other
periods]{.underline} in U.S. history. [The]{.underline} quarter [century
after **World War II** saw the loss of **China**]{.underline}, the [end
of a nuclear monopoly]{.underline}, the [erection of the **Iron
Curtain**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the **[Berlin
Wall]{.underline}**, a [bloody **stalemate** in **Korea**]{.underline},
a [**communist takeover** in Cuba]{.underline}, [and a **catastrophic
war** in Vietnam]{.underline}. The following two decades witnessed the
[collapse of]{.underline} the **[Bretton Woods]{.underline}** system,
[an energy crisis and **OPEC**]{.underline} oil [embargo]{.underline},
[anti-American revolutions in **Iran and Nicaragua**]{.underline}, a
bungled [intervention in **Lebanon**]{.underline}, [**dirty** **wars**
in **Central America**]{.underline}, the [Iran-contra]{.underline}
scandal, [and]{.underline} the **[Tiananmen Square]{.underline}**
massacre. [Some degree of **failure**]{.underline}, even tragedy, [is
**inescapable**]{.underline} in foreign policy. [**[What
matters]{.mark}** most [**is** not]{.mark}]{.underline} the presence of
[[individual]{.mark} triumphs or [disasters but **the collective
balance**]{.mark}]{.underline} between them. From this perspective, the
[post--Cold War era looks]{.underline} significantly
[better]{.underline}, for [[**set against** the **failures**]{.mark} [is
a]{.mark} **giant success**]{.underline}---[the emergence of a far [more
**peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline}, prosperous, and [**liberal**
international **[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with a prosperous and
secure United States at its center.

[Critics count the problems]{.underline} that have occurred [but
**ignore** the **problems** that have been **avoided**]{.underline}.
[There were **plenty of ways** the world could have gone
**haywire**]{.underline} after 1989. Leading scholars, for example,
foresaw a descent into [vicious instability]{.underline}. [**Germany and
Japan** would **turn hungry** and **revisionist**]{.underline} again,
[**security vacuums** would **emerge**]{.underline} in [**Central
Europe** and **East Asia**]{.underline}, and [**nationalism**,
**aggression**, and nuclear **proliferation** would run
**rampant**]{.underline}. "We will soon miss the Cold War," John
[[Mearsheimer [predicted](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/politics/foreign/mearsh.htm)]{.underline}]{.mark} in
1990. "The prospect of **[major [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even
wars . . . [is likely to **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}
dramatically."

[[Not quite]{.mark}. [The **long**]{.mark} **[peace]{.mark}
[continued]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [**great-power** relations
remained]{.underline} relatively **[calm]{.underline}**. German and
Japanese [[**revisionism** **never
materialized**]{.underline}]{.mark}---because those [countries
remained]{.underline} tightly [embraced within a]{.underline} strong
U.S. [**alliance system** and a broader]{.underline} [**l**iberal
**i**nternational **o**rder]{.underline}. [An outbreak of
**nationalism**]{.underline} and ethnic aggression [was **contained** in
the Balkans]{.underline}. The countries of the former Warsaw Pact did
not descend into chaos but embarked on political and economic reform,
[relaxing into]{.underline} a newly [secure]{.underline} environment
inside **[NATO]{.underline}**. [Asia did not collapse into]{.underline}
vicious [rivalries]{.underline}; under U.S. guidance, it continued its
remarkable post-1979 stretch of peace as billions of people benefited
from decades of sustained economic growth. The number of
**[democracies]{.underline}** in the world [**rose**
dramatically]{.underline}. [Even **[nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration** has
[remained]{.mark}]{.underline}
relatively [[[limited]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/non-proliferation-limitation-and-reduction),
as [Washington continued to provide **security guarantees**]{.underline}
to allies [so they would **not pursue**]{.underline} independent
[nuclear **arsenals**]{.underline}, orchestrated a campaign to secure
loose nuclear materials, and [[punished **rogue states**]{.mark} that
tried to buck the **nonproliferation** regime]{.underline}. In short,
after 1989, [the deep global **[engagement]{.mark} favored by the Blob**
[kept the world]{.mark} moving [forward]{.mark}]{.underline} on a
generally positive track, [[rather than]{.mark} regressing to the
historical mean of **[tyranny]{.mark}, depression, [and
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Yes]{.mark}, **[instability is returning]{.mark}** in]{.underline}
both [**[Asia]{.mark}** and **[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[globalization and **democracy** are]{.underline} currently [in
**retreat**]{.underline}, [[[intense
**competitions**](https://www.brookings.edu/research/china-and-the-return-of-great-power-strategic-competition/) with
**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} loom]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
the new **[[corona]{.mark}virus]{.underline}** pandemic [has
[reminded]{.mark} the world of the [**downsides** of
**connectivity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [the return of
**great**-**power** **rivalry**]{.underline} in recent years [has been
fueled **less by** U.S. **overreach** than by **questions about** its
**stamina**]{.underline}. [Had Washington followed the]{.underline}
recommendations of the **[Blob's critics and retrenched]{.underline}**
from its global commitments after 1989, rather than leaning into them,
[things would **look even worse**]{.underline} now. [[If]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} had [[pursued]{.mark} a
strategy of **[o]{.mark}ff[s]{.mark}hore
[b]{.mark}alancing**]{.underline}, say, by [winding down its **overseas
obligations**]{.underline}, would it be sitting pretty now? It is hard
to see how [withdrawing from Europe]{.underline} in the 1990s [or not
expanding NATO would have encouraged]{.underline} less bullying from
Moscow. More likely, it would simply have given [a **resurgent
Russia**]{.underline} greater freedom [to **reassert** its
**influence**]{.underline}. Pulling back from the
[Asia-Pacific]{.underline} region, similarly, [[would]{.mark} **likely**
[have **undermined**]{.mark} the United States' [**ability** to
**hedge** against]{.mark}]{.underline} the negative consequences of
[**China's** **[rise]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And **[[less
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** by Washington [on a global liberal
agenda in **trade**, politics, and **human rights** [would **not**
]{.mark}**have [improve]{.mark}d the [world]{.mark}** or prepared
it]{.underline} institutionally [[to handle]{.mark} global challenges,
such as [**pandemics** and **climate**]{.mark} **change**]{.underline}.

In retrospect, it is easy to identify specific policies and decisions
one would want to change. [[It is **hard**]{.mark}**er [to identify an
alternative]{.mark}** strategy that would]{.underline} have [delivered
clearly superior results]{.underline}---and [that is the true standard
by which real-world foreign policies deserve to be judged]{.underline}.

THE RETURN OF THE BLOB

[[How about]{.underline}]{.mark} the critics' third
[**[argument]{.mark}**, [that]{.mark} [**escaping** the]{.mark}
**influence of the [Blob]{.mark}** [would **make**]{.mark} American
**[policy]{.mark}** more **[effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
country more secure? As it happens, [[a **real-time test**]{.mark} of
that proposition **[has been running]{.mark}**]{.underline} for over
three years. [The **[Trump]{.mark}** administration has
**[sidelined]{.mark}** national security
**[professionals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and professionalism, [to a
degree unprecedented]{.underline} in the modern era. The
[president]{.underline} has routinely [**disregarded** the advice of
apolitical **career officials**]{.underline}, [accused them of
disloyalty]{.underline} and
even [treason](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/appalling-attack-alexander-vindman/601000/),
and **[[purged]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[top ranks]{.mark} of the
**administration**]{.underline} of anybody unwilling to toe the official
line of the day (whatever that may be). [The **results**]{.underline} of
this experiment **[are not encouraging]{.underline}**. So far [it has
produced **poor policy**, poor **execution**, and poor
**outcomes**]{.underline}.

Unforced [errors are]{.underline} one of [the **hallmarks** of the
Trump]{.underline} administration's [**foreign policy**.]{.underline}

The [administration launched an]{.underline} overdue [effort to confront
**China**]{.underline} on its trade practices, [only to **hobble the
approach** by [withdrawing]{.mark} from
the **[T]{.mark}**rans-**[P]{.mark}**acific
**[P]{.mark}**artnership]{.underline} and [starting]{.underline}
simultaneous [**[trade wars]{.mark}** with]{.underline} American
[allies]{.underline}. It [punished Russia]{.underline} for its
territorial aggression and electoral sabotage, [only to be **undercut**
**by** the president's embrace of]{.underline} Russian
President [Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} ](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2019-08-12/putin-great)and
by his personal vendettas relating to Ukraine. [The
president]{.underline} twice [announced]{.underline}, and twice
partially reversed, [a decision to **[withdraw]{.mark}** troops [from
**Syria**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [**[battering]{.mark}** U.S.
**[cred]{.mark}ibility**]{.underline} without actually leaving the
conflict. Thanks to diplomatic bungling and presidential credulity,
[**No**rth **Ko**rea is **no more contained**]{.underline} than it was
three years ago, [and **Japan**, **So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline}, and
the United States [are all **at odds**]{.underline}. [Because of
arbitrary]{.underline} White House [interference with **military
justice**]{.underline} and other issues, [**c**ivil-**m**ilitary
**r**elations]{.underline} [have **cratered**]{.underline}. What links
these cases is not ideology but competence---all involved basic mistakes
that were pointed out by experts inside and outside government, only to
be contemptuously ignored by the White House.  

Even when the administration's policy choices have been defensible in
conception, they have often been botched in execution, due to a
disregard for expert advice and a disdain for the details of
implementation. The administration could have tried to [remedy the
defects](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-11-15/better-iran-deal-within-reach) of
the Iran nuclear deal, for example, in a way that included European
powers rather than alienating them. It could have increased pressure on
Tehran with a plan for converting that pressure into lasting results. It
could have gotten something in return for diplomatic concessions given
to Israel and Saudi Arabia. And it could have reformed NAFTA without
gratuitously harming relations with Canada and Mexico.

As for results, [[the]{.mark} current [**pandemic**
shows]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[what happens when]{.mark} national
[policy is **driven by amateur**]{.mark} **improvisation** rather than
professional planning]{.underline}. Pandemics have been a known danger
for decades, and [[the **Blob** **has**]{.mark} **a** [suggested
**playbook** for]{.mark} handling them]{.underline}---constant
vigilance, [early [**detection** and
**monitoring**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a [unified national
response]{.underline} in coordination [with **global
partners**]{.underline}, and much more. Coming into office, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [was fully briefed]{.underline} on
the challenge---[and chose to look the other way]{.underline},
downgrading the relevant technocrats and pushing for deep cuts in global
health and disease programs. At the crucial early stages of the crisis,
[when a[ **robust** multilateral
**effort**](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-18/pandemic-and-toll-transatlantic-discord) might
have had maximum effect]{.underline}, [the administration]{.underline}'s
disorganization and denial [left Washington on the
sidelines]{.underline}. As the disease raced around the world and took
hold in the United States, officials desperate to sound the alarm and
begin [**preventive measures** were **silenced**]{.underline} by a
president unwilling to hear bad news. And once the direness of the
medical situation was finally recognized, the administration tried to
shift blame, going so far as to cut funding for the World Health
Organization in the midst of the pandemic, simply in order to create a
politically useful scapegoat.

[[The **establishment** makes **mistakes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, often
big ones. [**[But]{.mark}** in its collective capacity, [**it
learns**]{.mark} from them [and changes
course]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[which is why **the**]{.mark} liberal
international [**order** **has**]{.mark} **not only [lasted]{.mark} for
generations** [but]{.mark} **deepened** and [broadened]{.mark} **[over
time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Purging experience and disinterested
expertise](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/review-essay/2020-04-06/few-good-men) from
U.S. foreign policy has already caused problems. The longer it
continues, the worse things will get. And the more **[many will hope for
the return of the Blob.]{.underline}**

In his article "Why America's Grand Strategy Has Not Changed: Power,
Habit, and the U.S. Foreign Policy Establishment," Patrick [[Porter
argues]{.mark} that the continuity of [U.S.]{.mark} grand
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} since World War II [has [resulted from a
**group-think mentality**]{.mark}]{.underline} fostered by a powerful
foreign policy elite---"the Blob"---[[that **stifles debate**]{.mark}
and prevents]{.underline} needed **[course corrections]{.underline}**.1
[[Porter]{.mark}'s]{.underline} provocative [argument
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [**[unpersuasive]{.mark}**, because
[it **overstates** the degree of **conformity**]{.mark} **and
consensus** [in U.S. strategy]{.mark} while slighting the **most obvious
explanations** for the strategy's **endurance**]{.underline}. Below we
highlight several problems with his argument.

First, [[Porter **exaggerates**]{.mark} the degree of [consensus]{.mark}
in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline} since World War II. In fact, despite
a bipartisan consensus on the necessity of U.S. global leadership in
support of a congenial international order (what Porter calls
"primacy"), intense debates about how that strategy should be
operationalized have been common in U.S. foreign policy circles.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, elected officials, and policy
commentators [[**argued heatedly** over]{.mark} such fundamental issues
as whether to pursue a **Europe-first** or **Asia-first
strategy**]{.underline} in the 1950s, whether and how aggressively to
combat Soviet and communist influence in the developing world, whether
to make or avoid defense commitments on the Asian mainland, whether to
pursue détente or confrontation with the Soviet Union in the 1970s,
whether to use force to reverse Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in
1990--91, [whether to **expand** the **[N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic
[T]{.mark}reaty [O]{.mark}rganization**]{.underline} after the Cold War,
[[and whether to]{.underline} **[invade Iraq]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
2003. [[These]{.mark} debates [reflected **genuine intellectual
disagreements**]{.mark}]{.underline} that pitted members of the Blob
against one another. Porter would likely respond that such debates were
essentially about tactics, but [the fact that [the]{.mark} foreign
policy [community]{.mark} has engaged in knock-down, drag-out debates
over issues of such enormous strategic importance shows that it [is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} as **[[unified]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
the marketplace of ideas not as limited, as Porter claims.

Second, [[although Porter argues]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[dissenting]{.mark} foreign policy]{.underline}**
**[[views]{.underline}]{.mark}** advocating an approach he calls
"restraint" [[tend to be **marginalized**, departures]{.mark} from a
**strategy of U.S. leadership** [have **time and again** received a
hearing]{.mark}]{.underline} at the highest levels of government. In the
1950s and 1960s, Presidents Dwight [[**Eisenhower**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} John **[[Kennedy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
repeatedly [[considered **withdrawing**]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
[**troops** [from Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 Similar debates occurred
in Congress in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When Jimmy
**[[Carter]{.underline}]{.mark}** took office, he [**strongly
[favored]{.mark}** [withdrawing]{.mark} U.S. troops [from
**So**]{.mark}**uth [Ko]{.mark}rea**]{.underline}.3 In the early 1990s,
the George H.W. [[**Bush** and]{.underline}]{.mark} Bill
**[[Clinton]{.underline}]{.mark}** administrations initially
[[delegated]{.underline}]{.mark} management of the crisis in the former
[**[Yugoslavia]{.mark}** to]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an NATO
allies. In 2011, Barack [[**Obama** **withdrew**]{.mark} **U.S. troops
[from Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline} as part of a broader move toward an
offshore balancing strategy in the Middle East.4 In other words,
presidents and other [**[political leaders]{.mark}** in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[have]{.mark} often been
willing to [consider **significant changes** in]{.mark} U.S. [strategy,
and]{.mark} they have sometimes even [implemented policies that]{.mark}
represented a **meaningful [shift toward
retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline} and restraint.

Third, [the reason that many of [these]{.mark} departures [were
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately
**[[undertaken]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or proved fleeting---[is **not**
because policymakers denied them a **fair, open hearing**]{.underline}.
[It is [because they were]{.mark}]{.underline} judged---or later
shown---to be [**substantively [inferior]{.mark}** [to more assertive
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Eisenhower **never
withdrew**]{.underline} U.S. troops [from **Europe**]{.underline},
[because he understood that doing so would have threatened to
**destabilize**]{.underline} the interlocking series of arrangements
that deterred the Soviet Union while pacifying Germany and **[Western
Europe]{.underline}**.5 [Carter never withdrew]{.underline} U.S. troops
[from South Korea, for fear that **doing so** would have risked
incentivizing **South Korean nuclear proliferation**]{.underline} and
destabilizing the fragile balance in a critical part of the world.6 The
United States ultimately took the lead in addressing the crackup of
Yugoslavia when the inability of the Europeans to deal with the crisis
had become clear. [Obama did draw down U.S. forces in Iraq, but large
swaths of that country]{.underline} (and Syria) [were subsequently
**overrun** by]{.underline} the \[**[ISIL]{.underline}**\] Islamic
State, compelling a reassertion of U.S. military and diplomatic
engagement.7 In these and other cases, an emphasis on [[**U.S.
leadership has persisted**, because that approach has been]{.mark}
deemed---after **significant debate**]{.underline} or hard
experience---[**[superior]{.mark}** to the alternatives.]{.underline}

Fourth, and related, [Porter slights [the **simplest explanation**
for]{.mark} why there has been substantial [consistency in]{.mark} U.S.
[strategy: **because it works.**]{.mark}]{.underline} As scholars have
demonstrated, [[the past **seventy years** have been **among the best**
in]{.mark} human history in terms of **rising**]{.underline} global and
U.S. [**[prosperity]{.mark}**, the spread of]{.underline} democracy and
human **[rights]{.underline}**, [the [**avoidance** of **great power
war**,]{.mark} and the **decline of war in general**.]{.underline}8 It
has also been a period when the world's leading power consistently
pursued a grand strategy geared explicitly toward achieving those
goals[. [To prove]{.mark} that [U.S.]{.mark} grand [strategy persists
for reasons **other than utility**, Porter would have to show]{.mark}
that [U.S. leadership has **not been necessary**]{.mark} **to those
outcomes**]{.underline} or that it is no longer necessary. **[But [he
does not do so]{.mark}]{.underline}** ([[or even really **try** to do
so]{.underline}]{.mark}), [and [his article **does not engage**
the]{.mark} relevant social science **[scholarship]{.mark}** and
historical literature [establishing a **causal connection** between
**U.S. engagements** and]{.mark} **key aspects** of [the]{.mark}
relatively benign [global order]{.mark}]{.underline}.9

Finally, **[[critics of primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** consistently
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Porter does, [that [their ideas
are]{.mark}]{.underline} censored or [[**excluded** from **policy
debates**. Yet, **critics**]{.mark} of U.S. grand strategy [are
**prominent**]{.mark} **within the academy**]{.underline}, including at
prestigious institutions such as the University of Chicago, Harvard, and
the Massachusetts Institute of [Technology. Their **op-eds** and
**essays** appear in the New York Times]{.underline}, Foreign Policy,
and Foreign Affairs, [among other]{.underline} prominent
"[mainstream]{.underline}" [outlets, and **their work** receives
**generous funding**]{.underline}. Leading [**critics of primacy** are
regular participants in]{.underline} U.S. **[government--sponsored
outreach initiatives]{.underline}** such as the National Intelligence
Council's Intelligence Associates program. Not least, although Porter
and many other realists in the academy deplore key aspects of the
current president's foreign policy, that president's own core critique
of the foreign policy elite echoes those made by academic realists.10 If
this is censorship, it is a remarkably ineffective form of censorship.
Perhaps [[the reason primacy endures is **not that the marketplace of
ideas is broken**, but that it is **working**]{.mark} **fairly
well.**]{.underline}

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the White House, [[university
halls]{.underline}]{.mark}, and op-eds pages, [[experts]{.mark} are
**[under siege]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President Trump calls them
"terrible," and so it is little surprise that most of the individuals
driving his China policy are not China specialists, do not speak
Mandarin, and have little in-country experience.

The most recent critique of area specialists came in the form of an
op-ed by my colleague Hal Brands. The piece argues that "[[great power
gurus]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- [those **primarily
[well-versed]{.mark}** [in **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations theory]{.underline} --- [have]{.underline} a
[better track record at predicting Chinese behavior than China
hands]{.underline}. Brands is not alone; many generalists believe their
[positions]{.underline} are somehow less biased and [[reflect **better
analysis** and]{.mark} **strategic [thinking]{.mark}** [because they are
not]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the words of Aaron Friedberg, "[[a]{.mark}
card-carrying [member of the **China**]{.mark}**-watching
[frat]{.mark}ernity**]{.underline}."

Is Hal Brands correct? The evidence he offers does not make an
open-and-shut case. Robert Kagan predicted in 1997 that China would
challenge the United States in the region and perhaps globally, but it
didn't happen for at least a decade and a half. Beijing's strategy of
reassuring smaller countries and prioritizing positive relations with
great powers created a relatively stable and peaceful environment in
Asia until, arguably, 2012. Also, whether generalists admit it or not,
they have relied on the hard work of China hands in their own research.
In making his argument that China will "struggle for mastery in Asia,"
Friedberg relies on specialists' assessments of Chinese history and
strategic culture, as well as numerous Chinese sources translated for
him by Chinese speakers. Lastly, you have to evaluate predictions as a
whole. In 2014, John Mearsheimer predicted great power rivalry with
proxy wars between American allies and Chinese allies and attempts by
Beijing to forge ties with Canada and Mexico to weaken U.S. dominance in
the Western Hemisphere. Neither have happened.

To state the obvious, there are people on both sides who got it wrong.
All experts should be humble about their assessments and open to the
ways that Chinese interests, behavior, and strategy may change. Also,
the knowledge of history, strategy and theory continues to be useful
tools in research, analysis and advocacy. For this reason, many
foreign-policy China hands of this generation invest in building equally
strong theoretical backgrounds as they do in country knowledge. But for
whatever reason, we are seeing a trend of discounting area expertise.
Because of this, many of us couch our research agendas in language that
appeals to generalists and downplay our strong China backgrounds for the
sake of publishing in political science journals or scoring tenure.

[[Creating]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**political [culture]{.mark}** [that
values]{.mark} **China [experts]{.mark}** is about [more than]{.mark}
**just [ego]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Brands also argues, the
[**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates needs]{.underline} a [good
[strategy]{.mark} if is to prevail]{.underline}. Developing such a
strategy is [[only possible by including]{.mark} **China
ex[perts]{.mark}** [who]{.mark}se bread and butter is
[decipher]{.mark}ing]{.underline} what motivates [[Chinese behavior as
well as how to **shape** and **constrain** it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
some [[generalists **admit** they are less proficient
at]{.underline}]{.mark} the "[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[why]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[than those
with]{.mark} **area [expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is one thing
to predict that Chinese military power will grow, it is quite another to
predict the anti-access area denial strategy that China initially
adopted; or to predict that China would rely primarily on coercive
diplomacy, information operations and lawfare to promote its claims in
the South China Sea. China specialists can tell us why China still only
has one overseas base, and why it is in Djibouti; why China has chosen
to expand its power globally initially through One Belt, One Road and
not a global military presence like the United States; or why China was
unlikely to liberalize as it became richer.

The second [[shortcut]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps more popular than
the first, [[is]{.mark} to stand up]{.underline} always against
"imperialism"---or, a shortcut inside the shortcut, [**[always]{.mark}
to oppose** American policies abroad]{.underline}.
[**[Anti-Americanism]{.mark}** is a common left politics]{.underline},
which, again, sometimes gets things right and sometimes doesn't. I
believe that it got things right in Vietnam in 1967; it mostly got
things right from the beginning to the end of the twentieth century in
Central and South America; it got Iran right in 1953, when leftists
criticized the anti-Mossadegh coup, and it got Iraq right in 2003. But
that's not enough to make the shortcut a reliable one. The [[defeat of
**Nazism** and **Stalinism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the two [**[most
brutal]{.mark} political [regimes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} world [history,
was]{.mark}]{.underline} in significant ways [[American
work]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many peopl[e on the left supported
that]{.underline} work, [as we should]{.underline} have.

In 1967, Dwight Macdonald wrote to Mary McCarthy that the American war
in Vietnam proved "that despite all the good things about our internal
political-social-cultural life, we have become an imperialist power, and
one that, partly because of these domestic virtues, is a most inept
one."37 We are still inept: in December 2005, with 100,000 American
soldiers in Iraq, we organized an election there --- and our man came in
third. This result may be without precedent in imperial history. (It
might suggest that we were less interested in imperial control than in
promoting democracy, though the Iraqi politician who came in first
wasn't much of a democrat.) Macdonald's understanding of US imperialism
reflects a political intelligence and a moral balance that are mostly
missing in contemporary anti-American writing.

Another often used shortcut is to oppose everything Israel does and to
blame it for much that it hasn't done, since it is the "lackey" of
American imperialism or, alternatively, the dominant force shaping
American foreign policy. The policies of recent Israeli governments
require strong criticism --- the occupation, the settlements, the
refusal to suppress Jewish thugs and terrorists on the West Bank. But
much of the left attack on Israel has little to do with its policies and
more to do with its existence, which is taken to be the root cause of
all evils in the Middle East. This view violates all the requirements of
realism --- by which I mean simply a readiness to see the world as it
really is.

The last [[shortcut]{.underline}]{.mark} is [to [support every
government that calls itself **leftist or**]{.mark}
**anti-imperialist**]{.underline} and [sets itself **[against
America]{.mark}**]{.underline}n interests. This is different from the
old Stalinist shortcut: support the Soviet Union, whatever it does,
because it is the first proletarian dictatorship and the first workers'
paradise. [[That]{.mark} kind of [politics is]{.mark}]{.underline}, I
think, definitively finished, though it had a brief afterlife focused on
China and then, with very few believers, on Albania and
[**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}. The more recent
version celebrates Maximal Leaders like Gamal Nasser, Fidel Castro, or
Hugo Chávez; there are also short-lived infatuations, such as Michel
Foucault's affair with the future Ayatollah Khomeini. [[Leftist
enthusiasm for **populist dictatorships**]{.mark} is one of our **sad
stories**]{.underline}, which ends when resources run out, the failure
to build the economy suddenly becomes undeniable, and the military takes
over. [[But]{.mark} often the]{.underline} Maximal [[Leader is a
military]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~man himself~~ \[[[person
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}\], [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[repressive role]{.underline}]{.mark} of the army simply
[[becomes]{.mark} **more [obvious]{.mark}** [over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Latin America today, the better left is
represented by socialists and social-democrats in countries like Chile,
Brazil, and Costa Rica who reject demagogic populism and struggle to
produce economic growth, greater equality, and a stronger welfare state
--- and who attract less enthusiasm from American leftists than they
deserve.38

There is a lot to be said for [the **default position**. [We
should]{.mark} work]{.underline} in the place we know best [to [make
things better]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[improvement of
**humanity**]{.mark} begins]{.underline} at home. This argument has
special force for Americans, who live [[in a]{.mark}n]{.underline}
increasingly unequal society that is also a near-[[hegemonic world
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need to be wary of adventures abroad that
make our work at home more difficult.

Still, good leftists can't avoid internationalism. We will be engaged
again and again in arguments about what we should do or what we should
urge the United States to do to help people in trouble or comrades
abroad. Sometimes there is nothing that the United States can do, at
least nothing it is likely to do right. But even when we oppose American
action in other countries, we can be active ourselves --- providing
moral, political, and financial support to \[people\] ~~men and women~~
fighting in self-defense or in defense of others. There is no magic
answer to the question, What should we do? But the [[ideological
shortcuts]{.underline}]{.mark} I've just described, [**[lazily]{.mark}
adopted** and rigidly [held]{.mark}]{.underline}, have [served us badly
in the past and are]{.underline} almost [certain to [serve us
badly]{.mark} in the future. [Sticking with them
means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[get]{.mark} [things right **only by accident**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Political intelligence and moral sensitivity work much better than
ideology, and they are what should guide our choice of comrades and our
decisions about when and how to act abroad.
**[[Dictators]{.underline}]{.mark}** and terrorists [[are **never our
comrades**]{.mark}. We should embrace]{.underline} only those ~~men and
women~~ \[people\] who really believe in and practice [democracy and
equality. We should act abroad]{.underline} only [with those who **share
our commitments**]{.underline} and then, only in ways consistent with
those commitments. This is the politics that I want to call left
internationalism.

#### Aligning with China against the US because of 'human rights' is [academic garbage]{.underline} propagated by Chinese media.

[[Beijing's criticism of the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, however, differs from that seen around
the globe. China's critique [[does not stem from]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**genuine [concern]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} universal
[**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights and]{.underline} the [well-being
of African Americans]{.underline}. The [[Chinese
people]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} been
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[opportunity to
protest]{.underline}]{.mark} in solidarity with Americans --- or
[[against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[abuses of black residents in
China]{.mark} itself. **Anti-black [racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
remains [[rampant]{.mark} on the Chinese internet]{.underline},
untouched by [[censors]{.underline}]{.mark} who seek to [[**crush
opinions** the government dislikes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its
[[motivation is]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[to tell the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, and everybody else,
[[to stop criticizing China over its own]{.mark} **human rights
[abuses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Underneath Beijing's commentary on the
U.S. unrest is a deeply cynical voice that asks: If the U.S. authorities
can do it, why shouldn't we?

Last Friday afternoon, Trump held a press conference to denounce China's
plan to devise a national security law to crack down on Hong Kong's
dissents. He threatened to end U.S. recognition of Hong Kong's special
trading status and to sanction Chinese officials hurting Hong Kong's
freedom. It is going to bring real damage to [**[Chinese]{.mark}
companies** and **wealthy [elites]{.mark}**]{.underline} who have been
[[using Hong Kong as a back door]{.mark} to]{.underline} gain access to
foreign capital, sensitive technology, and channels to [relocate their
wealth oversea]{.underline}s.

That night, after Trump's speech, major cities across the United States
were engulfed in flames, National Guards were mobilized, and protesters
clashed with riot police near the White House. The president reportedly
hid briefly in a bunker. The [Chinese authorities]{.underline} have been
heavily criticized for their [[crackdown on]{.mark} **Hong Kong
[protests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for the Uighur [[concentration camps,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} for the [[arrests of]{.mark} rights [lawyers.
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} must be [[delighted to
see]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U.S.]{.mark} **global
[reputation]{.mark}** [tarnished]{.mark}]{.underline} as its problems of
racism and police brutality are brought into the spotlight. It would be
surprising if [Beijing]{.underline} did not [[seize]{.mark} the [moment
to **criticize** the]{.mark}]{.underline} double standards of the
[[White House]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [cynicism [underlines]{.mark}
Beijing's]{.underline} response to criticism of its [[bullying
behavior]{.mark} in the international arena]{.underline}. When an
international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines
against Chinese claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea in 2016,
Beijing made it clear it would not abide by the ruling. It pointed out
that the United States violated international law all the time and,
hypocritically, hadn't even acceded to the relevant U.N. convention
itself.

Such [rhetoric]{.underline} has [grown common over]{.underline} the
[last few decades]{.underline}, as the [**[C]{.mark}**hinese
**[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty]{.underline} gradually
abandoned its appeal for a more just social system and world order.
Instead, the party has become [**increasingly [explicit]{.mark}** [in
referring to]{.mark}]{.underline} the global [[domination by Western
powers as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**license** for its own imperial
ambition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Jiang Shigong, an influential official
scholar who advises the Chinese government on Hong Kong policy and
global governance, even wrote recently that China should "absorb the
skills and achievements" of the British and American empires to
construct its own "world empire" for the sake of the Chinese people and
the world.

For those in the United States and elsewhere who aspire for more
equality, justice, and liberty, [it is a [mistake to see Beijing
as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**exotic [progressive]{.mark}** force with
which to ally]{.underline}. [[Beijing points to the]{.mark}
violence]{.underline} and injustice [of the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [to exonerate]{.mark} itself from [its own]{.mark}
**egregious [violence]{.mark}** [and injustices]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Police brutality and racism in the United States are unimaginably
horrific. But [[U.S.]{.mark} authorities]{.underline} today are [[not
using]{.mark} these [protests as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[excuse
to]{.underline}]{.mark} arrest dissenting legislators and professors, to
wholly outlaw peaceful assembly and rights organizations, to pressure
companies and universities to fire employees sympathetic with the
protesters, to arrest people for criticizing the government on social
media, or to [[lock up]{.underline}]{.mark} 1 million
[[minorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in reeducation camps. [[These]{.mark}
**abuses [are routine]{.mark}** [in China]{.mark} and]{.underline}

#### Russia's worse.

//CYang

But [[African leaders should have]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[more
fundamental [concern]{.mark}]{.underline}** than these --- at least,
those who are committed to advancing peace and democracy.
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} is [attempting to undermine the global
order that]{.underline} has [guided international relations for
the]{.underline} better part of the [last century]{.underline}.
[Building on]{.underline} Russia's previous annexation of [Crimea
and]{.underline} parts of northern [Georgia]{.underline} as well as its
prior occupation of [Ukraine's]{.underline} Donbas region, [Putin is
[taking a **sledgehammer** to the]{.mark} foundation of the]{.underline}
once stable [**post-[World]{.mark} War II** [order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This attempt to normalize expansionist ambitions [will [have **profound
consequences** for Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}. Would-be [[tsars]{.mark}
[across the continent]{.mark}]{.underline} --- who, like Putin, have
[[evade]{.mark}d [term limits]{.mark} to stay in power
indefinitely]{.underline} while [[eliminat]{.mark}ing]{.underline} their
[[political opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} --- are watching closely,
asking if Putin can [get away with]{.underline} this [**brazen
[overreach]{.mark}** and flout the rules-based order]{.underline}, then
why can't they. It is a reasonable question to ask. [At stake
are]{.underline} established notions of
[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, territorial integrity,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[independence of member
states]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which **suddenly
[become]{.mark}**]{.underline} more temporal, arbitrary, and [[open to
**violent contestation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Perhaps the most eloquent defense of the existing order, premised on
these foundational principles, came from Kenya's permanent
representative to the United Nations: ambassador Martin Kimani, who
warned Putin and the Russian military to respect its border with
Ukraine, using [[Africa's]{.underline}]{.mark} own [colonial
[past]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[highlight]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[dangers of]{.mark} stoking the]{.underline} "**[embers of [dead
empires]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

So what does a Russian-shaped international order look like for Africa?

A [primary feature is]{.underline} the [challenge to the
**inviolability** of established boundaries]{.underline}. There are
currently some 100 contested borders on the continent, most of them
stemming from arbitrarily drawn colonial boundaries. These have, for the
most part, been managed peacefully by successive [African
governments]{.underline}, [rooted in]{.underline} a [respect
for]{.underline} the principles of [[sovereignty]{.mark} and territorial
[integrity]{.mark}]{.underline} that were enshrined in the Charter of
the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and later reaffirmed in the
Constitutive Act of the African Union in 2001. Established during the
postcolonial independence period, many African states were born out of a
commitment to [[self-determination]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ironically,
[this is [the **central issue**]{.mark} being [contested]{.mark} today
[by **Russia**]{.mark}**'s invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline}.

If the lesson from Putin's invasion of Ukraine is that might makes
right, then [Africa's political geography could be **perpetually in
dispute**]{.underline}. In other words, [if]{.underline} the
[overlapping security guarantees]{.underline} provided by both the U.N.
and AU charters [can be violated with impunity]{.underline}, [then what
is to stop African leaders who envy Putin's **[aggressive]{.mark}
brand** of [authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline} from
[[follow]{.mark}ing suit]{.underline}?

Already, we see this happening in some parts of Africa.

The volatile African Great Lakes region stands out for the fragility of
its borders. The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example,
has become a target for exploitation by authoritarian leaders in
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, officially
in power since 2000, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power
since 1986, have routinely marched their troops and proxies as well as
directed their allied rebel groups to seize Congolese territory, loot
natural resources, and kill citizens with alarming impunity. In October
2021, Congolese authorities reported clashing with Rwandan troops, who
allegedly occupied several villages before retreating. And as recently
as March, the Congolese army presented evidence that the Kagame regime
was actively backing a rebellion in eastern Congo. Disregarding borders
is particularly precarious in the Great Lakes region because it carries
with it the potential to reignite one of the most cataclysmic conflicts
in recent history.

Similarly, Moscow has played a destabilizing role in Africa. Recent
years have illuminated a "new scramble for Africa" as external actors
seek to aggressively plant their politics, governance, and economic
flags across the continent. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [at
the forefront of]{.underline} this [predatory behavior by **repeatedly
[propping]{.mark}** [up]{.mark}]{.underline} isolated and [authoritarian
leaders]{.underline} --- most notably in [[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[C]{.mark}entral [A]{.mark}frican [R]{.mark}epublic]{.underline},
[[Mali]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark} --- to
advance Moscow's patently anti-democratic influence.

[[Through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[deployment of]{.mark} **shadowy and
[unaccountable]{.mark}** mercenary [groups]{.mark}]{.underline},
[polarizing [disinformation]{.mark} campaigns]{.underline}, [[election
interference]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and arms-for-resource]{.underline}
deals, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has gained influence while
[[fostering instability and]{.mark} the increased **h**uman **r**ights
[abuses]{.mark}]{.underline} that ultimately result from it.

[Russia]{.underline} has [also fomented]{.underline} --- both covertly
and overtly --- and been quick to support the many unconstitutional
[seizures of power]{.underline} recently witnessed in Africa. The
[**spate of [coups]{.mark}** and]{.underline} increasing instances of
[African leaders scrapping term limits]{.underline}, for example, better
[suit Moscow's]{.underline} vision of [remaking]{.underline} the
international order in its autocratic mold.

That a Russian-shaped order in Africa would be more oppressive is
crucial to note since most of the 16 ongoing internal conflicts on the
continent have deep roots in authoritarian forms of governance. None of
Africa's established democracies, in contrast, are in conflict. More
authoritarianism, then, can be expected to yield more conflict.

[[Tolerance for predatory]{.mark} interstate
[behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} globally, moreover, will
[[embolden]{.mark} elevated]{.underline} forms of
[[repression]{.underline}]{.mark} domestically in African states. After
all, if the enshrined principles of self-determination and popular
participation are not respected in a high-profile instance, such as
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then what international actors can be
compelled to penalize the intimidation or jailing of opposition leaders,
the shuttering of independent media outlets, and the brazen rigging of
elections in Africa? Growing autocracy [would [do]{.mark} a **grave
[injustice]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [75 percent of
[Africans]{.mark} who **regularly state**]{.underline} that [democracy
is their preferred]{.underline} form of [government]{.underline}. The
[inevitable repression]{.underline} that will result from an unfettered
international order would [also]{.underline} lead to a
[[spike]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[refugee]{.mark} flow[s and]{.mark}
**internally [displaced]{.mark}** [populations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It took the trauma of World War II to compel the international community
to unite, recognize, and sign onto the principles outlined in the U.N.
Charter. Intrinsic to this global system --- forged from hard-learned
and costly experiences --- was the importance of collective security to
deter and push back against authoritarian bullies in Europe and
elsewhere.

The Organisation of African Unity and later the AU adopted many of these
core values. Indeed, drawing on its own hard-earned lessons from
colonialism, the challenges of securing peace following the brutal wars
of the 1990s, and the aftermath of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis,
the AU rightly recognized the importance of action when faced with
violations of such universal principles.

While often underappreciated and unevenly applied, the U.N. and AU
frameworks provide a layer of international accountability against
extralegal actions as well as a critical starting point to build the
solidarity that is needed to address the challenges that the global
community faces.

As Africans grapple with the more present and disastrous aftershocks of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is important to recognize the threat
this form of authoritarian expansion will have on the continent if it is
normalized. [[History shows]{.underline}]{.mark} us that [[impunity is
**contagious**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[apathy]{.mark} in the face of
**imminent threat** [is **foolhardy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [clear
threats emanating from [Putin]{.mark}'s worldview [defy the
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [[**central** to]{.mark} an
international order]{.underline} that both [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
U.N. and [**[AU]{.mark}** helped foster]{.underline}.

Today's [restrainers]{.underline} similarly seek to [**capitalize**
on]{.underline} the suffering and difficulties associated with [the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}, as well as the broader fight
against terrorism, when they [argue for]{.underline} the [withdrawal
of]{.underline} the [remaining U.S. forces]{.underline} from these and
other conflicts.11 [[Restrainers]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, often
[[conflate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [initial [decision to
intervene]{.mark}]{.underline} at all [[with how]{.mark} a [conflict
is]{.mark} **subsequently [managed]{.mark}**]{.underline} or how
eventually to withdraw. [[These are **different**]{.mark} **policy
[decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [[one]{.mark} can be
[critical of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [2003 **invasion of
[Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline} and how the war was managed -- [while [also
believ]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [[Washington should
retain]{.underline}]{.mark} a modest [U.S. [military
presence]{.mark}]{.underline} to help prevent a return of the Islamic
State and to counter the influence of Iran.

Restrainers have also attempted to leverage the Great Recession and the
current economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic to incite
populist passions.12 They do this by falsely suggesting that defense
spending is the primary source of the federal deficit and debt.13
Defense spending is near post-World War II lows in terms of percentage
of U.S. gross domestic product and percentage of federal spending.

Restrainers consistently paint existing and potential conflicts and U.S.
military deployments with the same brush, warning of another "forever
war."14 However, not every conflict leads to an interminable quagmire.
Even the so-called War on Terror, despite its headaches, so far has
helped prevent another major foreign terrorist attack on the United
States, which many had predicted to be inevitable after 9/11.

The term "forever war" is itself curious. History, unfortunately, is a
forever war --- the chronicle of states' struggles with their enemies.
To be sure, one can write a truly wondrous history of human achievement.
But sadly, as the Spanish writer George Santayana observed, "only the
dead have seen the end of war."15

[Restrainers operate under]{.underline} the [**mistaken
[assertion]{.mark}** that]{.underline} the [[world would be]{.mark} a
[**safer** or **better**]{.mark} place [if U.S.]{.mark} influence would
**simply [recede]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 The [20th [century tells
another story]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the historian Robert Kagan argued
in his 2012 book The World America Made, the [[U.S.-led]{.mark} world
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[heralded]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[global [rise in liberalism]{.mark} and **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights]{.underline}, better [**[education]{.mark}** and
**[health]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[greater
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} more [access
to [information]{.mark}]{.underline}.17

Equally puzzling is the notion that the world's problems and conflicts
are of little consequence to the United States.18 What happens abroad
inevitably affects Americans at home. Al-Qaeda launched the 9/11 attacks
despite America's best efforts to steer clear of Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda was and is based. The Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor despite Washington's best efforts to stay out of the fray.
Isolationists initially blocked then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt
from providing greater support to an embattled Britain, and millions of
lives were lost from not confronting German leader Adolf Hitler
sooner.19

The best way to protect American interests is to engage internationally
and maintain a well-designed, forward-deployed military presence
alongside allies and partners. As Jakub J. Grygiel and A. Wess Mitchell
have noted, U.S. deployments of varying magnitude along what they call
the "unquiet frontier" that stretches from the Baltic Sea to the South
China Sea counter the rise of revisionist powers such as China, Russia,
and Iran.20 Support for U.S. allies, coupled with a U.S. military
presence in forward bases, helps deter gathering threats.21

[When Washington plays]{.underline} an [**outsized role** in shaping and
maintaining]{.underline} the [international **rules-based
order**]{.underline}, Americans and [people around the world are safer
and **more prosperous**]{.underline}. That is what the [United States
has done]{.underline}, for the most part, [since World War
II]{.underline}. And that [[leadership]{.mark} role]{.underline} has
helped [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [global
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Cold War [[did not erupt
into]{.mark} **devastating [military
confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Admittedly, the U.S.-led international order certainly has not prevented
all wars. There have been costly mistakes along the way. But
[[responding to]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[mistakes by
ignoring]{.mark} **persistent [threats]{.mark}** [and drawing down
U.S.]{.mark} military [posture]{.mark}]{.underline} for its own sake
would be [[**shortsighted** and **dangerous**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Those who welcome]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[retreat]{.mark} of U.S.
power]{.underline} have [[yet to]{.mark} **fully [answer]{.mark}** one
**important [question]{.mark}**[: What happens
after]{.mark}]{.underline} the [United States goes]{.underline} home?
When the British Empire unraveled after World War II, the United States
stepped into the void, promoting an international system based on the
rule of law. Who will follow the United States? The
[[alternatives]{.mark} are [frightening]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is far less equipped to become a
superpower but would be a [**particularly [predatory]{.mark}**[,
**corrupt**, and **avaricious**]{.mark}]{.underline} one
[[under]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its
part, actively seeks global leadership. The [Chinese Communist

and massive [[theft of **i**]{.mark}ntellectual

a Chinese-led world order. And let us all dispense with the fiction that
the European Union could be an alternative to the United States in
defending democracies.

[The global scope of American military power has been described in many
ways: **[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[primacy]{.underline}**,
[and **unipolarity**]{.underline}. Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth
(2012)1 cover the nuances of the terminology well, and I agree with
their preference for the term "Deep Engagement" that Joseph Nye coined
in a 1995 article.2 [The complex patterns and nuances of engagement
[remain **poorly understood**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a [[focus on
**conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[ignores the **preponderance of
cases**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[where]{.mark} U.S. [forces have been
**peacefully based**]{.mark} **for decades**]{.underline}. In short,
[foreign [policy]{.mark} has **[focused on the heat instead of]{.mark}
the [light]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [countless [studies]{.mark},
essays, and books [on Vietnam,]{.mark} [Afghanistan, and Iraq]{.mark}
stand [in **contrast** to the **negligible attention** given to]{.mark}
countries where the U.S. maintained large-scale and long-term troop
basing such as **[Belgium]{.mark}**, **[Korea]{.mark}**,
**[Turkey]{.mark}**, [and **Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Is the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[an empire?]{.underline} [We may just as well debate whether an elephant
most closely resembles a]{.underline} **[T]{.underline}**yrannosaurus
**[Rex]{.underline}** [or **Triceratops**]{.underline}. [Some will point
to the imperial characteristics]{.underline} that are [reflected in
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[force posture]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** [[characteristics
of]{.mark} dinosaurs or [empires]{.mark}]{.underline} (size, martial
strength, breadth) really [[have **no meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in a world where that]{.mark} entire [order is
**extinct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **21st century** is filled with a
**new order**]{.underline} [of **nation-states**]{.underline},
[**markedly different** from eras prior to 1945]{.underline}.

**[American power]{.underline}** [is best understood not by its
type]{.underline}: hard, soft, or smart, [but]{.underline} its
**[motivation]{.underline}**. This is not to say the "imperial"
motivation has disappeared from human affairs; self-preservation and
domination are instinctive human qualities. But [[there is a **new
aspect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations that has been in place for more than a century, a
form of **[altruism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[illustrated by]{.mark} the
**[widespread support]{.mark}** that exists [in the U.S.]{.mark} and
other countries [for]{.mark} **universal [human
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For many decades now,
[nations]{.underline} have routinely sought to [advance something beyond
their narrow national interests]{.underline}. I call this [a
**Promethean motivation**]{.underline}, and America a Promethean power.

The phrase is rooted in the myth of Prometheus, the rebellious god of
ancient Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the
human race, sparking the beginning of technology, growth, civilization,
and prosperity. Zeus was the ruler of the Gods of Olympus, archetype of
the emperor/king. The Gods were rulers, and humans were mere subjects.
Prometheus represents rebellion, the trickster God, undercutting the
authority of the imperial order. Legend has it that Prometheus tricked
Zeus --- repeatedly --- in order to help uplift the human race.

[[Critics]{.mark} of American intervention [**reflexively** use the
term]{.mark} **["imperial"]{.mark}** when discussing foreign
affairs]{.underline}. By far the dominant theme of imperialism in
American foreign policy has been voiced by Leftist thinkers such as
Howard Zinn, Gabriel and Joyce Kolko, and Gore Vidal. But since 1990,
the end of the Cold War, **[[neo-isolationists]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on the right have [adopted the term as well]{.mark}]{.underline},
notably Pat **[Buchanan]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Congressman Ron
**[Paul]{.underline}**. Thus [the tendency is for thinkers on the
**political extremes**]{.underline} --- globalists on the left,
nationalists on the right --- [to find common cause, whereas centrists
tend to view American power more favorably]{.underline}, as do many
foreign scholars.

Following the 9/11 attacks and concerns about state failure abroad,
proponents of American intervention began suggesting American empire in
explicit and favorable ways. Such voices included Richard Haas,
Sebastian Mallaby, and Max Boot. The fullest expression of this new
theme is found in Colossus, a 2004 book by Niall Ferguson3 (now a
colleague at the Hoover Institution), who argued "not merely that the
United States is an empire, but that it always has been an empire" and
that the ultimate threat to the nation is its own "absence of a will to
power." The book is an unappreciated gem, but one wonders if Ferguson
and his intellectual opponents share the same framework, which refuses
to draw a line between imperial states of the 15th-19th centuries and
the modern states of the 21st.

Ferguson wonderfully skewers the slipperiness of the term hegemon, which
remains "the most popular term among writers on international
relations." [Hegemony]{.underline} refers to a coercive state, like an
empire, but one that aims to [create **mutually beneficial
relationships**]{.underline}. Trying to define the nature of state power
by the distribution of benefits (exploitative or shared) misses the
point. The point is: what are first principles that motivate foreign
action?

America on the world stage should be understood in the context of its
revolutionary founding. The republic's anti-imperial birth and its sense
of manifest destiny have colored foreign affairs from early on. Consider
again Thomas Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty," which was more than a
poetic phrase. In 1809 Jefferson wrote to his successor James Madison,
"I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as
ours for extensive empire & self-government." In one of his final
letters, written in 1824, Jefferson wrote, "where this progress will
stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been receding
before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I trust,
disappear from the earth."

To simplify matters, let's accept the framework of definitions on the
Left (and also popularly understood by Americans throughout history).
[Define an empire as a nation that exploits foreign peoples, aiming to
colonize them and/or extract their resources for the
advantage]{.underline} of the empire and at the cost of the foreigners.
And for the sake of clarity, recognize a bright line that distinguishes
imperial relationships as those where subjugated peoples do not want but
are forced to abide by foreign intervention. To be specific, [[the U.S.
role in]{.mark} South [Korea **fails the imperial
test**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as does the]{.mark} post-1955
[role]{.mark} of the U.S. [in **Germany** and
**Japan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Those]{.mark} three [countries
accounted for]{.mark} nearly [**three-quarters** of U.S]{.mark}. troop
[deployments]{.mark} since 1950]{.underline}. [[Not to mention
**Spain**]{.mark}, **[Turkey]{.mark}**, [**Taiwan**, and
**Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[All]{.mark} of these [are]{.mark}
**[voluntary alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and qualitatively
distinct from forces based in Iraq.

[[For the]{.mark} **Leftist [criticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of
American empire [to hold]{.mark}, **[ev]{.mark}**idence [of domination
should be **easy**]{.mark} **to see**]{.underline}. [One would expect to
see the countries of the world that are occupied by American troops
suffering economic decline as a result]{.underline}, or at a minimum a
relative decline. [Here **[the critique falls
apart]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the world [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[hosted]{.mark} the greatest
number of American [troops]{.mark} since 1950 [have **grown the
fastest**]{.mark} **economically**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [host
[countries]{.mark} have [experienced **faster declines in child
mortality**]{.mark}, **faster [increase in]{.mark} overall
[longevity]{.mark}**, **faster [growth in infrastructure]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} even [greater improvements in]{.mark} the broadly measured
human development index (**[HDI]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. Consider as
evidence the average economic growth rates presented in table 2,
reproduced from Jones and Kane (2012).4

The record shows that [**[America's engagement]{.mark}** with allied
nations [is **unequivocally beneficial**]{.mark} for those
countries]{.underline}. But the context is what matters for future
policy choices. **[Public [perceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** of world
affairs [[are dominated by]{.mark} negatives: [bombings in]{.mark} Iraqi
[cities]{.mark}, AIDS rampant in Africa, genocides,
earthquakes]{.underline}. Foreign policy experts focus on negatives of a
subtler nature: the dilemma over Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, the
poppy trade and corruption in Afghanistan, the strategic mystery that is
China. [**[Yet]{.mark}** despite real and looming crises, the
**underlying [theme]{.mark}** of the American century [is a]{.mark}
**patient [march of human prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [deepening
and [broadening as]{.mark} economic [growth unfolds]{.mark} in the free
world]{.underline}.

[The American strategy of patient, forward deployment of U.S.
troops]{.underline}, even and especially when it is not self-interested,
[has **benefitted our allies and the world**]{.underline}. [America's
engagement in Asia and Europe since 1945 created a security umbrella
fostering **peace** and **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline}. [If
this model were applied to the Middle East]{.underline} --- supporting
allies rather than hunting monsters --- [it would reshape the region's
future for the better]{.underline}. On this point, Fallows might agree.

[[The question]{.underline}]{.mark} that haunts contemporary foreign
policy [[is **not** whether the U.S.]{.mark} military [is a force for
good]{.mark} around the globe]{.underline}. **[[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The question is: Can]{.mark} Promethean
[power be sustained?]{.mark}]{.underline} Does the United States have
the willpower to maintain a forward force posture?

#### Russia and China's "new world order" would be a nightmare for African decolonial sovereignty.

**Mhaka '22** \-- Johannesburg-based social and political commentator
(Tafi Mhaka, 4-7-2022, \"Russia's new world order is bad news for
Africa,\" Al Jazeera,
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/4/10/russias-new-world-order-is-bad-news-for-africa,
accessed 7-5-2022) \-- nikki

On March 30, just a day after a Russian missile hit an administrative
building in the port city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, killing at
least 12 people, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made the case
for the establishment of new world order. In a videotaped message to his
Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Lavrov claimed the world is "living through
a very serious stage in the history of international relations". He
added, "We, together with you, and with our sympathisers will move
towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order". Lavrov's sentiments
echoed [Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi
Jinping's February 4 joint statement announcing the beginning of a new
era in international relations. In that statement, the two leaders not
only called for a new, multipolar order but lamented the West's
"unilateral approaches to addressing international issues", claiming
such attitudes "incite contradictions, differences and confrontation"
and hamper "the development and progress of mankind".]{.underline}
Without a doubt, this is a credible observation, especially regarding
the United States' policies across the world. For example, Washington
has sanctioned Zimbabwe's government -- and rightfully so -- for
committing gross human rights abuses, but continues to support the
equally repressive Ugandan government with military hardware, cash and
training. Last month, the US Senate passed a resolution urging
"international criminal courts to investigate Putin, his security
council and military leaders for possible war crimes" in Ukraine.
Nevertheless, Washington still refuses to recognise the International
Criminal Court (ICC), or cooperate in any way with its investigation
into possible war crimes committed by US troops in Afghanistan. The
hypocrisy of the US is also apparent in its approach to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite Israel's countless,
well-documented human rights and international law violations,
decades-long illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, and
apartheid policies against the Palestinian population, the US has
blocked 53 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical
of Israel in the last five decades. And it is not only Russia and China
that are disturbed by the West's apparent hypocrisy in the international
arena. [Africa too has grave concerns about the current global order,
and has long been calling for the UN to undergo substantial reform to
address the deep-rooted injustices in its handling of international
affairs. In]{.underline} 2005, for instance, the African Union (AU)
adopted the Ezulwini Consensus, calling for a more representative and
democratic UNSC, in which Africa, like all other world regions, is
represented. And speaking at the 35th Ordinary Session of the AU
Assembly in February, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed renewed the
call for Africa to be granted a larger role in the UN. [In this context,
it may seem understandable for Africa to support the multipolar world
order Russia claims to be building with the help of China. However,
Beijing and Moscow are not calling for any reform that would diminish
the enormous sway they readily have over world affairs. They are also
not acting in a way that demonstrates under this new order they would
hold themselves to the same standards as everyone else or that less
powerful states and peoples would have better access to justice. Indeed,
as recently as in 2021, China blocked a UN Security Council statement
condemning the military coup in Myanmar. And between 2011 and 2019,
Russia vetoed no less than 14 UNSC resolutions on Syria. These great
powers are evidently selective and casual proponents of democracy and
human rights]{.underline} -- just like their nemesis, the US. [But
African nations now appear hell-bent on ignoring the hypocrisy
demonstrated by Russia and China, and eagerly awaiting the emergence of
their new world order.]{.underline} The dangers of idolising Putin's
Russia, Xi's China [Putin's popularity is at an outstandingly irrational
and possibly dangerous high in Africa. Despite the illegality and
brutality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, Putin's name
adorns long-distance buses in Zimbabwe.]{.underline} And [African
leaders also seem reluctant to punish or even caution the Russian leader
for its destructive "special military operation" in Ukraine. At the
recent UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for Russia's
suspension from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), for example, the
majority of African states either abstained -- such as South Africa --
or outright voted no -- like Ethiopia.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [South
Africa's influential opposition leader Julius Malema has urged Putin to
"teach" Ukraine and NATO a lesson because "we need a new world
orde]{.underline}r". He has also claimed that Putin has given the
Russian army clear instructions to avoid "civilian casualties" in
Ukraine. [This is despite the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights recording 1,900 civilian casualties -- with 726 people
killed, including 52 children -- mostly caused by the use of explosive
weapons in populated areas.]{.underline} In light of the disdain for
territorial integrity, humanity and the right to life Putin's Russia is
currently showing in Ukraine, Africans should stop and think how the
Russian leader's proposed new world order would likely work out for
them. And [it is not only the carnage caused by Russia in Ukraine that
should make Africa think twice about supporting the new world order
promoted by Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline} Under Putin, [Russia has
been inundated by state-affiliated and state-sponsored political filth
and terror. Putin's political rivals and anyone daring to act against
the interests of the Kremlin, including journalists, have faced
assassination attempts both in Russia and abroad.]{.underline} Many,
including former Federal Security Service agent Alexander Litvinenko and
journalist Anna Politkovskaya, have been killed. [Human rights groups
and independent media organisations have been targeted and shut down.
Elections have been turned into a sham and private enterprise has been
all but killed. Under Putin's orders, the Russian military waged many
immoral wars across the world -- Russia's indiscriminate shelling of
residential areas in Syria and Georgia claimed thousands of
lives.]{.underline} Similarly, [China under Xi is a hotbed of
repression. His administration has arbitrarily detained, tortured and
mistreated millions of Turkic Muslims in the northwestern Xinjiang
region. It has also frequently targeted intellectuals, civil rights
activists and journalists and moved to restrict LGBTQ and women's
rights]{.underline}. Thus, [Malema and other African leaders who look
forward to Putin's new world order should stop and consider what they
are wishing for. An illiberal world order led by despots with
blood-soaked histories cannot help Africa fulfil its democratic
aspirations.]{.underline} Africa must chart its own path Africa does not
need to subscribe to Chinese, Russian or American interpretations or
manifestations of democracy and multilateralism. It simply needs to
secure equal rights and representations in a genuinely progressive
multipolar international system that safeguards its democratic and
economic interests as enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the AU. The
ill-advised and misplaced enthusiasm for Putin's strongman politics is a
sombre reflection of Africa's failures and imprecise trajectory under
the toothless AU. Almost 21 years after its establishment, the AU
carries very little weight on the continent and it has almost no voice
on the global stage. And while its pursuit of permanent representation
on the UNSC is an extremely praiseworthy and essential exercise, it has
gradually turned into an expedient and intermittently expressed
soundbite. Be that as it may, [Africa should focus on establishing a
world order that is defined by strong, independent and democratic
multilateral institutions. Undoubtedly, that is what China and Russia
are eager to avoid or destroy, because they want the licence to
intimidate, repress, silence and kill, both at home and
abroad]{.underline}.

[Consistency with influential relevant theories lends
**credence**]{.underline} [to the expectation that **US security
commitments**]{.underline} [actually can shape the strategic environment
as deep engagement presupposes]{.underline}. But it is far from
conclusive. Not all analysts endorse the theories we discussed in
chapter 5. These theories make strong assumptions that states generally
act rationally and focus primarily on security. Allowing misperceptions,
emotions, domestic politics, desire for status, or concern for honor
into the picture might alter the verdict on the strategy's net expected
effects. And [[to model]{.mark} the strategy's expected [effects
we]{.mark} had to [simplify]{.mark} things by selecting two
mechanisms]{.underline}--- [**[assurance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[deterrence]{.underline}**]{.mark}--- [and examining
their effects independently, thus missing potentially **powerful
positive interactions** between them.]{.underline}

This chapter moves beyond theory to examine patterns of evidence. If the
theoretical arguments about the security effects of deep engagement are
right, what sort of evidence should we see? Two [major bodies of
evidence are most important]{.underline}: general **[empirical
findings]{.underline}** concerning the strategy's key mechanisms
[and]{.underline} **[regionally focused research]{.underline}**.

General Patterns of Evidence Three key questions about US security
provision have received the most extensive analysis. First, do alliances
such as those sustained by the United States actually deter war and
increase security? Second, does such security provision actually hinder
nuclear proliferation? And third, does limiting proliferation actually
increase security?

Deterrence Effectiveness [The determinants of [deterrence]{.mark}
success and failure have [attracted]{.mark}]{.underline} scores of
quantitative and [case study [tests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of the
case study work yields a cautionary finding: that [deterrence is much
harder in practice than in theory]{.underline}, because standard models
assume away the complexities of human psychology and domestic politics
that tend to make some states hard to deter and might cause deterrence
policies to backfire. 1 [Many quantitative
[findings]{.mark}]{.underline}, mean- while, [[are]{.mark} mutually
[contradictory]{.mark} or are clearly not relevant to extended
deterrence. But **[some]{.mark} relevant [results receive broad
support]{.mark}:**]{.underline}

- **[[Alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** generally do **[[have a
  deterrent]{.mark} effect]{.underline}**. [[In a study
  spanning]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly **[[two
  centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[Johnson]{.underline}**
  [and]{.underline} [**[Leeds]{.underline}** [found "support
  for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the hypothesis that defensive alliances
  deter the **initiation of disputes**]{.underline}." They conclude that
  "[[defensive alliances lower]{.mark} the **probability of
  international [conflict]{.mark}** and are thus a good policy option
  for states seeking to maintain peace]{.underline} in the world."
  Sechser and [Fuhrmann similarly find that formal defense pacts with
  nuclear states]{.underline} have significant deterrence benefits. 2 3

- [The overall balance of military forces]{.underline} (including
  nuclear) between states [does not appear to influence deterrence; the
  **local balance of [military forces ]{.mark}**[in the]{.mark}
  **specific [theater]{.mark}** in [which **deterrence** is]{.mark}
  actually **[practiced]{.mark}**, however, **[is
  key]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4

- **[[Forward- deployed troops enhance the]{.mark} deterrent
  [effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** of alliances with overseas allies. 5

- [Strong mutual interests and ties enhance deterrence]{.underline}. 6

- [Case [studies]{.mark} **strongly [ratify]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}
  theoretical [expectation]{.mark} that [it is easier to
  **defend**]{.mark} a given status]{.underline} [quo [than]{.mark} to
  **[challenge]{.mark} it forcefully**]{.underline}:
  [compellence]{.underline} (sometimes termed "coercion" or "coercive
  diplomacy") [is extremely hard]{.underline}.

[The most important finding]{.underline} to emerge from this voluminous
research [is that [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}--- especially
[[with]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[- armed
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** [like the United States]{.underline}---
**[actually [work]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in deterring
conflict]{.underline}. This is all the more striking in view of the fact
that what scholars call "[[selection bias]{.underline}"]{.mark} probably
[**[works against it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The **U**nited States is
more inclined to offer]{.underline}--- and protégés to seek--- [alliance
rela- tionships in settings where the **probability** of military
**conflicts** is **higher than average**]{.underline}. [The fact that
alliances work to deter conflict in precisely the situations where
**deterrence** is likely to be **especially hard** is
noteworthy.]{.underline}

More specifically, these findings buttress the key theoretical
implication that if [the United States is interested in deterring
military challenges]{.underline} to the status quo in key regions[,
[relying]{.mark} only [on]{.mark} **[latent]{.mark} military
[capabilities]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} US **[homeland]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} likely to be **far [less effective]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[than having an **overseas military posture**]{.underline}.
Similarly, they lend support to the general proposition that a [[forward
deterrence]{.mark} posture [is]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[strongly
[appealing]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a status quo power, [[because
defending]{.mark} a given status quo [is]{.mark} **far [cheaper than
overturn]{.mark}ing it**, and, once a favorable status quo is
successfully overturned, **restoring** the status quo ante can be
expected to be **fearsomely costly**]{.underline}. [[Recognizing]{.mark}
the significance of [these **findings**]{.mark} **clearly [casts
doubt]{.mark}** [on the]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[wait on the sidelines
and decide]{.mark} whether [to intervene later"
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is so strongly [favored by
**retrenchment proponents**]{.underline}.

The Causes of Nuclear Proliferation Matthew Kroenig highlights a number
of reasons why US policymakers seek to limit the spread of nuclear
weapons: "[Fear that nuclear proliferation might deter \[US leaders\]
from using military **intervention** to pursue their interests, reduce
the effectiveness of their **coercive diplomacy**, trigger **regional
instability**, undermine their **alliance structures**, dissipate their
strategic attention, and set off **further nuclear proliferation**
within their sphere of influence]{.underline}." These are not the only
reasons for concern about nuclear proliferation; [also notable are the
enhanced prospects of]{.underline} **[nuclear accidents]{.underline}**
[and the greater risk of **leakage** of]{.underline} **[nuclear material
to terrorists]{.underline}**. 9 8

[[Do]{.underline}]{.mark} deep engagement's [[security
ties]{.underline}]{.mark} [serve to [contain]{.mark} t]{.underline}he
spread of **[[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**? The literature on
the causes of proliferation is massive and faces challenges as great as
any in international relations. With few cases to study, severe
challenges in gathering evidence about inevitably secretive nuclear
programs, and a large number of factors in play on both the demand and
the supply sides, [**[findings are]{.mark} decidedly [mixed]{.mark}**.
Alliance relationships are just one piece of this complex
puzzle]{.underline}, one that is hard to isolate from all the other
factors in play. And [empirical studies face the same selection bias
problem just discussed]{.underline}: Nuclear powers are more likely to
offer security guarantees to states confronting a serious threat and
thus facing above- average incentives to acquire nuclear weapons.
Indeed, [alliance guarantees might be offered to states actively
considering the nuclear option precisely in order to try to forestall
that decision]{.underline}. Like a strong drug given only to very sick
patients, alliances thus may have a powerful effect even if they
sometimes fail to work as hoped. 10

Bearing these challenges in mind, [[the **most relevant**]{.mark}
findings that emerge **from this literature [are]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

- [The]{.underline} **[most recent [statistical
  analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the precise question at issue
  [[concludes]{.mark} that "[security guarantees]{.mark} **significantly
  [reduce proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [proclivity]{.underline}
  among their recipients." In addition, [[states]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
  such [guarantees are less likely to **export**]{.mark}
  sensitive]{.underline} **[nuclear [material and
  tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** to other nonnuclear states. 12 11

- **[Case study research]{.underline}** [underscores that the complexity
  of motivations for acquiring nuclear weapons cannot be reduced to
  security]{.underline}: domestic politics, economic interests, and
  prestige all matter. 13

- [[Multiple **independent**]{.mark}**ly conceived** and]{.underline}
  **[executed]{.underline}** [recent case [studies]{.mark} nonetheless
  [reveal]{.mark} that **[security alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}
  [help [explain]{.mark} numerous allied [decisions not to
  proliferate]{.mark} even when security is not always the main driver
  of leaders' interest]{.underline} in a nuclear program. As Nuno
  Monteiro and Alexandre Debs stress, "[States whose security goals are
  subsumed by their sponsors' own aims have **never acquired the
  bomb**]{.underline}. ... [This finding highlights the role of U.S.
  security commitments in **stymieing nuclear
  proliferation**]{.underline}: U[.S. [protégés]{.mark} will [only
  **seek the bomb** if they **doubt U.S.
  protection**]{.mark}]{.underline} of their core security goals." 15 14

- **[Multiple independently]{.underline}** conceived and executed recent
  **[case [research]{.mark}]{.underline}** [projects further unpack the
  conditions that decrease the likelihood of allied proliferation,
  [center]{.mark}ing [on]{.mark} the [**credibility** of the **alliance
  commitment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In addition, [in]{.underline}
  some [cases of prevention failure, the alliances allow the patron to
  influence the ally's nuclear program subsequently, decreasing further
  proliferation risks]{.underline}. 17

- [Security [alliances lower]{.mark} the likelihood of **[proliferation
  cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, [many predicted cascades
  did not occur.]{.underline} But [security **[provision]{.mark}**,
  mainly [by the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**[, is a **key**
  reason]{.mark} why]{.underline}. [[The **most comprehensive**]{.mark}
  **statistical [analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[finds]{.mark} that
  [states]{.mark} are more likely to [proliferate]{.mark} in response to
  neighbors [when]{.mark} **three conditions are met**]{.underline}: (1)
  [[there is an **intense**]{.mark} **security [rivalry]{.mark}**
  between the two countries]{.underline}; (2) [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
  prospective [proliferating [state **does not have a security
  guarantee**]{.mark} from a **nuclear**- armed **patron**]{.underline};
  [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (3) [the potential proliferator has the
  industrial and technical [capacity]{.mark} to launch an
  indigenous]{.underline} nuclear [program]{.underline}. 18 19 16

In sum, as Monteiro and Debs note, "Despite grave concerns that more
states would seek a nuclear deterrent to counter U.S. power
preponderance," in fact "[the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
[**decelerated** with the **end of the Cold War**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in 1989." [Their research, as well as that of **[scores of
scholars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[using]{.underline} **[multiple
methods]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and [representing]{.mark} many
**[contrasting]{.mark} theoretical
[perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [shows]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[US]{.mark} **security [guarantees]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the counter-
proliferation policy **[deep engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline} [allows
[are]{.mark} a **big part** of the **reason [why]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
20

The Costs of Nuclear Proliferation General empirical findings thus lend
support to the proposition that security alliances impede nuclear
proliferation. But is this a net contributor to global security? Most
practitioners and policy analysts would probably not even bring this up
as a question and would automatically answer yes if it were raised. Yet
a small but very prominent group of theorists within the academy reach a
different answer: [some of the same realist precepts that generate the
theoretical prediction that retrenchment would increase demand for
nuclear weapons also suggest that proliferation might **increase
security**]{.underline} such that the net effect of retrenchment could
be neutral. Most notably, "**[nuclear optimists]{.underline}**"
[like]{.underline} Kenneth **[Waltz]{.underline}** [contend that
**deterrence** essentially solves the security problem for all
**nuclear- armed states**]{.underline}, [largely eliminating the direct
use of force]{.underline} among them. It follows that [US retrenchment
might generate an initial decrease in security followed by an **increase
as insecure states acquire nuclear capabilities**]{.underline},
[ultimately leaving no net effect on international
security]{.underline}. 21

[This perspective is countered by]{.underline} "**[nuclear
[pessimists]{.mark}]{.underline}**" such as Scott Sagan. Reaching
outside realism to organization theory and other bodies of social
science research, [they [see major]{.mark} security [downsides]{.mark}
from **new nuclear states**. **Copious [research]{.mark}**]{.underline}
produced by Sagan and others [[casts doubt]{.mark} on the expectation
that [**governments** can be **relied upon**]{.mark} to create
**secure** and **controlled** **nuclear forces**. The more nuclear
states there are, the higher the probability that the organizational,
psychological, and civil- military pathologies Sagan identifies will
turn an episode like one of the numerous "**near misses" he
uncovers**]{.underline} into actual nuclear use. As Campbell Craig
warns, "[One day a **[warning system]{.mark} will
[fail]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or **[[an]{.mark} [official will
panic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [or a terrorist **[attack will be
misconstrued]{.mark}**, and **the [missiles will
fly]{.mark}**.]{.underline}" 22 23

Looking beyond these kinds of factors, it is notable that [powerful
reasons to question the assessment of proliferation optimists also
emerge even if one assumes, as they do, that states are rational and
seek only to maximize their security]{.underline}. First, [nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} can [only work by **raising the risk of
nuclear**]{.mark} **[war]{.mark}**. For deterrence to be
**credible**]{.underline}, [there has to be a]{.underline} [**nonzero
chance** of nuclear use]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} nuclear [use is
**impossible**, **deterrence cannot be credible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It follows that [every nuclear deterrence relationship depends on some
probability]{.underline} of 24 nuclear use. [[The more]{.mark} such
relationships there are]{.underline}, **[[the greater the risk]{.mark}
of nuclear war]{.underline}**. Proliferation therefore increases the
chances of nuclear war even in a perfectly rationalist world.
Proliferation optimists cannot logically deny that nuclear spread
increases the risk of nuclear war. Their argument must be that the
security gains of nuclear spread outweigh this enhanced risk.

Estimating that risk is not simply a matter of pondering the conditions
under which leaders will choose to unleash nuclear war. Rather, as
Schelling established, the question is whether states will run the risk
of using nuclear weapons. [Nuclear [crisis]{.mark} bargaining
[is]{.mark} about [a "**competition in risk
taking**]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Kroenig counts some twenty cases in
which states]{.underline}---including prominently the United
States---[ran real risks of nuclear war in order to prevail in
crises]{.underline}. As Kroenig notes[, "By asking whether states can be
deterred or not ... proliferation optimists are **asking the wrong
question**.]{.underline} [The right question to ask is: **what risk of
nuclear war**]{.underline} [is a specific state willing to run against a
**particular opponent** in a]{.underline} **[given
crisis]{.underline}**?" [[The more]{.mark} nuclear- [armed
states]{.mark} there are, the more the opportunities for such risk-
taking and [the **greater the probability**]{.mark} **of nuclear
use**]{.underline}. 27 26 25

//CHC-DS

That Africa is the first among the world's regions to feel the
devastating human effects of climate change is now widely acknowledged.
[Arguably more significant than the]{.underline} **[economic
boons]{.underline}** [Russia stands to realize]{.underline} from the
aforementioned deals [are the adverse environmental effects that
resource mining could have on the populations of these
countries]{.underline}.

Putin's promise to help bring stability to the Central African Republic
also invites a human approach to the analysis of Russia's Africa policy.
According to the UN, the protracted conflict has displaced more than
642,000 people. During the past year, [the actions of Putin's
associate]{.underline} Yevgeny Prigozhin and Prigozhin's **[private
military company]{.underline}**, [Wagner Group, in the CAR have faced
increasing scrutiny]{.underline}. Columbia University professor Kimberly
Marten, for example, has [highlighted the group's]{.underline}
**[mercenary interests]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[CAR's]{.underline}** [mineral-rich]{.underline}
**[mines]{.underline}**. [Discerning]{.underline} exactly [what Putin's
promise entails therefore has a particular]{.underline} **[humanitarian
urgency]{.underline}**.

Foreign policy and domestic policy are inextricably connected. For this
reason, it is important also to examine the impact of foreign policy on
domestic social attitudes. [Russia has a]{.underline} **[notoriously
poor record on racism]{.underline}**, [particularly when it comes
to]{.underline} **[African migrants]{.underline}**, as the Los Angeles
Times highlighted back in 2014. Since the country hosted the FIFA World
Cup in 2018, [these problems have been]{.underline}
**[exacerbated]{.underline}** [by the presence of many Africans who
outstayed their Fan Visas in hope of seeking asylum or finding
work]{.underline}. In March of this year, Interior Ministry official
Andrei Krayushkin confirmed that [5,500 of these individuals remained in
Russia]{.underline}.

[Mixed race]{.underline} **[African Russians]{.underline}** [also
continue to face]{.underline} **[discrimination and
abuse]{.underline}**, as this Calvert Journal report shows. In the case
of Russia's "pivot to the East," official foreign policy has fostered
positive attitudes among the Russian population toward China and its
people. [To what extent the Kremlin's pivot to Africa will have an
analogous effect remains to be seen, but attention should be paid to
whether Putin's overtures to African leaders have any tangible effect on
the lives of Russia's own African population.]{.underline}

[Africa is not]{.underline}, as Belgium's King Leopold contemptuously
called it, [a "magnificent cake" that exists purely to sate the
appetites of great powers---**Russia among them**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it is an umbrella term that includes a plethora of independent actors
with their own agendas distinct from those of Moscow]{.underline},
Beijing, or indeed Washington. As the South China Morning Post recently
reported, **[Russia is playing catch-up]{.underline}** to China and the
West [in terms of developing economic ties with the
continent]{.underline}. With African nations---and the continent as a
whole---in ascendance on the international stage, it is time to rethink
the way we analyze great powers' Africa policies. And Russia's policy is
a good place to start.

#### Russia will [interfere]{.underline} with African elections to support [unstable autocracies]{.underline}.

**Gathara 19**, Communications consultant, writer, and award-winning

//CHC-DS

However, as it seeks to reassert itself on the world stage, [Africa is
still seen as providing "low-cost, high-profile" opportunities to
burnish its prestige]{.underline}.

Still, the Africa of today is very different from that of the 1970s and
1980s and while maintaining some of the tactics that were successful in
yesteryears, such as the use of proxy forces in places like the Central
African Republic and the sale of light and heavy weapons to regimes with
dubious human rights records, [Russia has evolved others more in tune
with the times]{.underline}.

According to Proekt (The Project), an independent Moscow-based online
investigative news outlet, [Kremlin-linked teams have used social
media]{.underline} **["troll farms"]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[spin doctors]{.underline}** [to interfere in politics and elections
in 20 countries on the continent,]{.underline} particularly in
Francophone Africa, but with mixed success so far. In 2018 [they failed
in their attempt to]{.underline} **[engineer]{.underline}** [the
re-election of President Erie Radzaunarimampianina in Madagascar and
have been linked to **interference** in elections in
Zimbabwe.]{.underline}

According to the Financial Times "[across Africa, Moscow has deployed
teams of]{.underline} **[military instructors]{.underline}** [to train
elite presidential guards, sent arms shipments and]{.underline}
**[assisted shaky autocrats]{.underline}** [with election
strategies]{.underline}. It has also promised to build nuclear power
plants and develop oil wells and diamond mines."

The Guardian has also reported on leaked [documents show]{.underline}ing
[a]{.underline} **[wide-scale Russian effort]{.underline}** "[to bolster
its presence in at least 13 countries across Africa by]{.underline}
building relations with existing rulers, striking military deals, and
[grooming a new generation of 'leaders' and **undercover
'agents'**]{.underline}."

The goal of Russian efforts seems largely unchanged from the Soviet days
-- essentially to counter and limit the influence of others on the
continent. [The benefits for autocrats seeking to hang on to power on
the continent is]{.underline} similarly [easy to ascertain]{.underline}.
However, for their youthful subjects, many of whom have little
experience or recollection of the Soviet Union, the renewed Russian
interest is likely to be viewed with scepticism.

//CHC-DS

Russia's interest in Africa

It will be simplistic to frame the just-concluded Russia-Africa summit
as a copy-cat jamboree organized by Russia to latch on the bandwagon of
the increasingly fashionable trend of organizing and institutionalizing
Africa summits by countries like China, India, Japan, France, and the
United States. The truth is that, si[nce the 2000s, there has been a
noticeable **re-awakening** of Russia's interest in Africa]{.underline}.
Indeed, [between 2005 and 2015, Africa's trade with Russia grew by 185
percent,]{.underline} and [Russia has]{.underline} **[several
reasons]{.underline}** [to engage Africa more intensely]{.underline}.

Goal 1: [Projecting power on the global stage]{.underline}

In supporting African countries---who, notably, constitute the largest
voting bloc in the United Nations---[Russia is cultivating allies in its
challenge to the current United States and Euro-Atlantic-dominated
security order]{.underline}. This strategy is not going unnoticed:
Indeed, in 2018 former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton
accused Russia of [selling arms to African countries in exchange for
votes at the United Nations, among other nefarious
motivations]{.underline}.

Goal 2: [Accessing]{.underline} **[raw materials]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[natural resources]{.underline}**

**[Russia]{.underline}**---just like other major world powers---also
**[covets]{.underline}** [many of Africa's raw materials and is creating
joint projects and investments in order to access them]{.underline}.
From the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Central African
Republic, [Russian companies are]{.underline} **[scaling
up]{.underline}** their [activities in the mining of resources such as
coltan, cobalt, gold, and diamonds]{.underline}. In Zimbabwe, for
instance, a joint venture between Russia's JSC Afromet and Zimbabwe's
Pen East Ltd is [developing one of the **world's largest** deposits of
platinum group metal]{.underline}. In Angola, [Russian mining company
Alroser recently increased its stake in local producer Catoca to 41
percent]{.underline}, in a deal that provides the diamond giant with a
production base outside Russia. Despite joint ownership with Angola,
[Catoca operates **under Russian management**]{.underline}. Remarkably,
about one-third of Russia's African imports are agricultural, including
fruit, cocoa, coffee, and potatoes.

Goal 3: Arms exports and security

In recent years, Russia had become the largest supplier of arms to
Africa, accounting for 35 percent of arms exports to the region,
followed by China (17 percent), United States (9.6 percent), and France
(6.9 percent). Since 2015, Russia has signed over 20 bilateral military
cooperation agreements with African states. A Russian citizen, Valeriy
Zakharov, has even been appointed to be a national security advisor to
the president of the Central African Republic (CAR), Faustin-Archange
Touadéra.

[Russian arms are attractive to African leaders because]{.underline},
besides being relatively cheap, [deals with Russia are
**not**]{.underline} often **[held up by human rights
concerns]{.underline}** [cited by other countries like France and the
U.S.]{.underline} For instance, when the U.S. was dilly-dallying on
selling arms to Nigeria to fight Boko Haram in 2014 upon allegations of
human rights abuses by Nigerian soldiers, Nigeria turned to Russia and
was able to place an order for 12 attack helicopters.

Goal 4: [Supporting energy and power development in Africa through
Russian companies]{.underline}

[Lack of]{.underline} affordable, [reliable electricity in Africa makes
the region a prime and]{.underline} **[lucrative location]{.underline}**
[for Russia's energy and power industry]{.underline}. Several
state-owned Russian companies such as **[Gazprom]{.underline}**,
**[Lukoil]{.underline}**, **[Rostec and Rosatom]{.underline}** [are
active in Africa]{.underline}, with activities largely concentrated in
Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Nigeria, and Uganda. So far, Rosatom has signed
memorandums and agreements to develop nuclear energy with 18 African
countries, including Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda, Nigeria, and
Ethiopia. In 2018 alone, Rosatom agreed to build four 1200 MW VVER-type
nuclear reactors in Egypt---with construction and maintenance valued at
\$60 billion---with a Russian loan of up to \$25 billion at an annual
interest rate of 3 percent.

[Russia]{.underline} also [wants to use its mostly state-owned oil and
gas companies to create]{.underline} **[new streams of energy
supply]{.underline}**. In 2018, for instance, [Nigerian oil and gas
exploration company Oranto Petroleum announced that it would be
cooperating with Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, to develop **21
oil assets** across 17 African countries]{.underline}. [Several Russian
companies have also made significant investments in Algeria's oil and

an argument about impacts rather than the sources of America's
antiimperial and pro-Westphalian role.

Empires and State Systems: Historical Patterns

Empire has been the historically predominant form of order in world
politics. Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no
global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent
imperial and colonial ventures connected desperate regional systems,
doing so approximately five hundred years ago.7 Prior to this emergence
of a globalscope system, the pattern of world politics was characterized
by regional systems. These regional systems were initially very
anarchic, and marked by high levels of military competition. But almost
universally, they tended to consolidate into regional empires which had
fairly limited interactions with polities outside their regions.8 Thus,
it was empires -- not anarchic state systems -- that typically dominated
the regional systems in all parts of the world.

Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order
was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy.
Despite repeated efforts to consolidate Europe into one empire -- or
what the Europeans referred to as "universal monarchy" -- this region
remained a plural, multi-state political order. After the Peace of
Westphalia ending the Thirties Year War, this plural anarchic system,
the Westphalian system, and was sustained by a rough balance of power
among its autonomous states and the weakness of the claimants of
European empire. This Westphalian system was based on a roughly equal
distribution of power among its major units, sustained by various
balancing practices that thwarted a succession of regional European
empire-builders, and had an elaborate system of public international law
and ideological justification.9 While this system rested on a balance of
power, it was juridically crystallized into a system of mutually
recognized sovereigns.

Outside of Europe, however, the European states, including those that
were most active in preventing empire within Europe, were
extraordinarily successful in conquering and colonizing vast areas
across oceanic distances.10 The Europeans did not invent empire, but
they were spectacularly successful at empire building on a global scope,
largely because of the imbalance of power that stemmed from European
innovations in technology and organization.11 The Europeans conquered
and dominated empires, states, and peoples in every previously loosely
coupled or isolated regional system across the world. The Europeans also
successfully planted numerous colonies of settlers, mainly in the
temperate zones in North and South America, Oceania, and the southern
tip of Africa.12 States from the Western European core of the
Westphalian system thus brought into existence a global-scale political
system made up of vast multi-continental empires of conquered peoples
and a scattering of colonial "new Europes."13

This pattern of European empire building was different from its
predecessors, not just in its global scope, but also because the
European states were continuously warring against one another for
dominance within Europe. These struggles between states within Europe
against empire in Europe were fought on a global scale. Thus the first
"world war," defined as a war fought across multiple continents,
occurred in the later 18th century. In this struggle Britain sought to
thwart French attempts to dominate Europe and the battle lines were in
Europe, North America, South Asia, and across the global oceans. This
pattern of the globalization of intraEuropean warfare continued in the
20th century with the wars triggered by German efforts to dominate
Europe. The growing imbalance of power between the Europeans and the
rest of the world during the 18th and 19th century enabled the Europeans
to easily expand their empires at the expense of non-Europeans. But
during the same periods, the Europeans found it very difficult to
conquer each other within Europe. Thus vast armies wrought great
destruction fighting over tiny parcels of land in Europe, while
comparatively small European imperial expeditionary forces readily
mastered non-European armies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Thus a
balance of power underpinned the Westphalian system in Europe, while an
imbalance of power between Europe and the world underpinned imperial
expansion.

Anti-imperial and anti-colonial rebellions and resistance are as old as
empires, but successful rebellion against European imperial rule outside
Europe began in the 18th century with the revolt of the colonial settler
colonies in the Americas -- first in North America and then in South
America. This first wave of settler-colony rebellion marked the end of
what historians refer to as the "first British empire," as well as the
first great European empire in the Americas, that of Spain. The success
of this first wave of anti-imperial rebellion in Spanish America was
crucially facilitated by the weakening of Spain during the Napoleonic
wars for domination within Europe.

In the later-19th century, European empire building outside of Europe
entered a second wave, enabled by the new industrial technologies that
further amplified the imbalance of power between Europeans and
non-Europeans, which in turn allowed the Europeans to extend their
imperial domination into the large interior spaces of the continents,
particularly in Africa and Asia.14 In the 20th century, further wars
among the core European states weakened Britain, France, and Holland,
the leading European colonial powers, thus creating opportunities for
antiimperial independence movements in Asia and Africa. Paradoxically,
the fact that the Europeans were continuously fighting one another
fueled their imperial ambitions and successes, while at the same time,
such wars weakened them and helped enable the success of rebellions
against their empires.15 Thus as the British empire was reaching its
territorial zenith in the early years of the 20th century, Britain was
critically weakened by the world wars in Europe and Asia against the
aspiring German and Japanese empire builders.

The territorial aggression of the Axis Powers constitute a third wave of
empire building which was short lived and thwarted by the successful
mobilization of the "United Nations," a coalition led by the United
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. A fourth wave of
empire building, by the Soviet Union and the international communist
movement in the second half of the 20th century, was thwarted and
dismantled by the United States and its allies.

The Pattern of American Anti-Imperial, Anti-Colonial, and
Pro-Westphalian Impacts

[[Against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [backdrop of]{.underline} this
[evolution of the international system and]{.underline} the [four [waves
of **empire** building]{.mark} and dismantlement]{.underline}, it
becomes possible to [see **more [clearly]{.mark}** the many
ways]{.underline} in which [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[played]{.mark} **important [anti-imperial]{.mark}**[,
anti-colonial]{.mark}]{.underline}, and pro-Westphalian
[[roles]{.underline}]{.mark}. 16

In each of the four waves of empire building and dismantlement, the
United States had an impact. The [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} was the [first]{.underline} "**[new
nation]{.underline}**" [to emerge from]{.underline} a
[**[rebel]{.mark}**lion [against]{.mark} European [imperial
rule]{.mark}]{.underline} during the first wave of modern empire. The
[United States]{.underline} also [[supported]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[independence of]{.underline} other [European settler
colonies]{.underline} throughout the Americas [and]{.underline}, with
the [Monroe Doctrine]{.underline}, helped [**sustain their
[independence]{.mark}** [against European efforts to
**recolonize**]{.mark}]{.underline} parts of the [Americas]{.underline}.
In the second wave of late 19th century empire-building, the [United
States]{.underline}, despite its great relative power, [[did not
establish]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[empire]{.mark} of its
own]{.underline} of any significance or duration. [And]{.underline}
during the latter part of the 20th century, the United States
[[pushed]{.mark} **European [decolonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus
[facilitating]{.underline} the [breakup of second wave empires.
In]{.underline} the [great world wars]{.underline} in the 20th century,
the [United States played]{.underline} an [**important role** in
[thwarting]{.mark}]{.underline} a third [**wave of [imperial
projects]{.mark}** [of **Germany**, **Japan**, and
**Italy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the second half of the 20th century,
the United States played decisive roles, both ideological and military,
in thwarting the fourth wave of empire building, the expansion of the
communist great power, the Soviet Union, as well as communist coups and
revolutions in many weak and small independent states.

The United States [[also]{.mark} played]{.underline} a [variety of
important roles in **[building]{.mark} and strengthening**]{.underline}
Westphalian [[institutions, moderating]{.mark} **inter-state
[anarchy]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} facilitating]{.underline} the [[ability
of states to survive as **independent**]{.mark} **members** of
international society]{.underline}. From its inception, the [United
States]{.underline} was [precocious in]{.underline} its [support
for]{.underline} the [law of nations]{.underline}, the [institutions
of]{.underline} the [society of states]{.underline}, particularly the
[laws of]{.underline} war and neutrality, and public international law,
as a means of [[restraining war and aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
both the 19th and 20th centuries, the [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, first regionally and then [[globally,
inspired]{.underline}]{.mark} and helped [**legitimate
[anti-colonial]{.mark}** [and anti-imperial **independence
movements**]{.mark} and]{.underline} national [liberation
struggles]{.underline} among [peoples struggling [against
empires]{.mark} all over the world]{.underline}. In the 20th century,
the [United States]{.underline} led the efforts to
[institutionalize]{.underline} Westphalian [norms of non-aggression
and]{.underline} sovereign [independence]{.underline}, first with the
League of Nations and then with the United Nations Charter. In the
second half of the 20th century, the [American]{.underline}-led [liberal
international order institutionalized **free trade** and **[multilateral
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus providing the infrastructure
for a global economic system, thus [[enabl]{.mark}ing
**[smaller]{.mark}**]{.underline} and weaker [[**states** to sustain
their sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}. Also in the second half of the
20th century, the [American]{.underline} system of [military
[alliances]{.mark} contributed to]{.underline} the [dampening of violent
conflicts]{.underline} among allied states, particularly in Europe and
East Asia, thus [[protecting]{.mark} the]{.underline} Westphalian
[[system from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [return of [violent conflict and
empire-building]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### IR is great \-\-- leads to better decisions which help avoid war. 

**Reiter 15**---Professor of Political Science at Emory University
\[Dan, "Scholars Help Policymakers Know Their Tools," *War on the
Rocks*, 27 Aug,
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/>,
accessed 11 Jan 2017\]

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign [policy choices are
**not sui generis**]{.mark}, there are [patterns]{.mark} across space
and time that **[inform decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Policymakers recognize this and routinely draw lessons from history when
making foreign policy decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other
areas such as development and public health routinely rely on broader,
more general studies to craft policy. And, [[**broader scholarship** can
**improve** foreign policy performance]{.mark}, as [evidenced by the
ability of]{.mark} IR [academics to build on their]{.mark} own [work to
**predict outcomes**]{.mark}, including for example forecasting the
lengths of the conventional and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq
conflict in the 2000s]{.underline}.

But, even if one were to accept the limits of general work, there is a
growing body of academic work that evaluates foreign policy tools as
applied to a specific country or region. These studies ask questions
such as whether:

Development projects reduced insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone
strikes reduced insurgent violence in Pakistan; Development programs
increased civic participation and social capital in Sudan; Building cell
phone towers in Iraq reduced insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate
combatants into society in Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in
Liberia increased the legitimacy of the government there; Road projects
in India reduced insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's
failure in Congo; Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent
attacks from militants.

This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective.

A third critique is that much of this academic work on foreign policy
tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too quantitative and
technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik Voeten, [[there
is a **danger** in **not appreciating** the importance of rigorous
research design]{.mark}, including sophisticated [quantitative
techniques, for **crafting effective policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Sophisticated [research]{.mark} design is not the enemy of effective
policy, it [is **critically necessary**]{.mark} for it]{.underline}.
Certainly, [the current academic focus on building research designs that
permit causal inference speaks exactly to what policymakers care about
the most: if implementing a certain policy will cause the desired
outcome]{.underline}.

Or, put differently, [**[bad research]{.mark}** designs [make for **bad
public policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A classic example is school
busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some cities adopted
voluntary integration programs for public schools]{.underline}, in which
families could volunteer to bus their children to schools in
neighborhoods with different racial majorities. [Policymakers used the
favorable results for the voluntary programs to make the improper
inference that mandatory busing policies would also work]{.underline}.
[The result was bad public policy and violence]{.underline} in the
streets.

[Sophisticated [technical methods]{.mark} can [improve our ability to
make **causal inferences**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} can help
[[solve]{.underline}]{.mark} other **[[empirical
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consider that the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. [Assessing whether certain policies do win
public support requires collecting opinion data]{.underline}. A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques
have been used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

[Going forward, we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in
which mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective
than male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion
in combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians?

[Certainly, **[other areas]{.mark}** of public policy [understand the
importance]{.mark} of rigorous research design]{.underline}. [Economic
and development policy communities read the work of and employ economics
Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [[Policymakers incorporate the findings of]{.mark}
sophisticated [studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**,
**gender empowerment**, and **foreign aid**]{.mark}, knowing the best
policy decisions must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}.

Or consider public health policy. [**[Lives are literally on the
line]{.mark}** as [decision-makers must make decisions about]{.mark}
issues such as [**vaccinations**, **nutritional recommendations**, and
**air quality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Policymakers know they must use
sophisticated technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other
public health academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}.

Critics will argue that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from
contemporary academic IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics
let go of an obsession with technique, they will then be better able to
connect with policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree
that IR academics need to find ways to communicate their results in
clear, non-technical language. But [[the **technical
components**]{.mark} of the work **[need to be
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Stripping them out **directly
undermines** the ability of the research to give the **right**]{.mark}
kinds of policy **[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Let me conclude by noting that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR
academics should think about the big picture as well as smaller
questions, the forest of grand strategy as well as the trees of foreign
policy tools. [IR [academics have the potential to **make real
contributions** to]{.mark} big picture
**[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of
grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates
foreign policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}.

Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers need to know their
tools]{.underline}. [Rigorous IR research is the only way to evaluate
them effectively]{.underline}.

If this is the best we can do, then what's the point? Well, consider the
alternatives. For starters, [[we might decide to
skip]{.underline}]{.mark} statistical [[forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark}
altogether and just target our interventions at cases identified by
expert judgment as likely onsets. Unfortunately,
[[those]{.underline}]{.mark} expert [[judgments are]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[going to be]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[even less
reliable]{.underline}]{.mark}** guide [[than our]{.underline}]{.mark}
statistical [[forecasts, so this "solution" only **exacerbates our
problem**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Alternatively, we could take no
preventive action and just respond to events as they occur. If the net
costs of responding to crises as they happen are roughly equivalent to
the net costs of prevention, then this is a reasonable choice. Maybe
responding to crises isn't really all that costly; maybe preventive
action isn't effective; or maybe preventive action is potentially
effective but also extremely expensive. Under these circumstances, early
warning is not going to be as useful as we forecasters would like. If,
however, any of those last statements are false--if responding to crises
already underway is very costly, or if preventive action is (relatively)
cheap and sometimes effective--then [[we have an incentive to use
forecasts to]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[guide]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[action, in spite of]{.underline}]{.mark} the lingering [[uncertainty
about exactly]{.underline}]{.mark} where and [[when]{.underline}]{.mark}
those [[crises will occur]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even in situations where
preventive action isn't feasible or desirable, [[reasonably accurate
forecasts can still be useful if they spur]{.underline}]{.mark}
interested [[observers to **plan for
contingencies**]{.underline}]{.mark} they otherwise might not have
considered. For example, policy-makers in one country might be rooting
for a dictatorship in another country to fall but still fail to plan for
that event because they don't expect it to happen any time soon. [[A
forecasting model]{.underline}]{.mark} which identifies that
dictatorship as being at high or increasing risk of collapse [[might
encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[policy-makers to
reconsider]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[expectations
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in so doing, [[lead them to **prepare better**
for that event]{.mark}.]{.underline} Where does that leave us? For me,
the bottom line is this: [[even though forecasts]{.underline}]{.mark} of
political instability [[are never going to be]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[[precise]{.underline}]{.mark} as we'd like, [[they can still be
accurate enough to be helpful]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as long as the
events they predict are ones for which prevention]{.underline}]{.mark}
or preparation [[stand a decent chance of making a]{.underline}]{.mark}
(positive) [[difference]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Hobbesian view of the state of nature' (Henderson, 2013, 80). Echoing
Charles Mills, Henderson argues that this conception was not applicable
to 'the general state of mankind' but rather intended to describe the
state of affairs of 'non-whites' to rationalise imperialistic violence
against them and the appropriation of their land. Thus, 'a non-white
people, indeed the very non-white people upon whose land his fellow
Europeans were then encroaching, is his only real-life example of people
in a \[Hobbesian\] state of nature' (Mills, 1997, 65; cited in
Henderson, 2013, 80). [It follows]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, [the
concerns among]{.underline} [realists]{.underline} [and idealists with
anarchy]{.underline} [are grounded in a racist discourse]{.underline}
[that is concerned with the obligations of superior peoples]{.underline}
to impose order on the anarchic domains of inferior peoples in order to
prevent the chaos presumed to be endemic in the latter from spilling
over into the former's territories or self-proclaimed spheres of
interest. Similarly, the realist and idealist concern with power was
grounded in a racist discourse concerned largely with the power of
whites to control the tropics, subjugate its people, steal its resources
and superimpose themselves through colonial administration. (Henderson,
2013, 85)

**[There are two problems]{.underline}** [with **Henderson's**
**generalisation** about **realism**]{.underline}. First, [the
'**Hobbesian'** state of nature]{.underline} Henderson associates [with
**realism** has been **rejected** **by classical
realists**]{.underline}. For example, in response to Martin Wight's
Hobbesian interpretation of his work, Morgenthau replied in a letter to
International Affairs: To say that a truth is "hidden" in an "extreme"
dictum can hardly be called an endorsement of the dictum. [To call a
position "extreme]{.underline}" [is not to identify]{.underline}
[oneself]{.underline} [with the position]{.underline} [but to
disassociate oneself]{.underline} [from it]{.underline} ... I was trying
to establish the point, in contrast to Hobbes's, that [moral principles
are universal]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, hence, [are not created by
the state]{.underline}. (Morgenthau, 1959; on Carr's rejection of
Hobbesianism see, for instance, Linklater, 2000; Molloy, 2021)

Secondly, [the concept of anarchy]{.underline} [was]{.underline}
[indeed]{.underline} [central]{.underline} [to neo-realists]{.underline}
[such as Waltz]{.underline} (whom Henderson cites most extensively),
[but not to classical realists]{.underline}. [In response]{.underline}
[to those]{.underline} [who take]{.underline} [it]{.underline} [as 'a
matter of course that anarchy]{.underline} \[is\] [a basic assumption of
Morgenthau's]{.underline} "[realist' theory]{.underline}" for instance,
Hartmut Behr and Amelia [Heath]{.underline} [argue]{.underline} [that
'although this]{.underline} [may be true for]{.underline}
[Waltz]{.underline}, [it is not the case for Morgenthau']{.underline}
(Behr & Heath, 2009, 332). Since '**[the term anarchy is]{.underline}**
**[mentioned]{.underline}** [in Politics Among Nations]{.underline}
**[only three times]{.underline}**; and when Morgenthau refers to it, it
is in a critical dissociation from Hobbes' (Behr & Heath, 2009, 332).
Importantly, Behr and Heath note that Politics Among Nations originated
as a reflexive attempt to critique the ideological rationalisation of
power. It was only later that 'a plethora of neo-realists became cooks
in the "kitchen of power"' (Behr & Heath, 2009, 345). In this sense,
[Morgenthau's]{.underline} **[(classical) realism]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} Waltz's (**[neo)realism]{.underline}** [are
diametrically opposed]{.underline} in [their aims and methodologies: the
former rejects]{.underline} the '[value free' social
science]{.underline} of [the latter]{.underline} [and **pursues**
instead]{.underline} **[a normative critique of power]{.underline}**
(Karkour & Giese, 2020; Roesch, 2014; Williams, 2013).
[Morgenthau's]{.underline} [critique of power]{.underline} [runs
counter]{.underline} [to any social science]{.underline} that proceeds
[on the basis of its]{.underline} [rationalisation, let alone the
rationalisation of empire]{.underline}. Akin to Morgenthau, in The
Structure of Nations and Empires, Niebuhr presents a critique of power
as an instrument of imperialism. [The 'pretentions' of
power]{.underline}, according to Niebuhr, '[are the source of
evil]{.underline}, [whether they are expressed by kings and emperors or
by commissars and revolutionary]{.underline} statesmen' (Niebuhr, 1959,
298).

**[It is]{.underline}** thus simply **[not true]{.underline}**, pace
Henderson and other post-colonial IR theorists (as cited below), [that
classical realists]{.underline} such as Morgenthau and Niebuhr **[either
justified or omitted]{.underline}** **[imperialism]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [analyses]{.underline} of
international politics. **[Morgenthau]{.underline}**, as well as Niebuhr
(but unlike Carr), [**rejected** the Marxist explanation of]{.underline}
**[imperialism]{.underline}** [as **rooted in laissez faire
capitalism**]{.underline} [and the social question in Western
democracies. **Instead, they presented a long** **durée explanation of
imperial domination**]{.underline}: imperial domination, according to
Morgenthau and Niebuhr, [was a political problem]{.underline} [that
pre-dated the capitalist]{.underline} [structure of the global
economy]{.underline}. 'The economic interpretation of imperialism' that
Marxism proposes, according to Morgenthau, 'erects a limited historic
experience, based on a few isolated cases, into a universal law of
history' (Morgenthau, 1978, 53). The notion that 'capitalist societies'
wage wars in search of 'markets for their products and sufficient
investments for their capital' did not stand to empirical scrutiny
according to Morgenthau (1978, 52). For 'during the entire period of
mature capitalism' [Morgenthau observed]{.underline}, '[no war, with the
exception of the Boer]{.underline} [War, was waged by major]{.underline}
[powers]{.underline} [exclusively or even predominantly for economic
objectives']{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1978, 53). Furthermore, 'the main
period of colonial expansion which the economic theories tend to
identify with imperialism precedes the age of mature capitalism' and
'Louis XIV, Peter the Great, the Napoleon I were the great imperialists
of the modern pre-capitalist age' (Morgenthau, 1978, 54). 'What the
precapitalist imperialist, the capitalist imperialist, and the
"imperialistic" capitalist want' thus Morgenthau concluded, 'is power,
not economic gain' (Morgenthau, 1978, 55). To counter imperialism,
therefore, the scholar ought to address the problem of power---namely to
limit power, through an ethic of humility. Morgenthau incorporated such
an 'ethic of humility' into his, largely misunderstood among
post-colonial scholars, conception of the national interest. This 'ethic
of humility' calls for the acknowledgement of the deceptive nature of
power and acceptance of the 'lesser evil'. It is based on the premises,
which Morgenthau summarises in Scientific Man Versus Power Politics as
follows, Neither science nor ethics nor politics can resolve the
conflict between politics and ethics into harmony. [We have no choice
between power]{.underline} [and the common good. To act]{.underline}
[successfully, that is]{.underline}, **[according to the rules of the
political art, is political wisdom]{.underline}**. [**To know** with
despair that **the political act is inevitably evil**]{.underline}, and
to act nevertheless, [**is** **moral courage**]{.underline}. [To choose
among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment. In
the combination of political wisdom, moral courage, and moral judgment,
**man** **reconciles his political nature with his moral
destiny.**]{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1946, 173)

#### Realism is the most [ethical]{.underline} paradigm for international relations --- it accepts the [inherent insecurity]{.underline} of the nuclear age as a [precondition]{.underline} for genuine hospitality. Rejecting national sovereignty and borders lapses into liberal interventionism and [global nuclear civil war]{.underline}.

Conditioned by the trace, [survival is]{.underline} thus
[**inseparable** from]{.underline} finitude and [the **constant threat
of [erasure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Derrida, 1976: 167). According to
Derrida (1984b: 65, emphasis added): 'it belongs to the trace to erase
itself, to elude that which might maintain it in presence'. In this way,
the trace also points to the elusiveness of life, and to the fact that
nothing can ever guarantee the infinite existence of anything. It tells
us that [life is nothing but a '**play of traces**', which **lacks an
absolute origin** and is **inherently mortal**]{.underline} (Derrida,
1984a: 15). [This]{.underline} play of traces brings us back to
Hägglund's notion of the 'time of life', which [[highlights the]{.mark}
**central [importance of]{.mark} temporal [finitude]{.mark}** [for
grasping]{.mark} the **general conditions of
[life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As he puts it: 'This radical finitude of
survival is not a lack of being that is desirable to overcome. Rather,
[the finitude of survival opens the chance for **everything that is
desired** and the threat of **everything that is feared**]{.underline}'
(Hägglund, 2008: 1--2). There is, then, an important 'double bind' to
the tracing of time. On the one hand, it is because nothing is infinite,
immortal or present in itself that new life can emerge. On the other
hand, the lack of self-presence means that life can never be immune to
alteration, contamination and death. [In order for anything to live, it
must consequently be **mortal** and **open to unpredictable
change**]{.underline} (Derrida, 1976: 143). Even if an infinite and
immortal life, free from dangers, might seem desirable, it would be a
self-refuting desire since it implies desiring the end of the
possibility to desire anything at all. More precisely, it would be the
same as desiring the end of the continuous flow of time that allows new
life to emerge while exposing everything that lives to the threat of
coming to an end. Immortality cancels out the time of mortal life and
renders survival obsolete. Counterintuitively, Hägglund (2008: 32--33)
thus notes, mortality can be seen as the 'best' or most desirable, while
immortality is the 'worst' or least desirable. [While [this]{.mark} may
seem like a **rejection** of life, it is, in fact, an **affirmation** of
life. It positively **[affirms the chance to live]{.mark}** precisely
[on the condition that inherent]{.mark} in any movement of survival [is
the **risk of**]{.mark} **life coming to [an end]{.mark}**[. Refusing
this]{.mark} risk [would be]{.mark} the same as **[refusing to
live]{.mark}**, since to live is to negotiate the relationship between
life and death.]{.underline} Temporal finitude is significant, moreover,
not only for grasping the general conditions of life, but for explaining
why [any act of survival **must encounter the uncertainty of the
future**]{.underline}. Returning to Waltz for a moment, [it is precisely
**[this]{.mark} uncertainty** that [makes it **impossible to know** if
today's friend will **stay a friend** or]{.mark} suddenly **[turn into
an enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline}: 'In the absence of an external
authority, a state cannot be sure that today's friend will not be
tomorrow's enemy', writes Waltz (2000: 10). [[If we]{.mark} were able to
**[acquire full knowledge]{.mark}** of if and when a friend becomes an
enemy]{.underline}, we would bring the future under our control.
However, then the future would no longer be a genuinely open future, in
which the chance of survival is inseparable from finitude and mortality.
[[Survival would]{.mark} then **[lose its value]{.mark}** and become
**redundant** as [life turns into]{.mark} **nothing but [a calculable
formula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So, what are the implications of
Derrida's notion of survival and his critique of the 'calculable' for
our understanding of 'ethics'? First of all, it means that [[ethics
**cannot be**]{.mark} **translated into [static]{.mark} ethical
ideals**]{.underline}. As Derrida has elaborated on in relation to a
wide array of issues, including justice, responsibility, hospitality,
friendship and the gift, [ethics]{.underline} rather [**depends on
maintaining openness** to the **perpetual coming of the
future**]{.underline}. This openness means that [none of these issues
**can ever be linked to something pure**, **uncontaminated** and
**incorruptible** that is immune to unexpected alterations.]{.underline}
To take one specific example, hospitality is, for Derrida, crucial for
thinking about ethics (see Derrida, 2000). This is because an [act of
hospitality suggests that the self **does not simply exist in pure
isolation** of what lies 'outside' the self, but **must always negotiate
its relation** with]{.underline} the non-self, that is, [the
other]{.underline}. Ethics is, for this reason, inseparable from
hospitality since both terms highlight the necessity of relating to and
opening up space for others. At the same time, [[hospitality cannot
be]{.mark} '**absolute**' or '[**pure**' in]{.mark} the sense of
**[conforming to a static]{.mark} metaphysical
[ideal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For Derrida, [not only would
[such]{.mark} an ideal [be **impossible to
achieve**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Kantian sense11, [it would be
**essentially [undesirable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because [the
**very aspiration** towards a pure metaphysical ideal would have as its
aim the **closure of the uncertainty** that makes the self--other
encounter **possible in the first place**. The welcoming of strangers
must therefore always involve a **chance** as well as a **threat**: the
chance of some sort of **positive** and **friendly transformation**, and
the threat that the other **turns into an enemy doing harm to the
host**]{.underline} (Derrida, 2000: 15; Hägglund, 2008: 103--105). The
only way to eliminate the potential threat inherent in any act of
hospitality would be to make the self completely immune to the other.
Such immunity, however, would close down the self--other encounter
before it could happen at all. Derrida (2003: 129) thus rhetorically
asks: The visit might actually be very dangerous, and we must not ignore
this fact, but would a hospitality without risk, a hospitality backed by
certain assurances, a hospitality protected by an immune system against
the wholly other, be true hospitality? Derrida's point here is that
[hospitality **categorically cannot correspond to something pure**, like
a **universal ideal situation beyond violence**]{.underline}. This is
because [without the **threat of violence**, the very act of welcoming
the other **would not be possible in the first place**]{.underline}. In
order for this act to be 'possible', it must simultaneously be
'impossible', in the pure metaphysical sense (see also Bulley, 2017: 12;
Vaughan-Williams, 2007: 121). [While ethics is often linked to a
**seemingly self-evident desire** to reach an **absolute metaphysical
ideal**, [Derrida]{.mark}'s philosophy **contests the desirability of
such ideals altogether** and [offers]{.mark} a **stark
[warning]{.mark}** [against **any attempt to immunize** the '**good**'
from the '**bad**']{.mark}, '**peace**' from '**violence**',
'**friends**' from '**enemies**', and so on]{.underline}. This is why,
in Derrida's view, [there has to be a **violent** or **non-ethical
opening of ethics**]{.underline} (Derrida, 1976: 140; 1978: 128). [To
desire the closure of this opening would be the same as desiring the
elimination of that which **makes any ethics possible at all**: its
exposure to the uncertainty of the future, and the indestructible threat
that inheres in all encounters with others]{.underline}. Rather than
linking ethics to a desire for the purely good,
[[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Derridean sense
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[**tied to an affirmation**
of]{.mark} the **[uncertainty]{.mark} of the future**, which opens up to
the '**good**' as well as the '**bad**'.]{.underline} The ethics of
neorealism [[Derrida's]{.mark} notion of]{.underline} the violent
opening of [[ethics fits]{.mark} **remarkably well**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the two core assumptions of Waltz's theory of
international politics: [[the **anarchic**]{.mark} **structure** of the
international political [system and]{.mark} **states' [desire to
survive]{.mark}** within this system]{.underline}. On this basis, it can
be argued that [there is]{.underline}, indeed, [an **ethics of
neorealism**]{.underline}. It is found in the 'Waltzian baseline' rather
than in attempts to use that baseline to establish law-like patterns of
behaviour.12 To grasp the ethics of neorealism, [it is]{.underline}
therefore [necessary to **shift focus**]{.underline} from causal laws
and testable hypotheses, [to the **structural conditions that shape**
and **affect the behaviour of states** in a **non-deterministic
manner**]{.underline}.13 Hence, [the 'structure']{.underline} in Waltz's
theory has [to be grasped as an **open structure** that leaves **ample
room for chance** and **contingency**]{.underline}. Crucially, [if we
could know for certain **what states will do** on the basis of either
the **structure of the system** or some **predetermined motives** of the
subjects within the system]{.underline}, the uncertainty of
international life would disappear and [the '**politics**' of
international politics would **lose its meaning**]{.underline}.14 Rather
than trying to rectify the lack of certainty by creating a stronger
sense of certainty, [it is]{.underline} therefore [**imperative to
affirm the uncertainties** created by the system. It is
important]{.underline}, moreover, [to **oppose the distinction between
ethical desirability** and **political possibility**, since the
reproduction of this distinction **blocks from view** the conditions of
international life that **make ethical thinking** and **action possible
in the first place**.]{.underline} Positivist social science and liberal
interpretations of Kant are thus, very crudely put, the main obstacles
to grasping the ethics of international life. In resisting both moves,
[neo[realism **does not**]{.mark} **seek to [close down]{.mark} the
violent opening of [ethics]{.mark} inherent in the structure of
anarchy**]{.underline}, for example, [[by **formulating**]{.mark}
**metaphysical [ideals]{.mark}** [informing states how they **should
act** or how they **ought to be**]{.mark}**come [friends rather than
enemies]{.mark}**. There **can be no absolute friendship** between
states, and [no state **can** ]{.mark}**ever [offer absolute
hospitality]{.mark}** to another state. At the heart of every
inter-state relation, there is **mistrust**, **uncertainty** and
**incalculability**. To positively affirm the latter is **not to say
that uncertainty** or **incalculability is good per se**. Rather, it
implies that they are seen as **basic** and **irrefutable conditions**
of international life, which, consequently, are **not even desirable to
overcome**]{.underline}. Hence, it also implies that as long as there is
international life, there must be 'the ominous shadow of the future
\[that\] continues to cast its pall over interacting states' (Waltz,
2000: 39). Crucially, Waltz's reference to [this]{.underline} shadow
[**should not be read** as an expression of **determinism**. It
expresses rather an **affirmation of uncertainty**: the 'uncertainty of
each about the other's future intentions and actions']{.underline}
(Waltz, 1979: 105). [In order to give friendship in international
politics a chance]{.underline}, so to speak, [the possibility that a
friend suddenly becomes an enemy **must never be eliminated**. Attempts
to **create absolute trust** in inter-state relations are therefore not
only **impossible to achieve in the practical sense**, but **essentially
undesirable**]{.underline}.15 Along similar lines, Derrida explains how
[friendship is possible **only if one remains open to the deception of
the other**, since it is precisely the **unconditional openness to
whatever may happen** in the encounter between self and other that makes
it possible to develop **any sort of friendship in the first
place**]{.underline} (Derrida, 2005: 219). Even if we were to accept
Alexander Wendt's (1999) distinction between different 'cultures of
anarchy', some of which are more 'friendly' than others, [[it is **not
self-evident** that]{.mark} a culture in which [friendship]{.mark} is
prioritized [over enmity is]{.mark} **actually a [better]{.mark}
one**]{.underline}. This is because in order to exclude the possibility
that a friend may suddenly become an enemy, one must first eliminate the
time of international life that makes the self--other encounter possible
in the first place. For the same reason, the key message of democratic
peace theory --- that all states should become democracies in order to
minimize or eliminate the possibility of wars --- is not only
practically impossible, but also ethically undesirable. It is impossible
to verify because there is no democracy that is immune to corruptibility
(Waltz, 2000: 10), but, in addition to that, it can be seen as
undesirable since [the notion that all states must conform to the same
universal ideal **cancels out their freedom to act**, to **take moral
responsibility** and so on]{.underline}. The undesirability of [[a
system that **eradicates**]{.mark} **violence**, **[borders]{.mark}**
and **discrimination**]{.underline} is further underlined by Waltz
(1979: 111--114) in his discussion of the 'virtues of anarchy'. Therein,
he attacks the idea of transforming the international system into a
world government. Not only [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} such a
transformation ['[be]{.mark} an invitation to prepare for
**[world]{.mark} civil [war]{.mark}**[']{.mark}]{.underline} (Waltz,
1979: 112), [but it would take away the **constitutive violence at the
heart of inter-state relations** in the structure of
anarchy.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} **constant [possibility of
war]{.mark}** in the international system [means]{.mark} that [states
will **always be wary of provoking others**]{.mark} in the search for
security]{.underline}. As he puts it: [The constant possibility
[that]{.mark} force will be used **limits manipulations**, [**moderates
demands**, and **serves as an incentive** for the **settlement of
disputes**]{.mark}. One who knows that pressing too hard may lead to war
has **strong reason to consider** whether possible gains are **worth the
risks entailed**]{.underline}.... The possibility that conflicts among
nations may lead to long and costly wars has ... sobering effects.
(Waltz, 1979: 113--114) In this way, [the conditions of peace in the
international system can be said to rest on the **constant possibility
of war**]{.underline}. In making this point, Waltz argues against moral
universalism. Hence, unwittingly or otherwise, he also opens up space
for ethical negotiation by recognizing the finitude of [the political
subject]{.underline}, who [is free to interact with others only on the
condition that self and other **do not have to conform** to the 'same'
universal ideal.]{.underline} [The subject is thus able to **take moral
responsibility** and ponder on **how to make ethical decisions**, which,
without **difference** and **alterity**, would turn into a **strictly
formal procedure** based on the '**mechanical application of
rules**']{.underline} (Zehfuss, 2009: 146). [Responsibility and ethical
decisions are]{.underline}, thus, [made possible **precisely by the
impossibility of predetermining** what is the '**right**' decision in
any given context]{.underline}. As Derrida argues, [irrespective of
**how thorough the decision-making procedure is**, and regardless of
**how much knowledge is acquired** before taking a
decision]{.underline}: the instant of the decision, if there is to be a
decision, must be heterogeneous to this accumulation of knowledge.
Otherwise, there is no responsibility. In this sense only must the
person taking the decision not know everything. Even if one knows
everything, [the decision]{.underline}, if there is one, [must advance
toward a **future that is not known**, that **cannot be
anticipated**]{.underline}. (Derrida, 2002b: 231) [The impossibility of
anchoring the decision in rational calculation is]{.underline}, in this
sense, [what **creates the chance for any decisions to be taken at
all**]{.underline}. The instant of the decision belongs, then, not to a
fully present moment in which the subject calculates the future
consequences of the decision, but to a future that is incalculable (see
Derrida, 2002a). [[It is]{.mark} precisely [this]{.mark}
**[incalculability]{.mark}**, and the **uncertainty of the future**,
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} Waltz's conception of [**[anarchy]{.mark}
positively [affirms]{.mark}**. Rather than making the instant of the
decision **obsolete** by transforming the decision into a **mere
application of rules**, anarchy makes the ethical decision
'**possible**'.]{.underline} Even if Waltz repeatedly claims that the
desire to survive is a purely pragmatic assumption made strictly for the
purpose of constructing an explanatory theory, it is not neutral or
innocent. First and foremost, Waltzian [neorealism expresses an ethics
due to the way it **affirms states' desire to survive** by stipulating
the **necessary conditions of their survival**]{.underline}. More
precisely, [[it]{.mark} affirms the uncertainty of international life by
**refusing to reduce the play of relations** between states to a
**calculable formula** or a **regulative ideal**, and that rather
**[embraces chance]{.mark}** and **contingency** as **central features**
of the anarchic system --- features that make states **simultaneously
free** and **insecure**]{.underline}.16 In this light, [the primary
significance]{.underline} of Waltz's theory [is **[not as]{.mark} an
[explanatory]{.mark} theory**, [but]{.mark} as a theory [that]{.mark}
affirms]{.underline} the time of international life, defined by [the
**uncertainty of the future**]{.underline} and the logic of the erasable
mortal trace.17 [It is this notion of the future that **[makes it
possible for states]{.mark}**, as finite political subjects, not only to
**survive**, but also [to]{.mark} try to **take moral responsibility**
and **[make ethical decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Why universal
ethical ideals are both impossible and undesirable What are the
implications of my reading of Waltzian [neorealism]{.underline} as an
ethics? First of all, it [contributes to a new understanding of the
difficulties inherent in **any attempt to theorize** what it might mean
to **replace the structure of anarchy** with an international or world
political order that is **supposedly 'more' ethical**]{.underline}. If
ethics is inextricably interlinked with the structural conditions of
survival, then [[any attempt to challenge]{.mark} neo[realism]{.mark}
from **an 'ethical' perspective** [must]{.mark} do so [by **replacing
one**]{.mark} **structure of [survival with another]{.mark}**, and there
can be **[no guarantees]{.mark}** that [the new structure will be **less
violent**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While this does not in any way
prevent such attempts from being made, it does highlight the risky
nature of trying to resolve problems of war and violence in
international politics on ethical terms. For example, [the idea of
creating [a new]{.mark} form of political [community that
**transcends**]{.mark} **the exclusionary borders of states** may seem
**naturally desirable**]{.underline} (e.g. Linklater, 1982). [Yet,
regardless of **how sophisticated theories become** in terms of
**articulating the content** and **meaning** of such a community, there
can be **no guarantees** that [attempts]{.mark} to actualize it
**[will]{.mark} not [result in]{.mark} even [more violence]{.mark}**.
There are no guarantees]{.underline}, as John Mearsheimer (1994: 44)
puts it, [that 'a **[fascist discourse far more violent]{.mark} than
realism** [will]{.mark} not [emerge]{.mark} as the **new hegemonic
discourse**'.]{.underline} Moreover, it is important to point out that
the value of a neorealist ethics is not that it provides a 'coherent
ethical theory'. One interesting attempt to create such a theory is
found in Frost's (2009) Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom and
International Relations. For Frost, the point of developing a coherent
ethical theory is to demonstrate how international relations can be
grasped primarily in ethical terms, rather than as a struggle for power
and survival. His assumption is that 'to engage in international
relations at all ... is to make ethical claims for oneself and to
recognize the ethical standing of others' (Frost, 2009: 19). Frost links
his theory partly to the diverse practices that shape international
interactions, and partly to an 'ethical background theory which
justifies the whole set of rules which constitute the practice' (Frost,
2009: 27). While the background theory is based on an English
School-inspired notion of the anarchic system/society of states, the
practices added to it have the potential to shape international
relations in a direction that is ethically desirable. Arguing for and
against the ethical standing of our interlocutors, 'we construct and
reconstruct the social practices within which international relations
are conducted' (Frost, 2009: 94). The main goal of these practices,
according to Frost, should be nothing less than resolving the tensions
within the current international system between citizen rights and
global human rights (Frost, 2009: ch. 3). In contrast to cosmopolitan
theories, however, he argues that this goal is attainable within the
anarchic structure of the system, through the ethical adjustment of that
system (Frost, 2009: 113). This adjustment involves renegotiating the
relationship between citizen rights and human rights through practice.
Frost (2009: 173) writes: 'Participants in global civil society and the
society of states need to take their own values seriously and need to
attempt to make them real for everybody everywhere'. [According to
Frost,]{.underline} [the **segregating borders of states** are thus
meant to **persist**, while the **violent forms of
exclusion**]{.underline} that these borders enable [are to **gradually
fall away** through the aspiration of [a **common** ]{.mark}**goal [that
embraces everybody everywhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From the
perspective of my reading of a neorealist ethics, however, [the notion
of a **common universal** goal underpinning Frost's ethical theory
[is]{.mark} not only **impossible**, but also **[undesirable]{.mark}**.
This is [not because the **ideal**]{.mark} **itself** [is
'**bad**']{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, it is because [[it is]{.mark}
**precisely [the absence of a]{.mark} common [goal beyond segregating
borders that makes ethic]{.mark}al negotiation [possible]{.mark}** in
the first place.]{.underline} [As soon as such an ideal has been
**formulated**, and the **guidelines for how to attain it** have been
**articulated**, the **incalculable future** in which the encounter
between self and other is allowed to play out is **cancelled
out**]{.underline}. As previously noted, [while this encounter might
result in **more** or **less violence**, it is the uncertainty of the
future that **makes the encounter possible** in the first
place.]{.underline} Frost's [attempt to formulate a **universal ethical
ideal** that **embraces everyone everywhere** while, at the same time,
**retaining the**]{.underline} segregating borders of the
[**international system** is thus **problematic**]{.underline}. The
primary reason for this, then, is that in articulating a universal
ethical ideal, his theory works to undermine the conditions of
international life. In brief, what Frost fails to recognize is that
[what makes international ethics possible is also what makes impossible
the **aspiration of a universal ethical ideal** that is **applicable to
everybody everywhere**]{.underline} --- like that of a perfect alignment
of citizen rights and human rights. [Rather than seeking to **resolve
these tensions**, the tensions should be **kept alive**. Only in this
way can we, moreover, maintain a **distinctly international ethics**
without reverting to a '**global ethics**']{.underline}. For [the
latter]{.underline} to make any sense, it [has to be based on ideals
that **transcend**]{.underline} the **[borders]{.underline}** of states,
whether those ideals are linked to a specific goal or just to a general
attitude of openness to political negotiation and contestation
(Hutchings, 2010: 215). [Irrespective of **what precisely they are
supposed to entail**, the ideals associated with a global ethics
**become problematic** as soon as the attempt is made to **transform
difference** and the **plurality of wills into one and the same
will**]{.underline}. It is problematic for the same reason that
philosophical attempts to create a new metaphysics that is supposed to
resolve the violence of metaphysics. [Such attempts **can only have as
their aim** the **ultimate destruction** of the **very possibility of
philosophical thought**]{.underline} and writing, [which]{.underline},
per definition, [are **metaphysical** and therefore
**violent**]{.underline} (see Derrida, 1978). The temporal horizon of
neorealism [To argue against the desirability of universal ethical
ideals is]{.underline}, essentially, [to **recognize the importance of
finitude** for thinking about international ethics]{.underline}. Waltz's
neorealist [**conception of international anarchy** and of the **desire
of states to survive** therein offers one way of **affirming this notion
of international ethics**. This is **not to say**]{.underline}, however,
[that international anarchy]{.underline} in Waltz's theory [should be
seen as a **perfect ideal** that all politics and ethics **must aspire
to maintain**]{.underline}. In order for my deconstructive approach to
the ethics of neorealism to make any sense, [the international must also
be seen as **something finite** and **deconstructible**, rather than as
an **end in itself**]{.underline}. To think of the finitude of the
international, [we **do not have to look** for something that
'**transcends**' or comes '**after**' the international, like a **world
government** or **cosmopolitan community**]{.underline}.18 [[We]{.mark}
only [have to]{.mark} focus on the principles that]{.underline},
according to Waltz, [are meant to **[keep]{.mark} the international
order [alive]{.mark}**: the **structure of [anarchy]{.mark}** and
**states' desire to survive**]{.underline}. While these are mutually
dependent, [they]{.underline} also [point to a situation in which the
struggle to stay alive **might threaten the system** in which this
struggle takes place]{.underline}. To illustrate this point,
[consider]{.underline} the issue of **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**, which Waltz controversially saw as a possible
method of creating a more peaceful international order (see Waltz,
1990b). For Waltz, [**[only if]{.mark} nuclear [catastrophe
remains]{.mark} a [real]{.mark} possibility** [will states need
to]{.mark} **actively [deter the]{.mark} nuclear
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19 Thus, [nuclear deterrence 'works'
**only if nuclear war remains a constant possibility**, hence only
insofar as the problem of nuclear war is **not permanently
resolved**]{.underline} (Waltz, 1990b: 743--744). [[What creates]{.mark}
the possibility of [nuclear war constitutes]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
this sense, [[the **conditions of**]{.mark} **international security**
and [**peace**. What makes]{.mark} the prospect of nuclear war different
from other wars is]{.underline}, of course, [the **planetary scale** on
which its effects are likely to be felt]{.underline}. As such, [it poses
a threat]{.underline} not only to individual states, but also [to the
**entire system of states**]{.underline}. On this point, there is
another parallel to be drawn between Waltz and Derrida, for whom
[[apocalyptic discourses]{.underline}]{.mark} on nuclear war are
interesting because they highlight 'the absolute effacement of any
possible trace' (Derrida, 1984c: 28). Hence, these discourses [**[raise
the stakes]{.mark} of survival [even further]{.mark}** [by pointing to
the **finitude of everything that lives**]{.mark}, as well as to all
those attempts at **keeping the apocalypse at bay**, **deferring it
through deterrence**]{.underline} and so on (Derrida, 1984d: 29).
Understood as a global threat to the entire international order, nuclear
war highlights the temporal horizon of the whole neorealist project as
conceived by Waltz. This is the horizon of the horizon, or the structure
of the structure, which gives meaning to the 'international' as a finite
as opposed to infinite category shaping the behaviour of states. [Rather
than **simply reaffirming a static world-view**, which **perpetually
reproduces itself** in a circular fashion]{.underline}, Waltz puts
forward a notion of [the international]{.underline} that [is **both
finite** and **mortal**. The international continues to live
on]{.underline} in this sense, [but only on the condition that it is
**exposed to the threat of coming to an end**]{.underline}. Other
examples of how the international system may come to an end relate to
the increased impact of global capital and global warming. While these
are often depicted as typical examples of transnational phenomena, they
nevertheless emanate from a system in which states are free to make
sovereign decisions, for example, on how to deregulate the emissions of
pollutants and financial markets. [Individual states are]{.underline}
thus [free to actively contribute to setting in motion processes that
might put an end to the system that conditions their
survival]{.underline}. In this way, [there is a **self-destructive
potential** built into the system, which threatens to **make it collapse
from within** and **on its own terms**]{.underline} (see also Frost,
2009: 163--168). Crucially, the self-destructive potential of
international politics does not contradict Waltz's theory. After all, he
argues that [the system **shapes**, **not determines**, state
behaviour]{.underline}. He recognizes that [as long as states interact
within an anarchic structure, they are **simultaneously free** and
**insecure**]{.underline}. This freedom and insecurity mean that
[survival in international politics **can never become a predictable
science** that is able to '**remove the uncertainty of
politics**']{.underline} (Waltz, 1990a: 37). [Sometimes, the struggle to
survive **does more harm than good** to the ones seeking to survive.
Sometimes, this struggle may even set in motion processes the effects of
which will be **felt on a planetary scale**, provoking an **irreversible
decay** of the entire system of sovereign states.]{.underline}
Conclusion The ethics of neorealism, as argued in this article, stems
from the mutual interaction of the two core themes of Waltz's theory:
[the **structure of anarchy** and **states' desire to
survive**]{.underline}. Together, they [affirm]{.underline} Derrida's
notion of [the **violent opening of ethics**: the opening to a future
that makes new life possible while exposing everything that lives to
finitude and the threat of erasure. Ethics and violence
are]{.underline}, thus, [**inextricably interlinked**, which means that
any attempt to immunize the former from the latter is **untenable**.
Before any **moral obligations**, and before any **normative
commitments**, the ethics of neorealism addresses the **more fundamental
problem** of what it means for states to live and be free in a system
that guarantees nothing]{.underline}. In this way, Waltzian [neorealism
articulates the **basic conditions of international life**, which **all
attempts to theorize international ethics**]{.underline}, either by
remaining 'within' the international system or by arguing in favour of
its transcendence, **[must come to terms with]{.underline}**. One of the
main challenges that springs from my reading of the ethics of neorealism
relates to how [[universal ethical ideals]{.mark} not only become
**impossible to achieve in the practical sense**, but are also
**fundamentally undesirable**]{.underline}. They are undesirable because
[the desire to fulfil them **[undermines the conditions that
make]{.mark} international [life possible]{.mark} in the first
place**]{.underline}. On this basis, a whole range of [**attempts to
theorize the meaning** and **implications** of international ethics,
which]{.underline} in various ways [hold on to the notion of **ethical
ideals beyond the violence of inter-state relations** within an anarchic
structure, become **untenable**]{.underline}. This even includes
classical realism and the thought of Morgenthau, whose sharp distinction
between ethical desirability and political possibility dissolves in
light of the neorealist ethics presented in this article. According to
this notion of ethics, then, [the desirable **cannot be placed beyond
political possibility** since it **essentially is political
possibility**]{.underline}: the possibility of whatever happens in the
interaction among states in the structure of anarchy. As was pointed out
in the penultimate section of this article, there is also a temporal
horizon of neorealism. This horizon is best illustrated by the threat of
**[[nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [highlights the **possible
end of the entire**]{.underline} international political [**system**.
The threat of nuclear war demonstrates why this system, just like the
state, ought to be seen as a **finite** as opposed to **infinite
category**. Stressing the finitude of the system [means that there is
**no metaphysical truth**]{.mark}, moral or otherwise, [to which
it]{.mark} either [**can** or **should conform**. It]{.mark} also [means
that there is **always space**, and **time**, for]{.mark} an **ongoing
ethical-political [negotiation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the latter
might very well include efforts to produce a 'lesser violence', its main
force is that of a perpetual coming of the future. [As long as this
future is **allowed to play out**, there is]{.underline}, I believe,
[**reason to be optimistic**: optimistic not about the **possible
fulfilment of universal ethical ideals**, but about the **future
itself**, and **whatever it holds for international life**.]{.underline}

**Blagden, 18**---Senior Lecturer in International Security at the
Strategy and Security Institute, Department of Politics, University of
Exeter (David, "Realism, Uncertainty, and the Security Dilemma: Identity
and the Tantalizing Promise of Transformed International Relations,"
*Constructivism Reconsidered: Past, Present, and Future*, Chapter 12, pg

The previous section documented how [[social variables]{.mark} **might**
be taken [as]{.mark} having the **potential** to transform international
politics]{.underline}. This section now turns to an explanation of why
[it is]{.underline} so [**hard to fulfill** such seeming
transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly [state interests]{.mark},
they [are]{.mark} **necessarily [subordinate]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
political **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as a sovereign entity with
control over its own foreign policy), "physiological"
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the safety from death and harm of
the state's population), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a baseline level of which is
necessary to ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and
its population do not exist, it **cannot achieve anything
else**]{.underline}---such as fulfilling a social role or expressing a
cultural identity---either.36 And since survival, security, and
prosperity all have a material base---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump
materialism" (he simply does not think the material base yields
determinate outcomes)---so too must states necessarily put the defense
of such interests ahead of social role fulfillment if they want to be in
a position to play any sort of role in future.37 [[That is **not to
suggest** that states **do not**]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes---or,
indeed, often---[[make ideationally driven]{.mark} foreign policy
[choices]{.mark} that are **detrimental** to their other interests. [It
is]{.mark} simply a description of [states' **incentive structure**,
which **much of the time** they]{.mark} end up
[follow]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.

[It is necessary]{.underline} at this point [to defend the notion that
[there is]{.mark}, in fact, [a **material base independent of the social
world**]{.mark} and [that]{.mark} characteristics of that material base
[can yield **causal outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all,
[military technology does not descend as **manna from heaven**, but
rather is created via **human agency** in response to perceived
threats]{.underline}, and thus it necessarily contains a dose of
military culture and broader social identity from the outset. The same
goes for the overall share of national economic resources allocated to
defense, and indeed, money itself is a socially constructed store of
value, albeit one premised upon underlying materially underpinned
wealth.38 Any assessment of strategic priorities is necessarily filtered
through the strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the
assessing; asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of
sea denial versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an
answer infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its
role in the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth.
The broader question of whether the sea--- like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation.

Even technologies with such seemingly self-evident destructive power as
nuclear weapons are not self-evidently "good" or "bad," either morally
or strategically, absent social interpretation. One might see them as
"bad" because of the potential humanitarian consequences of their use
(or because of the constraints they impose on conventional military
options), or "good" because of the casualties in conventional war they
prevent (and deterrence that they enable at low relative cost). Their
political meaning is thus socially constructed, even if the
physiological effects on human bodies of their detonation have only one
possible outcome. If military technology and resources require a social
component to be both developed and meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's
contention that there is indeed a "rump" material base but that it is
simply indeterminate---in the absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as
a cause of international outcomes becomes alluring.39

Crucially, however, [each of these social choices involves a **decisive
material effect** that is **not open to interpretation**. It may be
debatable whether nuclear weapons are "**good**" or "**bad**," but the
**effect** that one will have]{.underline} on the city and its
population of frail, carbon-based human animals over which it detonates
[represents a **single**, **determinate outcome**]{.underline}---and a
state facing another state armed with them must therefore make certain
necessary calculations based around that capability.40 In the same vein,
[while]{.underline} the [strategic threat/opportunity]{.underline}
constituted by geographical features, such as the oceanic moats enjoyed
by the United States and United Kingdom, [may be a matter of
interpretation, the **underlying material
factor**]{.underline}---humans' inability to cross water without
spending resources on capital (ships) that could otherwise have been
spent on further ground forces---[yields certain **necessary
outcomes**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the very **foundation** of relations
between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---secure second-strike
nuclear deterrence and its disincentivization of conventional
aggression41---[rests on a physical "**fact**"]{.underline}: the
relative impenetrability of water to the electro-magnetic spectrum and
the associated survivability that it provides to ballistic missile
submarines.

[The same goes for the decision over what **share of**]{.underline}
national economic [**resources** to allocate to defense. Choosing a
proportion may indeed be a **socially** and **ideationally informed
political choice**, but the **underlying size** of the resource
pools]{.underline}---and the military potentiality that they underpin---
rests on the total size of the state's capital stock (both human and
physical), which [is **not a matter of social
interpretation**]{.underline}. And while military technology is indeed
developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within the
technical bounds of the feasible. Such rebuttals apply more widely:
[[while the balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}, including resources
and technology, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed necessarily
[[interpreted through]{.mark} states' [social lenses, it]{.mark}
nonetheless **[conditions]{.mark} the bounds of [the possible]{.mark}**
even in the absence of social content]{.underline}. And when those
possibilities include hostile use, certain behaviors are necessitated by
prudent states seeking survival for their populations.

Realists should indeed be castigated if they infer predictions solely
from the balance of currently existing military hardware---a thin and
intellectually impoverished understanding of relative power---and
critics are correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not
the same as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done, in line with the behavioral output understanding of
power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from the input
understanding).42 But [[viewing]{.mark} total [state power in terms of
**overall assets**]{.mark}]{.underline}, defined as the state's total
stock of physical,43 financial,44 and human capital,45 [[does a **better
job** of]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[encompassing]{.mark} all the
**[relevant resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}---equipment, stores of
value, human bodies and brains---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, second,
[[providing an **effective measurable proxy** for the **underlying
causes** of behavioral power]{.underline}]{.mark} (given that [the
latter can only be observed **ex post**, and is therefore **not an
effective predictor** of outcomes]{.underline}). [[None of this is to
**deny**]{.mark} that there is [a **social element**]{.mark} to the
construction of all these power resources]{.underline}, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. [It is simply to point
out]{.underline}, rather, [that [states' power]{.mark} resources [and
their effects are **not wholly socially constructed**]{.mark} and that
the nonsocial element **produces certain effects**]{.underline}.

Turning to specific arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion
that achieving a particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a
certain international-social role might be a goal of states is
relatively uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent
constructivist work on Britain's pursuit of international status
suggests at the outset that states' social roles are not the same as
their interests, ambitions, values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work
later asserts that social role actually produces national interests,
thus implying that states cannot in fact have interests besides those
constituted by identity.48 Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a
theoretical dilemma: the more minimal former assertion is the harder to
refute, yet the more ambitious latter claim is necessary if
constructivists are to escape the realist retort that fulfilling a
social role is merely an interest of states---and a subordinate one to
materially underpinned survival at that---rather than the interest.
Escaping this retort is in turn necessary if constructivists are to be
able to claim that anarchy is indeed what states make of it socially,
since transforming the prevailing culture of anarchy would require
states to lower their guard against each other---and thus accept higher
risk to their survival, at least while the hoped-for transformation was
taking place---in pursuit of an international-social value.

The less contentious point---that playing a particular social role is
one of multiple interests---opens the way to conceding that the most
fundamental state interests remain "political" survival (of state
territory and institutions), "biological" security (of the citizenry's
bodies), and preserving some baseline level of economic prosperity,
since a state that cannot survive cannot achieve anything else. But if
that is the case, then from these materially underpinned vital interests
follows a need to be capable of defending them against potential
foes---and that, if it comes to it, means accomplishing certain military
missions.49 Such military capability is necessarily underpinned by
material resources, even as it also has a socially constructed
dimension. Such capability can be provided independently (internal
balancing), via allies (external balancing), or through some combination
of the two---prudent strategy, including eschewing avoidable
confrontation and aligning with the preferences of powerful allies, is a
key aspect of state success50---but either way, it rests on some
friendly actor's underlying resources. And reliance on external
balancing brings its own dangers, as recently experienced by European
NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51

In short, [such an analysis]{.underline}---while conceding that social
role and status are important to states, all else held equal, and that
such concerns sometimes drive them to act in imprudent
ways---nonetheless [suggests that hedging]{.underline} against
abandonment, coercion, or outright destruction [via balance-of-power
positioning is **likely to remain pervasive**. This is **not to say**
that there will not be variation in the **extent** and **severity** of
such competition. All manner of ideational variables might exacerbate or
reduce tensions]{.underline}, as discussed above, and even in the
absence of such social forces, overt, intensive competition may yield
self-destructive outcomes if it increases another side's insecurity and
causes them to adopt a more offensively capable strategic posture in
response.52 [The point]{.underline}, rather, [is simply that conflict
will never be a **wholly absent possibility** and that that reality
**must condition states' calculations**]{.underline}---often to the
point of some level of defensive hedging, if the state has the resources
and technology to make that feasible---even in times of broadly
cooperative relations.

[[A similar retort can be made against the claims]{.mark} that threat
perception and military [doctrine are]{.mark} both [so]{.mark}
**fundamentally [skewed]{.mark}** [by culture that they may be]{.mark}
**commonly** and **wholly [disconnected]{.mark}** [from balance-of-power
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for an end
to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition. While
this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive review, the
success of many states--- particularly resource-rich ones---in aping
military technological and professional best practice would seem to
suggest that much of the time states are able to achieve what Gray,
borrowing from marketing theory, dubs "good enough" force postures in
the face of strategic uncertainty.53 Similarly, when states do "die" in
the face of foreign aggression---a rare occurrence in post-1945
international politics---it is more often as a consequence of their
relative military weakness and geographical vulnerability than as a
consequence of a failure to perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key
contribution of the neoclassical realist research program has been to
demonstrate that [while domestic-political variables may **filter
strategic behavior** in multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are
still **underlying balance-of-power structural pressures** at the
international-systemic level that states **usually respond to**, even if
they do so **belatedly** or **imperfectly**]{.underline}.55 In short,
while Waltzian "socialization" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine may frequently be hindered---and
sometimes terminally compromised---by cultural factors, [[as a
description of]{.mark} the **workings of [the international
system]{.mark}** as a whole]{.underline} (as he intended his theory to
be), [[realist predictions]{.mark} of enduring concern and possible
competition over the distribution of material power [are **not
undermined** by]{.mark}]{.underline} this recognition.56 Tellingly,
despite their strong **[[ideational commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}**
toward democracy promotion and human rights enforcement under the banner
of upholding international order, Western states have recently had the
reprioritization of balancing against increasingly capable rivals forced
upon them by developments in the balance of power, whether that be
China's rise in Asia for the United States or Russia's (partial)
resurgence in Europe for the rest of NATO.57

Finally, [even **[national identity]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
**[nationalism]{.underline}** it engenders---the ideational "master
variable" underpinning the nation-state system---[[is]{.mark} itself
[forged by]{.mark} the interaction of **political group identity** and
the **survival imperative** under structural anarchy]{.underline}. To
paraphrase Tilly, [war **makes the state**, and the state **makes
war**]{.underline}.58 [Modern nation-states may have **originated** as
political groups of individually weak human beings with some shared
identity connection, but their choice to **form states** as protective
war machines capable of generating]{.underline} the military
[power]{.underline} necessary [to defend]{.underline} against similar
political units, [and the subsequent mutual reinforcement of national
identity and state strength, is **very much consistent** with realism's
predictions of [the **consequences of**]{.mark} **international
[structural anarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, as noted earlier,
Mearsheimer uses these grounds to argue that nationalism and realism are
mutually supportive theories.59 In the post-- Cold War world, moreover,
mutually threatening political groups' need to generate the military
power necessary for security under anarchy---the security dilemma, in
short---helps to explain the explosion of ferocious ethnonationalist and
sectarian conflict within and between the new states emerging from the
collapse of previously multiethnic communist federations, secular Middle
Eastern autocracies, and so forth.60 Such conflict has in turn forged
the identity of the states and state-like entities emerging from it. In
short, [while it is **certainly not impossible** for national identities
to shift]{.underline}, as noted above, [the **process** of their
generation nonetheless suggests that they are **endogenous** to---rather
than **readily capable of exogenously shifting** to
transform---international systemic security competition and
balance-of-power positioning]{.underline}, that they are as much a
dependent variable as an independent variable.

Uncertainty and the Menacing Shadow of the Future

The previous section outlined why some of the otherwise most convincing
[constructivist variables]{.underline} at work in international politics
nevertheless [**cannot promise** to transform international politics
away from a world of "**realist**," **security-motivated
balance-of-power positioning**]{.underline}. This section turns to
discuss why [this is something that social variables will **continue to
struggle with** as long as there is an international
system]{.underline}.

[The **principal barrier** to states ever setting aside their
inclination to guard against each other and instead embrace each other
as "friends"---**no matter how strong** their]{.underline} leaders' or
citizens' [desire to **transform the culture** of international
anarchy---is **uncertainty** over others' intentions]{.underline},
particularly their future intentions.61 Following the logic of the
prisoners' dilemma, a state62 that trusts that another means it no harm
while the other state concludes that it now has an opportunity to pursue
advantage may be punished severely for its complacency, rendering such
trust perilous, particularly in security affairs, where defection from
cooperation could result in the end of the "game" for one party.63

The meaning and implications of this "uncertainty" assumption merit
consideration, however. Human beings are constantly trying to impose
certainty on a contingent world via cognitive heuristics and neural
shortcuts, for the sake of their own mental well-being.64 Indeed, since
humans derive meaning and value from the self-imposed certainty of
ideational reinforcement, so too they can derive benefit from the
entrenchment of both amity with and enmity against "others," even when
this creates other complications and dangers.65 As a result, much of
international politics is influenced by habit, both the habit of
friendship and the habit of animosity.66 "Uncertainty" also means
different things to different people: for realists, it is a condition
from which to infer fear about others' possible behavior; for
constructivists, by contrast, it may simply refer to the inherent
indeterminacy of information until it is imbued with social content.67
It may be possible to build trust in others' benign intent over time and
thereby escape security competition, meanwhile, through their costly
signaling: forgoing capabilities and policy options that a potential
aggressor would not want to do without.68 States can also have the
certain "friendship" of those with whom they are balancing against a
third-party threat, and if that threat is long-lived, then so too may be
the certainty of alliance.69

Illustrating this "uncertainty about uncertainty,"70 consider one of the
highest profile oft-invoked security dilemmas: the Cold War escalation
of U.S.-Soviet hostility, during which the most seminal security dilemma
theorization took place.71 Robert Jervis---one of the concept's foremost
progenitors---subsequently questioned whether the Cold War can be
understood as a security dilemma after all, understood as a tragic cycle
of mutual threat between nonrevisionist security seekers driven by
uncertainty over the other's intentions. Neither side was "uncertain"
over whether the other was an adversary. And as subsequent archival
revelations document, each side did want to destroy the other, and
correctly inferred as much of its opponent.72

Jervis's "recantation" of the Cold War-as-security-dilemma is itself
bounded, however, and this bounding sheds light on the ways in which
varieties of uncertainty can still operate even between states with
"certain" mutual intent. "Greedy" states versus "security-seeking"
states are themselves binary ideal types that mask an underlying
spectrum. Practically all states are greedy, in terms of wanting to
improve their lot, if the costs are low enough.73 Conversely, few states
are greedy to the point of total unconcern for security; not even Nazi
Germany desired limitless global war. While there may not have been
uncertainty over each side's Cold War intent, therefore---enmity-driven
desire to defeat and ultimately destroy the other---there was still
uncertainty over underlying motivations. 74 A desire to exterminate an
enemy population may entail quite different behavior than a desire for
ideological supremacy, for example, and the two may therefore merit
different policy responses, even though both fall within the domain of
"hostile" intent. Such doubt over motivations---even within the
cognitively "certain" domain of U.S.-Soviet enmity---still added up to a
variety of security dilemma: [[the **most salient question**]{.mark} for
Americans [was not "**is the Soviet Union an enemy?**" bu]{.mark}t
rather "[**what might Moscow do** about situation X, in Y circumstances,
at time Z?"]{.mark} The same is evident]{.underline} in major power
politics [today. Washington is not "uncertain" over whether or not China
and Russia are its "adversaries,"]{.underline} defined in broad and
obvious terms, [but there is a **high degree of uncertainty** over what
**types** of rivals they represent and their **associated future
strategic choices**. Recognition of uncertainty's nonbinary
nature]{.underline}, in short, [**does not undermine** the argument that
states' inability to know others' future behavior with perfect
reliability **incentivizes them to worry** about possible future
dangers]{.underline}. Realists disagree over prospects for avoiding
security competition through signaling motivations, of course,75 but all
variants are united by recognizing the enduring significance of the
balance of material power.76

On top of these qualifications to the uncertainty-over-intentions
assumption come disagreements over the most appropriate response to such
uncertainty. [Conceding that we can never know another state's future
intentions with mathematical certainty, and therefore that the
worst-case outcome]{.underline}---surprise attack by a concealed
aggressor---[will always remain a hypothetical possibility **does
not**]{.underline} necessarily [**imply** that security is **maximized**
by treating such a scenario as **likely**]{.underline}. Provoking war
for fear of possible future war is like committing suicide for fear of
death, and given the balancing often generated by hostile behavior,
provoking others into uniting against oneself through attempted power
maximization can ultimately reduce one's security.77 [While worst-case
contingencies **always merit consideration**, [policy
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly decisions over how much of
the national resource base to devote to defense ("guns") versus
consumption and productive investment ("butter")78---[[**necessitates
probabilistic calculations** of]{.mark} the relative dangers of
**[overarmament]{.mark}**]{.underline} (provoking balancing alongside
domestic economic immiseration) [[versus
**underarmament**]{.underline}]{.mark} (attack by a better-armed
adversary).79 Intense security competition can therefore be an
irrational and self-defeating response to mere uncertainty over future
intentions, in the absence of other threat data.80 Both "realist" and
"constructivist" variables can feature among this threat data and
therefore play a crucial part in determining the optimal strategic
response to such intentions uncertainty, and that in turn conditions
whether the potential threat posed by each side's capabilities, be they
latent or realized, manifests itself as a security dilemma. For many
realists, the offense-defense balance of technology and geography
determines whether uncertainty over others' intentions merits military
confrontation and determines the (in)stability of states' strategic
relations.81 For constructivists, the solidarity/enmity borne of
sociocultural similarity/difference may be equally decisive.

But [**neither** of these observations---that uncertainty neither
carries a single meaning nor prescribes a single strategy---undermines
the **core claim** that survival has a **material base** that
necessitates **continual security-motivated concern** for one's position
in the balance of power. Survival may]{.underline} indeed [be
"**multiply realizable**,"]{.underline} with social/ideational variables
informing the path taken, alongside various "realist" variables.
[But]{.underline} given all [states']{.underline} need to safeguard a
materially based hierarchy of interests without wholesale reliance on
others' politically contingent (and therefore capricious)
benevolence---whether that be potential abandonment by erstwhile allies,
potential attack by erstwhile neutrals, or potential coercion by
either---their [position in the balance of power will **always remain
relevant** to their future security]{.underline}. And [given that
situation, the conditions for **mutual threat** and an associated
**security dilemma** to re-emerge are **unlikely to be permanently
expunged**]{.underline}, despite such a deterioration going unrealized
indefinitely in many cases due to other overlying factors.82 [Fear of
future conflict]{.underline}---at least against some state, if not
against any specific state---thus [remains an **endemic feature** of
international politics]{.underline}. And much of that is still down to
the enduring concerns of structurally based realism:
international-systemic anarchy, its absence of a reliable sovereign
enforcer of global peace, and the associated dangers of offensively
capable peers of unreliably benevolent intent.

Tellingly, while many contemporary states have achieved mutual
"friendship," they have rarely sustained it once the strategic factors
holding them together---such as alliance against a mutual threat, shared
membership of a great(er) power's dependency network, or some other
mutually beneficial exchange---have disappeared. This suggests that such
"friendship" is as much a dependent variable (an outcome of realist
balancing behavior) as an independent variable (a transformational force
in international politics).83 Even within the zone of friendship that
had come to characterize the European "community" by the late 1980s, for
example---probably the deepest case of intersubjective recognition,
cooperation, and sovereignty pooling to date---Britain and France still
worried intensely about the potential power imbalances created by German
reunification, and they were not content until reunified German power
was subordinated via a restated US commitment to NATO.84 As noted
previously, moreover, via both Trump and Brexit---ideationally motivated
shifts in foreign policy orientation85---Euro-Atlantic security
relations have recently displayed a dramatic backsliding, raising the
specter of alliance breakdown and coercive confrontation. The relative
power of all sides is critical to their ability to resist/dispense such
coercion and safeguard future security even in the possible absence of
alliance support. Even within the EU, the ability of members to resist
or dispense coercion comes down to relative power: witness Greece's
experience at German hands in the context of the Eurozone crisis, and
contrast it with the lack of sanction for Franco-German breaches of EU
rules.86 And between NATO and Russia, a 1990s moment of optimism over
developing friendship has retrenched to coercive confrontation as an
outcome of each other's choices.87 All these developments---which can be
interpreted as negative movement along the spectrum between cooperation
and conflict---illustrate the continuing centrality of relative power to
safeguarding a hierarchy of national interests without dependence on the
changeable commitments of others.

As a consequence, [[the **base conditions** for the security dilemma
will **always exist**]{.mark} between sovereign states under anarchy,
[even if it lies]{.mark}]{.underline} wholly
**[[dormant]{.underline}]{.mark}** for most states most of the time,
thanks to overlying factors. [Interstate [friendship does not]{.mark}
render deterioration to [a security dilemma **impossible**, and neither
does]{.mark} interstate [animosity **preclude**]{.mark}]{.underline}
stable and durable **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.88 [So while
identity---which]{.underline} in any case [is "**sticky**" and **slow to
change**---certainly matters to security relations, it is **unlikely to
trump** some combination of **power** and **informational
variables**]{.underline}.89 Of course, if international relations were
transformed by the emergence of a single world-state, the system would
no longer be anarchic and the units-formerly-known-asstates would not
need to rely on relative power for their security, and thus such
competition would end.90 That requirement, however, does not look likely
to be fulfilled anytime soon.

Conclusion

[Conflict and cooperation is not some binary "**either/or**" condition,
but]{.underline} rather [a **spectrum**]{.underline}. So too the
[security concerns]{.underline} borne of uncertainty over motivations
[are not some irreversible "on/off" switch]{.underline}, be that
permanently severe or permanently solved. There is certainly far more
peace in the world than the most pessimistic readings of realism would
seem to imply,91 and ideational similarity and solidarity---as well as
the power and informational variables beloved of realists---clearly have
something to do with this. [[Interests]{.underline}]{.mark} within the
parameters of continuing to survive [[are **socially
constituted**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and even the route to survival
itself represents an ideationally informed choice. [[But]{.mark} the
need to safeguard [a]{.mark} **[material]{.mark}ly underpinned
[hierarchy of interests]{.mark}** if states are to continue to
exist]{.underline}---a necessary prerequisite to performing any kind of
social role---[still [incentivizes]{.mark} them to **value their
position** in the [balance of power as a
**safeguard**]{.mark}]{.underline} against future dangers. Of course,
[[states **can** and **do** disregard certain incentive
structures]{.mark} in favor of others]{.underline}.92 [[But until
**all** states]{.mark} are known to [have done so---a **high
bar**]{.mark} **indeed**---[the potential for security competition to
re-emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} in the international system
[[will]{.mark} **continue to [exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And knowing
that, states will continue to prize the capabilities to provide for
their own security . . . and so on, creating enduring conditions for
security dilemmas to one day reappear, even though they go overlain by
other factors in most international relationships most of the time.

Both realists and constructivists therefore have work to do, in terms of
both refining their paradigmatic cores and recognizing the necessity of
analytically eclectic cross-pollination [to explain many of the **most
pressing questions** of real-world international politics]{.underline}.
Realists must do more to incorporate identity as a variable that
produces systemically significant variation in behavior rather than as
some adjunct bolt-on, whether that be via the post-1990s boom of
neoclassical theorization or attempts at microfoundationally elaborated
structural realism.93 Porter's work on the interaction of power and
habit in determining US grand strategy is a good recent example,
while---as noted earlier---Snyder's Myths of Empire remains a key
benchmark.94 Constructivists, for their part, must continue to
investigate the relationship between states' potentially infinite array
of socially constituted interests, their materially underpinned
hierarchy of core survival requirements, and the enduring concern for
relative power that the latter generates. Along the way, [both sides
must be **circumspect** in their appeals to allegedly "**smoking-gun**"
examples]{.underline}. For realists to claim that structure alone
explains World War II or the Cold War, for example--- missing the
universalist ideologies of German Nazism, Soviet communism, or US
liberalism---would be a stretch indeed. Equally, constructivists' most
beloved examples---amicable US-Canadian relations along an easily
passable land border, the relative underarmament of Germany and Japan,
greater American fear of a few North Korean atomic bombs than hundreds
of British thermonuclear warheads, the rise of European Union, and so
forth---can all be readily explained with reference to balances of
capability and information. "Analytic eclecticism" is easy to profess,
but the most pressing contemporary questions of world politics require
that theorists practice it too.

[For those **not interested** in resolving **paradigm wars** or
"**isms**" debates]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the intersection of
**material-structural pressures** on state behavior with socially
constituted foreign policy preferences **provides ample scope** for
investigating **crucial real-world questions** of our time]{.underline}.
Viewed in rationalist terms, this might involve investigating the role
of social variables in informing leaders' utility functions, and thus
their preference orderings under the overall structural constraint of
needing to ensure continued survival. Just how far could the United
States meddle in the Middle East at the behest of domestic interests,
for example, before it critically harmed its power position vis-à-vis
China? Extending the previous point, has US unipolarity created unique
space for a "crazy" foreign policy that disregards the balance of
power---both by the United States itself and by close US allies---and
will this change if or when unipolarity wanes?95 Relatedly, just how far
can the likes of Germany and Japan sustain their pacifistic foreign
policy orientations in the face of US relative decline or disengagement
and the likely associated need for them to provide more for their own
security? Changing tack, how does a small power like Sweden---say---make
its trade-off between providing mobile forces for an EU Battlegroup (a
cause it values), on the one hand, and maintaining large amounts of
conscripts and armor on its eastern border to hedge against Russia (a
threat that it cannot be rid of), on the other? Are UK efforts to
rebrand as an "aid superpower" facilitated by a nuclear deterrent and
the US alliance, say, providing leeway to follow an ideational foreign
policy under the cover of a "good enough" military umbrella? In short,
[[there is scope for]{.mark} **any number** of midlevel
[theories]{.mark} of foreign policy [under the **constraint of**]{.mark}
**still [recognizing]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} interstate
[balance-of-power considerations]{.mark} **continue to
[structure]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} international

Although the majority of the left has condemned the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, the left camp's unity is still lacking. [We would like to
address those on the left who still stick to]{.underline} "[a plague on
both houses]{.underline}" [position that views the war as an
inter-imperialist war]{.underline}.

[[It is **high time**]{.mark} [the left]{.mark} [**woke up** and carried
out a]{.mark}]{.underline} "[**[concrete analysis]{.mark}** of the
**concrete situation**]{.underline}" [[instead of reproducing]{.mark}
**[worn-out frameworks]{.mark}** [from the Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Overlooking Russian imperialism is a
**terrible mistake**]{.mark} for the left]{.underline}. [[It is Putin,
**not NATO**]{.mark}, [who is waging war]{.mark} on
Ukraine]{.underline}. That is why [[it is
**essential**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to shift our focus from
Western]{.mark} imperialism [to Putin's **aggressive
imperialism**]{.mark}, which has an **ideological** and **political**
basis in addition to an economic one]{.underline}.

[Russian [imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline} consists of two elements.
Firstly, it [[involves **revisionist**]{.mark} **Russian
[nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [After 2012, [Putin]{.mark} and his
establishment [moved]{.mark} from a civic concept of the
nation]{.underline} (as rossiysky, "related to Russia") [[to an]{.mark}
**exclusive**, **[ethnic]{.mark}ally** based [concept of
**Russianness**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as russkiy, "ethnically/culturally
Russian"). [[His aggression]{.mark} in **2014** and in **2022** [was
**legitimized** by the return of]{.mark} "**[originally]{.mark}**"
[Russian lands]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [this concept
of]{.underline} ([ethnic]{.underline}) "[Russianness]{.underline}"
[revives the **nineteenth-century**]{.underline} [imperial concept of
the Russian nation, which reduces Ukrainian and Belarusian identity to
**regional identities**]{.underline}. [According to this view, Russians,
Belarusians, and Ukrainians are a **single people**]{.underline}.
[Employing [this]{.mark} concept in **official rhetoric**]{.underline}
[[implies the **negation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} independent
[Ukrainian statehood]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why we cannot say
with any degree of certainty that Putin only wants the recognition of
Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the Donbas. Putin may desire to
either annex or subdue the whole of Ukraine, threats which appear in his
article "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians" and in his
speech on February 21, 2022. Finally, [the perspective of Ukraine-Russia
peace talks look rather bleak]{.underline}, as Russia's negotiation team
is headed by former Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, one of the
most dedicated believers in the ideology of russkiy mir (the ethnic
Russian world) --- [a world where]{.underline}, **[believe
us]{.underline}**, [**no one** will be happy]{.underline}.

Secondly, even though Putin's aggression is hard to explain rationally,
current events have demonstrated that it may be reasonable enough,
nevertheless, to take Russian imperialist rhetoric at face value.
[Russian [imperialism is fueled by the desire to **change**]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called "**[[world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Thus, [[Putin's demand for NATO's
withdrawal from Eastern Europe]{.mark} may [signal]{.mark} that [Russia
may **not stop**]{.mark} with Ukraine, and **[Poland]{.mark}**,
**[Latvia]{.mark}**, **[Lithuania]{.mark}**, [or]{.mark}
**[Estonia]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may be the **next
targets**]{.underline}]{.mark} of Putin's aggression. [[It is]{.mark}
**very [naïve]{.mark}** [to demand to]{.mark}
**[demilitarize]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Eastern Europe, because in the
light of **current circumstances**]{.underline}, [[that will only be
**appeasing**]{.mark} [Putin and will make]{.mark} Eastern European
[countries]{.mark} **[vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Putin's
aggression. [[Discourse about **NATO expansion
obscures**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Putin's desire]{.underline}]{.mark} to
divide the spheres of influence in Europe between the US and Russia.
Being in the Russian sphere of influence means a country's political
subordination to Russia and subjection to the expansion of Russian
capital. The cases of Georgia and Ukraine demonstrate that Putin is
ready to use force to influence the political affairs of countries which
he believes wish to leave the Russian sphere of influence. It is
important to understand that [Putin's understanding of key agents in the
world order is **basically limited** to the **US** and
**China**]{.underline}. [He **does not recognize** other countries'
sovereignty]{.underline}, regarding them as satellites of one of these
agents of the international order.

[Putin and his establishment are very **cynical**]{.underline}. They use
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, American intervention in Afghanistan,
and the invasion of Iraq as a shield for the bombing of Ukraine. In this
context, the left must show consistency and say no to all imperialist
aggression in the world. [Today the imperialist aggressor is Russia, not
NATO]{.underline}, and if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, it will
definitely continue its aggression.

Furthermore, [we must have **no illusions** about [Putin's
regime]{.mark}. It [offers]{.mark} **[no alternative]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} Western [capitalism]{.mark}. [It is an
**authoritarian**]{.mark}, **[oligarchic
capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The level of **inequality**]{.mark}
in Russia [has]{.mark} **[risen significantly]{.mark}**]{.underline}
during the 20 years of his leadership. [[Putin is]{.mark} not only [an
**enemy** of the **working class**]{.mark}, but also an enemy to all
forms of **democracy**]{.underline}. [Popular participation]{.underline}
in politics and voluntary associations [is treated with
**suspicion**]{.underline} in Russia. [Putin is essentially an
**anti-Communist** and an enemy to everything the left]{.underline}
fought for in the twentieth century and [is fighting for]{.underline} in
the twenty-first. [[In his worldview]{.mark}, the strong have a **right
to beat** the weak, [the rich have the **right to exploit**]{.mark} the
poor, and strongmen in power have the **right to make decisions** on
behalf of their **disempowered population**.]{.underline} [This
worldview must be dealt a **severe blow** in Ukraine]{.underline}. [In
order [for]{.mark} **[political change]{.mark}** [to come about]{.mark}
inside of Russia, the [Russia]{.mark}n army **[must be
defeated]{.mark}** in Ukraine]{.underline}.

We want to address a highly controversial demand, that of military aid
to Ukraine. We understand the repercussions of militarization for the
progressive left movement worldwide and the left's resistance to NATO
expansion or Western intervention. However, more context is needed to
provide a fuller picture. First of all, NATO countries provided weapons
to Russia despite the 2014 embargo (France, Germany, Italy, Austria,
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and Spain). Thus, the
discussion about whether weapons sent to the region end up in the right
or wrong hands sounds a bit belated. They are already in bad hands, and
EU countries would only be righting their earlier wrongs by providing
weapons to Ukraine. Moreover, the alternative security guarantees that
the Ukrainian government has proposed require the involvement of a
number of countries, and probably can be achieved only with their
involvement, too. Secondly, as numerous articles have emphasized, the
Azov regiment is a problem. However, unlike in 2014, the far right is
not playing a prominent role in today's war, which has become a people's
war --- and [our comrades on the **anti-authoritarian left** of Ukraine,
Russia, and Belarus are fighting together **against
imperialism**]{.underline}. As has become clear in the last few days,
Russia is trying to compensate for its failure on the ground with air
attacks. Air **[defense]{.underline}** will not give Azov any additional
power, but it [will help Ukraine **keep control** of its territory and
**reduce civilian deaths**]{.underline} even if negotiations fail.

In our opinion, [[the Left should demand]{.underline}]{.mark}:

- [the immediate withdrawal of all Russian armed forces]{.underline}
  from Ukraine

- [**new** targeted, personal **sanctions**]{.underline} [on Putin and
  his multimillionaires]{.underline}. (It is important to understand
  that Putin and his establishment care only about their own private
  assets; they are oblivious to the state of the Russian economy
  overall. The left can also use this demand to expose the hypocrisy of
  those who sponsored Putin's regime and army and even now continue
  selling weapons to Russia)

- [the sanctioning of Russian **oil** and]{.underline}
  **[gas]{.underline}**

- [[increased **military support** to Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
  particular the provision of air defense systems

- the introduction of UN peacekeepers from non-NATO countries to protect
  civilians, including the protection of green corridors and the
  protection of nuclear power plants (Russia's veto in the UN Security
  Council can be overcome at the General Assembly)

The left should also support those Ukrainian leftists who are resisting,
giving them visibility, centering their voices, and supporting them
financially. We recognize that it is the millions of Ukrainian essential
workers and humanitarian aid volunteers who make further resistance
possible.

A number of other demands --- support for all refugees in Europe
regardless of citizenship, the cancellation of Ukraine's foreign debt,
sanctions against Russian oligarchs, etc. --- are broadly accepted on
the left and, therefore, we do not discuss them here.

[[The Russian invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine [sets]{.mark} a terrible
[precedent for]{.mark} the resolution of conflicts which involve the
risk of **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is why the Left must
come up with our own vision of international relations and the
architecture of international security which may include multilateral
nuclear disarmament (which will be binding for all nuclear powers) and
the institutionalization of international economic responses to any
imperialist aggression in the world. [[The]{.mark} **military
[defeat]{.mark}** [of Russia should be the]{.mark} **[first
step]{.mark}** [towards]{.mark} the **[democratization]{.mark}** of the

The world is trying to make sense of Russian President Vladimir Putin's
violent invasion of Ukraine. But his attack is not rooted in any
rational calculation of costs and benefits.

Instead, [Putin is making an **ill-conceived gambit**]{.underline} [to
reclaim his nation's stature as an **imperial power**]{.underline} and
assert Russia's prestige, authority and will on the world stage. Putin
has positioned himself as a frustrated representative of an aggrieved
fallen empire --- for example, lamenting "the paralysis of power and
will" that led to the complete "degradation and oblivion" of the Soviet
Union in 1991. Though this grievance seems situated within what Putin
has called the tragedy of the Soviet collapse, his imperial inspiration
extends even deeper into the country's past. [As Putin described it in a
**2012 speech**, the revival of Russian national consciousness
**necessitates** that Russians **connect** to their **past** and realize
that they have "a **common**, **continuous** history spanning over
**1,000 years**]{.underline}."

[Putin understands the post-Soviet global order through the prism of
**Russia's long history**]{.underline}. [And that history is
**inextricably tied**]{.underline} [to Russia's dynamic **imperial
mission**]{.underline} both in the past and today.

The first "Russian" state was established in present-day Kyiv in the 9th
century. But Kievan Rus' fell into ruin with the Mongol conquest of the
13th century, becoming a decentralized group of principalities that each
owed fealty and tribute to the Mongol khans.

By the late 15th century, though, the principality of Moscow, led by
Grand Prince Ivan III, turned the tables of fortune on the Mongols.
Ivan, known to history as Ivan the Great, renounced his land's
subordination to the Mongols and declared the sovereignty of Russia.
Ivan then subdued his neighbors, annexed their territory and centralized
Moscow's authority.

Ivan the Great came to power less than a decade after the Ottoman
conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Cultivating his imperial standing
with his marriage to the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, Ivan
claimed Byzantium's legacy for Muscovite Russia and adopted the title of
czar for himself. As czar, he asserted Russia's international influence
and stature by establishing diplomatic relations with foreign powers and
building the Kremlin to serve as an architectural manifestation of
Russia's new imperial power.

[By the]{.underline} start of the [16th century, the Russian **czars**
firmly conceived of their land as a **great empire**]{.underline}. For
them, Moscow was the Third Rome --- the heir to the Roman and Byzantine
empires. Though their imperial predecessors' empires had fallen, [the
Russian czars resolved to hold **absolute power**]{.underline} [to
ensure]{.underline} the dynamic and **[continued
expansion]{.underline}** of theirs.

In the 1550s, the czar known later as Ivan the Terrible extended his
country's territory along the southern Volga down to the Caspian Sea.
Twenty-five years later, Ivan sponsored expeditions that initiated
several decades of conquest and colonization of Siberia and large swaths
of Central Asia.

By 1648, Russia had moved across a continent and reached the Pacific
coast to become an enormous state with an unrivaled land mass. It was a
full-fledged colonial enterprise.

In 1654, Czar Alexis seized the territory that lay between Russia and
the Dnieper River. This included much of present-day Ukraine, including
Kyiv. While the dominions around Moscow were known as Great Russia or
simply Russia, much of what is present-day Ukraine was deemed Little
Russia in a clear reflection of its peripheral, colonized status.

Alexis's son Peter the Great took Russia's imperialist mission to new
heights. With a revamped army and newly founded navy, Peter the Great
defeated Sweden and expanded his empire in every direction. In
recognition of his military victories and territorial conquests, Peter
in 1721 declared Russia to be an empire and he, its emperor.

Several decades later, another great, the Empress Catherine, pushed the
empire's boundaries farther west through the partitions of Poland.
Catherine also took advantage of the weakening power of the Ottoman
Empire to expand Russia southward and create the region of Novorossiya,
which included the southern sections of present-day Ukraine. She then
solidified Russia's position on the Black Sea by annexing Crimea in
1783.

Many of Russia's imperial conquests were hard-won. In 1818, when Russian
forces attempted to conquer the Northern Caucasus, they encountered a
population that refused to be subdued. In answer to the guerrilla
warfare that the indigenous population unleashed against the invaders,
Russia burned villages to the ground, incinerated forests and took
civilians as hostages. Although by 1864 Russia had incorporated the
region into its empire, ethnic and religious tensions percolated and
would erupt in a new wave of violence over a century later with the
Chechen Wars in the 1990s.

[**Convinced** that Russia's status as a global power depended on its
**expansive empire**, Russian czars]{.underline} --- safe and secure in
their St. Petersburg palaces --- [expended **vast sums** of money and
the **lives** of young Russian soldiers to maintain **imperial
glory**]{.underline}. [Territory was **purchased** with the lives of
both **conquering armies** and their **resisters**]{.underline} [while
Russian rulers transformed the cities of the **metropole**]{.underline}
[with monuments erected to honor **imperial victories** and
**expansion**]{.underline}.

When Russia erupted in revolution in 1917, the empire collapsed.
Initially, the Bolsheviks expressed antipathy toward imperialism.
Indeed, they contended that regions like Ukraine that declared their
independence would be free from the weight of empire. But the
dislocation that came with the end of World War I did not bring the
worldwide socialist revolution that Vladimir Lenin expected. As a
socialist island in a sea of global capitalism, the Russian Empire was
resurrected by Lenin and the Bolsheviks within the federal structure of
the Soviet Union. For the next 70 years, Russia's traditional imperial
mission became entangled with the expansionist aims of communism.

To meet the surging economic and military power of the United States,
the Soviet Union in the late 1940s established satellite states
throughout Eastern Europe, with communist governments overseen by
Moscow. Using tanks, artillery and repression, the Soviets kept the
communist bloc until the 1980s, when Mikhail Gorbachev could no longer
use military force to retain power. The Soviets' imperial project was in
peril.

These liberatory impulses unleashed a ripple effect within the Soviet
Union itself, with the Baltic States and the Caucasus calling for
independence from Moscow. By the end of 1991, nationalist sentiments
within the assortment of nations that the Soviet Union had inherited
from the czarist imperialist state led to demands for autonomy and
spelled the end of the U.S.S.R.

[When Putin succeeded]{.underline} Boris [Yeltsin]{.underline} as
president of the Russian Federation [in **1999**]{.underline}, [he
claimed that his country was **entitled** to exert a **privileged
influence**]{.underline} [over the **post-Soviet states**]{.underline}.
Yet many of these nations balked at the local cronyism and corruption
that seemed to come with Moscow's continued influence. In the early
2000s, popular uprisings in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan ---
collectively deemed the Color Revolutions --- demonstrated these
countries' spirit of independence and, thereby, the limits of Russia's
and Putin's control of the region.

For Putin, this equated to an inglorious lack of prestige and power.
Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity that overthrew Putin's supporter,
President Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014 only intensified this perception.
[The Russian president's decision to move into eastern Ukraine and annex
Crimea was the]{.underline} **[opening salvo]{.underline}** [to reclaim
the power that imperial failure had eroded]{.underline}.

[Beyond economic sanctions, Putin faced **little
consequence**]{.underline} for this 2014 power play, [and his
**geopolitical machinations** surged]{.underline}. Russian interference
in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump's subsequent
derision of NATO probably convinced Putin of his ability to extend
Russia's global sway without substantial obstacles.

Over the past several years, as [Putin has **increasingly constricted**
Russian civil society, limited his country's **independent media** and
**news sources**, and **imprisoned** domestic opposition
leaders]{.underline}, he has enhanced his ability to pursue his aims
unencumbered. [Reviving the **imperialist dreams** of his **czarist
forebears**]{.underline}, Putin moved to reclaim the empire that he
believes was unjustly pilfered from Russia.

But [the determined resistance of the Ukrainian people]{.underline} to
Russian aggression [has shown the **folly** of Putin's vision of renewed
imperial grandeur]{.underline}. Having found independence from Moscow in
the years since 1991, [Ukrainians have no desire to return to their
**previous colonial status**]{.underline}. Despite Russia's superior
military might, the Ukrainian people have made a stand for their
sovereignty and their freedom, earning support and respect around the
world.

Conquest and glory have thus far eluded Putin and his forces. Instead of
finding renewed prestige through the global order, Putin finds himself
isolated and condemned, and his 21st-century version of Russian
imperialism vilified and reviled rather than championed.

The great NATO enlargement debate never ends. In the 1990s, U.S.
officials and academics argued about whether pushing the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization into Eastern Europe was likely to sustain the
post-Cold War peace or prematurely end it. More recently, critics have
charged that Russia's war in Ukraine is a natural response to the
aggressive expansion of America's most powerful alliance.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."

The "blame NATO" argument tells a story of hubris, arrogance and
tragedy. It holds that there was a golden chance for lasting peace in
Europe, but the U.S. threw it all away. Rather than conciliating a
defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it by expanding a vast
military alliance up to Russia's borders and even into the former Soviet
Union. This pursuit of American hegemony in a liberal-democratic guise
eventually provoked a violent rebuke.

In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia and Ukraine are just the
natural response of one great power whose vital interests are being
heedlessly threatened by another.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part,
to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But the idea
that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
geopolitically bizarre.

Far from being a historic blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the
**great American successes**]{.underline} of the post-Cold War era. [Far
from being the act of a domineering superpower, it was part of a long
tradition of **vulnerable states begging** to join America's liberal
empire]{.underline}. [And far from posing a mortal threat to Moscow,
NATO enlargement actually provided Russia with far greater
**security**]{.underline} [than it could have provided
itself]{.underline}.

NATO's big bang

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

[To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember
something]{.underline} that nearly [everyone has now
forgotten]{.underline}: [There was **no guarantee** that Europe would be
mostly **stable**, **peaceful** and **democratic** after the Cold
War]{.underline}. In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO
expansion as a catastrophe once warned that [a post-Cold War Europe
could become a **violent hellscape**]{.underline}.

[It wasn't an outlandish scenario]{.underline}. [A reunified Germany
might once again try to **dominate** its neighbors]{.underline}; [the
old enmity between Moscow and Berlin could **reignite**]{.underline}.
[The collapse of Soviet influence]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [could
liberate]{.underline} those [states to pursue]{.underline}
long-suppressed [**territorial claims** and **nationalist
agendas**]{.underline}. [**Ethnic tensions** and **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline} [might **explode**]{.underline} [as the
Cold War order crumbled]{.underline}.

[If the U.S. pulled back]{.underline} once the Soviet threat was gone,
[there would be no]{.underline} extra-European [superpower to **put out
fires**]{.underline} [on a continent with lots of **geopolitical
kindling**]{.underline}. "[The prospect of major crises, even
wars]{.underline}, in Europe [is likely to **increase
dramatically**]{.underline}," Mearsheimer predicted in 1990.

[NATO enlargement was the **logical answer**]{.underline} to these
fears. Expansion was a way of binding a reunified Germany to the West
and surrounding it with democratic allies. [Joining NATO required new
members to lay aside any **revanchist designs**, while allowing them to
pursue]{.underline} economic and **[political reforms]{.underline}**
[rather than investing heavily in military capabilities]{.underline} to
defend their newly won autonomy.

[NATO's move]{.underline} to the east [also ensured that Poland and
other states that easily could have built **nuclear weapons** didn't
need to, because they had **American protection**]{.underline}. Most
important, enlargement kept the U.S. firmly planted in Europe, by
preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from
becoming obsolete.

[**No other initiative** could have accomplished these
objectives]{.underline}. Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose
security cooperation agreements with former Soviet-bloc states ---
didn't offer the ironclad guarantees that came with NATO membership.
([If you want to understand the difference between]{.underline}
"[security partner]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[NATO
ally]{.underline}**," [just look at what is happening]{.underline} today
[to **Ukraine**]{.underline}, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

[Only American power]{.underline} and promises [could provide
**stability**]{.underline} in Europe, [and NATO was the continent's
**critical link**]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}. Since 1949,
Washington had tamped down rivalries between old enemies such as France
and Germany, while also protecting them from external threats. After
1991, NATO expansion took this zone of peace, prosperity and cooperation
that had emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern Europe as
well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier," protecting the continent from dangers
within and without.

Russia as the victim

Today, of course, the critics don't buy this account. They argue that
NATO expansion represented crude power politics, as the U.S. exploited
the Soviet collapse to engorge its own empire. What resulted, pundits
such as Thomas Friedman contend, was a sort of Weimar Russia --- a
country whose dignity was affronted, security imperiled and democracy
undermined by a harsh, humiliating peace.

There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy began to
wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration saw NATO
expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent.

In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues --- including
disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian economy in the
late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's relationship with the
West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.

First, all policies have costs. [The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites]{.underline} --- although we often
forget that Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, bringing Russia into elite Western institutions
such as the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in the
intervention in Bosnia in 1995-96. [Yet the cost of not expanding NATO
might have been **forfeiting** much of the stability that initiative
provided]{.underline}. [**Trade-offs** are **inevitable** in foreign
policy]{.underline}: [There was no magic middle path]{.underline} that
would have provided all the benefits with none of the costs.

Second, [if NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it
was a remarkably **benign**]{.underline} [and **consensual** form of
empire]{.underline}. When Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did
so at the urging of the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians. [The Baltic
countries and others were soon **banging at the door**]{.underline}.
[The states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were
**desperate** to **join America's** sphere of influence, because they
were desperate to leave Moscow's]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline}, too, [was part of an older pattern]{.underline}:
[The U.S. has often extended its influence by
"**invitation**]{.underline}" [rather than imposition]{.underline}. [The
creation of NATO]{.underline} in 1949 [was mostly a European
idea]{.underline}: [Countries]{.underline} that were [terrified of
Moscow sought protection from Washington]{.underline}. One reason
Putin's wars to keep countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so
abhorrent to Americans is that the U.S. empire has trouble keeping
members out.

Putin may not see it that way. All that matters to him is that the
mightiest peacetime alliance in history has crept closer to Russian
soil. But here a third fact becomes relevant: Russia was one of the
biggest beneficiaries of NATO's move east.

Making Russia safer

Open terrain has often left Russia vulnerable to invasion and
instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany
and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern Europe to wreak havoc on
Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason why the great strategist
George Kennan opposed NATO expansion --- because it would surely
re-activate this fear of encroachment from the west.

Yet this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat. The
alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign troops
in Eastern Europe. After the Cold War, America steadily withdrew most of
its troops and all of its heavy armor from the continent. U.S. allies
engaged in a veritable race to disarm.

The prospect that NATO could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was
laughable. What the alliance could do was tame the perils that might
otherwise have menaced the Russian state.

Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled snugly into an
alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket. NATO, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could "play a
containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry about a
nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy.

NATO expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack.

Putin's easy excuse

So what went wrong? Why couldn't Putin make his peace with a larger
NATO?

Part of the answer is that NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in
the sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony
in its near-abroad. The Soviet Union, and [the Russian
empire]{.underline} before it, [had traditionally sought to **control
countries** along their frontiers and used **brutal means**]{.underline}
to do it. [To say that NATO expansion caused Russian belligerence is
thus to make an **extremely dubious assertion**]{.underline}: [that
absent NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a
**satisfied**]{.underline}, **[status quo]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}.

And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire. [For 20 years, Putin has been **publicly lusting** after the
sphere of influence that the Soviet Union once enjoyed]{.underline}.
NATO expansion stood athwart that ambition, by giving Moscow's former
vassals the ability to resist its pressure.

[NATO]{.underline} also [threatened]{.underline} a certain type of
Russian government --- [an autocracy that was **never secure** in its
own rule]{.underline}. [A democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded
being neighbors]{.underline} with Western-leaning democracies, because
political liberty in those countries wouldn't have threatened to set a
subversive example for anti-Putin Russians.

Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early 2000s, and as Putin's
popularity declined with the Russian economy after 2008, the imperative
of preventing ideological spillover from a U.S.-backed democratic
community loomed large.

So Putin began pushing back against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he
invaded Georgia, a country that was moving --- too slowly for its own
safety --- toward the West. Since 2014, he has been waging war against
Ukraine, in hopes of rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's
westward drift. America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's
program of violent coercion.

West missed the danger signs

To be sure, U.S. officials made mistakes along the way. Because Russia
was prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s, Washington
acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without really
considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon has thus
been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of NATO's
eastern flank.

As Russia regained its strength, U.S. officials also failed to grasp the
danger of provoking Putin without adequately deterring him. When, in
2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for Georgia and Ukraine but
issued a vague statement saying that they would someday join the
alliance, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving Putin both the
pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by tearing those two
countries apart.

Yet there is a curious morality in [accounts]{.underline} that [blame
the West, which sought to protect **vulnerable** states]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe, [for the current carnage, rather than blaming Putin, who
has worked to **dismember** and **intimidate** those
countries]{.underline}. It is sloppy thinking to tally up the costs of
NATO expansion without considering the historic achievements of a policy
that served American, European and even certain Russian interests
remarkably well.

And if nothing else, NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between
Moscow and the democratic world to the east after one Cold War --- a
factor of great significance now that a second cold war is underway.

The legacy of NATO expansion isn't simply a matter of historical
interest. [Americans' understanding of the past has always
influenced]{.underline} their view of [what policies to pursue **in the
future**]{.underline}. [During the 1920s and 1930s]{.underline}, [the
widespread]{.underline}, if [inaccurate]{.underline}, [belief that
America had entered World War I to serve the interests of
**banks**]{.underline} [and **arms manufacturers**]{.underline} [had
a]{.underline} \[**[crushing]{.underline}**\] ~~paralyzing~~ [effect on
U.S. policy amid the **totalitarian aggression**]{.underline} [that set
off **World War II**]{.underline}.

Today, the U.S. faces a long, nasty struggle to contain Putin's imperial
project and protect an endangered world order. Introspection is an
admirable quality, but [the last thing America needs is another bout of
**self-flagellation**]{.underline} [rooted in another misapprehension of
the past]{.underline}. --- Bloomberg

i\'ve been thinking a lot about the role media plays in egging these
hate crimes on not just trump and his china blaming nonsense but also
the daily legitimate reports about the terrible things the chinese
government is doing like arbitrarily detaining two canadians to bully
canada into releasing monzo committing genocide against the uyghurs and
other ethnic minorities cracking down on hong kong\'s democracy pulling
shady neo-colonious moves in southeast asia and africa and much much
worse and we should criticize the chinese government international
pressure is the only thing that can get them to back off but i\'m
wondering what this non-stop positioning of china as that ominous
foreign boogeyman does to the perception of chinese people as a whole
and other asians and pacific islanders by extension i used to not flinch
when people would say china without information about kovid or china is
playing the long game to world domination because i instinctively know
that they\'re talking about the chinese government not ordinary citizens
because i as someone who was born and raised in mainland china i\'m well
aware that the chinese government does not represent me but now i\'m
wondering if the average person who grew up in the west can
conceptualize this if they\'re aware that the average chinese citizen
has no political power or influence over whether these atrocities are
happening you hear a lot about what the chinese government is doing but
do you ever hear about what\'s happening in china for ordinary people do
you have any idea what they\'re thinking whenever i speak up against
white supremacy and the lingering impact of western colonialism there\'s
always some guy in my comments who is like well china has a han

criticize both the chinese and western governments but somehow just
because of my name and face some people equate me to this ominous evil
in their minds that it\'s china we can talk all day about how i don\'t
even have chinese citizenship anymore i\'m legally a canadian but i
don\'t want to make it seem like it\'d be okay to see all citizens of
the people\'s republic of china as the enemy either if you want to know
what it\'s like for an average chinese citizen imagine if trump and his
goons appointed themselves your government leaders because of their

not even being able to criticize trump without worrying that the police
might pay you a visit my family sees the stuff american comedians say
about trump they see a selfie i took with justin trudeau and they are
stunned in china politicians don\'t go on campaigns to win support they
don\'t take selfies with random people they do what their higher ups
tell them to do it\'s like ordinary citizens are base level employees at
a massive company and civil servants are the managers we occasionally
hear stuff about the top bosses like xi jinping but ultimately we have
no influence on the direction they decide to take the company and in
everything we see in public we have to maintain the position of oh yeah
our company is the best however most mainland chinese people that i know
are not blindly loyal to the ccp they\'ve just been conditioned to not
voice dissent out of fear of punishment but the grievances have their
own way of slipping out there are endless sensitive terms that get
automatically blocked on chinese social media but discussions still
happen using all sorts of slang to bypass the filters the chinese people
are always one step ahead of the censors we make jokes about getting
invited to tea whenever we say something out of line we laugh at
government propaganda we use vpns to go on youtube and twitter and
facebook we mock the socialist values cj king loves to talk about
because we\'re well aware that china has an attempted socialism in
decades and it is in fact one of the most capitalist countries on earth
if it were true that all mainland chinese people are brainwashed the
government wouldn\'t need to crack down so hard on free speech i am
chinese but i do not feel proud that the chinese government is getting
so powerful it even makes me feel hopeless sometimes when i think about
how other countries are too tangled up in their own messes and too
economically dependent on china to seriously stand up to the ccp and
chinese citizens themselves have too much to lose to rise up in a mass

in the ccp have their grip on that much power and there\'s currently no
reliable force out there that we can depend on to take them down this is

Yet **[a wave of interest]{.underline}** [in pursuing solar system
colonization is building]{.underline}, whether its initial focus is the
Moon, Mars, or O'Neill-style space habitats. Jeff Bezos has argued
eloquently for [moving heavy industry off the home planet, **preserving
Earth** as a nature reserve, and building the space-based infrastructure
that will lower barriers and create opportunities for vast economic and
cultural growth]{.underline} (similar to how the Internet and a
revolution in microelectronics has allowed Amazon and numerous other
companies to achieve spectacular wealth). Elon Musk and **[Stephen
Hawking]{.underline}** both [suggested the need for a "hedge" population
of humans]{.underline} on Mars [to allow human civilization to reboot
itself in the event of a **catastrophe on Earth**]{.underline} -- [an
eggs-in-several-baskets approach]{.underline} which actually complements
the arguments made by Bezos. And while both are valid reasons for
pursuing colonization, there's a stronger, overarching rationale that
clinches it.

I'll assert that [a]{.underline} **[fundamental truth]{.underline}** --
[repeatedly borne out by history]{.underline} -- [is that expanding,
outwardly-focused civilizations are far **less likely to turn on
themselves**, and far more likely to expend their fecundity on growing
habitations, conducting important research and creating wealth
for]{.underline} their [citizens]{.underline}. A [civilization that
**turns away from**]{.underline} discovery and **[growth
stagnates]{.underline}** -- a point made by NASA's Chief Historian
Steven Dick as well as Mars exploration advocate Robert Zubrin.

[As a species, we have yet to resolve problems of extreme **political
polarization**]{.underline} (both internal to nation states as well as
among them), inequalities in wealth distribution, [deficiencies in civil
liberties, environmental depredations and war]{.underline}. Forgoing
opportunities to expand our presence into the cosmos to achieve better
outcomes here at home hasn't eliminated these scourges.

What's more, the **["cabin fever"]{.underline}** often decried by
opponents of colonization (when applied to small, isolated outposts far
from Earth) [turns out to be a potential problem for our own
planet]{.underline}. **[Without a relief valve]{.underline}** [for
ideological pilgrims]{.underline} or staunch individualists who might
just prefer to be on their own despite the inevitable hardships, [we may
well run the risk of **exacerbating** the **polarization** and
internecine strife]{.underline} we strive so hard to quell. [Focusing
humanity's attention and imagination on a grand project may]{.underline}
well [give us the running room we need to address these
problems]{.underline}. But the decision cannot be made by one country,
or one company, or one segment of the human population. If we do this,
it will of necessity be a truly international endeavor, a cross-sector
endeavor (with all commercial, civil, and defense interests engaged and
cooperating).

The good news: [Critical technologies such as propulsion and power
generation systems]{.underline} will **[improve over
time]{.underline}**. [Transit durations between celestial destinations
will shorten]{.underline} ([in the same way sailing vessels gave way to
steam ships and]{.underline} then to [airliners]{.underline} and
perhaps, one day, to point-to-point ballistic reusable rockets).
[Methods for obtaining critical resources on other planets will be
**refined** and enhanced]{.underline}. **[Genetic
engineering]{.underline}** [may be used to better adapt humans, their
crops and other biota to life in space]{.underline} or on other
planetary surfaces -- [to withstand the effects of low or micro-gravity,
radiation, and the psychological effects]{.underline} of long-duration
spaceflight.

As nation after nation lands their inaugural exploratory vessels on our
Earth's moon, and as billionaire space enthusiasts race to launch
passengers, satellites and other cargo into orbit, it's clearly time for
us to sit down as a species and debate whether our future will be one
highlighted primarily by growth and discovery, opening the solar system
to settlement and economic development, or one that eschews outward
expansion for conservation and preservation. Doing so would allow us to
focus our attentions on this planet, leaving the solar system in its
natural state, a celestial Antarctica stretching beyond Neptune.

I vote for growth. But one person, or one company, one community, one
nation, isn't a plurality here. [This debate - postponed for more than
50 years -- is one worth having. **Humanity's future** will be decided
by its outcome]{.underline}.

Many argue that [the world is in a state of crisis]{.underline} and that
the human race is the cause. [As a species, we are approaching an
important turning point in our history, and if we make the wrong
decisions we might be facing a future of **deprivation**, **over
population**, **hunger**, and **instability**]{.underline}. Ultimately,
many believe that [we will eventually be forced to colonize
space]{.underline}. Last year, the 100 Starship Symposium set on course
a project to design and build an economical and practical spacecraft for
interstellar travel.

But [with the very immediate worries about over population, it might
**not** be **a good idea to wait** for interstellar travel and the
colonization of other worlds]{.underline}. Fortunately, [there
are]{.underline} also [many suggestions in place for large space
structures designed as places for people to live in their millions, much
like a city is on Earth]{.underline}. Of course, building a space
habitat comes with thousands of challenges, including: construction in
space, recreating a livable atmosphere, recycling waste, producing
artificial gravity, transporting food and materials to the habitat, and
convincing people such a venture is worth it.

There\'s no strict definition for a \'space habitat\', but it\'s
generally agreed to be [a permanent human living facility on a celestial
body such as \'Mars One\']{.underline} (extra-terrestrial planets,
moons, or in a spaceship orbiting the Earth). [We may have]{.underline}
**[no choice but to build]{.underline}** one of [these in the
future,]{.underline} be it [initiated as a **matter of
survival**]{.underline} or an undeniable demand because of our desire to
explore and gain new knowledge by expanding in space. Ultimately, there
are a number of incentives to building such a habitat.

For [governmental bodies and world leaders faced with]{.underline} a
huge [an]{.underline}d **[unsustainable population]{.underline}**, the
concept of [a space habitat would be attractive]{.underline}. [Using the
materials available in the Solar System, there is the potential to build
enough surface area within space habitats to]{.underline} possibly
[house]{.underline} billions and even [**trillions** of
people]{.underline}. [Populations would have the space to expand
sustainably without destroying any current ecosystems, as well as
**relieving** the **pressure off Earth** to provide
resources]{.underline}. The planetary population could be
[**stabilized**]{.underline} and supported [with the extra space to
inhabit and develop agricultural plantations for food.]{.underline}

The expansion into space also offers up a wealth of privatized
opportunities, such as access to energy and other interplanetary
resources. **[On Earth]{.underline}**, [utilizing the Sun\'s energy via
solar cells is a disappointingly inefficient process with **unavoidable
problems**]{.underline} associated with the atmosphere and night. [In
space, solar panels would have access to nearly continuous light from
the Sun]{.underline}, and in Earth\'s orbit this would give us [1400
watts of power per square meter]{.underline} (with 100% efficiency).
This **[abundance of energy]{.underline}** [would mean]{.underline} that
we [could travel throughout much of the Solar System without
a]{.underline} terribly [significant drop in power]{.underline}.

[Material resources would also be in]{.underline}
**[abundance]{.underline}** [throughout the entire Solar
System]{.underline} (especially if you include mining opportunities on
Mars, Luna, and other moons). [Asteroids contain almost all of the
stable elements in the periodic table]{.underline}, and [without
gravity, extracting and transporting them]{.underline} for our uses
[could be done with ease]{.underline}. NASA is working on a project
where [one could manufacture fuel, building materials, water, and oxygen
just from resources found the Moon.]{.underline} The shift from Earth
based manufacturing and plantation to industries in space may not just
become feasible, but incredibly economically beneficial.

In 2021, a new era of space exploration dawned with the first privately
organized flights ferrying civilian passengers across the line that
separates our planet from the rest of the universe. Much of the media
coverage of the three flights launched by Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin
and SpaceX has either been of the "isn't this cool" variety or has
characterized these endeavours as symbols of inequality. As such, [the
question of what the value of human spaceflight is has gone largely
unanswered]{.underline}.

Supporters of space exploration sometimes suggest that sending robotic
probes to the remote corners of the solar system and beyond can teach us
what we need to know about the universe at less cost and risk than
sending people. Yet, [for the]{.underline} **[safety of our
descendants]{.underline}** [and to reach humanity's full potential, we
must become **a multiplanetary species**]{.underline}.

**[Existential risk]{.underline}**

[Humans have a]{.underline} **[one in six chance]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[going extinct]{.underline}** [this
century]{.underline} according to [Oxford Philosopher]{.underline} Toby
Ord. In his book, The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of
Humanity, [Dr]{.underline} **[Ord]{.underline}** [lays out a variety
of]{.underline} **[long-tail risks]{.underline}** [that are both
**existential** and very **difficult to mitigate**]{.underline}. These
include nature-based risks like **[asteroids]{.underline}**,
[large-scale]{.underline} **[volcanic eruptions]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[stellar explosions]{.underline}**. Although we can
track many of these phenomena, [we do not have the
technology]{.underline} ([nor are we likely to develop it anytime
soon]{.underline}) [to prevent large eruptions or redirect large
asteroids]{.underline}. Initial efforts to nudge space objects are just
beginning. This is to say nothing of the [human-created risks
of]{.underline} **[nuclear war]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[bioweapons]{.underline}** [intentionally or
unintentionally]{.underline} released on the public, a scenario made
easier to imagine by the current pandemic.

[As long as humanity is]{.underline} **[grouped together]{.underline}**
[on a single planet there will always be a possibility that all of us
can be killed at once.]{.underline} It is [equivalent to having everyone
in a single building]{.underline}: **[there is always a risk greater
than zero]{.underline}** [of a collapse or fire that kills
everyone]{.underline}. [By **establishing**]{.underline}, at first,
small **[outposts]{.underline}** [and eventually larger scale
settlements on other planets, the risk of our species being destroyed is
**significantly curtailed**]{.underline}.

Realizing humanity's potential

On a more positive note, [human habitation in a greater variety of
settings will radically expedite science]{.underline} and commerce.
While we currently have small-scale experimentation with manufacturing
items in micro and zero gravity on the International Space Station, [the
potential for us to set up large-scale industry in different physics
requires us to have a presence on other celestial
locations]{.underline}.

[Large-scale settlements of people are hubs of innovation and human
flourishing]{.underline}. Just think of how many more discoveries and
marvels could be created by 80 billion people in the future instead of
today's 8 billion. [Our current planet has a]{.underline} **[limited
carrying capacity]{.underline}** [but our solar system can accommodate
many more people than any single planet]{.underline} can.

Just as cultural and geographic variety contributes to the richness of
our current society, [further expanding the diversity of human settings
would continue to]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}** the
**[creativity]{.underline}** of our species. Space travel itself has
already been an incredible inspiration to numerous
[scientists]{.underline}, [engineers and artists]{.underline} with many
people citing seeing the moon landing as one of the most formative
events of their lives.

Hastening science and technology development

The [technologies we develop on our way to becoming a multiplanetary
species will also benefit us here on earth]{.underline}. Today,
**[satellites]{.underline}** [are used to **monitor** carbon and other
**greenhouse gas emissions** to give us a better picture of the causes
of global warming and]{.underline} **[promote
accountability]{.underline}**. In her first speech devoted to space, US
Vice-President Kalama Harris said: "I truly believe **[space activity is
climate action]{.underline}**." In a recent report, the World Economic
Forum\'s Global Future Council on Space laid out the many ways
[satellite data is being used to address climate change]{.underline} and
suggests feeding data from space-based assets into an "Earth Operations
Centre" [to provide a real-time picture of activities and phenomena that
contribute to warming.]{.underline}

Less well known are the many other technologies developed on our way to
space but used in our daily lives. The **[CMOS sensor]{.underline}** was
first [invented at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab]{.underline}oratory in the
1990s. No one could have predicted that this technology would eventually
be part of all our phones, [enabl]{.underline}ing [high-quality digital
images]{.underline} and [affecting]{.underline} everything from [how we
document]{.underline} **[human rights abuses]{.underline}** to how we
present ourselves to potential mates on dating apps.

#### NATO assistance to Ukraine is [anti-imperialist]{.underline}.

International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies,
member of Anti\*Capitalist Resistance; 3-21-2022; \"Six FAQs on
**[[Anti-Imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** Today and the War [[in
**Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}\"; International Viewpoint;
https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article7571; KL\]

Question 2: [[Wouldn't Ukraine]{.mark}'s standing up against the Russian
invasion [benefit NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}?

[The first thing to say is "**[so what?]{.mark}**]{.underline}" Our
support to peoples fighting imperialism shouldn't depend on which
imperialist side is backing them. [Otherwise, [by the]{.mark} **[same
logic]{.mark}**, [**justice** should be **sacrificed** to the **supreme
battle** against the]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[West]{.mark}ern
bloc]{.underline}," as some argue in neo-campist pseudo-left circles.
For my part, I wrote that [[a **Russian success**]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- an outcome that unfortunately still remains a real possibility ---
"[[would **embolden**]{.mark} US [imperialism]{.mark} itself and its
allies to continue their own **aggressive** behavior]{.underline}."
Indeed, the United States and its Western allies have already benefited
enormously from Putin's action. They should be warmly grateful to the
Russian autocrat.

[A successful Russian takeover of Ukraine would encourage the United
States to return to the path of **conquering the world** by force in a
context of exacerbation of the **new colonial division** of the world
and worsening of **global antagonisms**, while [a Russian
failure]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[adding to]{.mark} the US [failures in
**Iraq**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[Afghanistan]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[would reinforce]{.mark} what is called in Washington [the]{.mark}
"**[Vietnam syndrome]{.mark}**]{.underline}." [Moreover]{.underline}, it
seems quite obvious to me that [a Russian victory would considerably
strengthen **warmongering**]{.underline} [and the push towards increased
**military spending**]{.underline} [in NATO countries]{.underline},
which has already gotten off to a flying start, [while a Russian defeat
would offer much better conditions]{.underline} for our battle [for
**general disarmament**]{.underline} and the dissolution of NATO.

If [Ukraine were to succeed in rejecting the **Russian
yoke**]{.underline}, it is more than [likely that it would be vassalized
to Western powers]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the point is that, [if
it fails to do so, it will be **enserfed** to Russia]{.underline}. And
you don't have to be a qualified medievalist to know that [the condition
of a vassal is **incomparably preferable** to that of a
serf]{.underline}!

Question 3: How can we radical anti-imperialists support a resistance
that is led by a rightwing bourgeois government?

Should we support a people that resists against an over-armed
imperialist invasion only if its resistance is led by communists and not
by a bourgeois government? This is a very old ultra-left position on the
national question, which Lenin rightfully combatted in his time. [[A
**just** struggle against]{.mark} **national [oppression]{.mark}**, let
alone foreign occupation, [must be **supported**]{.mark} [regardless
of]{.mark} the **nature** of [its **leadership**]{.mark}: if this fight
is just, it implies that the population concerned **actively
participates** in it and **deserves support**]{.underline}, regardless
of the nature of its leadership.

[[It is]{.mark} **certainly [not]{.mark}** [the Ukrainian
capitalists]{.mark} who are [mobilizing]{.mark} en masse with the
Ukrainian armed forces]{.underline} in the form of an improvised
national guard and new-style "pétroleuses," [[but the **working
people**]{.mark} of Ukraine]{.underline}. And [[in their fight
against]{.mark} **Great [Russian imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[led by an **autocratic** and **oligarchic ultra-reactionary**
government in Moscow that presides over the destinies of one of the most
**unequal countries** on the planet, the Ukrainian people deserve our
**full support**]{.underline}. This certainly does not imply that we
cannot criticize the Kyiv government.

Question 4: [Isn't the ongoing war an inter-imperialist
war]{.underline}?

[If any war where each side is supported by an imperialist rival were
called an inter-imperialist war, then **all the wars** of our time would
be inter-imperialist]{.underline}, since as a rule, it is enough for one
of the rival imperialisms to support one side for the other to support
the opposite side. [An inter-imperialist war is **not
that**]{.underline}. [It is a direct war, and not one by proxy, between
two powers, each of which seeks to invade the territorial]{.underline}
and (neo)colonial domain [of the other]{.underline}, as was very clearly
the First World War. It is a "war of rapine" on both sides, as Lenin
liked to call it.

[[To describe the]{.mark} ongoing [conflict in Ukraine]{.mark}, in which
the latter country has **no ambition**, let alone **intention**, of
seizing Russian territory, and in which Russia has the **stated
intention** of subjugating Ukraine and seizing much of its
territory]{.underline} --- [to call this conflict
**[inter-imperialist]{.mark}**, rather than an **imperialist war of
invasion**, [is a]{.mark}n **extreme [distortion of
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} **[primary]{.mark}**, **most [immediate]{.mark}**,
[function of]{.mark} the supply of [arms]{.mark} to Ukraine [is]{.mark}
therefore [that it helps]{.mark} it [oppose its
**enserfment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if, on the other hand, it
wishes its vassalization in the belief that it is the only guarantee of
its freedom. We must, of course, also oppose its vassalization, but
[[for the time being]{.mark}, [the **most urgent** need must be
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Of course, the direct entry into war of the other imperialist camp would
transform the current conflict into a true inter-imperialist war, in the
correct sense of the concept, a type of war to which we are
categorically hostile. For now, [[NATO members]{.mark} are declaring
that they will not cross the red line of sending troops]{.underline} to
fight the Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil, or shooting down
Russian planes in Ukrainian airspace --- [despite Volodymyr Zelensky's
exhortations. This is because they [**rightly fear** a **fatal
spiral**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [skeptical]{.underline}, as they have
become, [[about]{.mark} the **rationality** of Putin who did not
hesitate to brandish [the]{.mark} **[nuclear threat]{.mark}** from the
outset.]{.underline}

Question 5: Can we support Western arms deliveries to Ukraine?

Since the Ukrainians' fight against the Russian invasion is just, it is
quite right to help them defend themselves against an enemy far superior
in numbers and armament. That is why [we are **without
hesitation**]{.underline} [in favor of the delivery of]{.underline}
defensive [weapons to the **Ukrainian resistance**]{.underline}. But
what does this mean?

An example: we are certainly in favor of delivering anti-aircraft
missiles, portable and otherwise, to the Ukrainian resistance. [To
oppose it would be to say that Ukrainians only have to choose between,
on the one hand, **being massacred** and seeing their **cities
destroyed**]{.underline} by the Russian air force, [without having the
means they need to defend themselves, or]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [fleeing their country]{.underline}. At the same time, however, we
must not only oppose the irresponsible idea of imposing a no-fly zone
over Ukraine or part of its territory; we must also oppose the delivery
of air fighters to Ukraine that Zelensky has been demanding. Fighters
are not strictly defensive weaponry, and their supply to Ukraine would
actually risk significantly aggravating Russian bombing.

In short, we are in favor of the supply to Ukraine of anti-aircraft and
anti-tank weapons, as well as all the armaments indispensable for the
defense of a territory. [[To deny Ukraine]{.mark} these deliveries
[is]{.mark} simply [to be]{.mark} **[guilty of failure]{.mark}** [to
assist a people in **danger**]{.mark}! We have called for the delivery
of such defensive weapons to the **Syrian opposition** in the past. The
United States **refused** and even prevented its local allies from
handing them over to the Syrians]{.underline}, in part because of the
Israeli veto. [**We know** what the **consequences** were]{.underline}.

#### Stop [Westplaining]{.underline} Ukraine.

The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine has lasted nearly a month,
killing over 3000 civilians and wounding more than 10000 of them. The
humanitarian crisis has attracted much attention on campus, with
students organizing vigils and fundraisers for disaster relief. Some
[progressives]{.underline} on campus, however, [have adopted the
**Russian talking point**]{.underline}, [holding the West and NATO
responsible for triggering the invasion]{.underline}. Curiously, [their
arguments]{.underline}, [in line with realist scholars they]{.underline}
[**usually despise** like John Mearshimer and Stephen
Waltz]{.underline}, [mainly concern the **security needs** of the
Russian state and the **imperialist nature** of NATO]{.underline}. They
contend that the "imperialist," U.S.-led NATO expansion, in violation of
its promise to the Soviet Union before the unification of Germany,
[triggered heightened anxiety in Eastern Europe and pushed Russia to
defend its sphere of influence]{.underline} via war. [What's more, being
in the same camp as isolationists like **Rand Paul**]{.underline},
**[they]{.underline}** also call for dialing down sanctions against
"ordinary Russians," and argue against **[any form]{.underline}** of
**[NATO intervention]{.underline}**.

[The seemingly innocent anti-war and anti-imperialist position taken by
some progressives is **harmful** for Ukrainians and other **oppressed
peoples**]{.underline} [fighting against autocratic
brutality]{.underline} for two reasons: 1) [on the surface level,
blaming NATO/the West]{.underline} **[denies any agency]{.underline}**
[of Ukrainians and their **legitimate wish** to join NATO and embrace
the West]{.underline}, and 2) in promoting their version of
anti-imperialism, [the anti-war left in fact embrace a form of
**U.S.-centrism** that **ignores atrocities** committed by adversaries
of the U.S., such as **Russia**, **China**, Cuba, Venezuela, and
**Iran**]{.underline}.

Let's take on [the]{.underline} "[Ukraine is the West's
fault]{.underline}" [argument]{.underline} first. [The problem of this
proposition is that it assumes that without NATO expansion, Russia would
**behave differently**]{.underline}. [Both **historical** and
**contemporary empirical evidence** suggests otherwise]{.underline}.
[Long before the establishment of NATO]{.underline} and since the reign
of Ivan the Terrible I in the 16th century, [Russia sought eastward
expansion to secure its relatively weak geopolitical]{.underline}
position that lacks strategic depth. As noted by renowned historian
Stephen Kotkin, Russian foreign policy "has been characterized by
soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country's capabilities" for
centuries. In a present day scenario, the best way for Russia to prevent
the eastward expansion of NATO would be to station troops alongside the
Russian-Ukrainian border without an invasion to achieve maximum
deterrence effect and bargaining power. In fact, [it was **Russian
aggression**]{.underline} [against Ukraine throughout the 21st century
that **accelerated**]{.underline} [Ukraine's embrace of]{.underline} the
EU and [NATO]{.underline}. Public opinion polls suggest that immediately
after the Cold War, only 37% of Ukrainians supported joining NATO. It
was not until after the Orange Revolution, when Russia poisoned
Yushchenko with neural toxins, that more than 50% of the Ukrainian
public embraced the idea of a national referendum on joining NATO.
[After the Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian support for NATO
reached a **historical height**, with more than 60% of Ukrainians
embracing the idea]{.underline}. Breaking down Putin's psyche, his
rationale to attack Ukraine, and the puzzling optimistic evaluation
before the war is a tall order. Historians are likely to debate causes
of the war for decades, but [it is **clear** that NATO expansion is
**not** a major factor in Putin's calculation to launch the
war]{.underline} --- [he **barely mentioned**]{.underline} [NATO in his
war-declaration speech]{.underline} right before the invasion [and
declared Ukraine to be an **imaginary state**]{.underline} [gifted by
Lenin]{.underline}. If there is anything that can be learned from the
ongoing war, however, it is that [allowing Ukraine to join NATO in 2008
would likely have prevented the Russian invasion]{.underline}: [the
**rock-solid peace** and security in **Poland** and the **Baltic
states**, countries that were traditionally in the Russian sphere of
influence, are the **best example**]{.underline} of how NATO manages to
protect member states from Russian aggression.

Contending with the uncomfortable idea that the vast majority of
Ukrainians support NATO and that NATO could have protected Ukraine, [the
anti-war left]{.underline}, as represented by Marjorie Cohn who gave a
talk at Swarthmore on March 2, 2022, [often resorts to **conspiracy
theories** backed by the Kremlin, claiming that the current pro-West
administration was the result of the]{.underline} "[illegimate neo-Nazi
coup]{.underline}" of 2014 [backed by the U.S]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} is essentially a claim that [not only]{.underline}
**[contradicts with reality]{.underline}** [but also **removes any
agency**]{.underline} [vested in the Ukrainian people]{.underline}.

[What is **more disturbing** than the flawed argument that ignores
internal political dynamics and **political agency**]{.underline} [of
Ukraine is its **moral implication**]{.underline}: [by identifying the
U.S. as the **only "bad guy**" in the world, leftists **ignore** and
indirectly **whitewash**]{.underline} [the evils committed by
autocrats]{.underline} around the world. Indeed, U.S. progressives are
facing an intellectual dilemma between criticizing U.S. imperialism and
addressing oversea authoritarianism today. [They believe that
criticizing autocracies in the global south would undermine their
project of dismantling U.S. imperialism]{.underline} --- [an **entirely
false** proposition]{.underline}, of course.

For years, [they have focused primarily on wrongdoings of the
U.S]{.underline}., [in part because of this **one-dimensional**
anti-imperialist project]{.underline}, [but also because of the
**unconscious U.S.-centrism**]{.underline} [that inevitably results from
**solely focusing** on U.S. behaviors]{.underline}. [The anti-war left
has criticized the]{.underline} U.S./the [CIA]{.underline}, [without
concrete evidence]{.underline}, [for offering support to pro-democracy
protesters in]{.underline} Syria, Hong Kong, and Venezuela, [and has
been **largely absent**]{.underline} [on issues such as the **annexation
of Crimea**]{.underline}, [**Assad's war crimes** against
civilians]{.underline}, **[Iran's proxy wars]{.underline}** [in the
Middle East, and **China's treatment** of ethnic minorities and Hong
Kong]{.underline}. Instead, [they focused mostly on where they deemed
U.S. policy to be]{.underline} [wrong]{.underline}, like in regards to
dealings with Yemen, Israel/Palestine, and Cuba. Why was this the case?
[The current generation of the anti-war left, born at the end of the
Cold War, have **never experienced** real threats firsthand from other
great powers]{.underline}. [Instead, they grew up in an
**America-dominated** world]{.underline} in which the power of the U.S.
was largely unchecked. [As such, their worldviews were shaped by events
such as the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}, where an omnipotent U.S.
failed to sustain its moral claim of establishing a democracy to replace
the Saddam regime. Thus, those born in this generation spent their
formative years criticizing the U.S. regime with a deep sense of guilt.
[This]{.underline} introspective [guilt]{.underline}, [coupled
with]{.underline} continued **[unchallenged]{.underline}** U.S.
[dominance]{.underline}, [resulted in the millennial anti-war left
supporting the **very ideas** they attempted to criticize]{.underline}:
[U.S. dominance and imperialism]{.underline}.

In adopting this viewpoint, [the anti-war left ended up where they
**exactly** did not want to be]{.underline}: [U.S.-centric]{.underline}.
As mentioned before, many [progressives have **ignored** human rights
violations and **atrocities** caused by many foreign powers]{.underline}
--- [Russia in **Syria**; Iran in **Yemen**, **Iraq**, and
**Lebanon**]{.underline}; [and China in **Hong Kong** and
**Xinjiang**]{.underline} --- [because these countries are adversaries
of the U.S. and can potentially undermine U.S. dominance]{.underline}.
Moreover, [instead of helping activists within these authoritarian
countries, anti-war progressives view them as **agents** of the U.S.'s
imperialist interests]{.underline} and advocate for U.S. isolationism,
[even when **real-life** human rights atrocities were being committed
against civilians]{.underline}. This is another mistake caused by their
belief that only the U.S. is capable of wielding real power in a
unipolar world and that critical events happening in other countries
have their roots in an American-centric system.

[This "anti-war" worldview]{.underline}, in part due to the breakdown of
the moral legacy of the U.S.- led, pro-democracy, and pro-openness
post-Cold War order after the Iraq War, [not only takes agency away from
other **oppressed peoples**]{.underline} [living under and being
threatened by **autocrats**]{.underline} in Russia, China, Iran, and
etc., [but also indirectly promotes another form of
**U.S.-centrism**]{.underline}, [in which **only** the U.S. is deemed to
have **any real power**]{.underline} [over the global
events]{.underline}. Progressive millennials now face the intellectual
challenge of refraining from 'westplaining' Ukraine and aligning their
worldview with moral claims about freedom and self-determination both
home and abroad. [Facing growing challenges posed by autocratic and
inherently imperialist powers like Russia and China, leftists in the
U.S. should **unequivocally stand** on the side of
**democracy**]{.underline} [rather than **apologize** for autocrats and
their **expansionist aggression** in the **name** of
"**anti-imperialism**]{.underline}."

Ontologies of Otherness: Liberal--local relations, 'hybridity',
'resistance' and the 'everyday'

Sensitive to the problem of such occlusion, [a major strand of recent
literature has emphasized the need to rethink]{.underline} the relations
between [the 'liberal']{.underline} and the 'local' in intervention
settings (Mac Ginty, 2011; Richmond, 2009, 2010, 2011), in what has been
labelled a 'fourth generation' approach (Richmond, 2011). This writing
has taken a much more proactive approach to research with and about the
peoples targeted by intervention, aiming to correct the impression of
smooth liberal transformation and the 'romanticization' of the local
(Mac Ginty, 2011: 2--4). [Yet, the paths it has taken have, quite
unwillingly, reinforced a Eurocentric understanding of intervention,
through the use of an ontology of 'Otherness' to frame the
issues]{.underline}. Prominent among these accounts is Richmond's (2009,
2010, 2011) recent work on 'post-liberal peace', which frames the key
problems of intervention through an ontological distinction between the
'liberal' and the 'local'. In earlier writing, the [liberal peace is
elaborated as genealogically endogenous to Western traditions of
thought, reflecting Enlightenment]{.underline}, modern and
post-Christian [values]{.underline} (Richmond, 2005). In post-conflict
settings, however, [it is critiqued for exercising]{.underline} forms of
[hegemony that suppress pluralism]{.underline}, depoliticize peace,
undermine the liberal social contract [and exercise a colonial gaze in
its treatment of local 'recipients' of the liberal peace]{.underline}.
In view of these various aspects of failure, the liberal peace is
characterized as 'ethically bankrupt' (Richmond, 2009: 558) and
requiring re-evaluation. [The 'local', on the other hand, is a space
characterized by 'context, custom, tradition and difference]{.underline}
in its everyday setting' (Richmond, 2010: 669), which is suppressed by
liberal peace interventions. [The]{.underline} very
[conception]{.underline} of the 'post-liberal peace' [is]{.underline}
thus [about]{.underline} the ways in which [two ontologically distinct
elements]{.underline} -- the 'liberal' and the 'local' -- are 'rescued
and reunited' via forms of hybridity and empathy, in which 'everyday
local agencies, rights, needs, custom and kinship are recognized as
discursive "webs of meaning"' (Richmond, 2010: 668). Mitchell (2011:
1628) has recently argued that Richmond's conception of the 'local' is
not 'a reference to parochial, spatially, culturally or politically
bounded places' but 'the potentialities of local agents to contest,
reshape or resist within a local "space"'. Richmond (2011: 13--14)
himself has also been concerned not to be understood as 'essentializing'
the 'local', emphasizing that it contains a diversity of forms of
political society. Indeed, in this more recent work, a more complex
conception of the 'everyday' as a space of action, thought and potential
resistance is elaborated. Despite these qualifications, however, there
is much conflation, interchangeability and slippage between these
conceptions of the 'local'. Accordingly, the ontology of Otherness,
understood as cultural distinctiveness and alterity, continuously
surfaces throughout the narratives of liberal and post-liberal peace.
[Not only is the liberal peace closely linked to the intellectual
trajectory of the 'West', but a conception of the 'local' as non-modern
and non-Western]{.underline} often [re-appears]{.underline}: This
requires that local academies and policymakers beyond the already
liberal international community are enabled to develop theoretical
approaches to understanding their own predicaments and situations,
without these being tainted by Western, liberal, and developed world
orthodoxies and interests. In other words, to gain an understanding of
the 'indigenous' and everyday factors for the overall project of
building peace, liberal or otherwise, a via media needs to be developed
between emergent local knowledge and the orthodoxy of international
prescriptions and assumptions about peace. (Richmond, 2009: 571,
emphasis added) [There is a clear emphasis here on the need to engage
with the 'indigenous' or 'authentic' traditions of non-Western life,
which seems to reflect an **underlying assumption of cultural difference
as the primary division** between these two parties. This reproduces the
division between the liberal, rational, modern West and a culturally
distinct space of the 'local]{.underline}'. Indeed, the call for a
post-liberal peace is often a call for peacebuilding to reflect a more
'culturally appropriate form of politics' (Richmond, 2011: 102) that is
more empathetic and emancipatory. This emphasis on tradition and
cultural norms as constitutive of the 'local' is carried through in
recent research on interventions in Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands.
These focus largely on the reinvigoration of 'customary' houses and
institutions as a form of 'critical agency' in distinction to liberal
institutions and the state (Richmond, 2011: 159--182). The point here is
not simply that there is an account of alterity or cultural difference
within the politics of intervention, but that [the liberal/local
distinction appears to be the central ontological fulcrum upon which the
rest of the political and ethical problems sit]{.underline} (see also
Chandler, 2010b: 153). Therefore, 'local' or 'everyday' 'agency' is seen
to be best expressed to the extent that it reclaims 'the customary' and
is not 'co-opted' by the internationals. It is understood as enhanced
where codes of 'customary law' become part of the new constitutional
settlement. A similar division can be seen in Mac Ginty's (2011)
framework, which sees the hybridities in peacebuilding as emerging at
the intersection of the 'international' and 'local' agents and
institutions. Again, this framework is built on an ontological
distinction between the two that repeatedly splits the
'Western'/'international' from the 'non-Western'/'local'. Even though
this is well qualified, overall Mac Ginty (2011: 94) defends this
distinction, arguing that if one were to abandon such potentially
problematic labels then this would lead to an abandonment of research
altogether. This can quite straightforwardly be read as a defence of the
basic ontology of the project, which is an ontology of the distinction
between the West and its Others, which meet through various forms of
hybridization. While Mac Ginty does not pursue the ethics of the
post-liberal peace in the same way as Richmond, [the]{.underline}
underlying intellectual [framework also uses this distinction as the
analytic pivot of the research]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} earlier
[define]{.underline}d [Eurocentrism as the **belief in Western
distinctiveness**]{.underline}, and I have argued that [this is
**philosophically fundamental to this strand of the critical
literature** that grapples with the relationship between the 'liberal'
and the 'local'.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} strand [has put
substantial analytic weight on fundamental cultural differences between
these two entities]{.underline}, even while disavowing any essentialism
and making some substantive conceptual efforts to move away from this.
[Such difficulties are indicative of the **deep hold that this
particular avatar of Eurocentrism has on the critical
imaginary**.]{.underline} By contrast, [the point made by]{.underline} a
wide variety of [other 'postcolonial' writers has precisely been against
such an ontology of the international, pointing instead to the
historically **blurred, intertwined and mutually constituted** character
of global historical space and 'culture']{.underline} (Bhabha, 2004;
Bhambra, 2010).

#### Non-western IR [essentializes]{.underline} cultural tropes of non-US peoples\-\--turns the K, reifies imperialism and undermines any intellectual gains in their framework

**Mena 20**, PhD Student at the department of International Relations at

production of Chinese International thought, China´s political economy
and the expansion of global capitalism (Ferran Perez, "The Trap of
Diversity: What Constitutes 'Non-Western IR Theory'?," E-IR,
<https://www.e-ir.info/2020/05/08/the-trap-of-diversity-what-constitutes-non-western-ir-theory/>)

[During the last decade]{.underline}, the field of International
Relations ([IR]{.underline}) [has witnessed the emergence of
'non-Western IR theory']{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan's seminal work
titled Non-Western International Relations Theory: Perspectives on and
Beyond Asia (2009) marked a watershed for the discipline. Acharya and
Buzan's book contributed to a disciplinary self-reflection, which
resulted in a wide range of academic publications aimed at turning the
field of IR into a more pluralistic discipline that respects the
subaltern voices that have been silenced by the imperial origins of IR.
For this reason, the celebration of 'cultural diversity' as an
ontological source has become the central focus of new theoretical
endeavours. Both the projects of 'Global IR' (Acharya, 2016; Yong-Soo,
2019) led by the prestigious scholar Amitav Acharya and the various
'national schools of International Relations' (Cho, 2013; Qin, 2018;
Shahi, 2019; Shih et al., 2019; Yan, 2019; Zhao, 2019) are prime
examples of this new phenomena. [Despite the welcoming efforts of
promoting 'cultural diversity']{.underline} (Acharya, 2016; Reus-Smit,
2018; Tickner and Blaney, 2012) to produce theoretical projects that
seek to transcend both the 'Western' and 'imperial' origins of the
discipline, [the field of IR has fallen into a dangerous dynamic that
stems from the very imperial origins of discipline: the **reification of
culture as an essentialist construction**]{.underline}. In this sense,
[essentialism is 'the view that cultures have fundamental or "essential"
properties, among them their values and beliefs']{.underline} (Goodhart
2003, p.940). [In the late 19th century, Western imperialism had to
imagine essentialist cultural forms]{.underline} beyond the domains of
the 'West' [to rationalise its 'civilising mission']{.underline} (Said,
2014). [In a historical and disciplinary twist]{.underline}, both [the
celebration of 'cultural diversity']{.underline} and the promotion of
pluralism have allowed and [legitimised the arrival of 'essentialist'
theoretical projects by a disciplinary 'back door']{.underline}. Put it
differently, [in an act of disciplinary redemption, the field of IR has
accepted forms of theorising that would have been disqualified some
years ago due to their essentialist tendency. For instance, the
celebrated 'Chinese school of IR' solely reactivates Confucianism as an
ontological source, dismissing thus other political traditions that
exist or have existed in China such as 1930's]{.underline} revolutionary
Chinese thought, Mao Zedong's thought, Buddhism or even a 'sinicised'
Islam. In this way, only Confucianism is equated with Chineseness.
Regarding the project of 'Global IR', Hurrel (2016, p.150), wisely
warned us about the dangers of [Global IR]{.underline} as it
'[can]{.underline} also [lead to a cultural and regional inwardness that
may **work to reproduce** the very ethnocentricities that are being
challenged']{.underline}. [This is perhaps one of the main paradoxes
that exist in IR given the massive and recent disciplinary efforts to
evade such 'essentialist' constructions]{.underline}. This is what I
call the 'trap of diversity' in IR. It is worth mentioning that the
production of 'non-Western IR theory' has manifested several degrees of
'essentialism'. Although, there are some great contributions (Hurrel,
2016) that seek to transcend these dynamics. Nonetheless, I contend that
such essentialism that informs the production of 'non-Western IR theory'
is a result of the impact of the 'dual legacy' (Chibber, 2018) of Edward
Said's Orientalism in the discipline of IR. As Chibber (2018, p.37)
argues '\[Said's\] legacy is therefore a dual one -- propelling the
critique of imperialism into the very heart of the mainstream on the one
hand, but also giving strength to intellectual fashions that have
undermined the possibility of that very critique'. Specifically, [in the
field of 'non-Western IR theory', these academic trends have been
crystallised in]{.underline} (neo)-Weberian and postmodern approaches
and [a problematic scholarly tendency to understand the production of
international theory as an independent intellectual process that is
completely disjointed from a specific form of political economy or
material reality]{.underline}. In this light, the main challenge that
the IR discipline has to address is the legacy of 'Western cultural
imperialism', in an idealist fashion, rather than the specific social
and geo-economic structure that both enabled and shaped the form in
which 'Western IR' has been materialised since 1919. As a result of this
idealist critique, it is widely recognised that 'cultural
representation' (Acharya, 2014) is indeed the deep structural problem of
the IR discipline rather than the material historical pillars and
infrastructure that enabled its emergence. The logical consequence of
this has been the mainstream approach that understands 'non-Western IR
thought' as the theory produced in non-western societies, which are in
opposition to the conventional geography of an eternal 'West'. Hence the
apparent importance of Confucianism, Hinduism or political Islam as
'non-Western' ontological sources in the new theoretical formulations.
[The activation of such cultural imaginaries as ontological foundations
from 'non-Western' societies]{.underline} in the context of the
production of 'non-Western IR theory' [is conceived as the logical step
towards a more pluralistic and 'cultural' egalitarian
discipline]{.underline}. [It is worth clarifying that I am not arguing
against cultural diversity. Cultural diversity is the very foundation of
humanity. On the contrary]{.underline}, I argue that [it is important to
critically engage with the very enterprise of 'non-Western IR theory' in
its current disciplinary form]{.underline}. Despite the respectable
efforts to turn the IR discipline into a more pluralistic field,
[critical scholars have taken for granted the essentialist notion of
'non-Western IR theory', uncritically assuming that such theory is only
produced in non-Western societies in a binary contrast to that of
conventional IR]{.underline}. [This not only reifies 'the West' as an
eternal and fixed entity but also **orientalises the
'non-West'**]{.underline}. For this reason, this article seeks to answer
the following question: what constitutes 'non-Western IR theory'.

To properly analyse the production of 'non-Western IR theory', we first
need to sketch out what we mean by 'the West' and its relationship with
the emergence of the IR discipline. In the next section, following the
work of Kees van der Pijl, I will define the 'West' as what he describes
as the 'Lockean Heartland'. The 'Lockean heartland' and the origins of
the IR discipline In his work titled The Discipline of Western
Supremacy. Modes of Foreign Relations and political economy, volume III,
the critical scholar Kees van der Pijl (2014) attributed the origins of
the IR discipline to the imperial pulses of what he describes as the
'Lockean heartland' (1998, 2006, 2007, 2014). According to Van der Pijl
(2006, p.13), 'the heartland is therefore best understood not as some
massive central island but as a networked social and geo-economic
structure comprising a number of (originally English speaking) states
and a regulatory infrastructure. Expansion occurs on two dimensions: one
of capital, to global proportions; and the other of the West, which by
definition has a more limited reach. In their combined advance across
the globe, the two progress in tandem was a way of live, a culture, and
a politics, with their means of coercion complementing discipline'. Its
Lockean nature stemmed from the specific legal culture which was
epitomised by Locke's Two Treatises of Government that took a
transnational form after the immigration from the British Isles to North
America and the settle colonialism that followed thereafter. Such
state/complex was sealed in the British Isles after the Glorious
Revolution in 1688. According to Van der Pijl (2006, p.8), 'the Lockean
state, governed by a constitutional monarch controlled by a parliament,
is the true bourgeois political formation; a state that 'serves' a
largely self-regulating, 'civil' society by protecting private property
at home and abroad'. This last point is crucial because it was the main
ontological source of the idealist IR theory produced in the 'Lockean
heartland' at the beginning of the 20th century. In parallel, during the
17th century, the expansion of the heartland and the Protestant
Reformation mounted geopolitical pressures on other contender states
such as catholic France. To not be dispossessed and 'resist
peripheralization by the Lockean heartland' (Van der Pijl 1998, p.78)
and catch-up with it, France was forced to develop a strong state. The
specific form of the new French state was described by Van der Pijl
(1998, p.79) as the 'prototype of the Hobbesian contender state'. Such
Hobbesian state/complex was characterised by 'the paramountcy of the
state as the institution driving forward the social formation and
pre-emptively shaping, by action, sometimes revolution from above, the
social institutions which have evolved 'organically, if not necessarily
autonomously, in the heartland' (Van der Pijl 1998, p.80). In such
state/complex, society is completely confiscated in favour of the social
and economic development of the state. As I will demonstrate later on,
this point is crucial to understand the production of 'non-Western IR
theory'. As Van der Pijl (1998, p.83; 2006, p.1) argues, the structure
of the 'Lockean heartland' vis-a-vis contender states has been the main
structural divide of world politics since the European Enlightenment
until the present. The evolution of international affairs has been
characterised by the expansion of the 'Lockean heartland' and the (semi
or full) integration of several contender states such as France,
Prussia, Japan, the Soviet Union, China to its expansionist network.
Against this backdrop, the origins of the IR discipline in 1919 was
marked by the willingness of the Anglo-American ruling elites of the
heartland via education institutions to produce academic knowledge to
legitimise and guide their imperial expansion. For this reason, as
Schmidt argues in (Van der Pijl 2014, p. viii) 'the academic discipline
is marked by British, and especially, American parochialism'. As we have
seen since its origins, the evolution of IR has gone hand in hand with
the imperial project of the Liberal West after the First World War. Due
to the historical evolution of the 'Lockean heartland' and its
dialectical relation with other contender states, the production of
international thought in its core was crystallised in an idealist form.
As Walker (1993, p.42) points out, 'if it is necessary to identify a
tradition of international relations theory, then the most appropriate
candidate is not 'realism' but 'idealism'. As Van der Pijl argues (2014,
p.ix), 'English-speaking social thought, which today dominates academic
life the world over, remains locked into the antinomy between
(materialist) empiricism and (religious-idealist) moral judgement.
Contender states and 'non-Western IR theory' With this in mind, I argue
that, paradoxically, the current production of mainstream 'non-Western
IR theory' (Cho, 2013; Qin, 2018; Shahi, 2019; Shih et al., 2019; Yan,
2019; Zhao, 2019) has been informed by the antinomy between
(materialist) empiricism and (religious-idealist) moral judgement, which
is the main characteristic of the 'English-speaking social thought' and
not that of other external societies to the Lockean heartland. In this
vein, despite the influences of Daoism and Confucianism in their
theoretical propositions, both Qin's constructivist relational theory
(2018) and Yan's moral realism (2019) are a case in point. The existence
of such persistent antinomy explains why the production of 'non-Western
IR theory' has been materialised in its current form and its unable to
transcend the logics imbued by the imperial origins of the discipline.
On the contrary, to overcome the 'trap of diversity' in the field of IR,
I propose an alternative path to conceive the development of
'non-Western IR theory'. Against culturalist approaches, I argue that
'non-Western IR thought' should be better understood as the knowledge
informed by the legacy of the structural experience of several
historical contender states since the 18th century. Put it differently,
the production of 'non-Western IR thought', rather than being a product
of a reified and sealed cultural background, is the logical consequence
of the knowledge that emerges from a specific structural position of a
given society within the wider historical structure of the 'Lockean
heartland' vis-a-vis contender states. In this vein, the distinctiveness
of the production of international knowledge in the 'non-West' is not
solely manifested by a cultural divergence but a structural one. In this
light, the primacy of the state over society, which is one of the main
characteristics of the contender states experience, is perhaps one of
the fundamental ontological foundations that has shaped the production
of 'non-Western IR Theory' since the 18th century. For this reason, in
addition to the 'Global IR' and the 'national schools of IR', the
international thought produced in contender states such as 18th century
France, Prussia, imperial Japan or the Soviet Union could also be
described as being produced in a non-Western setting. For instance,
following my argument, ontologically speaking, Prussian political
realism which is always regarded as the quintessential IR theory of the
'universal' West, has more in common with the Qin's Confucian relational
IR project (Qin, 2018) than with Anglo-Saxon liberalism. Both
theoretical projects are shaped by the same ontological premise of the
primacy of the state over society. For this reason, in the context of
the production of IR theory in China, the reactivation of Confucianism
as an ontological source to build the 'Chinese school of IR' is not a
solely consequence of its eternal existence within the Chinese
civilization but also due its political meaning within the wider
structural position of China. Put it differently, Confucianism is indeed
a political tradition that gives primacy of the state over society and
can rationalize best the structural contender posture of contemporary
China. This crucial structural ontological foundation that shapes the
production of 'non-Western IR theory' is one of the elements that has
been obscured by the dominant essentialist approaches that exist within
the discipline of IR. During the past decade, the field has tended to
emphasise the ontological value of 'cultural otherness' rather than the
existence of universal structural elements that are reproduced in
different cultural settings due to the geopolitical pressures of the
'Lockean heartland'. The obscuration of this crucial point not only has
to do with the internal evolution of the IR discipline in the
Anglo-American academia and its postmodern drift, but also with the
neoliberal forces that has shaped the discipline since the 1980s.
Davenport (2019, p.535) argues that these 'debates \[the Third Debate\]
should be understood, in both its timing and its substance, as a
phenomenon of neoliberal globalization: it was the reflection into
disciplinary IR of the enormous transformations through with so many of
the structures and hierarchies that had characterized the modern age
were disintegrated'. It is worth mentioning that I am not dismissing the
importance of culture in the process of production of IR theory.
Cultural multiplicity plays a fundamental role in shaping theoretical
knowledge and the diverse cosmovisions that enable communities to make
sense of the world. Nonetheless, with the alternative path that I have
outlined above, I attempt to denaturalise the deep-seated interpretation
of the problematic dichotomy between 'Western IR theory' vs 'non-Western
IR theory' which is reproduced in most of the mainstream literature on
'non-Western IR theory'.

Conclusion

This article has argued that the uncritical engagement with 'cultural
diversity' in the discipline of IR, which has been epitomised by the
development of 'non-Western IR theory', has not succeeded in
transcending the 'imperial' or 'Western' origins of the discipline. On
the contrary, [the interpretation of the production of non-Western
International thought as the knowledge produced by societies beyond the
territories of the West has reinforced new forms of
essentialism]{.underline}. This is what I have described as 'the trap of
diversity' in IR. For this reason, [the form in which 'non-Western IR
theory' has materialised should be understood as a form of disciplinary
'identity politics', a struggle for the representation of]{.underline}
abstract and [reified cultural entities, rather than as a real
theoretical challenge to question its imperial foundations and the
material infrastructure that enabled that specific production of
knowledge]{.underline}. In other words, I maintain that **[these
approaches are a disciplinary 'dead-end']{.underline}**.

There appears to be lot of disagreement in moral philosophy. Whether
these many apparent disagreements are deep and irresolvable, I believe
there is at least one thing it is reasonable to agree on right now,
[[whatever]{.underline}]{.mark} general [**moral [view]{.mark}** [we
adopt]{.mark}]{.underline}: that [it is very [important to
reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk]{.mark} that
[all]{.mark}]{.underline} intelligent [[beings]{.mark} on this planet
are [eliminated by]{.mark} an **enormous
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} a [nuclear
war]{.underline}. How we might in fact try to reduce such existential
risks is discussed elsewhere. My claim here is only that we --- whether
we're [[consequentialists]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[deontologists]{.underline}]{.mark}, or **[virtue
[ethicists]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- should [[all
agree]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we should try to save the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}.

According to [[consequentialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, we [should
[maximize]{.mark} the [good]{.mark}]{.underline}, where this is taken to
be the goodness, [[from]{.mark} an **[impartial
perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of outcomes. Clearly one thing that
makes an outcome good is that the people in it are doing well. There is
little disagreement here. [If]{.underline} the [happiness or well-being
of]{.underline} possible future [people is]{.underline} just as
[important]{.underline} as that of people who already exist, and if they
would have good lives, it is [not hard to see how reducing existential
risk is easily the **most important** thing]{.underline} in the whole
world. This is for the familiar reason that there are so many people who
could exist in the future --- there are trillions upon trillions... upon
trillions.

There are so many possible future people that reducing existential risk
is arguably the most important thing in the world, even if the
well-being of these possible people were given only 0.001% as much
weight as that of existing people. Even on a wholly person-affecting
view --- according to which there's nothing (apart from effects on
existing people) to be said in favor of creating happy people --- the
case for reducing existential risk is very strong. As noted in this
seminal paper, this case is strengthened by the fact that there's a good
chance that many existing people will, with the aid of life-extension
technology, live very long and very high quality lives.

You might think what I have just argued applies to consequentialists
only. There is a tendency to assume that, if an argument appeals to
consequentialist considerations (the goodness of outcomes), it is
irrelevant to non-consequentialists. But that is a huge mistake.
[[Non-consequentialism]{.underline}]{.mark} is the
[[view]{.underline}]{.mark} that [there's [more]{.mark} that
**determines rightness** [than]{.mark}]{.underline} the goodness of
consequences or [[outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}; it is [[not]{.mark} the
view]{.underline} that [[the latter don't matter]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Even John Rawls wrote, "[All ethical doctrines]{.underline} worth our
attention [take consequences into account in judging
**rightness**]{.underline}. One which did not would simply be
irrational, crazy." Minimally plausible versions of [deontology
and]{.underline} virtue [[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} must be
[[concerned]{.underline}]{.mark} in part [[with
promoting]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[good]{.underline}]{.mark}, [from an
**impartial** point of view]{.underline}. They'd thus [imply **very
strong reasons** to reduce existential risk]{.underline}, at least when
this doesn't significantly involve doing harm to others or damaging
one's character.

What's even more surprising, perhaps, is that even if our own good (or
that of those near and dear to us) has much greater weight than goodness
from the impartial "point of view of the universe," indeed even if the
latter is entirely morally irrelevant, we may nonetheless have very
strong reasons to reduce existential risk. Even egoism, the view that
each agent should maximize ~~her~~ \[their\] own good, might imply
strong reasons to reduce existential risk. It will depend, among other
things, on what one's own good consists in. If well-being consisted in
pleasure only, it is somewhat harder to argue that egoism would imply
strong reasons to reduce existential risk --- perhaps we could argue
that one would maximize her expected hedonic well-being by funding life
extension technology or by having herself cryogenically frozen at the
time of her bodily death as well as giving money to reduce existential
risk (so that there is a world for her to live in!). I am not sure,
however, how strong the reasons to do this would be. But views which
imply that, if I don't care about other people, I have no or very little
reason to help them are not even minimally plausible views (in addition
to hedonistic egoism, I here have in mind views that imply that one has
no reason to perform an act unless one actually desires to do that act).

To be minimally plausible, egoism will need to be paired with a more
sophisticated account of well-being. To see this, it is enough to
consider, as Plato did, the possibility of a ring of invisibility ---
suppose that, while wearing it, Ayn could derive some pleasure by
helping the poor, but instead could derive just a bit more by severely
harming them. Hedonistic egoism would absurdly imply she should do the
latter. To avoid this implication, egoists would need to build something
like the meaningfulness of a life into well-being, in some robust way,
where this would to a significant extent be a function of
other-regarding concerns (see chapter 12 of this classic intro to
ethics). But once these elements are included, we can (roughly, as
above) argue that this sort of egoism will imply strong reasons to
reduce existential risk. Add to all of this Samuel Scheffler's recent
intriguing arguments (quick podcast version available here) that most of
what makes our lives go well would be undermined if there were no future
generations of intelligent persons. On his view, my life would contain
vastly less well-being if (say) a year after my death the world came to
an end. So obviously if Scheffler were right I'd have very strong reason
to reduce existential risk.

We should also take into account [[moral
uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}. What is it reasonable for one to do,
when one is uncertain not (only) about the empirical facts, but also
about the moral facts? I've just argued that there's agreement among
minimally plausible ethical views that we have strong reason to reduce
existential risk --- not only consequentialists, but also deontologists,
virtue ethicists, and sophisticated egoists should agree. But even
[[those]{.underline}]{.mark} (hedonistic egoists) [[who **disagree**
should have]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[significant]{.underline}]{.mark}
level of [[confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} that they are mistaken, and
that one of the above views is correct. [Even if]{.underline} they were
[90% sure]{.underline} that [their view is the correct one]{.underline}
(and 10% sure that one of these other ones is correct), [they would
have]{.underline} pretty [strong reason]{.underline}, from the
standpoint of moral uncertainty, [to reduce existential
risk]{.underline}. Perhaps most disturbingly still, [[even if we are
**only 1% sure**]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[well-being]{.mark}
of]{.underline} possible future [people [matters]{.mark}]{.underline},
it is at least arguable that, from the standpoint of moral uncertainty,
[[reducing]{.mark} [existential risk is the **most important**]{.mark}
thing in the world]{.underline}. Again, this is largely for the reason
that there are so many people who could exist in the future --- there
are trillions upon trillions... upon trillions. (For more on this and
other related issues, see this excellent dissertation).

**Scarry 19**, PhD, Professor of English at Harvard (Elaine Scarry,
2019, Interview, Representations, 146.1) \*language edited --- brackets

RA: At the Buffalo conference on pain, you gave a paper that built on
some of the insights of your then most recent book, Thermonuclear
Monarchy. 1 In the book, you demonstrate the incompatibility of
democracy and nuclear arms at least in part on the grounds that, by the
nature of their deployment, nuclear arms make it impossible for the
populace to consent to their use. In your talk, you made a different but
related claim that focused on the relative silence of the population
regarding nuclear arms in the post-Cold War era. You were concerned, in
particular, with the difficulties of imagining the consequences of
nuclear war. I wonder if you could expand on this second point: [why it
is so hard to think about **[nuclear war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} ES: The
two points are deeply related. [The architecture]{.underline} of nuclear
arms [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the population **be
eliminated from the decision about**]{.underline}]{.mark} going to
[**[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It also requires that Congress be
eliminated from the decision about going to war---just because [the
nature of the **[tech]{.mark}**nology requires a tiny number of people
to do the launch. [The result]{.mark}]{.underline} of that architecture
[[is that people]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually, over seven decades,
[[have internalized]{.mark} the fact [that they're **worthless** when it
comes to the need to defend the country]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
carry out acts of mutual aid toward one another. We now simply abandon
the right of self-defense and the right of mutual aid and give unlimited
injuring power to the executive branch of government and fall silent.
RA: How much responsibility, how much blame, does one give to the
population for remaining silent? ES: That has always been a question.
Gandhi said, ''You can wake a man who's asleep, but you can't wake a man
who's pretending to be asleep.'' His statement marks a fork in the road.
If the population has been anesthetized and is genuinely asleep, then
they are morally innocent (even if infantilized and terribly reduced as
moral agents). [If]{.underline} instead [the population is pretending to
be asleep, [we are]{.mark} **morally [culpable]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
the population is [**[complicit with the genocide]{.mark}**
that's]{.underline} standing in the wings [**[waiting to
happen]{.mark}**.]{.underline} During my lecture and in many years of
working on disarmament, I stressed the first path and tried to outline
why waking up is difficult. In recent months, I've moved closer to the
position that your question identifies, the responsibility of the
population. I feel the force of Martin Luther King's statement,
''**[There comes a time when silence is betrayal]{.underline}**.'' I'm
almost at the point of believing that [[there is]{.mark} a wanton
[refusal to \[recognize\]]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~see~~ [the **imminent
[peril]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a refusal [[to]{.mark}
understand]{.underline} not just [that [we have a **responsibility to
reverse it**]{.mark},]{.underline} to dismantle it, but that **[we have
the ability to do so]{.underline}**, and that [[if we don't, **it is
going to happen**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I don't know if it's going to
happen this year. Or whether it's going to happen this century. But it's
almost inconceivable that it isn't going to happen. RA: Why is it that
people have such a hard time understanding this? If you allow that
people might honestly and ardently be trying to understand, what is it
that is getting in the way? ES: Four or five answers come to mind.
First, [[people]{.mark} often [lack]{.mark} key [pieces of
information]{.mark}.]{.underline} If you ask someone in this country
which nations have nuclear weapons, they are likely to say Iraq (which
has none), Iran (which has none), or North Korea (which has fewer than
60; leading experts say fewer than 20). The United States has 6,500. The
United States and Russia together own 93 percent of the world arsenal:
the other 7 percent is owned by the other seven nuclear states---in
order of numerical possession, France, China, the United Kingdom,
Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea (see fig. 1). An equally
profound misconception held by US citizens is the belief that our
nuclear architecture is for ''defense'' and ''retaliation.'' In fact we
have had a ''presidential first-use'' policy for the whole nuclear age.
The profound obscenity of that arrangement, which has only begun to be
glimpsed with the current president, has been an equally grave moral
wrong from day one. Second, [even [when]{.mark}]{.underline} American
~~citizens~~ \[[[denizens]{.underline}]{.mark}\] and residents
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[information, the outcome is
derealized by its **being future**]{.underline}]{.mark}---that is, [[the
unreality something has by having not yet happened is conflated with the
unreality something might have by being]{.mark} **merely
[imaginary]{.mark}**.]{.underline} People, it's true, are uninformed.
But once they become informed, even then the flash of insight fades from
their eyes after about ten minutes. RA: Why do you think that is? ES:
Because **[[they think ''future'' equals
''unreal.'']{.underline}]{.mark}** But we need to stop and understand
what we mean by ''future.'' [[If it takes 10,000 steps to put]{.mark} a
[nuclear architecture **in**]{.mark}to place, [9,999 steps have]{.mark}
already [been completed]{.mark}:]{.underline} we know how to split the
atom; we know how to provide enriched uranium; we know how to deliver
the bomb; we've completed not only the theoretical steps but the
materialization steps: we've made the bombs; we've completed the
delivery systems---Ohio-class submarines, the land-based ICBMs, and
airdelivery B-2s and B-52s. Unlike in China and India, the weapons in
the United States are already ''mated'' to the delivery systems; they
are on alert; specific weapons have been assigned to specific cities in
the countries of present enemies and, yes, even potential enemies. One
step remains: the order to launch. So 9,999 steps are present and
accounted for; one remains undone. While the 9,999 steps took vast
amounts of time and resources, the last one is designed to be carried
out in minutes. The word ''future'' does not apply to the 9,999 steps,
only to the last one. [[When people decline to address]{.mark} the
[nuclear peril on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[grounds that it is]{.mark}
an ''[unreal'']{.mark} worry]{.underline} because ''following the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki it hasn't yet happened,'' [[they
are]{.mark} **unknowingly [allying themselves
with]{.mark}**]{.underline} the position that [our]{.underline} own
Department of State and [**[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f
**[D]{.mark}**efense]{.underline} took in 1995. At that time,
seventy-eight countries asked the International Court of Justice to
declare the possession, threat of use, and use of nuclear weapons
illegal on the basis of the humanitarian and environmental instruments
such as the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide, the Geneva Protocols, the Declaration of Saint Petersburg,
the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Rio
Declaration on Environment and Poverty, and many others. Though the
United States worked to invalidate the application of these protocols to
our nuclear weapons one at a time, an argument they used over and over
was that the firing of the weapons was ''future,'' hence
''hypothetical,'' hence ''suppositional''---this despite the billions of
dollars that each year go into polishing and oiling the architecture of
earth's destruction to keep it in a present-tense state of constant
readiness. RA: At the conference you also spoke about the problem of
''statistical compassion.'' ES: Let's call that the third reason why the
population is asleep. [American indifference to our own genocidal
nuclear architecture comes from the **constraints on compassion** when
**large numbers** of people \[become\]]{.underline} ~~stand~~ [to be
injured]{.underline}. Public health [physicians distinguish between
narrative compassion]{.underline} (where one or two or three people are
at risk) [and **statistical compassion**]{.underline} (where thousands
or millions are at risk).2 [We're fairly good at the first]{.underline},
and have many occasions to strengthen our capacity through daily acts of
friendship and from reading literature. [We're terrible at the
second]{.underline}, and have almost no training in strengthening our
feeble abilities in this region. The nuclear peril of course entails the
second: recent work on nuclear winter by Alan Robock and his colleagues
shows that [[if]{.mark} even [a small fraction of the]{.mark} current
[world arsenal is fired]{.mark}]{.underline} (one one-hundredth of one
percent of the total available blast power), [[forty-four million people
will be casualties]{.mark} on the first afternoon [and one billion in
the weeks following. The]{.mark} small [shrug people make when the
subject of nuclear weapons comes up]{.mark}]{.underline}---the little
lift and fall of the shoulders---[[means they have]{.mark} just [run
a]{.mark} quick [check on]{.mark} their interior brain-and-soul
[equipment and can report: nope, **nothing in there in**]{.mark} **the
way of [statistical compassion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} RA: Narrative
compassion and statistical compassion seem to take place in widely
separate spheres. How then do you see them coming into conflict with
each other? ES: For me, a frightening example occurred in the Bulletin
of Atomic Scientists, the wholly admirable body that sets the Doomsday
Clock (now at two minutes to midnight) and that works round the clock to
educate the people of the United States and the world about the hazards
of nuclear weapons. Yet in commemorating the seventieth anniversary of
the Nagasaki bombing in August of 2015, they published a historically
factual narrative about the pilots of the plane delivering the atom bomb
to Nagasaki, how many things went wrong and had to be repaired
midflight. The lead-in read, ''A typhoon was coming, the fuel pump
failed, they had to switch planes, things were wired incorrectly, they
missed their rendezvous, they couldn't see the primary target, they ran
out of gas on the way home, and they had to crash-land.'' But the worst
part was when ''the Fat Man atomic bomb started to arm itself,
mid-flight.''3 The story, narrated in edge-ofyour-seat suspense, is an
example of narrative compassion utterly preempting the possibility of
statistical compassion: the crew might die, but if they had in fact died
over the Pacific, tens of thousands of persons would not have been
burned into nonexistence that day. RA: Your emphasis at the conference
was on the nature of physical pain itself. ES: Yes, that was my central
subject. In terms of our conversation now, we can say that a fourth and
fifth reason for [indifference arise from the difficulty of
**comprehending pain**]{.underline}, whether it takes place in one
person's body or in the bodies of millions, and whether it occurs in the
past, present, or future. (But if I were listing the reasons in the
order of importance, these two would be near the top.) Once we exhaust a
small handful of adjectives for physical pain, two (and almost only two)
metaphors arise: the metaphor of the weapon (one may say it feels as
though a knife is sticking in my shoulder blade even if it isn't); and
that of body damage (one may say it feels as though my elbow has snapped
in two, even if it hasn't). The Body in Pain concentrates on problems
arising from the first; a later essay (''Among Schoolchildren'')
concentrates on the second.4 Both metaphors, if carefully controlled,
can help us understand the felt experience of another person's pain; but
both are highly volatile and can lead us far away from understanding. An
example of the benign or genuinely expressive potential is provided by
findings in neuroscience that we have mirror neurons that help us
recognize another person's physical pain. When you look at the actual
experiments that were done, however, you see that the test subject is
asked not to listen to a sufferer's report of pain but to observe, for
example, a pin being stuck into someone's hand or the administration of
a small electric shock. The experiments show not our comprehension of
another person's pain but our recognition of the aversivenes of being
subjected to a weapon---often closely related to but by no means
identical with physical pain. [The very fact that a weapon can be
separated from the site of the injury means that the attributes of pain
can be lifted away from the sufferer and conferred on the agents
inflicting the harm, so now it is not the pain that is world destroying
but the inflictor of the pain]{.underline}. There are many examples of
this in the case of nuclear weapons. For example, the mushroom cloud is
often regarded as ''awesome,'' some even say ''sublime.'' But the
hibakasha, the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, say, ''We saw no
mushroom cloud.'' A mushroom cloud is what you see if you're an observer
far away, seated high in the sky in the airplane that dropped the
weapon, or standing on the ground scores of miles beyond the radius of
the harm. Like any sensible mortal, I admire J. Robert Oppenheimer, but
his endlessly quoted statement following the Trinity test, ''I
remembered the line from the Hindu scripture \...I am become Death, the
destroyer of worlds,'' allows the scale of the injury to be transferred
across the weapon and conferred on the agents, who now perceive
themselves as magnificent, thrilling, almighty in their power.
Oppenheimer even prefaces the quotation by saying that Vishnu here takes
on a multi-armed form ''to impress'' the prince. The name he chose for
the test, ''Trinity,'' shows this same fabrication of godlikeness. What
if instead Oppenheimer had said, ''I remembered the goddess Guanyin
whose name means 'The one who perceives the sounds of the world' and the
sounds I heard were excruciating cries, unbearable shrieks of tens of
thousands scalded together in an instant of molten flesh.'' The first
statement is a fiction: Oppenheimer is neither a multi-armed god nor a
three-personed god; the second statement (could we hear Guanyin) is
accurate; if we could internalize and practice the second statement, we
would disarm immediately. [The image of the nuclear weapon,]{.underline}
which might help make visible the pain and suffering it will bring
about, [instead captures the gigantic scale of the suffering, only to
lift that ''giganticism'' away from the site of suffering altogether and
confer it on the human agents]{.underline}---ordinary men, small in
stature and in number, but who now appear gigantic. [Insofar as any
shred of ''suffering'' still remains visible, we believe it is the
suffering of the nowgigantic human agent who is in mighty peril. Thus
[the nation spends billions]{.mark} of dollars [on a presidential
fallout shelter while convincing the public]{.mark} that fallout
[shelters]{.mark} for the population [are
ridiculous]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Thinking in an Emergency, and again
in Thermonuclear Monarchy, I contrast the Swiss shelter system---Swiss
law requires that every house have a fallout shelter;5 the law was
reaffirmed in a 2003 referendum that had an 80 percent turnout at the
polls---with the staggering constructions that have been made in the
United States for\... the people? no---for the president and those close
to him, a shelter inside a mountain, with buildings and a lake that is,
according to observers, large enough for waterskiing. One country,
[Switzerland, believes in what the Swiss call ''equality of survival'';
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} other country, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, **[believes]{.mark} that [only the agents of
nuclear \[disaster\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} ~~holocaust~~
[**[deserve]{.mark} the chance for [survival]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Much more detail on the multiple presidential fallout shelters is
described by Garrett M. Graff in a recent book, Raven Rock: The Story of
the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself---While the Rest of Us
Die. The nuclear architecture requires that either the weapon be
invisible (buried in a submarine or buried in a cornfield, like the 450
ICBMs) or, when it is visible, it must become the path across which the
magnificent prowess of the human agent is seen---he's so thrilling, so
important, so vulnerable; here, please, take my tax money, use all of it
to protect the man who will launch our nuclear missiles. What should
bring us to our knees in sorrow and shame instead brings about a dutiful
salute to the thermonuclear monarch. If one thinks fallout shelters for
the population are ridiculous (ignoring the fact that the medically
sophisticated Swiss have data showing otherwise), then it is informative
to contrast the money lavished on our nuclear architecture with ordinary
forms of safety structures for the population like bridges, dams, roads,
levees. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in their 2017 report on
infrastructure, gave our bridges a ''Cþ'' (56,000 are ''structurally
deficient''), our dams a ''D'' (2000 have a ''high-hazard potential''),
our levees a ''D'' (\$80 billion is needed for structural repair), and
our roads a ''D'' (one out of every five miles of highway pavement is
''in poor condition'').6 Might Americans be given a choice on whether
they want their taxes spent on infrastructure or---as is currently the
case---on nuclear weapons and presidential fallout shelters? Or has ''no
taxation without representation'' disappeared along with all our other
basic democratic principles?(112-118) RA: That all follows from the
instability of the weapon; what about the second field of
representation, body damage? ES: The phenomenon of body damage is like
the image of the weapon but works in a much different way---almost the
opposite. Whereas the problem of the weapon is its very separability
from the body (and the way to make it benign is to retether it to its
referent in the body), the problem of body damage is that it overlaps,
overrides, and eclipses the personhood of the one underneath the damage.
Either one looks away, or, if one looks, one recoils. Visual artists and
writers---from Peter Paul Rubens and Andrea Mantegna in the Renaissance
to fin de sie\`cle artists Ka¨the Kollwitz, Aubrey Beardsley, Edvard
Munch, Joris-Karl Huysmans, to twentieth-century Guatemalan writer
Miguel Asturias---all solve this problem by finding a way to double the
location, so that personhood remains intact in our perceptual field even
if the human body is at that moment being obscenely shredded. 118
Representations If you visit the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, you will
probably find yourself, as I did, surrounded by young schoolchildren,
who look with courage on the visages of those who were incompletely
incinerated in the bombing of that city (see figs. 2, 3, and 4). In the
United States, few adults face up to the faces of those harmed there. In
February of 2016, the Central Square Library in Cambridge agreed to let
me---and Joseph Gerson, an American Friends Service colleague---do a
monthlong program on the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with weekly
lectures and an exhibit of books, drawings, and photographs. The morning
after we put up the exhibit, we found all the photographs of injuries
had been removed. The effort to put on an exhibit about Hiroshima and
Nagasaki at the Smithsonian Institution in 1994 led to such controversy
that it had to be canceled---with one exception: the Enola Gay (the
plane that delivered the bomb) was put on display. Here we circle back
to the phenomenon of the weapon being perceptually severed from the site
of the pain. It's in part because of museums like those in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki that so many people in the Japanese population are passionately
in support of nuclear disarmament. In preparation for a disarmament
demonstration in New York, Cambridge and Boston activists (I include
myself) worked for months to bring supporters to the march: after
endless work, approximately one hundred did so. But one thousand
Japanese men and women arrived that morning in New York; they carried a
petition signed by six million of their countrymen, who collectively
paid for the travel costs of the thousand who came. RA: Can you provide
any examples of authors who ''double the location,'' as you have just
described, ''so that personhood remains intact'' while the ''human body
is being \...shredded''? ES: Miguel A´ngel Asturias's Men of Maize
begins with a heroic Indian in Guatemala, who ordinarily protects his
people no matter what; he is able to do so, in part, because he has a
level of sensory acuity that approaches genius. He knows the scent of
every flower; he can discern the whole recipe of scents present in the
forest in any given moment. The European colonizers can commit a
slaughter of his people only if they can divert this heroic leader; and
the only way to divert him is to subject him to horrible, scalding,
obscene pain. Asturias must convey to us the felt experience of pain,
the turning of the body inside out, and he chooses to do this through
the associated phenomenon of body damage; but in order to do so without
eclipsing the personhood of Gaspar Il´om, he decouples the body damage
from the hero. The book opens with a dog, which the invaders have used
as a test case for their pain-inducing poison laced with glass. The dog,
in excruciating pain, zooms hysterically through the village square,
covered with open sores, his penis erect, howling in a way that is
aversive to everyone who hears and sees. This horrible scene conveys the
obscenity of pain, the obscenity of bodily damage. By obscenity, I mean
interior substances in the body which come before us without our
consent, come before us before we are mentally prepared to comprehend
what we are seeing. But the story separates this bodily desecration from
the person, for now, having seen the dog, we need only be told that
Gaspar Il´om has drunk this glass-laced poison to understand why he
abandons his post, submerges himself in the lake, drinks all its waters,
and eventually comes out. He has survived. But during the moments when
he disappeared below the surface of the water, his people have been
slain. RA: I wonder how you think about the role of the visual in that
context. Do you think of the visual as akin to a language? ES: In visual
art one can see the same phenomenon taking place, as when Ka¨the
Kollwitz refuses to let an injured victim be portrayed as what Shelley
called ''a monstrous lump of ruin.'' In her 1900 etching and aquatint
The Downtrodden, she pushes the wounds on the body just beyond the
body's edge onto a linen sheet on which the person is lying. These
mouthlike, liplike structures of open wounds are there but are not
permitted to compromise figure 4. Photographs of survivors of the atomic
bomb in the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum. An Interview with Elaine Scarry
121 our recognition of the sufferer's personhood. Even somebody like
Aubrey Beardsley, in one of his posters, puts the wound in a tree rather
than on the body of the woman. And yet the woman has attributes that
make the viewer see the analogy, just like Marty South and the trees in
your account of Hardy's The Woodlanders \[Scarry is referring to Rachel
Ablow's account in Victorian Pain\]. Her posture, for example, is
exaggeratedly erect and treelike. She wears a high-waisted skirt that is
made to be a visual analogy with the tree. But our perception of her
personhood remains uninterrupted. RA: One issue you have raised recently
is the particular difficulty of thinking about the specific kinds of
injuries caused by nuclear war, namely burns. There was a striking
moment in your talk when you discussed the protocols used in burn units
to help doctors and nurses in looking at burn victims. It seems so
intuitively right that caretakers would have difficulty looking at these
patients. It seems to suggest something about the limits on the
imagination in terms of suffering. I'm wondering what it is about burns
that makes it so hard to imagine the suffering they entail. Is it about
the skin as the site of humanity? Is it about the face? ES: It is the
visage. Without preparation and help, when we see the complete
mutilation of the body, especially the face, we mistakenly feel we are
seeing the mutilation of personhood. The ''rule of nines'' is devised to
enable rescue workers to look at a gravely burned person and (instead of
having their own minds shut down in sorrow and confusion and revulsion)
to assess instantly the gravity of the injury, start appropriate
treatment, and report the scale of the injury to the hospital awaiting
the person's arrival. Each part of the body is assigned an
easy-to-remember number that is a multiple of nine (see fig. 5).
Counting forms a key part in many forms of emergency rescue, and this is
one instance. The numbers, once totaled, tell the rescuer the next step,
such as whether to insert an IV for fluid resuscitation. The need to
train the perceptions of those who hope to help those who are burned is
also illustrated by a procedure called ''staying.'' During the years
when I was part of a research group on suffering at the Hastings Center
for Ethics, I heard a lecture by a physician-nurse who worked in a burn
unit. She mentioned that because of the difficulty oflooking at a
severely burned person, nurses assigned to burn units may begin to avert
their eyes when speaking with a patient, decline to touch the patient,
or stand at a greater distance each day, or request a transfer after a
few days. To counteract these problems, caretakers can participate in a
class on ''staying'' where they recognize the temptation to withdraw
from the patient and practice trying to overcome that withdrawal. While
the ''rule of nines'' and ''staying'' are brilliant inventions, we
should recognize that in nuclear war there will be few rescue workers
and nurses. A study in the Netherlands of what would happen if a
terrorist brought into Rotterdam a very small 12 kg weapon (the size
used in World War II) found that of those who had not immediately
evaporated, four thousand persons would require burn beds.7 They noted
that in all of the Netherlands there are only a hundred burn beds. A
leading hospital in Boston, Mass General, has seven burn beds. The burn
beds themselves---what few there are---will disappear in a nuclear
strike. On the floor of the UK Parliament, the possession of four
Trident submarines has repeatedly been justified by the potential need
to bomb Moscow. In response, a Scottish study by John Ainslie looked at
the scale of damage that would actually take place if a nuclear missile
were launched against the Ministry of Defense building in Moscow: along
with the Ministry of Defense, four major hospitals would be destroyed
and four others subjected to fire and radiation that would make them
inoperable. Thirty-one schools would also be destroyed with at least
700,000 children slain.8 If the missile is larger, so, too, will the
disappearance of hospitals be larger. An article by Steven Starr, Lynn
Eden, and Theodore A. Postol in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists shows
that if an 800-kiloton weapon were detonated above Manhattan, the center
of the blast would be four times the temperature of the sun, and, within
''tens of minutes,'' a firestorm will cover 90 to 150 square miles.

RA: Was the artistic strategy that you just described of doubling the
location so as to protect personhood apparent in the real-world examples
you were citing, the Nagasaki children, the ''rule of nines,''
''staying''? ES: I think so. It is not accidental that the Nagasaki
Atomic Bomb Museum is itself physically beautiful in its architecture,
or that as you enter you pass lavish cascades of paper cranes, inspired
by the child Sadako Sasaki, like cherry blossoms in spring, or that you
see an inscription about Nagasaki's exceptional generosity to
outsiders---its many centuries of open trade with foreign companies, a
level of cosmopolitan hospitality not at that time found to the same
degree in other regions of Japan; you see engraved inscriptions from
Dwight D. Eisenhower and from the ''United States Strategic Bombing
Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War), July 1946'' saying unequivocally
that the atom bomb was not needed to end the war. All these elements,
and many others, keep the personhood of the city's inhabitants in view,
side-by-side with the excruciating vision of burnt faces. The ''rule of
nines'' lets one reconstruct the body out of a beneficent invention,
toylike in its simplicity. In ''staying,'' the very name of the
procedure holds the injury within the frame of sympathetic personhood.
RA: Let's return to Ghandi's forking path. You've sketched the reasons
why the US population is innocently sleeping. But what if they're
feigning sleep? ES: [I am]{.underline} sometimes [[floored by the
discrepancy between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[attention we give to
injuries]{.mark} that have happened **[when we can't do
anything]{.mark}**]{.underline} to change them [[and]{.mark} the
[attention we give to injuries that haven't yet happened when by
intervention we]{.mark} **absolutely [can prevent
them]{.mark}**.]{.underline} I don't know how to explain this.
[I]{.underline} have always [assumed]{.underline} that those [acts of
trying to talk about the pain of torture victims in the
1970s]{.underline} in my case, or the pain of people in World War II,
the Holocaust, that those acts [are meant to act as a warning to the
future. What is our motive for thinking about the **unchangeable
injuries** of the past if not to increase our ability to prevent such
injuries in the future? Yet almost incomprehensible is the distance
between the willingness to think about events from the past we can't
possibly change and the complete comfort with **feeling that future
massacres need not concern us**.]{.underline} Or worse, that one is
slightly superior to protesting a wrong: intellectually superior because
the moral wrong is an obvious moral wrong, and we only like to address
sophisticated, hard to discern moral wrongs. It might be embarrassing to
have to stand on a street corner with a sign or attend a public meeting.
[Imagine]{.underline}, though, [if we forgave the complicity with past
acts of enslavement or genocide by saying, ''People saw that it was
wrong, but they considered it too intellectually obvious, too
compromising of their dignity, to have to stand up and
protest]{.underline}.'' Or take the argument that the aspiration to
dismantle nuclear weapons is now many decades old, and we must turn to
fresh undertakings: imagine that someone tried to defend those who
tolerated slavery in 1860 because they had been hearing antislavery
sentiment since 1820 and now considered such sentiments ''stale.'' [We
would never give a ''pass'' to anyone in the past who **excused their
inattention to slavery**]{.underline} or the ~~transfer of people to
concentration camps~~ [on either of those two grounds; yet we believe
such **arguments release us from addressing weapons whose outcome is
instant genocide**.]{.underline} There are historical periods in which
people were dissuaded from protesting because dissidents were beaten
(Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate) or killed (Dietrich
Bonhoeffer in Germany). No such beatings or death threats excuse our own
silence today. RA: Staying with this point about the relative ease of
imagining pain past as opposed to pain in the future, do you attribute
that to sentimentality? It sounds so reprehensible put in those terms. I
wonder how you account for it. ES: I think you are right to worry that
[**our [attention to the past begins to look like
sentimentality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The argument is sometimes made by
academics that [sympathy is less about compassion or the desire to
ameliorate pain than it is a kind of **cultural signaling** of our moral
goodness. To me that thesis seems horrifying]{.underline}: it lets the
many who ignore past pain excuse their own inattention on the grounds
that the few who do attend to pain are only doing so to announce their
own goodness. So [I feel a strong aversion to that
argument;]{.underline} it works to reduce still further the number of
those who show any wish to help. However, if **[it turns out that
[we]{.mark} only [speak about irremediable injuries from the past
while]{.mark} a huge [architecture of massacre
\[is\]]{.mark}]{.underline}** ~~stands~~ **[[waiting]{.mark} to be
used]{.underline}**, then one has to ask oneself: why were we looking at
injuries in the distant past? Is it just sentimentality? Is it just
cultural signaling?9(124-5)

//CYang

One reason to **[trust [markets]{.mark}]{.underline}** is that [they
[are better]{.mark} at setting prices [than people. If you set prices
too high]{.mark}]{.underline}, many a [[socialist
government]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[found, citizens]{.mark} will be
**needlessly [deprived]{.mark}** [of goods. Set them too low, and there
will be excess]{.mark}ive [demand and]{.mark} **ensuing
[shortages]{.mark}**. This is true for all goods]{.underline}, including
health care and labor. And there is [**[little reason]{.mark}** to
believe]{.underline} that the [next batch of
[socialists]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington or London [[would
be]{.mark} **any [better]{.mark}** at setting prices [than their
**predecessors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [government-run health
care]{.underline} systems in Canada and European countries are [plagued
by long wait times]{.underline}. A 2018 Fraser Institute study cites a
median wait time of 19.8 weeks to see a specialist physician in Canada.
Socialists may argue that is a small price to pay for universal access,
but a [market-based approach]{.underline} can [deliver]{.underline} both
[**coverage** and **responsive** service]{.underline}. A [full
government]{.underline} takeover [isn't]{.underline} the only
[option]{.underline}, nor is it the best one.

Beyond that, markets are also good at rationing risk. Fundamentally,
socialists would like to reduce risk --- protect workers from any
personal or economywide shock. That is a noble goal, and some reduction
through better functioning safety nets is desirable. But getting rid of
all uncertainty --- as state ownership of most industries would imply
--- is a bad idea. Risk is what fuels growth. People who take more
chances tend to reap bigger rewards; that's why the top nine names on
the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans are not heirs to family
dynasties but are self-made entrepreneurs who took a leap to build new
products and created many jobs in the process.

Some leftist economists like Mariana Mazzucato [argue]{.underline} that
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} might be able to step in and [become
**laboratories for [innovation]{.mark}**. But that [would be a
**historical anomaly**]{.mark}; socialist]{.underline}-leaning
[governments]{.underline} have typically been [less innovative than
others]{.underline}. After all, [bureaucrats]{.underline} and
worker-corporate boards [have [**little incentive** to upset the
s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}]{.underline} or compete to build a better
widget. [[And]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[when government
programs]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[spurred
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [as in the]{.underline} case of the
[[internet]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[it took the **private sector** to
recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[value and create a
market]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And that brings us to a third reason to believe in markets:
productivity. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon, have looked to
today's economic problems and suggested that productivity growth --- the
engine that fueled so much of the progress of the last several decades
--- is over. In this telling, the resources, products, and systems that
underpin the world's economy are all optimized, and little further
progress is possible.

But that is hard to [square with **reality**. [Innovation]{.mark} helps
economies [do more with fewer resources]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[**increasingly [critical]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} addressing
[climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}, for example --- which is a [form
of productivity growth]{.underline}. And likewise, many of the products
and [[technologies people **rely on**]{.mark} **every day** [did not
exist]{.mark}]{.underline} a few [years ago]{.underline}. These [goods
make inaccessible services]{.underline} more [available]{.underline} and
are changing the nature of work, often for the better. Such
[[gains]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[made possible by
**capitalist**]{.mark} **systems** that encourage [invention and growing
the pie, not]{.mark}]{.underline} by [[socialist]{.mark}
systems]{.underline} that are [more [concern]{.mark}ed [with how]{.mark}
the **[existing pie is cut]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is far too soon,
in other words, to write off productivity.

[Discourse on food ethics often advocates]{.underline} the
**[anti-capitalist idea]{.underline}** [that we need **less capitalism,
less growth, and less globalization**]{.underline} if we want to make
the world a better and more equitable place, [with arguments focused
on]{.underline} applications to food, globalization, and a [just
society]{.underline}. For example, arguments for this anti-capitalist
view are at the core of some chapters in nearly every handbook and
edited volume in the rapidly expanding subdiscipline of food ethics.
None of these volumes (or any article published in this subdiscipline
broadly construed) focuses on a defense of globalized capitalism.1

More generally, [discourse on global ethics, environment, and political
theory]{.underline} in much of academia---and in society---increasingly
[features this anti-capitalist idea]{.underline} as well.2 The idea is
especially prominent in discourse surrounding the environment, climate,
and global poverty, where we face a nexus of problems of which
capitalism is a key driver, including climate change, air and water
pollution, the challenge of feeding the world, ensuring sustainable
development for the world\'s poorest, and other interrelated challenges.

[It is]{.underline} therefore [important to ask whether this
anti-capitalist idea is justified by **reason and
evidence**]{.underline} that is as strong as the degree of confidence
placed in it by activists and many commentators on food ethics, global
ethics, and political theory, more generally.

In fact, many **[experts]{.underline}** [argue that this
[anti-capitalist idea]{.mark} is **[not supported]{.mark} by reason and
argument and is actually wrong**]{.underline}. The main contribution of
this essay is to explain the structure of the leading arguments against
the anti-capitalist idea, and in favor of the opposite conclusion.
[I]{.underline} begin by [focus]{.underline}ing [on]{.underline} the
general argument in favor of [**well-regulated globalized capitalism**
as the key to a **just, flourishing, and environmentally healthy
world**. This is]{.underline} the most important of all of the arguments
in terms of its consequences for health, wellbeing, and justice, and it
is [endorsed by experts in the **empirically minded
disciplines**]{.underline} best placed to analyze the issue, [including
experts in long-run global development, human health, wellbeing,
economics, law, public policy, and other related
disciplines]{.underline}. On the basis of the arguments outlined below,
[well-regulated capitalism has been endorsed]{.underline} by recent
Democratic presidents of the United States such as Barack Obama, and [by
progressive Nobel laureates]{.underline} who have devoted their lives to
human development and more equitable societies, [as well as
by]{.underline} a wide range of [experts in government and leading
**n**]{.underline}on**[g]{.underline}**overnmental
**[o]{.underline}**rganization**[s]{.underline}**.

The goal of this essay is to make the structure and importance of these
arguments clear, and thereby highlight that discourse on global ethics
and political theory should engage carefully with them. The goal is not
to endorse them as necessarily sound and correct. The essay will begin
by examining general arguments for and against capitalism, and then turn
to implications for food, the environment, climate change, and beyond.

Arguments for and against Forms of Capitalism

The Argument against Capitalism

[Capitalism is]{.underline} often [argued to be a key driver of many of
society\'s ills: inequalities, pollution]{.underline}, land use changes,
[and incentives that cause people to live differently than in their
ideal dreams]{.underline}. Capitalism can sometimes deepen injustices.
These negative consequences are easy to see---resting, as they do, at
the center of many of society\'s greatest challenges.3

And at the same time, it is often difficult to see the positive
consequences of capitalism.4 What are the positive consequences of
allowing private interests to clear-cut forests and plant crops,
especially if those private interests are rich multinational
corporations and the forests are in poor, developing countries whose
citizens do not receive the profits from deforestation? Why give private
companies the right to exploit resources at all, since exploitation
almost always has some negative consequences such as those listed above?
These are the right questions to ask, and they highlight genuine
challenges to capitalism. And in light of these challenges, it is
reasonable to consider the possibility that perhaps a different economic
system altogether would be more equitable and beneficial to the global
population.

The Argument for Well-Regulated Capitalism

However, **[things are more complicated than the arguments above would
suggest]{.underline}**, and [the benefits of capitalism]{.underline},
especially for the world\'s poorest and most vulnerable people,
[are]{.underline} in fact myriad and **[significant]{.underline}**. In
addition, as we will see in this section, many experts argue that
**[[capitalism is not the]{.mark} fundamental [cause of]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** previously described [**[problems]{.underline}**
[but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather [an essential component of the **[best
solution]{.mark}s**]{.underline} to them [and]{.underline} of [the best
methods for promoting our goals of health, well-being, and
justice]{.underline}.

To see where the defenders of capitalism are coming from,
[consider]{.underline} an analogy involving [a response to a pandemic:
if a country administered a rushed]{.underline} and untested
[vaccine]{.underline} to its population that ended up killing people,
[we would not say that vaccines were the problem. Instead, the problem
would be the]{.underline} flawed and sloppy policies of vaccine
[implementation. Vaccines might]{.underline} easily
**[remain]{.underline}** absolutely **[essential]{.underline}** to the
correct response to such a pandemic [and could]{.underline} [also be
essential to promoting health]{.underline} and flourishing, more
generally.

[The argument is similar with capitalism]{.underline} according to the
leading mainstream arguments in favor of it: [Capitalism is an essential
part of the best society we could have]{.underline}, just like vaccines
are an essential part of the best response to a pandemic such as
COVID-19. [But]{.underline} of course both
[[cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline} and vaccines [can be [implemented
poorly]{.mark}]{.underline}, and can even do harm, especially when
combined with other incorrect policy decisions. But **[that [does not
mean]{.mark} that [we should turn against]{.mark}
them]{.underline}**---quite the opposite. [Instead, we should **embrace
them as essential**]{.underline} to the best and most just outcomes for
society, [and educate ourselves]{.underline} and others [on]{.underline}
their importance and on [how they must be **properly designed and
implemented**]{.underline} with other policies in order to best help us
all. In fact, [the argument in favor of capitalism is even more dramatic
because it claims that much more is at stake than even what is at stake
in response to a global pandemic]{.underline}---[what is at stake with
capitalism is]{.underline} nothing less than **[whether the world\'s
poorest and most vulnerable billion people will remain in conditions of
poverty and oppression]{.underline}**, or if they will instead finally
gain access to what is minimally necessary for basic health and
wellbeing and become increasingly affluent and empowered. The argument
in favor of capitalism proceeds as follows:

Premise 1. Development and the past. [Over]{.underline} the course of
[recorded]{.underline} human [history, the majority of [historical
increases in health]{.mark}, wellbeing, and justice have occurred in the
last two centuries]{.underline}, largely [as a result of]{.underline}
societies adopting or moving toward **[capitalism]{.underline}**.
[Capitalism is a relevant cause of these improvements]{.underline}, in
the sense that [they [could not have happened]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}to such a degree [if it were not for capitalism and would **not
have happened to the same degree [under any
alt]{.mark}ernative**]{.underline} noncapitalist approach to structuring
society. The argument in support of this premise relies on observed
relationships across societies and centuries between indicators of
degree of capitalism, wealth, investments in public goods, and outcomes
for health, wellbeing, and justice, together with econometric analysis
in support of the conclusion that the best explanation of these
correlations and the underlying mechanism is that large increases in
[health, wellbeing, and justice are largely driven by increasing
investments in public goods. The scale of increased wealth necessary to
maximize these investments requires **capitalism**]{.underline}. Thus,
[as capitalist societies have become dramatically wealthier]{.underline}
over the past hundred years (and wealthier than societies with
alternative systems), [this has allowed **larger investments in public
goods**,]{.underline} which simply has not been possible in a sustained
way in societies without the greater wealth that capitalism makes
possible. Important [investments in public goods include]{.underline}
investments in basic **[medical knowledge]{.underline}**, in health and
nutrition programs, [and]{.underline} in the institutional
[capacity]{.underline} and know-how [to **regulate**]{.underline}
society and [**capitalism** itself]{.underline}. As a result,
[[cap]{.mark}italism [is a]{.mark} **primary [driver]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} positive outcomes in **health and wellbeing**]{.underline}
([such as]{.underline} increased **[[life
expectancy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[lowered]{.mark} child and
maternal [mortality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[adequate calories]{.mark}
per day, **[minimized]{.mark} infectious [disease]{.mark} rates**, a
[lower]{.mark} percentage and number of people in **[poverty]{.mark}**,
and more reported **[happiness]{.mark}**]{.underline});5 [and in
**justice**]{.underline} ([such as [reduced]{.mark} deaths from
[**war**]{.mark} and homicide; [higher]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}rankings in **[human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}indices; the [[reduced]{.underline}]{.mark} prevalence of
**[[racist]{.mark}, sexist, homophobic [opinions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in surveys; [[and]{.mark} higher [literacy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}rates).6 These **[[quantifiable]{.mark} positive
[consequences]{.mark} of global capitalism]{.underline}** dramatically
[[**outweigh**]{.mark} the negative consequences]{.underline} (such as
deaths from pollution in the course of development), with the result
that [the net benefits from capitalism in terms of health, wellbeing,
and justice have been greater than they would have been under any known
noncapitalist approach]{.underline} to structuring society.7

Premise 2. Economics, ethics, and policy. [Although capitalism has often
been ill-regulated]{.underline} and therefore failed to maximize net
benefits for health, wellbeing, and justice, **[it can become
well-regulated]{.underline}** so that it maximizes these societal goals,
[by including mechanisms]{.underline} identified by economists and other
policy experts [that do the following]{.underline}:

- optimally8 **[regulate negative effects]{.underline}** such as
  pollution and monopoly power, [and invest in public goods]{.underline}
  such as education, basic healthcare, and fundamental research
  including biomedical knowledge (more generally, policies that correct
  the failures of free markets that economists have long recognized will
  arise from "externalities" in the absence of regulation);9

- [ensure equity and distributive justice]{.underline} (for example, via
  wealth redistribution);10

- [ensure basic rights]{.underline}, justice, and the rule of law
  independent of the market (for example, by an independent judiciary,
  bill of rights, property rights, and redistribution and other
  legislation to correct historical injustices due to colonialism,
  racism, and correct current and historical distortions that have
  prevented markets from being fair);11 [and]{.underline}

- [ensure that there is no alternative way of structuring society that
  is more efficient]{.underline} or better promotes the equity, justice,
  and fairness goals outlined above (by allowing free exchange given the
  regulations mentioned).12

To summarize the implication of the first two premises,
[**well-[regulated cap]{.mark}italism** [is
**essential**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} best achieving our
ethical goals]{.underline}---which is true even though capitalism has
certainly not always been well regulated historically. Society can still
do much better [and **[remove]{.mark} the large
[deficits]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}in terms of health, wellbeing,
and justice **[that exist under]{.underline}** the current inferior and
**[imperfect]{.underline}** versions of **[capitalism]{.underline}**.

Premise 3. Development and the future. [If]{.underline} the global
spread of [capitalism is allowed to continue]{.underline}, desperate
**[poverty can be]{.underline}** essentially
**[eliminated]{.underline}** in our lifetimes. Furthermore, [this can be
accomplished **faster**]{.underline} and in a more just way [via
**well-regulated**]{.underline} global **[capitalism]{.underline}**
[than by **any alternatives**. [If]{.mark} we]{.underline} instead [opt
for **[less cap]{.mark}italism**]{.underline}, less growth, and less
globalization, then desperate **[[poverty will]{.mark}
continue]{.underline}** to exist for a significant portion of the
world\'s population into the further future, [and the world will
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}a **[[worse]{.mark} and less
equitable]{.underline}** place than it would have been with more
capitalism. For example, [in a world with less capitalism, [there would
be]{.mark} more **[overpop]{.mark}ulation, [food
insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, air
**[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ill health, injustice,
[[and]{.mark} other problems]{.underline}. In part, this is because of
the factors identified by premise 1, which connect a turn away from
capitalism with a turn away from continuing improvements in health,
wellbeing, and justice, especially for the developing world. In
addition, [fertility declines are also a consequence of increased
wealth, and the size of the population is a primary determinant of
**food demand and other [environmental
stressors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.13 Finally, as discussed at length in
the next section of the essay, [capitalism can be naturally combined
with optimal **environmental regulations**]{.underline}.14 [Even
bracketing]{.underline} anything like optimal [regulation]{.underline},
it remains true that sufficiently **[wealthy nations reduce
environmental degradation]{.underline}** as they become wealthier,
[whereas developing nations that are nearing peak degradation will
remain **stuck at the worst levels of degradation if we stall growth**,
rather than allowing them to transition]{.underline} to less and less
degradation in the future [via capitalism]{.underline} and economic
growth.15 In contrast, [well-regulated [cap]{.mark}italism [is a key
part of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the best way of coping with these
problems, as well as a key part of **[[dealing with climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, global [**food production**, and
other]{.underline} specific [challenges]{.underline}, as argued at
length in the next section. Here it is important to stress that we
should favor well-regulated capitalism that includes correct investments
in public goods over other capitalist systems such as the neoliberalism
of the recent past that promoted inadequately regulated capitalism with
inadequate concern for externalities, equity, and background distortions
and injustices.16

Conclusion. [Therefore, we should be in favor of capitalism over
noncapitalism]{.underline}, and we should especially favor
well-regulated capitalism, which is the ethically optimal economic
system and is essential to any just basic structure for society.

[This]{.underline} argument is impressive because, as stated earlier in
the essay, it [is based on **evidence**]{.underline} that is so striking
that it leads a bipartisan range of open-minded thinkers and activists
to endorse well-regulated capitalism, including many of those who were
not initially attracted to the view because of a reasonable concern for
the societal ills with which we began. To better understand why such a
range of thinkers could agree that well-regulated capitalism is best, it
may help to clarify some things that are not assumed or implied by the
argument for it, which could be invoked by other bad arguments for
capitalism.

One thing the argument above does not assume is that health, wellbeing,
or justice are the same thing as wealth, because, in fact, they are not.
Instead, [the argument]{.underline} above [relies on]{.underline}
well-accepted, [**[measurable indicators]{.underline}**]{.mark} of
health and wellbeing, such as increased lifespan; [decreased early
childhood mortality; adequate nutrition; and other empirically
measurable]{.underline} leading [indicators]{.underline} of health,
wellbeing, and justice.17 Similarly, [the argument that
[cap]{.mark}italism [promotes]{.mark} justice, **[peace]{.mark}**,
freedom, human rights, and tolerance relies on empirical
metrics]{.underline} for each of these.18

Furthermore, the argument does not assume that because these indicators
of health, wellbeing, and justice are highly correlated with high
degrees of capitalism, that therefore capitalism is the direct cause of
these good outcomes. Rather, the analyses suggest instead that something
other than capitalism is the direct cause of societal improvements (such
as improvements in knowledge and technology, public infrastructure, and
good governance), and that [capitalism is]{.underline} simply [a
**necessary condition** for these improvements]{.underline} to happen.19
In other words, the richer a society is, the more it is able to invest
in all of these and other things that are the direct causes of health,
wellbeing, and justice. But, [to maximize investment]{.underline} in
these things [societies need well-regulated capitalism]{.underline}.

As part of these analyses, [it is often stressed that current forms of
capitalism]{.underline} around the world [are]{.underline} highly
[defective]{.underline} and must be reformed in the direction of
well-regulated capitalism because they lack investments in public goods,
such as basic knowledge, healthcare, nutrition, other safety nets, and
good governance.20 [In this way, an argument for]{.underline} a
particular kind of [**progressive reformism** is an
essential]{.underline} part of the analyses [that lead many to endorse
the more general argument for well-regulated capitalism.]{.underline}

Although these analyses are nuanced, and appropriately so, it remains
the case that the things that directly lead to health, wellbeing, and
justice require resources, and the best path toward generating those
resources is well-regulated capitalism. And on the flip side, according
to the analyses behind premise 1 described above, [[an anti-capitalist

[We find ourselves **still at the dawn** of a **new space** century,
**mindful of the**]{.underline} victories and [**setbacks** of our past,
eager to pass the torch]{.underline} to the next generation of space
visionaries, scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts. We look to the
future not just to see how much bigger, faster, or higher we can reach,
but also how [[the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline},
and specifically the U.S. [space community, [can]{.mark} again
**[inspire]{.mark} the [nations]{.mark} of the world [to align with
us]{.mark}**, as it **did in the 20th century**.]{.underline}

The SmallSat Alliance is an alliance of [companies]{.underline}
developing, producing, and operating [in **all segments** of the 'next

[**renewed U.S. leadership** in the **burgeoning commercial space

government-led space capabilities. We are experienced space
professionals who have chosen to join with others leveraging our decades

capabilities are **exponential**ly growing elements of the **21st
century world economy**.]{.underline}

Beginning with the dreams and funding by successful tech entrepreneurs,
enormous venture investments are already delivering wondrous benefits to
the world.

Commercial Space -- Profit and Non-Profit

There are really two major categories in the commercial sector, the
profit driven and the non-profit. The classic for-profit companies
include not only those designing, building, launching, and operating
satellites but also [the [tech]{.mark} sector]{.underline} that [[is
**turning**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**raw [space data into
gold]{.mark}** through machine-learning analytics]{.underline}. Since
for-profit companies are no longer dependent upon the revenues generated
by the Cold War space race culture of a bygone era, this new generation
of space companies is able to more efficiently capitalize on Moore's
Law, the nonstop exponential growth in chip density, and the associated
networking technology co-evolving with it. This new generation is
[building profitable businesses]{.underline} helping [[to **clean
up**]{.mark} **our [oceans]{.mark} of garbage**]{.underline} and debris
[with satellite [surveillance]{.mark}, reconnoitering to]{.underline}
assist in **[[enforc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[laws that]{.mark}
protect our oceans from illegal]{.underline}**, unregulated, unlicensed
**[fishing]{.underline}**, something [that is **rapidly depleting** the
**world's most valuable and essential lifeforms**]{.underline}. It's
[leading]{.underline} in [the innovative use of low-cost satellite
constellations to produce **ubiquitous remote-sensing data**, [enabling
**small business**]{.mark} owners [to be]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and less wasteful. For example,
precise timing signals from space are already optimizing transportation
of people, goods, and services, with even further gains anticipated with
the introduction of artificial intelligence to assist drivers, perhaps
even someday replacing them entirely.

The non-profit sector is the other side of commercial space, concerned
more for the general welfare of society, but every bit as integral to
this new space enterprise. Much **[like every century]{.underline}**
before it [in human history, ours is not without its **unique
challenges**]{.underline}, [some of which have been a consequence of the
last, and **all of which the space [data]{.mark} domain [can be
leveraged to]{.mark}**]{.underline} help [**[solve]{.mark}**. Examples
are **endless**, but one challenge that this new space community is
uniquely well-adapted for is to]{.underline} further [inform **worldwide
[resource allocation]{.mark}** for the **21st century and
beyond**]{.underline}. These [two primary resources are **[sustainable
water]{.mark}** and the materials needed for **adequate
[housing]{.mark}** []{.mark}for an **ever-increasing human population**.
As cities and urbanization continue to expand, **governmental planning**
challenges]{.underline} such as transportation design optimization for
goods and services [are **only**]{.underline} the
**[beginning]{.underline}**. [Additionally, through]{.underline} using
[inexpensive remote sensing]{.underline} technologies, some [members are
designing space data analytics to **[mitigate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
human suffering from [**[plagues]{.mark}**, **contain
[outbreaks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [combat]{.underline}ing
[**illegal [poaching]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Some are connecting with
other non-profits to [curtail **human
[trafficking]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the sex trade [or]{.underline}
forced labor for migrant debt repayment. Still others are helping
non-governmental organizations in their work to [expose the use of
**child**]{.underline}ren as [**soldiers**. Addressing these challenges
has little to do with resuscitating dreams]{.underline} conceived [by
long deceased science-fiction writers and much]{.underline} more [to do
with **turning "swords back into plowshares**" to **solve real [threats
to humanity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Other non-profit initiatives include pursuing an even more foundational
understanding of who we are and how to be the best custodians of our
environment. Much as exploring and monitoring the world's oceans has
advanced civilization through a better understanding of human life and
the planet, so too does exploring and monitoring from space. Low Earth
orbit (LEO) provides a unique vantage point to look back on the planet
and understand what is happening, anticipate what might happen and
prepare for the future. In addition to better understanding Earth,
responsible and rapid exploitation of the low Earth orbit domain will
enhance the understanding of the solar system and the rest of the
universe. Small satellites already offer low-cost platforms to study and
explore what lies beyond the Earth. Other members are pioneering the use
of zero-carbon, hydrogen-based reusable propulsion systems to ensure we
don't worsen our atmosphere using kerosene-fueled rockets for the coming
tsunami of satellite launches. [Finally, a mission
**[ensuring]{.mark}**]{.underline} the general welfare and [**[planet
survival]{.mark}** for the **next thousand years** is **finally
[confronting]{.mark}** the **existential [threat]{.mark}** [that

#### Space resource extraction solves sustainability. 

**Whittington '20** \[Mark; November 22; writes frequently about space
and politics, has published a political study of space exploration
entitled Why is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon and is published in
the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Hill, USA Today, the LA Times, and
the Washington Post, among other venues; The Hill, "How space
exploration will help to address climate change,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/527058-how-space-exploration-will-help-to-address-climate-change/\]

The Biden approach to NASA seemed to be expressed best by Lori Garver,
who served as NASA's deputy administrator during the Obama
administration. According to the Space Review, she said, "If we don't
put some really significant resources into allowing humanity to be
sustained on this planet, we're not going to have the time to leave it.
You can't really do one without the other."

That last sentence is truer than, perhaps, Garver realizes. An article
in Astronomy Magazine suggests that [[the]{.mark} ultimate
[solution]{.mark} to climate change [will be to move]{.mark} **resource
[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **heavy industry [off]{.mark}
the [planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The notion seems like science
fiction, but some very serious people are looking at the idea of **[[a
space-]{.mark}based industrial [revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Jeff
Bezos, who made his billions from Amazon.com and now runs a space launch
company called Blue Origin, [suggests "zoning" Earth for
residential]{.underline} [areas and "light industries."]{.underline}
[Mining and manufacturing]{.underline}, two of [[the **biggest
sources**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} environmental
[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[would move]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[off]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The moon and asteroids are the sources of untold mineral wealth. A
single asteroid, 16 Psyche, is said to contain 10,000 quadrillion
dollars' worth of metals. The quoted figure is somewhat misleading. If
one were to bring all the gold on 16 Psyche to Earth, its price would
collapse, making it into a cheap, industrial metal.

The point, however, is that [[only]{.mark} by turning humankind into a
**[space]{.mark}-faring civilization** [can]{.mark} we **[avoid]{.mark}
environmental [catastrophe]{.mark} while maintaining technological
progress.**]{.underline} The fact further suggests that the Artemis
program has an environmental dimension that Team Biden would do well to
recognize and to consider when formulating space policy for the incoming
administration.

American law already recognizes the right of companies to extract
resources from the moon and other celestial bodies, thanks to Title IV
of the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. The act was
passed in 2015 on a bipartisan basis and signed into law by Obama.

Currently, [NASA has been attempting to gain international recognition
of Earth humans' right to extract and own space resources]{.underline}
as part of the Artemis Accords. The accords have been signed by nine
nations, besides the United States, with more to follow.

The point of all of this, going back to what Garver said, is that
climate change and space exploration are inseparably linked. She likely
meant that Earth needs to be sustained so that humankind can expand into
space. However, the opposite is also true. **[[Humankind must expand
into space so]{.mark} that [the Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the pale
blue dot that the late-Carl Sagan once celebrated, [[can be]{.mark}
[preserved]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\[language modified\]

At the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1950, physicist Enrico [[Fermi
famously posed]{.underline}]{.mark} to his colleagues [a simple
question]{.underline} borne of complex math: **['[Where are
they]{.mark}?']{.underline}** He was asking about aliens---intelligent
ones, specifically. The Italian-American scientist was [puzzled as to
why \[hu\]mankind **hasn't detected any signs** of intelligent life
beyond our planet]{.underline}. He reasoned that even if life is
extremely rare, you'd still expect there to be many alien civilizations
given the sheer size of the universe. After all, some estimates indicate
that there is one septillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
stars in the universe, some of which are surrounded by planets that
could probably support life. So, where are they, and why aren't they
talking to us? This is known as [[the **Fermi paradox**.]{.mark} It's
[based on]{.mark}]{.underline} mathematical ideas like [[the Drake
equation]{.underline}]{.mark}, which was devised to estimate the number
of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way. Scientists use the
equation by multiplying seven variables, as Elizabeth Howell outlined
for Space: N = R\* • fp • ne • fl • fi • fc • L N = The number of
civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions
are detectable. R\* = The rate of formation of stars suitable for the
development of intelligent life. fp = The fraction of those stars with
planetary systems. ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an
environment suitable for life. fl = The fraction of suitable planets on
which life actually appears. fi = The fraction of life bearing planets
on which intelligent life emerges. fc = The fraction of civilizations
that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their
existence into space. L = The length of time such civilizations release
detectable signals into space. The Drake equation is incredibly
speculative, or, as astronomer Jill Tarter once said, it's "a wonderful
way to organize our ignorance." It remains a puzzling problem. However,
[[a new paper]{.underline}]{.mark} from scientists at the Future of
Humanity Institute at Oxford University [[provides an
**updated**]{.mark} Drake [equation]{.mark}]{.underline}, one [that
incorporates **"realistic distributions of uncertainty"** and **"models
of chemical and genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life."**
By doing so, [the researchers say they dissolve the Fermi
paradox]{.mark} and provide even [more reason to think **we're
alone**]{.mark} **in the universe**]{.underline}[. [The updated
equatio]{.underline}]{.mark}[n effectively takes each variable and
[combines]{.mark} many **[historical estimates]{.mark}** that scientists
have used to create an uncertainty range, one that highlights just how
much scientists still don't know]{.underline}, as study author Anders
Sandberg told Universe Today: "Many parameters are very uncertain given
current knowledge. While we have learned a lot more about the
astrophysical ones since Drake and Sagan in the 1960s, we are still very
uncertain about the probability of life and intelligence. When people
discuss the equation it is not uncommon to hear them say something like:
\'this parameter is uncertain, but let's make a guess and remember that
it is a guess\', finally reaching a result that they admit is based on
guesses. \"But this result will be stated as single number, and that
anchors us to an \*apparently\* exact estimate---when it should have a
proper uncertainty range. This often leads to overconfidence, and worse,
[the Drake equation is very sensitive to bias: if you are hopeful a
small nudge upwards]{.underline} in several uncertain estimates [will
give a hopeful result]{.underline}, and if you are a pessimist you can
easily get a low result." After Sandberg and his colleagues combined
these uncertainties, [the results showed a distribution pattern of the
likelihood that humanity is alone in space]{.underline}. "We found that
[even using]{.underline} the [guesstimates]{.underline} in the
literature (we took them and randomly combined the parameter estimates)
[one can have a situation where the mean number of civilizations in the
galaxy might be fairly high---say, a hundred---and yet the probability
that we are alone in the galaxy is 30%!]{.underline} The reason is that
there is a very skew distribution of likelihood. "[If we instead try to
review the **scientific knowledge**, things get **even more
extreme**]{.underline}. This is [because [the probability of getting
life and intelligence]{.mark} on a planet [has]{.mark} an \*[extreme\*
uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} given what we know---[we cannot rule
out]{.underline} that [it happens nearly everywhere there is the right
conditions, but we cannot rule out that [it is **astronomically
rare**.]{.mark} This leads to an even stronger uncertainty about the
number of civilizations, drawing us to conclude that **[there is a
fairly high likelihood that we are alone]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, we \*also\* conclude that we shouldn't be too surprised if we
find intelligence!"

**Calnitsky '21** \[David; August 8; Assistant Professor in the
Department of Sociology at Western University; *Critical Sociology,*
"The Policy Road to Socialism," Sage Online\]

David Calnitsky, Published August 8, 2021

I do not, however, think that **[[the rev]{.mark}olutionary road
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** implausible. Rather, it is
**[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least [inside the rich
capitalist democracies]{.underline}. [And between the implausible and
the impossible the choice is clear.]{.underline}

Again, [this can be framed as an empirical hypothesis]{.underline}:
**[[You do not see rev]{.mark}olution[s]{.mark} [in developed capitalist
democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Przeworski and Limongi (1997)
have written, [there has **never** been a revolution in a moderately
middle-class democracy]{.underline} (see also Przeworski, 2019).
[[Drawing on a **thousand years of data**]{.underline}]{.mark},
cumulatively collected across 37 democratic countries, [they show that
[**not one had collapsed** with]{.mark} a per-capita [GDP higher
than]{.mark} that of [Argentina]{.mark} in 1976. A]{.underline}mong
countries with half that figure, collapse was exceedingly rare. Even a
modest GDP brings with it an enormous amount of regime stability.
[[These]{.mark} data in fact [include **any kind of regime
collapse**]{.mark};]{.underline} [narrowing the data to socialist
revolution makes the empirical case against it even more
impressive.]{.underline} Any case for revolution must begin by
acknowledging rather than ignoring this evidence.

To look at this question in a different way, I draw on the
Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive, which contains information on
revolutions (rather than government collapse) for over 200 countries
since 1919. [Their definition of revolution is very broad]{.underline}
(see footnote 7) [and includes "attempts" to overthrow government as
well as "unsuccessful" rebellions]{.underline}. The data were compiled
from newspaper sources and warrants caution, but nonetheless constitutes
the most systematic evidence available for these questions. In Figure 9,
I present the GNP per capita distribution of revolutions, from 1919,
where GNP is first available, to the present. By considering only those
country-years with revolutions I reduce the observation count from
17,520 to 184. Unlike Przeworski, I do not further restrict the data to
democracies. The graph displays an extreme skew: The vast, overwhelming
majority of cases of revolutionary threat occur in countries with a per
capita GNP below \$5,000 USD. For reference, the figure for the US in
the data is about \$65,850 in 2019. The hypothesis above---that we do
not see revolutions in developed democracies---seems borne out by the
evidence.

figure

Figure 9. Histogram of country-years with revolutions.

Source: Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive. Data drawn from 200
plus countries between 1919 and 2018 are then restricted to
country-years (N = 184) in which there were "revolutions," as well as a
"major government crisis" and "anti-government protests."

Why exactly is this true and what are the mechanisms to explain it? Why
is the revolutionary strategy impossible for a country like the US?
There are, at bottom, three reasons, each of which stands alone as a
sufficient condition to snap the last threads of one's revolutionary
faith.23 The first two suggest that revolution is unachievable, and the
last suggests that even if it is achievable, socialism by revolutionary
means is unachievable. [The revolutionary road is closed on the
following grounds:]{.underline}

(1) **[Workers do not want it]{.underline}**

(2) **[Capitalists would sooner grant reforms]{.underline}**

(3) **[[A smashed state is]{.mark} more [likely to result in
tyranny]{.mark}]{.underline}** than deep democracy

[[Not only has there never been a successful revolution]{.mark} in a
developed democracy, **[there has never]{.mark} been [a working class
that]{.mark} has [wanted one]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Erikson and
Tedin, 2015; Sassoon, 1996).24 There are no clear cases where the
dominant inclination of the working class in a developed democracy was
revolutionary. Recall that the above graph also includes attempts and
unsuccessful cases. It is self-evident that workers have not joined
revolutionary groups en masse at any point in the context of a rich
democracy. Nor were their aspirations to join such groups thwarted by
violence or ideology. When gains inside a capitalist democracy are
available---either individual or collective ones, and this has been true
even through the neoliberal period, where median living standards have
continued to (slowly) go up and not down---it is not worth risking
everything for an uncertain future (Thewissen et al., 2015).25 More
important than the dynamic point is the static one: When standards of
living are moderately high, as shown in Figure 9, the modal worker has
more to lose than her chains. This is not an argument against socialism;
but to revise Werner Sombart, the life raft of revolution really was
shipwrecked on shoals of roast beef and apple pie.

Therefore[, the reasons workers are not revolutionary are materialist in
character. Explaining their reformist politics does not require appeal
to venal trade union leaders or false consciousness. Most people wish to
**minimize risk** in their lives, and **[rev]{.mark}olution
[involves]{.mark} taking on [colossal risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For
example, [home-ownership in the developed world hovers around 70%; this
means that **a lot of [people have a lot to lose]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

By contrast, [the materialist case for revolution proposes that people
favor it when their expected post-revolutionary standards of living are
greater than their current standard]{.underline} (Roemer, 1985). But
[when we add moderate risk- and loss-aversion the calculation
changes]{.underline} (Kahneman and Tversky, 1991). Say you have a low
income, but own a few assets, maybe a house, a car, and perhaps you also
have a child; what risk profile would you require to gamble your modest
holdings for an uncertain future which might be better but might be
worse? Even if you are certain that the probability of better is greater
than the probability of worse, you have to envision workers as a class
of inveterate gamblers to take the bet. Moderately cautious people who
prefer a bird in the hand will still view the downside risk as too
great. Equal gains and losses are not experienced equally. This is the
loss aversion phenomenon. But the assumption of a population confident
about improved standards of living---and a willingness to take risky
strategies to achieve them---is itself unwarranted. This is the risk
aversion phenomenon. The modal worker is of course correct to suspect
that her post-revolutionary welfare is uncertain; socialists after all
do not have satisfactory answers to the problems of coordination,
motivation, and innovation under socialism (for attempted answers that
are provocative and oftentimes brilliant, see Albert, 2004; Cottrell and
Cockshott, 1992; Corneo, 2017; Roemer, 1994; and Wright and Hahnel,
2016). When one compares the status quo to a future where both heaven
and hell are seemingly plausible, it is perfectly rational that people
everywhere would abandon the barricades. And abandon them they did.

Now perhaps the revolutionaries have persuaded us that negative outcomes
are far-fetched, that we are very confident that revolution will usher
in, eventually, the land of milk and honey. It is still the case that in
this model the promised land will only be reached after a social
breakdown of unknown duration: A complete overhaul in the organization
of production will lead to some middle period of deteriorating material
welfare as capitalists rapidly exit the economy. This means chaos and
uncertainty, but it could also mean war. The interregnum could last a
year, but it might last two decades, and however optimistic we are about
the end point, we cannot in advance know how long this interim phase
will persist. In the meantime, revolutionary enthusiasm will wane,
erstwhile supporters will decamp, a "stay-the-course" electoral strategy
will be outflanked by competitor parties promising a return to normalcy,
and the desire to consolidate gains will make the authoritarian impulse
greater. From a materialist perspective, the uncertain passage through
what Przeworski (1986) calls the "transition trough" makes the journey
less appealing.26

To my mind, these factors explain why **[[all working classes]{.mark} in
all developed democracies [have been]{.mark} decidedly
[reformist]{.mark} in orientation]{.underline}**. [The reason why
revolutionary socialism has always been marginal in rich capitalist
economies]{.underline}---and will always be outflanked by
reform-oriented socialism---[is that only the latter consistently
deliver hi]{.underline}gh (and usually increasing) standards of living
and low (and usually decreasing) levels of risk. As long as the Mad Max
world of catastrophic collapse can be avoided, reform-oriented parties
will always better capture the enthusiasm of poor and working people.

Thus, when we try to explain the non-revolutionary attitudes of our
working-class friends and family, we do not need to lean on the false
consciousness account, for there is a more parsimonious materialist
explanation. As such, any case for revolution must be non-materialist in
character: You can be a materialist or a revolutionary, but not both.

This is the dilemma the revolutionaries must consider: [Revolution is
only possible when the forces of production are underdeveloped, but it
can only be successful when they are sufficiently developed to make
socialism]{.underline} (or communism) [objectively
viable]{.underline}.27 As Elster (1986) has argued, [the circumstances
under which revolutions **spark and succeed never
coincide**.]{.underline}

What about the **[[capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Under these
circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that they [will [fight]{.mark}
[**far harder** against a revolution than]{.mark} they would against
[reformist drives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [ignoring the response
from capitalists violates Elster's first law of political rationality:
Never assume your opponent is less rational than you. [If revolution
were the alt]{.mark}ernative]{.underline}, [[employers would grant
every]{.mark} imaginable **[reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from far
higher taxes to the rejiggering of power relations in the workplace. In
a mugging, most people will surrender their wallet before their life.

Actors in the state ought to respond in more or less the same way---that
is, as long as you admit your adversary the competence to read the
situation as well as you. If our theory of the state suggests that it
acts on behalf of the capitalist class, its apparatchiks would
anticipate and preempt any revolutionary crusade with a cocktail of
concession and repression. And while it will certainly contest reforms,
it will devote all of its resources to break the revolution.
Nonetheless, this means that revolutionaries can play a crucial role,
even if it is not to foment revolution. Militancy is a powerful strategy
to foment reform (for an argument about the history of social democracy
along these lines, see Piketty, 2014).

Thus far, the main reason revolution is off the table is because no one
wants it---not workers, nor employers, nor the state.

The third point above asks us to imagine the prospects for revolutionary
success even if we ignore the wrinkle that workers have neither an
interest nor capacity to make it. But let us pretend they did:
**[Why]{.underline}** then would [we imagine that total social breakdown
would prompt a deepening of [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} [rather than
**authoritarian entrenchment**]{.underline}? [This happy outcome [has
never]{.mark} before [emerged in the]{.mark} [wake of social
collapse,]{.mark}]{.underline} and there is little reason why the final
showdown with the American military ought to produce fertile ground for
deepening democracy in all spheres of life. In fact, evidence from the
General Social Survey suggests that in response to recession and
economic downturn people tend to become less altruistic and less
concerned with questions of fairness.28 After situations of economic
crisis, voters tend to shift to the right (Lindvall, 2014). The old
union song cries out that "we can bring to birth a new world from the
ashes of the old," but life is not birthed on ash. None of the
historical case studies track this narrative, and indeed everything we
know about human psychology suggests that social devastation makes
people more, not less, prone to demagoguery. This means that even if a
revolution were achievable, it is probably undesirable.

The argument I have thus far laid out against revolution contends only
that it is off the table in middle-class democracies. I have in mind
social dynamics within developed capitalist democracies, countries "like
the US," but the premise no longer holds true if we imagine a society
that has already suffered some sort of catastrophic societal
disintegration---at that point all bets are off. We are of course now
talking about a world we are not living in, but it is worth considering
the thought experiment nonetheless.

It is possible that America, after some world-historic environmental or
economic collapse, begins to look something more like Russian feudalism
than contemporary developed capitalism. Revolution then might again be
on the table, but the context of desperation and scarcity in this
scenario gives little reason to expect it would incubate an egalitarian
democratic society. The historical evidence is unambiguous: None of the
communist revolutions of the 20th century ushered in deeply democratic
egalitarian social structures. Not only are there no examples, but there
are also no clear mechanisms on offer.

The fact that this scenario generates an interest in bringing about an
egalitarian society by means of revolution does not mean there will be a
capacity to do so. The theory is little more than "where there is a will
there is a way." But, as Elster (1980: 124) argues, the general
interests of society do not secrete the conditions for their
fulfillment. Interests and capacities need not overlap.

There is a final reason to be skeptical of non-evolutionary strategies:
The highly dubious premise that the system we erect the morning after
will actually work. [A [socialist economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, if
plopped down tomorrow, [[would be]{.mark} so [rife with **unintended
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} and pathologies that [it is easy to
imagine a democracy voting its way back into capitalism]{.underline}.
[This is true even if we believe]{.underline} (mistakenly, in my view)
[that the socialist calculation debate is solvable in the age of big
data]{.underline} (Morozov, 2019). Interlocutors in the calculation
debate have had very little to say about the politics of transition.
Indeed, [[it is hard to **imagine success**]{.underline}]{.mark} of any
kind [[without]{.mark} a **slow and [incremental]{.mark}
[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [experimenting with bits and
pieces along the way]{.underline}---as we have been doing for the past
century[. An experimental approach is likely [the only way to
avoid]{.mark} **devastating [blunders]{.mark}** that **undermine the
whole project**]{.underline}. [Moments of institutional upheaval and big
change may at times be necessary, but to be successful they will have to
rest on a foundation of smaller changes that have been
tested.]{.underline}

Global Unrest

There are many contradictions in the capitalist system, and some are
more salient than others. The incredible class and social inequalities
and collapsing environmental conditions are obvious priorities. But then
comes the "too big to fail, too monstrous to survive" contradiction.
Neither the social inequality nor environmental degradation issues can
be addressed without taking on this underlying contradiction. [A
socialist and anti-capitalist program will have to negotiate a
knife-edge path between preserving that which services the world's
population and which appears too big and foundational to fail while
confronting the fact that it is becoming **too monstrous** to survive
without sparking geopolitical conflicts that will likely turn the
innumerable small wars and internal struggles already raging across the
planet into a **globaconflagration**]{.underline}.

This is the core of the problem. [**[In Marx's time]{.underline}**, [if
there was a **sudden collapse**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[of
capitalism]{.underline}**, [[most people]{.mark} in the world
[would]{.mark} still [have been able to feed]{.mark} [themselves]{.mark}
and reproduce.]{.underline} They were reasonably self-sufficient in
their local area procuring the kinds of things they needed to live and
reproduce. [[People could put]{.mark} some sort of [breakfast on]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}ir [table]{.mark} irrespective of what was going on in the
**global economy** and in **global markets**]{.underline}. [[Right
now]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[that's no longer the
case]{.underline}]{.mark} in many parts of the world. [[Most]{.mark}
[people in the]{.mark} **U**nited **S**tates, in much of
[Europe]{.mark}, in Japan, and now increasingly in [China]{.mark},
[India]{.mark}, Indonesia, [and]{.mark} in Latin [America]{.mark} are
[depend]{.mark}ing more and more [on]{.mark} the delivery of [food
through]{.mark} the circulation of [capital]{.mark}. In Marx's time,
perhaps 10 percent of the global population was vulnerable to
disruptions in the circulation of capital, as opposed to many more who
were subject to famines, droughts, epidemics, and other environmental
disruptions]{.underline}. The crisis of European capitalism in 1848 was
part a product of harvest failures and part produced by a speculative
crash focused on railroad finance. [Since then, [capital]{.mark}
operating in the world market has largely [eliminated]{.mark} the
prospect of [starvation]{.mark} due to supposedly natural causes. If
there is famine the underlying causes]{.underline} (as opposed to the
immediate triggers) [can invariably be traced to failures in the social
and political system of capitalist governance and
distribution.]{.underline} [Much of [the world]{.mark}'s population
[is]{.mark} now [dependent upon]{.mark} the circulation of capital to
procure and ensure its food supply, access the fuels and the
[energy]{.mark} required [to support daily life]{.mark}, and to maintain
the elaborate structures and equipment of communication that facilitate
the coordination of basic production requirements]{.underline}.

[Capital]{.underline}, right now, [may be too deeply implicated in the
**reproduction of daily life** to fail. [The]{.mark} economic
consequences and social impacts and [costs of a]{.mark} massive and
prolonged [failure in the continuity of capital circulation will be
catastrophic and]{.mark} potentially **[lethal]{.mark}** for a
significant portion of the world's population.]{.underline} To be sure,
indigenous and peasant populations in the Andean highlands may survive
quite well, but [if the flow of capital shuts down]{.underline} for any
prolonged period, then [**maybe [two-thirds of the world's population
would within a few weeks be threatened with starvation]{.mark},**
deprived of fuel and light, while being rendered immobile and deprived
of almost all capacity to reproduce their conditions of existence
effectively]{.underline}. **[[We cannot]{.mark} now
[afford]{.mark}]{.underline}** any kind of [sustained and prolonged
attack upon or [disruption]{.mark} of capital circulation [even if
the]{.mark} more **[egregious forms of accumulation are strictly
curbed]{.mark}**. [The]{.mark} kind of [fantasy]{.mark} that
[revolutionaries]{.mark} might once have [had]{.mark} -- which was that
capitalism could be destroyed and burned down]{.underline} overnight and
that something different could immediately be built upon the ashes --
[**[is impossible today]{.mark}** even supposing there ever was a time
when such a revolutionary overthrow might have happe]{.underline}ned.
Some form of the circulation of commodities and therefore of money
capital has to be kept in motion for some considerable time lest most of
us starve. It is in this sense that we might say that [[capital
appears]{.mark} to be now **[too big to fail]{.mark}.**]{.underline} We
[may aspire to make our own history, Marx observed, but this can never
be done under conditions of our own choosing. These conditions dictate a
politics that is about sustaining many existing commodity chains and
flows while socializing and perhaps gradually modifying them to
accommodate to human need]{.underline}s. As Marx noted in his commentary
on the Paris Commune,

in order to work out their own emancipation, and along with it the
higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending by its own
economical agencies, they \[the working classes\] will have to pass
through long struggles, through a series of historic processes,
transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realize, but
to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing
bourgeois society is pregnant.

[[The task is to]{.mark} identify that which **lays latent in our
existing society to [find a peaceful transition to a more socialist
alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Revolution
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[a]{.mark} long [process not an
event]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### ! --- Cap Good --- AT: Disease

#### No disease impact.

**Adalja '16** --- Amesh; an infectious-disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh. He writes regularly at Tracking Zebra. June
17, 2016; "Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human Race?"; *The
Atlantic*;

//CYang

But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. With each outbreak of a
[**[headline]{.mark}-grabbing** emerging infectious [disease]{.mark}
comes]{.underline} a **[fear of extinction]{.underline}** itself. The
fear envisions a large proportion of humans succumbing to infection,
leaving no survivors or so few that the species can't be sustained. I'm
[[not afraid]{.mark} of this **apocalyptic scenario**]{.underline}, but
I do understand the impulse. [Worry about the end is a
**quintessentially human** trait]{.underline}. Thankfully, [so
is]{.underline} our [resilience]{.underline}.

For most of mankind's history, infectious diseases were the existential
threat to humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at
killing people: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out an
estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century Black
Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5
percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half of all
humans who have ever lived.

Any yet, of course, [[humanity]{.mark} continued to
flourish]{.underline}. Our [species']{.underline} recent [explosion in
lifespan is]{.underline} almost exclusively [the result of]{.underline}
the [[control]{.mark} of infectious [diseases through **sanitation**,
**vaccination**, and]{.mark} **antimicrobial
[therapies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only in the modern era, in which many
infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people
have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the
8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and
friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles,
and the like.

So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now?

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. Fortunately, [[outside of fiction]{.mark}, there's [no
reason]{.mark} to expect **alien [pathogens]{.mark}** to [wage war
on]{.mark} the [human race]{.mark} any time soon]{.underline}, and my
[[analysis suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[any]{.underline}]{.mark}
real-life [domestic [microbe reaching]{.mark} an **[extinction]{.mark}
level** of [threat]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [is just as
[unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by
infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short.

Any [apocalyptic [pathogen]{.mark}]{.underline} would [need to possess a
**very special combination** of two attributes]{.underline}. First, it
would have to be [[**so unfamiliar** that no]{.mark} existing
[therapy]{.mark} or vaccine could be [applied]{.mark}]{.underline} to
it. Second, it would need to have a [high [and]{.mark} surreptitious
[transmissibility **before symptoms**]{.mark} **occur**]{.underline}.
The first is essential because any microbe from a known class of
pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could serve as
models for containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the
hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the most
astute clinicians.

The three [infectious [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} most likely to be
[considered **extinction-level threats** in the world today]{.underline}
--- influenza, HIV, and Ebola --- [[don't meet
these]{.underline}]{.mark} two [requirements]{.underline}. Influenza,
for instance, despite its well-established ability to kill on a large
scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift
away from our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known unknown."
While there are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at
least the time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And
in the modern era, a [full-fledged industry of]{.underline} influenza
[preparedness exists, with effective **vaccine strategies** and
**antiviral therapies**]{.underline}.

HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is
similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, [HIV's
dependency on blood and body fluid for transmission]{.underline}
(similar to Ebola) [requires]{.underline} [intimate]{.underline}
human-to-human [contact, which limits contagion. **Highly potent**
antiviral therapy allows]{.underline} most [people to live
normally]{.underline} with the disease, [and]{.underline} a substantial
group of [the population has **genetic mutations** that render them
impervious to infection]{.underline} in the first place. Lastly, simple
prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users
and barrier contraceptives --- when available --- can curtail
transmission risk.

[Ebola]{.underline}, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as
several others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to
the fact that it [spreads]{.underline} almost [exclusively through
people with **easily recognizable symptoms**]{.underline}, plus the
taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by simple
supportive care.

Beyond those three, [every]{.underline} other known [disease falls short
of]{.underline} what seems [required to wipe out humans]{.underline} ---
which is, of course, why we're still here. And it's not that diseases
are ineffective. On the contrary, [diseases' failure]{.underline} to
knock us out [is a testament to]{.underline} just [how resilient humans
are]{.underline}. Part of our [**evolutionary heritage** is [our immune
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, one of the [[most complex on the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, even without the benefit of vaccines or the
helping hand of antimicrobial drugs. This [system]{.underline}, when
viewed at a species level, [can adapt to]{.underline} almost [any enemy
imaginable. [Coupled to **genetic variations**]{.mark}]{.underline}
amongst humans---which [open up the possibility for a range of
advantages, from **imperviousness**]{.underline} to infection [to a
tendency for mild symptoms]{.underline} --- this [**adaptability**
ensures]{.underline} that almost [[any]{.mark} infectious
[disease]{.mark} onslaught will [leave]{.mark} a **[large]{.mark}
proportion** of the [population alive]{.mark}]{.underline} to rebuild,
[in contrast to]{.underline} the [fictional Hollywood
versions]{.underline}.

While the immune system's role can never be understated, an [**even more
powerful** protector is]{.underline} the faculty of
[[consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Humans are not the most prolific,
quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle
identified, [humans are]{.underline} the [rational]{.underline}
animals---[and]{.underline} it is this fundamental [distinguishing
characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions]{.underline},
think in principles, and plan long-range. These capacities, in turn,
[allow [humans]{.mark} to [modify]{.mark}, [alter]{.mark}, [and
improve]{.mark} themselves and]{.underline} their [environments.
Consciousness]{.underline} equips us, at an individual and a species
level, to [make nature safe for the species through]{.underline} such
[**[technological]{.mark} marvels** as antibiotics, antivirals,
vaccines, and sanitation]{.underline}. When humans began to focus their
minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased
being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, [human
consciousness]{.underline} became [infectious [diseases' **worthiest
adversary**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Price Of Growth --- Destruction Of The Environment?

But isn't there a price for this growth: environment devastation? Of
course, nobody would deny that industrialization causes environmental
problems. But the [[assertion]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[growth]{.mark}
**automatically [leads]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} ever
accelerating [[environmental degradation is]{.mark} **simply
[false]{.mark}**[. Yale]{.mark} University's **[E]{.mark}**nvironmental
**[P]{.mark}**erformance **[I]{.mark}**ndex]{.underline} (EPI) [[uses
**16 indicators** to rank]{.mark} countries on [environmental health,
air]{.mark} quality, [water, biod]{.mark}iversity, [natural resources
and pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [indicators]{.underline} have
been selected to [reflect]{.underline} both the current baseline and the
[dynamics of **national ecosystems**]{.underline}. One of the Index's
**[most striking [findings]{.mark}]{.underline}** is that there [is a
[**strong correlation** between]{.mark}]{.underline} a state's [[wealth
and]{.mark} its [environmental performance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most
[**developed [capitalist countries]{.mark}** [achieve **high
environmental standards**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those [countries
with]{.underline} the [worst EPI]{.underline} scores, such as Ethiopia,
Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger, are all poor. They [have]{.underline}
both [low investment capacity for infrastructure]{.underline}, including
water and sanitation, and tend to have weak environmental regulatory
authorities.

Contrary to prevailing perceptions, [industrial development and
**[tech]{.mark}nological advances**]{.underline} have contributed
[significantly]{.underline} to [[reliev]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the
[[burden on the environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Both Indur Goklany in
his book The Improving State of the World and Steven Pinker in chapter
ten ("The Environment") of his book Enlightenment Now demonstrate that
[[we are]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[living longer]{.mark},
healthier [lives]{.mark} in unprecedented prosperity]{.underline}, but
we are also doing [so [on a]{.mark} **comparatively [clean]{.mark}**
[planet]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Researchers]{.underline} have [confirmed]{.underline} that economic
freedom --- in other words, more [capitalism]{.underline} --- [leads to
higher]{.underline}, not lower, [environmental quality]{.underline}.

Every year, the Heritage Foundation compiles its Index of Economic
Freedom, which analyzes individual levels of economic freedom, and thus
[[capitalism]{.mark}, in countries around the world]{.underline}. The
Heritage Foundation's researchers also [measure]{.underline} the
[correlation between]{.underline} each [country's environmental
performance]{.underline} and its economic freedom. The [[results
**couldn't be clearer**]{.underline}]{.mark}: the world's [[most]{.mark}
**economically [free]{.mark}** [countries achieve]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[highest environmental performance]{.underline}]{.mark} rankings
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} an average [score of
[76.1]{.mark}]{.underline}, followed by the countries that are "mostly
free," which score an average of 69.5. [In **stark
contrast**]{.underline}, the [[economically]{.underline}]{.mark}
"repressed" and "mostly [[unfree]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[countries]{.underline} [**all score** less than
50]{.underline}]{.mark} [for environmental performance]{.underline}.

Is Government The Best Solution To Environmental Problems?

Anti-capitalists frequently claim that central government is the best
solution to environmental problems. And there is no doubt that state
regulations to safeguard the environment are important. But state
regulations, cited by anti-capitalists as a panacea for environmental
issues, often achieve the opposite of what they were intended to do.
Hardly any other country in the world touts its green credentials as
much as Germany. According to even the most conservative estimates,
Germany's so-called "energy transition" is set to cost a total of almost
€500 billion by 2025.

But the results of this massive investment is sobering, as an analysis
by McKinsey reveals, "Germany is set to miss several key energy
transition targets for the year 2020, and the country's high power
supply security is at risk unless new generation capacity and grid
infrastructure are built in time for the coal and nuclear exit and
electrification of transportation networks is accelerated."

For decades, environmentalists in Germany focused on shutting down
nuclear power plants. However, the phasing out of nuclear power has left
Germany in a poor position in terms of CO2 emissions compared to other
countries. It is not without good reason that Germany's energy policy
has been described as the dumbest in the world.

The latest generation of nuclear power plants are much safer than their
predecessors. Despite what environmentalists might claim, impartial
calculations have confirmed that it is impossible to meet the world's
energy needs from solar and wind power alone. Enlightened
environmentalists are therefore now calling for nuclear power to be
rightfully included in the fight against climate change. And yet, this
is precisely what is being prevented in Germany by politicians --- not
capitalism. This example, just one of many, shows that government
environmental policy is often ineffective. In some instances, it even
achieves the opposite of what it was originally intended to, i.e. it
exacerbates existing environmental problems.

It is [[also wrong to think]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[capitalism]{.mark} **necessarily [leads]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} ever [greater [waste of]{.mark} **limited
[natural resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Just take the
[[smartphone]{.underline}]{.mark} for example, one of the most
environmentally friendly of capitalism's many achievements. With just
[one small device]{.underline}, a [**whole [plethora of
devices]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} used to [consume
resources]{.mark}]{.underline} in the past, such as the [[telephone,
camera, calculator, navigation]{.underline}]{.mark} system,
[[dictation]{.underline}]{.mark} machine, [[alarm]{.underline}]{.mark}
clock, [[flashlight]{.underline}]{.mark} and many others, [have been
[replaced]{.mark}]{.underline}. Smartphones [also]{.underline} help to
[reduce]{.underline} the [consumption of paper]{.underline} as many
people choose not to take notes on paper [and]{.underline}, for example,
[use their iPhone instead of a calendar]{.underline} to enter
appointments.

[[Those who call for]{.underline}]{.mark} "[system
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}" instead of "climate change" [[do
not]{.underline}]{.mark} usually [[say which system
they]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[prefer]{.underline}]{.mark}. All they
are really sure of is that any new system should not be based on free
market economics and that the state should play the decisive role. The
[**simple [fact]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[failed in **every country every
time**]{.mark} it]{.underline} has been [tried]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} socialism has [damaged the environment more than any
capitalist system]{.underline}. Murray Feshbach documents examples of
the environmental destruction wrought by socialism in his book
Ecological Disaster. Cleaning Up the Hidden Legacy of the [[Soviet
Regime]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the book progresses through chapters
such as "A Nuclear Plague," "Dying Lakes, Rivers, and Inland Seas" and
"Pollution of the Air and Land," it becomes clear that this
non-capitalist system was [[responsible for]{.mark} the [**greatest
environmental destruction** in history. Anti-capitalists
may]{.mark}]{.underline} well [[reply]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[they]{.mark} [do not want]{.mark} a system like [the Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, they
[[cannot name a **single real-world system**]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[at any time in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[history]{.underline}]{.mark}
of \[humankind\] ~~mankind~~ --- [[that provides better **environmental
solutions** than capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[There is **no**]{.mark} **scientific [basis]{.mark}** [to

"annihilate **intelligent life**" (by which I assume the]{.underline}
report [authors [mean **human extinction**]{.mark})]{.underline} by

However, climate breakdown does pose a grave threat to civilization as
we know it, and the potential for mass suffering on a scale perhaps
never before encountered by humankind. This should be enough reason for
action without any need for exaggeration or misrepresentation!

A "Hothouse Earth" scenario plays out that sees Earth's temperatures
doomed to rise by a further 1°C (1.8°F) even if we stopped emissions
immediately.

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

This word choice perhaps reveals a bias on the part of the author of the
article. A temperature can't be doomed. And while I certainly do not
encourage false optimism, assuming that humanity is doomed is lazy and
counterproductive.

Fifty-five percent of the global population are subject to more than 20
days a year of lethal heat conditions beyond that which humans can
survive

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

This is clearly from Mora et al (2017) although the report does not
include a citation of the paper as the source of that statement. The way
it is written here (and in the report) is misleading because it gives
the impression that everyone dies in those conditions. That is not
actually how Mora et al define "deadly heat" --- they merely looked for
heatwaves when somebody died (not everybody) and then used that as the
definition of a "deadly" heatwave.

Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:

[[Projections of **extreme events**]{.underline}]{.mark} such as these
[[are]{.mark} **very [difficult]{.mark}** [to make and **vary**]{.mark}
**greatly** [between]{.mark} **different climate

Deadly heat conditions across West Africa persist for over 100 days a
year

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

The deadly heat projections (this, and the one from the previous
paragraph) come from Mora et al (2017)1.

It should be clarified that "deadly heat" here means heat and humidity
beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in the region
subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone instantly
dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al are
conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not check
the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason to
think they are in error.

Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research fellow, Potsdam Institute for
Climate Impact Research:

This is a highly questionable conclusion. The reference provided in the
report is for the "Global Catastrophic Risks 2018" report from the
"Global Challenges Foundation" and not peer-reviewed literature. (It is
worth noting that this latter report also provides no peer-reviewed
evidence to support this claim).

Furthermore, if it is apparently beyond our capability to model these
impacts, how can they assign a 'high likelihood' to this outcome?

While it is true that warming of this magnitude would be catastrophic,
making claims such as this without evidence serves only to undermine the
trust the public will have in the science.

Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

It seems that [**the eye-catching [headline]{.mark}-level
[claims]{.mark}** in the report **[stem]{.mark} almost entirely**
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} these [**[knock-on effects]{.mark}**,
which]{.underline} the authors themselves admit [are ["beyond]{.mark}

scientific perspective**, the]{.underline}]{.mark} purported "high
[[likelihood]{.mark} of civilization coming to an end]{.underline} by
2050" [[is]{.mark} **essentially [personal
speculation]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the part of the report's authors,
[[rather than]{.mark} **a clear [conclusion]{.mark}** drawn [from
**rigorous**]{.mark} **assessment** of **the available

The content of the IFLScience article is mostly an accurate
representation of the contents of the Breakthrough report, but [the
article tends to gloss over **important caveats and
probabilities**]{.underline} that are [given in the report]{.underline}.
The least accurate part of the IFLScience article is the headline, which
is an outright misrepresentation of the report. The article title states
that there is, overall, [**a "high probability"** of human civilization
coming to an end]{.underline} in 30 years. This [is **extremely
misleading**]{.underline}. What the Breakthrough report actually says is
that, [[in **the most unlikely, "long-tail"**]{.mark} **biophysical
[scenario]{.mark}** [where]{.mark} **climate [feedbacks]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} **much [more severe]{.mark} than we expect**, [**THEN**
there is]{.mark} a]{.underline} high [[likelihood of]{.mark} human
[civilization coming to]{.mark} an [end]{.mark}. But the report authors
**explicitly state** that **[this]{.mark} "high-end [scenario]{.mark}"**
[is **beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[capacity to model or]{.mark}
to **quantitatively [estimate]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

The article uncritically reproduces claims from a recent report released
by an Australian thinktank regarding the purported "end of human
civilization" due to climate change over the next 30 years. [While there
is plenty]{.underline} of [scientific evidence]{.underline} that
[climate change will pose]{.underline} increasingly [**existential
threats** to **the most vulnerable individuals in society**]{.underline}
and to key global ecosystems, [**even these dire outcomes** aren't
**equivalent** to the "**annihilation of intelligent
life**,"]{.underline} as is claimed in the report.

Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:

The report this article is based on describes a scenario which is
unlikely, but several aspects of what is included in the report are
likely to worsen in coming decades, such as the occurrence of deadly
heatwaves. [**The conclusion** of **a high likelihood** that **human
civilisation** will end is **false**, although there is **a great deal**
of evidence]{.underline} that [there will be]{.underline} many
**[damaging consequences]{.underline}** to continued global warming over
the coming decades.

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

I don't think it's so easy to discount the essential warning of this
report. However, it would have been stronger if the authors were more
careful not to mention the unsupported concept of near-term human
extinction, and the unsupported probabilistic claim that there is a
"high likelihood" of their 2050 scenario which includes the collapse of
civilization. [I do not understand why **non-scientist
writers**]{.underline} (neither report author is a scientist) [feel a
need to **exaggerate** sound scientific findings]{.underline}, when
those findings are already quite alarming enough. I feel that humanity
should undertake urgent climate action just as the report authors do,
but I feel that [misrepresenting the science is **unhelpful** and
**unnecessary**]{.underline}.

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

This is a classic case of a media article over-stating the conclusions
and significance of a non-peer reviewed report that itself had already
overstated (and indeed misrepresented) peer-reviewed science --- some of
which was already somewhat controversial. It appears that there was not
a thorough independent check of the credibility of the message.

New Report Warns "High Likelihood Of Human Civilization Coming To An
End" Within 30 Years

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

The headline overstates the conclusions of the report (which is already
overdoing things). The reports says it presents a scenario, and under
that scenario and all the assumptions within it, the report claims that
there is a "high likelihood of human civilization coming to and end" ---
but even then, the report itself does not give the end of civilisation
within 30 years. [The [process]{.mark}]{.underline} supposedly leading
ultimately to collapse [[**begins** around **2050** but takes **a long
time**]{.mark} **to take effect**]{.underline}. Also [the
[processes]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves [[are **not**]{.mark}
**well-[grounded in science]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [[they
**over-interpret**]{.mark} published [work]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As I point out in that linked (and free!) book: [[we're nowhere
near]{.mark} **any [limit]{.mark}**]{.underline} that need bother us.
[[We've]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[800,000 years of
**nickel**]{.underline}]{.mark} left (assuming no recycling) [[and 34
million of **cobalt**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [enough to]{.underline}
be [getting along with]{.underline}, given the average lifespan of a
species is three million years.

So why the worrying that we are? Mainly, it's because [[people
**misunderstand** the]{.mark} **technical [jargon]{.mark}**
[used]{.mark}]{.underline} in the industry. [[They talk about mineral
reserves and]{.underline}]{.mark} mineral [[resources without
realizing]{.mark} that [these are not a]{.mark} **fair
[indication]{.mark}** [of usable resource]{.mark}]{.underline}. No, [not
even a guide, not an estimation, [there]{.mark} **simply [is no
link]{.mark}** at all]{.underline}.

A [[mineral reserve]{.mark} is [something]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} have [drilled]{.underline}, tested, dug up a
bit [and [processed]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we have now proven that we
can extract this at current prices, using current technology, [and make
a profit doing so]{.underline}. [[This is an economic
definition]{.underline}]{.mark}: roughly speaking, [the stock
[at]{.mark} **already [existing]{.mark}** [mines]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A mineral resource is where we're pretty sure all of that is true --
we've just not proved it yet. And then there's the stuff we've not got
around to looking at -- which is true of the bulk of the planet and the
bulk of all minerals. [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark} like
[[complaining]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the [food in the fridge]{.mark}
is **about to [run out]{.mark}** [without referring
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[supermarkets]{.mark} which]{.underline}
exist to [fill up our fridges again]{.underline}.

#### Their ev only accounts for [current reserves]{.underline}.

Just look at that famed Club of Rome report, Limits to Growth. They,
entirely correctly, note that mineral reserves are going to last 30 --
50 years. They then, again **[entirely
[correctly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, note that [[mineral
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} can and [will be [converted into reserves
by]{.mark} the [application of]{.mark}]{.underline} time and
[[money]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their [[prediction comes
from]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[incorrect
[assumption]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[current reserves
are]{.underline}]{.mark} an [indication of [the **total**]{.mark}
**amount [available]{.mark}** to us]{.underline}.

But they then simply assume that resources out there are only 10 times
current reserves. Hmm, 10 x 30 -- 50 years is 300 to 500, isn't it? So
it's not all that much of a surprise that they tell us that society is
doomed, doomed, in only a couple of centuries when they add a bit of
exponential growth in usage. Their prediction comes from their
assumption, that wholly incorrect one, that current reserves are an
indication of the total amount available to us.

All [too many [predictions of this sort]{.mark} are [based on
**entirely**]{.mark} and **totally [wrong]{.mark}**
[assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [truth is
[we]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[do not have]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[shortage of **any mineral**]{.underline}]{.mark}, over any human
timescale, that we might want to use. [Any policy based upon the
assumption]{.underline} that we do [is]{.underline} provably
[wrong]{.underline}. So we'd better revisit those policies based upon
this incorrect assumption pretty sharpish, shouldn't we?

\"Stable Jobs or iPhones? The Dilemma of Innovation in Socialism,\"
Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 52, Vol. 4, p. 642-649\]

**Note: DPS = Democratically Planned Socialism**

[One]{.underline} of the [advantage]{.underline}s [for
[innovation]{.mark} in DPS is]{.underline} that [it can]{.underline}
effectively [take into account social and environmental
costs,]{.underline} including the jobs lost or disrupted by the
introduction of a new technology.8 [But this can also be
**problematic**, in that it [is]{.mark} likely to make **innovation
[slower]{.mark}** [in **socialism**]{.mark} than in **capitalism**.
[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [majorities are **not immune**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} some of [the **same [factors]{.mark}** [that
caused **Soviet**]{.mark} **manager[s]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark}
technologically [conservative]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On the one hand, DPS should not suffer from taut planning, unrealistic
plan targets imposed from the top down, or an incentive structure that
discourages risk-taking by trying out new technologies. But on the other
hand, [[innovation is]{.mark} **always [disruptive]{.mark}** in any kind
of **economic system**. As old technologies are **superseded**, product
lines become **obsolete** and production processes are changed, and as a
result certain]{.underline} kinds of [jobs are **no longer needed**.
[Even with]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[employment guarantee]{.mark}, the
loss of one's job may have to involve **retraining**, **changing
careers**, or **moving**]{.underline} across the country. So, [it is
reasonable to expect]{.underline} that [workers will **resist new
technologies**]{.underline}.9 Yet at the same time, in their capacity as
consumers, they will demand new and better products.

[This is]{.underline} the "[Stable jobs or iPhones?" dilemma. We can
prioritize]{.underline} cutting-edge [consumer products, or]{.underline}
we can prioritize [stable employment, but]{.underline} perhaps **[not
both]{.underline}**.10 In DPS, the people will be able to decide between
one and the other, on a case-by-case basis, so that [[some]{.mark}
innovations]{.underline} will be pursued, others [[will be
scrapped]{.mark} because of their **disruptive effects**, [and]{.mark}
some]{.underline} will be [[introduced at]{.mark} a **deliberately [slow
pace]{.mark}**. Meanwhile, capitalism always comes down in
favor]{.underline} of the iPhones despite the conflict with stable jobs.
[Since socialism will not]{.underline} always do this, [it is likely
that socialism will have]{.underline} more job security but [fewer
**cutting-edge**]{.underline} consumer [products than
capitalism]{.underline}.

[[If there is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**[international
rivalry]{.mark}** between **socialism** and **capitalism**, the
[citizens]{.mark} of the two]{.underline} kinds of [societies
will]{.underline} be able to [[compare]{.mark} their
[lifestyles]{.mark}]{.underline} with those in the other economic
system. Workers living under capitalism may be attracted by the stable
jobs, shorter working hours, democratic workplaces, and social benefits
provided by socialism. However, [[those]{.underline}]{.mark} living
[[under socialism will]{.mark} likely also [be **attracted** by]{.mark}
the **rapid [introduction]{.mark}** of new]{.underline} consumer [goods
under capitalism]{.underline}. Moreover, [as long as the **speed of
innovation** in socialism is **lower**]{.underline} than that in
capitalism, [the "**consumer gap**" with capitalism would
**grow**]{.underline} over time.

This may not be considered a problem for socialism if most of the
population value stable jobs more than iPhones, but there would likely
be a minority who do not. If the consumer gap is large enough, and/or
that dissenting minority has an overriding preference for new consumer
goods, then [we have a category of people with a **material interest**
in **supporting capitalism**, which values a **new
technology**]{.underline} over job stability, [even though they are part
of the working class]{.underline}.

[[A common response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[flaws]{.mark} of
Soviet socialism [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} to [propose **[other
models of socialism]{.mark}** that [would not have]{.mark} those
[**flaws**. But the **trade-off** between **job security** and
**innovation** is not]{.mark} one that can be **[easily
eliminated]{.mark}** within socialism. It is not due to]{.underline} the
[overly centralized or undemocratic nature of Soviet
socialism]{.underline}.

Furthermore, there is a [[military]{.underline}]{.mark} aspect to the
[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} problem. Innovations that aid the
military are also likely to have a disruptive effect on employment, as
in the case of consumer-oriented innovations. This is a problem because
it might [[put DPS at]{.mark} a **military [disadvantage]{.mark}** with
respect to capitalism, [which would **hurt**]{.mark} the [**socialist
side** in **i**]{.mark}**nternational [r]{.mark}elations** [even if
no]{.mark} military [conflict takes place.]{.mark} If [one side]{.mark}
knows it would **lose any war**]{.underline} that did take place, then
[that side [will **act timidly**]{.mark} and avoid even nonviolent
confrontation]{.underline}, so as [to **avoid provoking** the other
side]{.underline} into war. [For both sides to stand]{.underline} a
[good chance of success in a peaceful rivalry, they must be]{.underline}
more or less [evenly matched]{.underline} militarily, [so that neither
feels that it can do whatever it wants with impunity]{.underline} or
that it must tread lightly to avoid confrontation.

[[The Cold War was]{.underline}]{.mark} a [multifaceted
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} between two different systems. [[Any
future socialist]{.mark} economic [order will]{.mark} most
[likely]{.mark} face capitalism in a]{.underline} somewhat [[similar
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}. Can such a struggle be won by socialism
without matching capitalism's rate of technological development? That is
the question.

In [[1820, 94%]{.mark} of the]{.underline} world's
[population]{.underline} was [[living in]{.mark} **extreme
[poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 1910, this figure had fallen to 82%,
and by 1950 the rate had dropped yet further, to 72%. However, the
[[**largest** and **fastest** decline]{.mark} occurred between
1981]{.underline} (44.3%) [and [2015]{.mark}]{.underline}
([[9.6%]{.underline}]{.mark}). Reading these figures, which were
compiled by Johan Norberg for his book Progress, is enough to make
anyone rub their eyes in disbelief. For [[according
to]{.underline}]{.mark} leftist [[anti-capitalists, these were]{.mark}
the very [decades]{.mark}]{.underline} in which [so [much
went]{.mark}]{.underline} so [[wrong]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}.
In his book Capital in the 21st Century, the left-wing French economist
Thomas Piketty writes that it is precisely this period that is allegedly
so problematic. He [bemoans]{.underline} a [widening of]{.underline} the
[gap between the rich and]{.underline} the [poor in terms
of]{.underline} income and [wealth]{.underline} in the period from 1990
to 2010. But [what is **more important**]{.underline} to these hundreds
of millions of people --- [that they are no longer starving,
or]{.underline} that the [wealth of]{.underline}
multi-[millionaires]{.underline} and billionaires [may have
increased]{.underline} to an even greater extent than their own standard
of living?

According to Norberg, 200 years ago, [[at]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[birth of capitalism, there were only]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[60
million people]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world who were
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} living [[in]{.mark} **extreme
[poverty]{.mark}**[. Today there are]{.mark} **more than [6.5
billion]{.mark}** people]{.underline} who are [not living in extreme
poverty]{.underline}. Between 1990 and 2015 alone (in Thomas Piketty's
view the devastating years in which social inequality rose so sharply),
1.25 billion [[people **around the world** escaped]{.mark} extreme
poverty]{.underline} --- [50 million per year]{.underline} and [138,000
every day]{.underline}.

Glorifying The "Good Old Days"

Johan Norberg himself used to be a left-winger and an
[[anti-capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}. In his book, he admits that he
[[**never thought** about how people lived]{.mark} before]{.underline}
the industrial revolution, when [there was [no medicine]{.mark}, no
[antibiotics]{.mark}, no **clean [water]{.mark}**, nowhere]{.underline}
near enough [[food]{.mark}, no [electricity]{.mark}]{.underline} and no
clean water. He confesses that he pretty much imagined this epoch of
humanity as a trip to the countryside. But the [**[reality]{.mark} of
the past** [was]{.mark} **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
the early 19th century, [[poverty rates]{.underline}]{.mark} were
[[higher]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[in]{.mark} the [richest
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} then [[than]{.underline}]{.mark} they are
[[today in]{.mark} the **[world's poorest]{.mark}
countries**]{.underline}. In the [United States]{.underline}, Great
[Britain and France]{.underline}, between 40% and [50% percent of the
population lived in conditions]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} now
[describe as]{.underline} [extreme poverty]{.underline}. Today, the only
countries with such high poverty levels are all in sub-Saharan Africa.
Across Scandinavia, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Spain, roughly 60% to
70% of the population lived in extreme poverty. And between 10% and 20%
of Europeans and Americans were officially described as beggars and
vagabonds.

It is estimated that 200 years ago some 20% of the inhabitants of
England and France were unable to work at all. At most they had enough
strength to walk slowly for a few hours each day, which condemned them
to begging for the rest of their lives. Karl Marx foresaw the
impoverishment of the proletariat, but when he died in 1883, the average
Englishman was three times richer than in 1818, the year in which he was
born.

Life expectancy

[Progress over recent decades]{.underline} is [**particularly
[evident]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} terms of [[life
expectancy]{.mark} gains]{.underline}. Life expectancy at birth has
[[increased]{.mark} **more than [twice]{.mark}** as much in the last
century]{.underline} as in the 200,000 years before. The
[probability]{.underline} that a [child born today]{.underline} will
[reach retirement age]{.underline} is [higher than]{.underline} the
[probability of previous generations]{.underline} ever [celebrating
their **fifth birthday**]{.underline}. In 1900, the [average life
expectancy]{.underline} worldwide [was 31]{.underline} years; [today it
stands at 71]{.underline} years. [[Of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [roughly
[8,000 generations]{.mark} of Homo sapiens]{.underline} since our
species emerged approximately 200,000 years ago, [[only]{.mark} the
[last four]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[experienced]{.mark} **massive
[declines]{.mark}** [in mortality]{.mark} rates]{.underline}.

Hunger

In the last 140 years there have been [[106]{.mark} **major
[famines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, each of which has [cost more than
100,000 lives]{.underline}. The [[death toll]{.underline}]{.mark} has
been [**particularly [high]{.mark}** [in socialist
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Soviet Union, China,
Cambodia, Ethiopia and North Korea, [killing]{.underline} tens of
millions of [people through]{.underline} the [forced transfer of private
means of production]{.underline} to public economies [and]{.underline}
the [use of hunger as a weapon]{.underline}. The book The Power of
Capitalism describes in painful detail the [biggest socialist experiment
in history]{.underline}, Mao's "Great Leap Forward" at the end of the
1950s. About 45 [million Chinese died at that time]{.underline}.

Travel And Hospitality Sectors Need To Reimagine Their Business Models

The [[annual]{.mark} number of [deaths]{.mark}]{.underline} due to major
famines [[fell]{.underline}]{.mark} to 1.4 million in the 1990s --- not
least [[as a result of]{.underline}]{.mark} the collapse of socialist
systems worldwide and China's [move toward
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. As late as
[[1947]{.underline}]{.mark}, the United Nations stated that around
[[half of the]{.mark} world's [population]{.mark} was **chronically
[undernourished]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 1971, this had fallen to 29%,
ten years later it was only 19%. [[By 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
proportion of people suffering from malnutrition [worldwide]{.underline}
had [fallen to [11%]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Prophets Of Doom]{.underline} Have [Always Got It Wrong]{.underline}

[If there is one thing we]{.underline} can [learn from
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[**[doom-mongers]{.mark}** have **[always been
wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 1968, a [highly acclaimed
book]{.underline} was published [with]{.underline} the [provocative
title **[The Population Bomb]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The book
[stated]{.underline} that the [1970s]{.underline} would
[see]{.underline} the [world plagued by numerous famines]{.underline},
which would result in hundreds of millions of people starving to death.
Another book, [**[Famine 1975]{.mark}**!, predicted]{.underline} that
[famine]{.underline} would [reach catastrophic proportions]{.underline}
within 15 years. While [[anti-capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}
frequently glorify the past, they [[always regard the future
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[strong]{.mark} sense** of
**[doom]{.mark} and gloom**]{.underline}. In 1972, for example, the
highly influential [[Club of Rome warned]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[emissions]{.mark} of]{.underline} practically [every
pollutant]{.underline} now seemed to be [[rising exponentially. In
fact]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the decades to come,
[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark} would not only stop growing, but
**[actually [decrease]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And
[[drastically]{.underline}]{.mark} so. [**Total [emissions]{.mark}**
from the world's]{.underline} six [leading]{.underline} air [polluters
[fell by]{.mark}]{.underline} more than
[[two-thirds]{.underline}]{.mark} between 1980 and 2014.

The Environment

[Norberg]{.underline} also [confirms]{.underline} the extent to which
[[environmental conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[improved]{.mark}
over the last few decades]{.underline}. While acknowledging the impact
of climate change, he also points out that the [amount of energy needed
to produce]{.underline} one unit of [prosperity]{.underline} in the
Western world has [decreased]{.underline} by 1% per year every year
[[over]{.mark} the **past [150 years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As he
demonstrates, there are [ways]{.underline} and means [to cut CO2
emissions without reducing growth, trade and]{.underline} access to
[energy]{.underline}. These include [**more [efficient
production]{.mark}** processes, [less energy-intensive
construction]{.mark}]{.underline} methods, [new energy sources and
fuels]{.underline}. As he also explains,
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and companies are now [working on
[fourth-gen]{.mark}eration nuclear [power]{.mark}]{.underline} plants,
all of which have passive safety systems, [that]{.underline} can
[[generate **hundreds**]{.mark} **of times** [more
energy]{.mark}]{.underline} from the same resources [[and do not
have]{.underline}]{.mark} the same [[waste]{.underline}]{.mark} problems
as their predecessors. Stephen Pinker, in his book Enlightenment Now!,
also confirms that [[all]{.mark} manner of [environmental
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} have [**[declined]{.mark} sharply** in
recent decades]{.underline}, despite the fact that most people believe
they have actually increased. Pinker also sees nuclear energy as the
most important means of combating climate change. In the past, according
to Pinker, [people's [innovative power]{.mark}]{.underline} to solve

The [past 30 years]{.underline} have [[see]{.mark}n]{.underline}
**[immense [progress]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark}
improving]{.underline} the [[quality of life]{.mark} for]{.underline}
much of [humanity]{.underline}. Extreme [[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- the number of people living on less than \$1.90 per day --- [has
[fallen]{.mark} by]{.underline} nearly **[two-thirds]{.underline}**,
from 1.9 billion [to around]{.underline} **[650 million]{.underline}**.
[[Life expectancy]{.mark} has]{.underline}
**[[risen]{.underline}]{.mark}** in most of the world, [along
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[literacy]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[access to
[education]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [while]{.underline} **[[infant
mortality]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [fallen]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Despite perceptions to the contrary, the [average person]{.underline}
born today [is likely to have access to]{.underline} **[more
opportunities]{.underline}** [and have a]{.underline} **[better quality
of life]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} at [any other point in human
history]{.underline}. Much of this [increase in]{.underline} human
[wellbeing has been [propelled by]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[rapid]{.underline}** [economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} driven
largely by state-led industrial policy, particularly in poor-to-middle
income countries.

However, this growth has come at a cost: between 1990 and 2019, global
emissions of CO2 increased by 56%. Historically, economic growth has
been closely linked to increased energy consumption --- and increased
CO2 emissions in particular --- leading some to argue that a more
prosperous world is one that necessarily has more impacts on our natural
environment and climate. There is a lively academic debate about our
ability to "absolutely decouple" emissions and growth --- that is, the
extent to which the adoption of clean energy technology can allow
emissions to decline while economic growth continues.

Over the past 15 years, however, [something has]{.underline} **[begun to
change]{.underline}**. [Rather than a]{.underline} 21st [century
dominated by]{.underline} **[coal]{.underline}** that energy modelers
foresaw, [global [coal]{.mark} use]{.underline} **[[peaked]{.mark} in
2013]{.underline}** [[and is]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[structural [decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
We have [succeeded in [making]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[clean energy

**[power]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[battery]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[storage]{.underline}** [[costs

**[solar]{.underline}**, [**[wind]{.underline}**,
**[hydro]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- [than from coal over the past two
years]{.underline}. And, [according to]{.underline} some major [oil
companies, [peak oil]{.mark} is upon us --- not [because]{.mark} we
have]{.underline} **[run out of]{.underline}** cheap
**[oil]{.underline}** to produce, [but because [demand
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[falling]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and
companies expect]{.underline} **[further decline]{.underline}** [as
consumers]{.underline} increasingly [shift to]{.underline}
**[e]{.underline}**lectric **[v]{.underline}**ehicle**[s]{.underline}**.

The world has long been experiencing a relative decoupling between
economic growth and CO2 emissions, with the emissions per unit of GDP
falling for the past 60 years. This is the case even in countries like
India and China that have been undergoing rapid economic growth. But
relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a world where global CO2
emissions need to peak and decline in the next decade to give us any
chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in line with Paris
Agreement targets.

Thankfully, [there is]{.underline} **[increasing evidence]{.underline}**
that [the [world]{.mark} is [on track to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[absolutely decouple]{.underline}**]{.mark} CO2
**[emissions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} economic
**[growth]{.underline}** --- [with global CO2
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} **[potentially]{.underline}** [having
[peak]{.mark}ed]{.underline} **[[in]{.mark} 20[19]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and unlikely to]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[substantially]{.underline}** [in the coming decade]{.underline}.
While an emissions peak is just the first and easiest step towards
eventually reaching the net-zero emissions required to stop the world
from continuing to warm, [it demonstrates]{.underline} that [linkages
between emissions and economic activity are]{.underline} **[not an
immutable law]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} rather [simply a result
of our]{.underline} **[current]{.underline}** [means of energy
production]{.underline}.

In recent years [we have seen]{.underline} **[more and
more]{.underline}** [examples of absolute decoupling]{.underline} ---
economic [growth accompanied by]{.underline} **[falling]{.underline}**
[CO2 emissions]{.underline}. Since 2005, [[32
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} with a population of at least one million
people [have]{.underline} **[absolutely]{.underline}**
[[decoupled]{.mark} emissions from]{.underline} economic
[growth]{.underline}, both [for]{.underline}
**[terrestrial]{.underline}** [emissions]{.underline} (those within
national borders) [and]{.underline} **[consumption]{.underline}**
[emissions]{.underline} (emissions embodied in the goods consumed in a
country). This [[include]{.mark}s [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
Japan, Mexico, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Poland, Romania,
Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, Belarus, Austria,
Bulgaria, El Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway,
Ireland, New Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia,
Estonia, and Cyprus. Figure 1, below, shows the declines in territorial
emissions (blue) and increases in GDP (red).

To qualify as having experienced absolute decoupling, we require
countries included in this analysis to pass four separate filters: a
population of at least one million (to focus the analysis on more
representative cases), declining territorial emissions over the
2005-2019 period (based on a linear regression), declining consumption
emissions, and increasing real GDP (on a purchasing power parity basis,
using constant 2017 international \$USD). We chose not to include 2020
in this analysis because it is not particularly representative of
longer-term trends, and consumption and territorial emissions estimates
are not yet available for many countries.

There is a wide range of rates of economic growth between 2005-2019
among countries experiencing absolute decoupling. Somewhat
counterintuitively, there is no significant relationship between the
rate of economic growth and the magnitude of emissions reductions within
the group. While it is unlikely that there is not at least some linkage
between the two factors, [there are]{.underline}
**[plenty]{.underline}** [of examples of countries]{.underline} (e.g.,
Singapore, Romania, and Ireland) [experiencing both]{.underline}
**[extremely rapid]{.underline}** economic [growth and]{.underline}
**[large reductions]{.underline}** [in CO2 emissions]{.underline}.

One of the primary [criticisms of]{.underline} some [prior
analyses]{.underline} of absolute decoupling [is that they
ignore]{.underline} **[leakage]{.underline}**. Specifically, the
offshoring of manufacturing from high-income countries over the past
three decades to countries like China has led to "illusory" drops in
emissions, where the emissions associated with high-income country
consumption are simply shipped overseas and no longer show up in
territorial emissions accounting. There is some truth in this critique,
as there was a large increase in emissions embodied in imports from
developing countries between 1990 and 2005. After 2005,
[however]{.underline}, **[structural [changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
China and a growing domestic market [[led to]{.mark} a [reversal]{.mark}
of these trends]{.underline}; the [amount of
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} ["**[exported]{.underline}**]{.mark}"
[from]{.underline} **[developed]{.underline}** [countries
to]{.underline} **[developing]{.underline}** [countries has]{.underline}
**[actually [declined]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over the past 15
years]{.underline}.

This means that, [for many countries, both]{.underline}
**[[territorial]{.underline}]{.mark}** emissions [[and]{.underline}
**[consumption]{.underline}** [emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} (which
include any emissions "exported" to other countries) [have]{.underline}
**[[jointly declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, on average,
[consumption emissions have been]{.underline} **[declining slightly
faster]{.underline}** [than territorial emissions]{.underline} since
2005 in the 32 countries we identify as experiencing absolute
decoupling. Figure 2, below, shows the change in consumption emissions
(teal) and GDP (red) between 2005 and 2019.

![Chart, bar chart Description automatically

height="1.5576388888888888in"}

There is a pretty wide variation in the extent to which these countries
have reduced their territorial and consumption emissions since 2005.
Some countries --- such as the UK, Denmark, Finland, and Singapore --
have seen territorial emissions fall faster than consumption emissions,
while the US, Japan, Germany, and Spain (among others) have seen
consumption emissions fall faster. Figure 3 shows reductions in
consumption and territorial emissions for each country, with the size of
the dot representing the size of the population in 2019.

Michael **Bennett** and Sean Welsh **22**, Bennett, PhD student in AI;
Welsh, PhD in Philosophy, 1-16-2022, \"Will AI Spell the End of
Capitalism?,\"
https://quillette.com/2022/01/16/ai-and-the-end-of-capitalism/, jy

In 2018, the Washington Post published an opinion piece by Feng
[Xiang]{.underline} entitled "[AI Will Spell the End of
Capitalism."]{.underline} Professor Feng teaches law at Tsinghua
University and is one of China's most prominent legal scholars. The core
of his argument is set forth in the opening paragraphs:

> If AI remains under the control of market forces, it will inexorably
> result in a super-rich oligopoly of data billionaires who reap the
> wealth created by robots that displace human labor, leaving massive
> unemployment in their wake.
>
> But China's socialist market economy could provide a solution to this.
> If AI rationally allocates resources through big data analysis, and if
> robust feedback loops can supplant the imperfections of "the invisible
> hand" while fairly sharing the vast wealth it creates, a planned
> economy that actually works could at last be achievable.

There are a couple of things wrong with this. First, there is the
obvious point that [Marxists have been prophesying the end of capitalism
**since 1848**]{.underline}. Second, Der Spiegel has run covers
prophesying massive unemployment due to robots since 1964. These
predictions are yet to eventuate.

[Feng]{.underline} hopes that state-owned AI will revive the long-dead
idea of socialist central planning. He is probably wrong about this
because he **[overestimates the capabilities of AI]{.underline}** and
what it is good for. His reference to "[big data analysis]{.underline}"
indicates that he is referring to the particular class of data-hungry
machine learning (ML) models popular today. These algorithms [require a
**lot of data**]{.underline} because they rely on mimicry rather than
understanding and independent reasoning. [ML does **not work like human
learning**]{.underline}. Human children do not need ten thousand tagged
images to tell the difference between cats and dogs, but contemporary ML
does.

Given a particular task, if the purpose is known, [a human can seek to
serve that purpose **even if there are surprises**, i.e., unanticipated
changes in circumstance. The **opposite is true** for a digital
mimic]{.underline} that knows nothing of the purpose it serves. This is
why [anything **novel**]{.underline} [or out of the ordinary tends to
**break ML**]{.underline}. For example, the error rate of systems
looking to distinguish feral trees from native trees can increase
dramatically if the live aerial photos start to differ from the photos
used to train the model. Shifts in satellite orbit, the time of day
pictures are taken and even modest moves in geography and vegetation can
degrade model accuracy. [Contemporary ML-based AI is very much a case of
highly trained horses for **very specific courses**.]{.underline}

As is commonly said, [a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence
[is **brittle**]{.underline} (but fast) whereas [human intelligence is
**robust**]{.underline} (but slow). [If the task is to]{.underline} land
a drone, **[provide song recommendations]{.underline}**, or even predict
protein folding, [then mimicry can work **well**]{.underline}, given a
sufficiently varied quantity of training data. [If]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [rationality or the ability to provide **nuanced reasoning
for past decisions is required**]{.underline}, [mimicry
**flops**]{.underline}. The ability to deal with the unexpected is one
of the great strengths of Homo sapiens.

Feng's claim is simply that AI oligarchs are bad and the only credible
fix is a "socialist market economy" governed by a Marxist one-party
state. This is a false dichotomy; [our choice is **not
between**]{.underline} [these **two extremes**]{.underline}. We agree
that AI oligarchs are an unattractive prospect. However, there are
existing remedies for cartels, monopolies, and harmful AI products in
the pluralist West. [**Targeted regulation** is a **better fix** for
capitalism's defects than a **revolution**]{.underline} led by an
alliance of workers and peasants. As a result of Frances Haugen's
testimony, [many in the US Congress are looking to **clip the wings of
social media**]{.underline}. [The EU has **led the world in regulating
AI**]{.underline} products, introducing rights to explanations, rights
to be forgotten, and rights to data privacy. The Australian government
has released draft legislation to expose anonymous trolls to defamation
actions by removing the "platform" shield of social media and making
them "publishers" accountable for the views their users post just like
traditional media. The "wild west" days of the information age are over.

But [Feng offers a typically Marxist "**all or nothing**"
argument]{.underline}. To fix the problems of competitive capitalism,
his solution is a Marxist political monopoly based on the revolutionary
expropriation of the expropriators. His argument is unconvincing because
[it is based on a hopelessly dated **caricature of
capitalism**]{.underline}. "Laissez-faire capitalism as we have known
it," he says, "can lead nowhere but to a dictatorship of AI oligarchs
who gather rents because the intellectual property they own rules over
the means of production."

The obvious problem with this argument is that [laissez-faire capitalism
is **extinct**]{.underline}, long since [abandoned in favour of
**regulation**, **anti-trust legislation**, and **redistribution through
the welfare state**. Feng overstates the **market power**]{.underline}
of the AI oligarchs, most of whom make their money selling ads in a
competitive market. [He says nothing about the **coercive
power**]{.underline} [of a **political monopoly**, that can silence
policy competition by throwing it into the **gulag**.]{.underline}

[The **most sinister aspect**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} current [AI
is **what a one-party state can do with it**]{.underline}. Silicon
Valley has given China the technical tools to set up the world of 1984.
Now [the **party telescreen** can monitor the likes of **Winston Smith**
24/7]{.underline}. Instead of a screen on the wall, it's the mobile
phone in your pocket connected to the Internet that can be used to track
you and monitor what you click on, who and what you message, and keep
you and all your fellow citizens under constant surveillance for
"counter-revolutionary" views. [In China, the Internet and social media
have evolved to be a **tyrant's dream**. Comrade political
officers]{.underline} in technology firms monitor online [posts for
"objectionable" material and have **unlimited powers of
"moderation."**]{.underline}

The Achilles heel of this political strategy is that it creates a
culture in which people are afraid to think and speak freely. When you
have to filter every word you say in case it offends the powers that be,
you are strongly motivated to avoid risky creative thinking. In a
society where the state can control everything and purge celebrity and
wealth, [talented people vote with their **feet**]{.underline} and
[migrate to places where they can **get rich**]{.underline} and famous
and say what they think. Those that remain settle for the safety of
government-approved groupthink. As a result of this systemic dampening
of creativity, [the economy **stagnates**]{.underline} in the long run.

Aspects of contemporary AI theory align with the intuitions of Karl
Popper as expressed in The Open Society and Its Enemies. Driven mostly
by reaction to the totalitarian horrors of fascism and communism in
World War II, Popper intuited that [social truth is best served by
policy competition and piecemeal social engineering **not policy
monopoly**]{.underline}. Contemporary AI, in the form of discussion of
the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in reinforcement learning (a
variant of ML), explains why.

Exploitation is a strategy whereby the AI takes a decision assumed to be
optimal based on data observed to date. In essence, it is about trusting
past data to be a reliable guide to the future, or at least today.
Exploration, by contrast, is a strategy that consists of not taking the
decision that seems to be optimal based on existing past data. The AI
agent bets on the fact that observed data are not yet sufficient to
correctly identify the best option. Obviously, exploitation works better
in closed and well-understood systems, but exploration is a better bet
in those that are open and poorly understood.

Even if decisions are made by the most generally intelligent AI
possible, [the optimal strategy for that AI is to **subdivide
tasks**]{.underline}, **[duplicate itself]{.underline}**, [and
**specialize for local conditions**]{.underline}. In other words, a
swarm of individuals each making their own choices can learn from the
best of what its population tries. [If all individuals are constrained,
then the ability of the swarm to learn and change is]{.underline}
\[[destroyed]{.underline}\] crippled. There are exceptions, particularly
where the cost of an individual failing is so high it is comparable to
the whole population failing (for instance, letting more people have
access to a button that ends the world is worse than letting fewer
people have access to this button). But, generally speaking, more
**[distributed control]{.underline}** consistently [beats more
**centralised control**]{.underline}. By employing many different, often
contradictory policies at once, we constantly explore as we exploit.
Applying this recent technical insight retrospectively to history, [it
explains]{.underline} the **[sustained stagnation of Marxist
economies]{.underline}**.

Presently, no functioning state has either completely central or
distributed control. We are all somewhere in between. In the mid-19th
century, when The Communist Manifesto was published, there was hardly
any spending on social services. Income tax was three percent in the UK,
there was no such thing as company tax, and the welfare state did not
exist. What existed was the parish and the poorhouse. In the days of
Gladstone and Disraeli, with property-based suffrage and a budget than
went mostly on the Army, the Navy, and servicing debt incurred during
the Crimean War, one could plausibly claim, as Marx and Engels did, that
"the executive of the modern state was nothing but a committee for
managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie." In the 19th century,
spending by the UK government was less than a 10th of GDP. Today it is a
third. Half the UK budget, one-sixth of GDP, goes on health, education,
and welfare.

[A degree of central planning is desirable]{.underline} to provide
infrastructure, to support basic research, and to ensure that everyone
has access to education and health services. [Regulation is
required]{.underline} to enforce contracts, to facilitate cooperation,
to provide minimum standards for products and services, and to enforce
rules on safety, pollution, and so on. **[However]{.underline}**, as an
overall policy, [maximising **individual autonomy**]{.underline} within
reason, [erring towards **computational efficiency**]{.underline} and
distributed control, [will yield dramatically **better outcomes than
central control by the AI of a one-party state.**]{.underline}

[Central planning ignores]{.underline} what is arguably the greatest
advantage of distributed control and local adaptation: [**error
correction**. It also ignores the fact that **"fairness" is notoriously
hard to define**]{.underline} in AI terms, assuming resources are to be
fairly allocated. A central planner might select what is best for an
average human, but what is best is often far from obvious. [Humans are
**quite dissimilar**]{.underline} from one another. [We share goals only
in the most **general sense**]{.underline} (for example, we seek to
avoid pain, find food, take shelter, and so forth). [We **rarely
agree**]{.underline} on what we want to do today or any other day, and
our beliefs about how to achieve things are often inconsistent.

The best possible central planner, mathematically, is a pareto-optimal
super-intelligence. This is a software agent that learns faster to
predict more accurately than any other agent, on average across all
possible tasks. This is the theoretical upper limit of intelligence
(allowing for debate over the exact definition of intelligence itself).
However, even this theoretical perfection will always be out-performed
by those with a more specifically relevant inductive bias toward a given
task (those who are less intelligent in general, but more suited to the
task at hand). In other words, even the most intelligent being possible
would make mistakes when compared with the possibilities presented by
distributed control, localised adaptation, and selective evolution. The
same goes not just for correcting mistakes, but for improving our lot in
life. Every beneficial innovation in history was an instance of an
individual breaking ranks to correct a perceived flaw in the norm, to
adapt to the specific situation at hand. Innovation requires
disobedience. To centralise control is to encourage stagnation.

The problem with [state-run monopolies]{.underline} is that they [are
**inherently inefficient**]{.underline} because they lack the error
correction provided by competition. [Markets provide **error
correction**]{.underline} [in the form of people **deciding products
suck** and **buying elsewhere**]{.underline}. In the realm of ideas,
error correction occurs when people say a party's policy does not work,
but this option is removed when free speech is curtailed. In China,
[those who criticise]{.underline} [government policy]{.underline} (or
government officials) **[disappear]{.underline}** and get silenced. Only
a lucky few like Peng Shuai have global profiles high enough to get
noticed. Notwithstanding their claims about "participatory" democracy,
in the one-party state, dissidents and innovators are purged in
darkness.

[The history of the communist world is **replete with economic
disaster**. **Millions** died]{.underline} as a result of famines caused
by Stalin and Mao. [Marxist doctrine underlies the economic
underperformance of **China compared to Taiwan**. AI **cannot save
Marxism**, but it can be used by Marxists to **serve their agendas of
surveillance** and **social control**]{.underline}. AI can be used to
bring about the death of democracy and enable the rule of a digital Big
Brother.

[Forced to choose between AI oligarchs who make fortunes selling ads,
regulated by elected governments]{.underline} that the people can
replace, [or a society ruled by AI platforms staffed with political
officers who repress all criticism]{.underline} of the party line, [the
**former is preferable**]{.underline}.

Oliver **Waters 18**, degrees in Science, Law, and Philosophy,
11-13-2018, \"The Strange Necessity of Infinite Economic Growth,\"
https://medium.com/@oliverwaters_76079/the-strange-necessity-of-infinite-economic-growth-ebc2e505cdf1,
jy

Since the Earth consists only of a finite amount of matter and energy,
we clearly cannot indefinitely consume its contents without eventually
drowning in waste or starving to death. But even this obvious insight
contains a misconception. [[We **never**]{.mark} actually
'[consume']{.mark} matter and energy in the first place. We are forever
bound by the **first law**]{.underline} of thermodynamics, which
dictates that [matter and [energy]{.mark} are [**never created** or
**destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [only **transformed**]{.underline}.

This brings us back to [economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Fundamentally, it [is the process of human beings [transform]{.mark}ing
matter and [energy into]{.mark} **more [valuable forms]{.mark}** via the
development of **theoretical and practical knowledge**]{.underline}. It
is '[economic value']{.underline} which [increases
**exponentially**]{.underline}, measured (very)roughly by GDP. The
crucial point is that while [the extraction of finite physical resources
**cannot increase indefinitely on a finite planet**, economic growth
**actually can**.]{.underline}

Steven Pinker describes the infinite potential of economic growth
eloquently in his book Enlightenment Now:

'...[it's a **fallacy** to think that people "**need
resources**"]{.underline} in the first place. [They need ways of growing
food, moving around, lighting their homes, displaying information, and
other sources of well-being. They satisfy these needs with
**[ideas]{.mark}**]{.underline}: with recipes, formulas, techniques,
blueprints, and algorithms for manipulating the physical world to give
them what they want. [The human mind]{.underline}, with its recursive
combinatorial power, [[can explore an **infinite space**]{.mark} **of
ideas**]{.underline}, and is [not limited by the **quantity of any
particular kind of stuff**]{.underline} in the ground.'

Of course, [it's abundantly clear]{.underline} from history that most
[civilisations have failed miserably to generate and implement the
requisite knowledge to provide for the needs and desires]{.underline} of
their citizens. This brings us to [Hickel's]{.underline} empirical
[claim]{.underline}: that [our]{.underline} own current [trajectory is
leading us to disaster.]{.underline}

2\. Prediction or prophesy?

One might reasonably suspect that the promise of infinite economic
growth would only be plausible for a sufficiently advanced civilisation
--- particularly one that has managed to wean itself off fossil fuels.
[We should therefore ask if decoupling]{.underline} economic
[growth]{.underline} from resource use [is]{.underline} likely to be
[feasible]{.underline} given our relatively primitive level of
technological development.

On Hickel's account, things are not looking good. He cites several
studies which suggest there is no way to avoid running out of resources
if we continue with our current rate of economic growth.

The main problem with these [studies]{.underline} is that they tend to
[presume a **certain fixed '[biocapacity']{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Earth. This concept and the corresponding notion of [humanity's
'ecological footprint' [have]{.mark} **many
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the most fundamental of which is that
[they [depend **arbitrarily** on]{.mark} our **[current]{.mark} level of
scientific and technological [development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
is because [the maximum level of human consumption that our planet can
support is **not fixed**]{.underline} by some natural law --- [it
depends entirely on the **sophistication of our technology** to convert
raw materials efficiently]{.underline} into life-supporting forms.

[The very same lump of matter and energy has **vastly different
properties**]{.underline} to us humans depending on the level of and
quality of our knowledge. Major scientific
[[breakthroughs]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [allow us to
**[do]{.mark} dramatically [more with less]{.mark}**. One kilogram of
**uranium**]{.underline} [contains]{.underline} two to [three million
times more]{.underline} energy [than]{.underline} the same amount of
[coal]{.underline} or oil, but [this]{.underline} fact [went
**completely unnoticed**]{.underline} by everyone up until fundamental
breakthroughs in physics in the 20th century.

Similarly, the [invention of **[desalination]{.mark}**]{.underline}
techniques [[unlocked]{.mark} the effectively **boundless supply of
[seawater]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the rest of the Middle East
suffers water shortages, [Israel has a **surplus**]{.underline} ---
thanks to advances that have reduced the costs of desalination by
two-thirds since 1990.

One study mentioned by Hickel calculated that we'll be using 95 billion
metric tons of resources globally in 2050. But this figure is
meaningless without a corresponding estimate of what fraction that is of
the Earth's total resources. And [we **can't know what Earth's total
resources are**]{.underline} because we cannot predict future
fundamental technological advances.

At one point Hickel declares that the sustainable level of global
resource use is about 50 billion metric tons a year, without citing any
source or justification. The authors of the 2012 study he references
cited this same figure as a possible upper limit on global resource
extraction, being roughly the level of extraction there was in 1992. But
why choose this year? Because that was the year of the first United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In other words, it
was picked out of a hat.

[Even where]{.underline} these [studies make allowances for future
improvements in how efficiently we use resources, they only allow for
greater efficiency in the use of resources **we currently know
about**]{.underline}. If the future is anything like the past, [[we will
discover]{.mark} **whole [new ways to build]{.mark} and power
[things]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and replace whole classes of raw
materials we currently depend upon]{.underline}.

Then there's the fact that these studies' predicted improvements in
resource efficiency are themselves woefully pessimistic. The most
optimistic prediction in the studies Hickel mentions is that resource
efficiency will double by 2050. But almost [any consumer product we use
today requires **far fewer resources**]{.underline} to build and run
[than]{.underline} their equivalent [32 years ago]{.underline}. While
it's a somewhat trite example, take the iPhone. This one product has
replaced landline push-button phones, pagers, cameras and camcorders,
calendars, alarm clocks, audio-recorders, flashlights, maps, GPS, credit
cards, and more. We should only expect this kind of dematerialization to
accelerate over the next 32 years, given the rapid advances being made
in nanotechnology and materials science.

This fundamental fallacy driving the pessimism of these studies was
eloquently captured by David Deutsh in his book The Beginning of
Infinity. In the chapter 'Unsustainable', Deutsch reflects on Paul
Erlich warning his high school class in 1971 of the impending global
ecological collapse, a tragedy which never came to pass:

> '[Ehrlich thought]{.underline} that [he was investigating a planet's
> physical resources and predicting their rate of decline]{.underline}.
> In fact [he was prophesying the **content of future
> knowledge**]{.underline}. And, by envisaging a future in which only
> the best knowledge of 1971 was deployed, [he was implicitly
> **assuming** that only a small and rapidly dwindling set of problems
> **would ever be solved again**]{.underline}.'

It's perfectly acceptable and prudent to make predictions about future
resource scarcity, so long as you remember that such predictions are
based on our current level of scientific knowledge. Such analyses play a
crucial role in motivating us to invest more in advancing our knowledge,
but [[Hickel]{.underline}]{.mark} mistakenly [interprets]{.underline}
their [[findings as **fatalistic**]{.underline}]{.mark} signs that we
must cease economic growth altogether. And [this]{.underline}, as I'll
show below, [is simply **not an option**.]{.underline}

As discussed earlier, a common if not predominant use of
Georgescu-Roegen's theory of [[entropy]{.underline}]{.mark} since
Rifkin's popularization in the 1980s [has been to [create the
**illusion**]{.mark}**ary appearance [of a]{.mark} robust physical
[basis]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} neo-Malthusian and
[anti-development ideologies, not to support a **[Marx]{.mark}ist
critique of neo-classical economics**]{.underline}. Hence Burkett's
embrace of Georgescu-Roegen's theory is curious given Burkett's own
valuable critique of neo-Malthusian views (Burkett, 1998).

In Rifkin's work, [the entropy concept is extended to its **apocryphal
limits**. Entropy appears]{.underline} as a pollutant, [as]{.underline}
an indicator of cosmic disorder, the inexorable outcome of all economic
activity, [the mother of **ecocatastrophe**]{.underline}.
(Georgescu-Roegen enthusiastically endorses Rifkin's treatment of the
subject (Georgescu-Roegen, 1980). Rifkin, as noted, favors a
pre-industrial global population of less than one billion people, and
rejects the use of computers since they generate entropy (1989 edition,
190-191)! Should we wonder whether Rifkin's more recent books were
composed on a word processor rather than a less entropic typewriter?

[[Entropy is **too abstract**]{.mark} **and coarse**]{.underline} a
concept [to illuminate most issues in the environmental
discourse]{.underline} unless the full context of its use is thought
through---the "ascent from the abstract to the concrete" in Marxist
epistemology (Ilyenkov, 1982). [[Its invocation]{.mark} in the
environmental discourse commonly [serves **little
purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} [other [than **to avoid**]{.mark}
**[clarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} while [[creating the **illusion of
rigor**]{.underline}]{.mark} [because a concept from theoretical physics
is used]{.underline}. [Is entropy a useful measure of
unsustainability?]{.underline} A consideration of the physical entropic
flux (roughly equivalent to the radiant energy flux) from the Earth's
surface should demonstrate that appealing to anthropogenic (man-made)
entropy production as a measure of negative environmental impacts fails
to recognize their real qualitative aspects.

This entropic flux is dominated by the natural heat production from both
solar radiation interacting with the Earth's surface and incoming
radiation from the greenhouse effect. [[Any]{.mark} plausible
anthropogenic [contribution is **trivial**.]{.mark} The
greatest]{.underline} potential [anthropogenic contribution arises from
global **warming**]{.underline}. Since to a good first approximation the
entropic flux is equal to the incoming solar flux divided by the
absolute temperature (Schwartzman, 1999, 2002, 162-163), a [[5
deg]{.mark} C global [rise]{.mark} in surface temperature [will
lower]{.mark} this [flux]{.mark} by **about [2%]{.mark},**]{.underline}
which is derived from the ratio of absolute temperatures (288/293), the
global incoming solar energy flux being the same (recall that the
denominator of the entropy flux expression is always the absolute
temperature). [Whatever the change in entropic flux arising from
changes]{.underline} in the Earth's surface temperature, [the entropic
[flux]{.mark} in itself will [tell us **nothing about**]{.mark} **actual
[impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} of global warming, [which
are]{.underline} both the linear and **[nonlinear]{.underline}**
outcomes of fossil fuel consumption and other sources of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases. The concrete linkage of cause and effect must be
worked out from application of the sciences of biogeochemistry,
climatology, oceanography, ecology etc. Likewise, while the entropy of
mixing gives some insight into general aspects of pollution it fails to
capture the relevant qualitative aspects so critical to the health of
humans and nature (Schwartzman, 1996).

On a cosmological scale, the [increase in entropy in the universe is
inevitable]{.underline} as expressed in the Second Law, [but this very
increase is the necessary requirement for the **emergence** and
**maintenance of self-organized systems**. The debt of self-organizing
systems to "chaos" is the environmental increase in
entropy]{.underline}. As we shall see [sustainable societal
self-organization on the planet Earth is **only limited** by the
**low-entropy solar flux**, a limit with **no practical
consequences**]{.underline} far into the future, [with the entropic debt
paid as the **heat flux to space**, the **ultimate heat
sink**]{.underline}. This future, I argue, is only achievable by the
contingent outcome of global red-green struggle.

Given the mineral and fossil fuels reserves of the Earth's crust, the
\"economic system is\... doomed to \"run down\" as the low entropy
material resources on earth are dissipated and become unavailable\"
(Burkett, 2005, 135, quoting Georgescu-Roegen). [[We do **not** need
a]{.mark} **fallacious [fourth law to tell us]{.mark}
this**]{.underline}, the first and second laws provide sufficient
explanation. Without the use of incoming solar radiation, this system
will ultimately run out of available energy to do work. It is important
to point out that even without the use of incoming solar radiation as a
prime source of energy (aside from the low efficiency collection by
photosynthesis, the basis of agriculture), [this system is **not
isolated**]{.underline} since waste [heat is dissipated, ultimately
**radiated into space**]{.underline}. Nuclear energy, even fusion power
will only postpone this ultimate fate in a real economy limited to the
terrestrial environment since this energy source utilizes the finite
reserves of fissionable (or, in the future, fusionable) raw material.
**[The solar fusion reactor 93 million miles away]{.underline}** [is the
**true sustainable alternative**.]{.underline}

Thus the inescapable flaw of the fourth law is its neglect of the
possible flow of energy into/out of the system which is defined as
closed but not isolated. [By converting low entropy, high temperature
energy]{.underline} (solar radiation) [to high entropy, low temperature
heat, work can be produced to **recycle indefinitely**]{.underline}
(footnote 2). A caveat: indefinitely does not mean \"eternally\" (even
protons may have a finite half-life). To get concrete about this issue,
the relevant time scale is hundreds, even millions of years, not
eternity. Moreover, we should be considering the urgent prospect of
solarizing and demilitarizing human society in the 21st century, not in
the distant future, when humanity will plausibly expand outward in our
solar system and even further into the galaxy if it survives the present
epoch of destructive capital reproduction and future challenges.

Interestingly, in one text Georgescu-Roegen (1976, 8) incorrectly
defines "closed" as entailing no exchange of matter or energy with
\[[the]{.underline}\] [environment]{.underline} (recall that in
thermodynamics this [is defined as an **"isolated" system**,
not]{.underline} a **["closed" system]{.underline}**); he still
maintained that according to the second law matter along with energy is
subject to irrevocable dissipation. This confusion may be linked to his
pessimistic view on harnessing solar energy since the latter is the
relevant energy flux to consider for the closed but not isolated system
containing economic activity on the earth's surface. Thus, immediately
following his formulation of the fourth law in his 1980 text we find his
argument that there is no immediate prospect of solar energy (high
efficiency) going from feasible to viable, i.e., escaping from its
perpetual status as a parasite on fossil fuels, the dominant
contemporary energy source. Parenthetically, I found no evidence that
Georgescu-Roegen ever explicitly corrected himself by acknowledging his
definition of closed systems in this paper (Georgescu-Roegen 1976) was
wrong.

But Burkett claims that the concept of unavailable matter, "the
inevitability of friction, corrosion and decomposition" transcending
energy reductionism is critical to Georgescu-Roegen's insight.
Therefore, Burkett argues that since the "earth is open to massive solar
energy inflows but basically closed materially, it is not surprising
that low-entropy matter, not energy, emerges most clearly as the
ultimate constraint on human production" (Burkett, 2005, 119-120). I
welcome Burkett's implied rejection of Georgescu-Roegen's views on solar
viability. But his argument regarding the implications of "unavailable
matter" is highly problematic, recognizing that it is a partial retreat
from the strong version of the fourth law. On what time scale? What are
the real and potential fluxes of low entropy solar energy that can
reclaim this dissipated matter? Just what determines the
"unavailability" of high entropy matter? Does this alleged constraint
imply that near future migration to the moon or asteroid Belt is
necessary? Is waste heat a critical concern with respect to the
utilization of solar energy? And finally is this spectre of "unavailable
matter" really relevant to a future solarized physical economy? My short
answer to each of the previous three questions is: no.

What is the ultimate limit to global energy consumption? Presently the
global anthropogenic (human-created) energy flux is equal to 0.03% of
solar flux to land. Or, to put it another way, [humanity currently uses
an amount of energy]{.underline}, mostly from fossil fuels, equivalent
[to **0.03%**]{.underline} [of the solar energy reaching the land
surface of earth]{.underline}. Hence tapping this solar flux has a huge
potential as the energy basis of a solar utopia, with much smaller
impacts on global ecology than the present unsustainable reliance on
fossil fuels and nuclear power (Schwartzman, 1996). Thus, for a solar
energy source, the waste heat flux back into space is to a very good
first approximation not incremental to the natural infrared flux from
the Earth's surface, at least until such time as human energy demand
increases many hundreds of times. This is precisely the same argument
made by Kaberger and Mansson (2001) referenced but unfortunately not
addressed in Burkett's paper. Of course, I am not claiming that the
first basis for human civilization, low efficiency biomass energy, can
be the basis of this solarized economy. Only high-efficiency solar
energy can do this. The conflation of the two is common in
Neo-Malthusian treatment (e.g., Huesemann, 2001, 2003).

Recycling

Now, more specifically on the possibility of \"complete\" recycling in
an open system, Burkett's discussion of this issue (Burkett, 2005, 132)
lacks sufficient concreteness with respect to a real physical economy on
the earth's surface, consistent with Georgescu-Roegen and Daly's
abstract treatment. In practical terms, [[100%]{.mark} recycling
[efficiency is **not required**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Kaberger and
Mansson\'s (2001) illuminating discussion). Given the possibilities of a
future dematerialized solar economy, with a lower throughput than now,
and of course recognizing that current information technology is not
really dematerialized under current capital reproduction, as Burkett
rightfully argues, (2005,135), the huge solar flux is again the basis of
any ultimate limit to practical recycling on the earth\'s surface, and
not the entropic flux of waste heat. The latter would be dissipated
anyway by the absorption of solar energy on a land surface (with an
albedo, i.e., reflectivity, of about 0.3-0.4, with 0 being perfectly
absorbing and 1 being perfectly reflecting (like an ideal white
surface). Under these conditions, [the]{.underline} \"tremendous
[[increase in the entropy]{.mark} of the environment\']{.underline} or
the "adverse material effects of waste heat on eco-systems" [resulting
from recycling]{.underline} (Burkett, 2005,132-133) [[is an
**illusion**]{.underline}]{.mark} for a solarized economy as Kaberger
and Mansson (2001) show. Unfortunately, [Burkett's
discussion]{.underline} of the case made for the plausibility of total
recycling in an industrial society (citing Ayres, 1999) [does not
**confront the qualitative difference**]{.underline} between a solarized
and a depletable-energy-based economy.

Many will see the Young Labour Twitter account saga as yet another
battle in the perpetual civil war between the left and the right of
Labour, and as Young Labour---one of the last bastions of Corbynite
socialist supremacy---attempting to undermine Keir Starmer's leadership,
which they see as a betrayal of Labour values. While Starmer's
moderation on economic policy, as seen in his attempts to reposition the
Labour Party as business-friendly and his equivocations over tax policy,
may be misplaced overreactions to Corbyn's devastating loss in 2019, his
return to foreign policy more in line with international norms certainly
is not. Corbyn's anti-American, "anti-imperialist" politics not only
alienated much of the electorate (according to a 2020 poll, 65% of
people in the UK support NATO), but were only dubiously progressive. The
left was correct to call out America's foreign policy blunders in Iraq
and elsewhere---however, [constructive criticism of American overreach
has now been replaced by an **overarching**]{.underline},
**[hyper-reductive]{.underline}** [ideology that places America and
neoliberalism at the **centre** of the world's ills]{.underline}.
Corbyn's sympathy for Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime in Venezuela
and his flirtations with Hamas and Hezbollah are symptomatic of this
outlook. And [there is **no clearer example** of the manifestation of
this ideology than in the supposedly left-wing **criticisms of
NATO**]{.underline}, which Corbyn himself espouses.

Young Labour's preposterous [idea that it was]{.underline} "[NATO
aggression]{.underline}" [that precipitated the Russian invasion betrays
a **fundamental misunderstanding**]{.underline} [of NATO's
function]{.underline}. [NATO troops were deployed in Poland and the
Baltic states in a **defensive response**]{.underline} [to the **largest
military build-up** since **World War II**]{.underline}. [This was **not
escalatory brinkmanship**]{.underline} [by the US trying to impose its
will on the world]{.underline}. Unlike the Russians in Belarus and in
Russian-occupied Crimea, the [US offered **no shows of
force**]{.underline} and undertook no "military exercises," as they are
euphemistically called. [This was NATO operating at its most
**fundamental level**]{.underline}: [as an alliance for **mutual
defence**]{.underline}. [Countries that still bear **deep scars** from
**centuries** of **Russian imperialism**]{.underline} [were
**understandably concerned** at the potential of spillover from any
conflict in Ukraine and so]{.underline}---**[quite
reasonably]{.underline}**---[requested additional support from their
larger NATO allies]{.underline}. [It is rather **ironic**]{.underline}
[that the]{.underline} "[anti-imperialist]{.underline}" [contingent of
the left would have quite **happily abandoned**]{.underline} [the very
defensive commitments that have prevented these sovereign nations from
being **preyed on** by a **revanchist**, **imperialist**
Russia]{.underline}.

Some of NATO's left-wing critics argue that it is the organisation's
expansion into Eastern Europe that has forced Russia onto a paranoid
warpath, but this argument does not hold water either. [Countries join
NATO by **democratic consent**]{.underline}---[a fact that only the
**most absurd** CIA conspiracy theories can explain away]{.underline}.
[Had Russia been a **good neighbour** to its Eastern European former
client and satellite states, perhaps NATO would not have
expanded]{.underline} beyond Germany. [Instead, Russian
leaders]{.underline} since Boris Yeltsin [have viewed Russia's **former
sphere** as the country's **birth right**]{.underline}, [crushing
nascent separatist movements within Russia's own borders with **horrific
brutality**]{.underline}, [while supporting pro-Russian separatist
movements in **Moldova** and **Georgia**]{.underline}. This cynical
policy would have collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions
had it not devolved into the blood-and-soil imperialism that we see
playing out in the invasion of Ukraine. Yeltsin may be remembered
through rose-tinted glasses as a cheery drunkard, but his desperation to
maintain Russia's status as a superpower set Russian foreign policy on
course to where it is today. Putin has now simply taken that foreign
policy to its logical conclusion. No wonder much of Eastern Europe
wished to join NATO, the one alliance that could give these nations
credible anti-imperialist protection.

[NATO is too often **viewed reductively**]{.underline}, [as an American
sphere of influence, in much the same way as the **Warsaw Pact**
countries comprised a Soviet sphere of influence]{.underline}. [It is
true that a **degree of alignment** with some American foreign policy
goals and values is implicit in NATO membership, but this is in **no
way**]{.underline} [equivalent to the influence the Soviets exerted over
their client states during the Cold War]{.underline}. [NATO members are
**sovereign states** and have **acted against** US interests in the
past]{.underline}. For instance, Turkey recently (wrongly) invaded
America's Kurdish allies in Syria. Likewise, [NATO]{.underline}
(**[rightly]{.underline}**) **[refused]{.underline}** [US requests for
assistance during the invasion of **Iraq**]{.underline}. As [these
**concrete actions** demonstrate]{.underline}, [NATO is **far more**
than an American-led sphere and has remained **grounded**]{.underline}
[in the **democratic principles**]{.underline} [upon which it was
founded]{.underline}, even though the US is able to leverage more power
than it did at NATO's founding in 1949. [The characterisation of NATO as
a tool of American imperialism]{.underline}, then, [is **demonstrably
false**]{.underline}.

[Criticism of NATO is not limited to the realm of geopolitical
machinations]{.underline}. [Many on the left see it as a vessel for
American business interests and neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}.
[History has **shown otherwise**]{.underline}. It was Clement Attlee's
British Labour government that signed the North Atlantic Treaty in 1947,
founding NATO. And while Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that
signatories should "eliminate conflict in their international economic
policies" and "encourage economic collaboration," this did not prevent
Attlee's government from being one of the most transformative in British
history: it established the modern welfare state and continues to be
widely celebrated by the Labour left today. [**Norway** and
**Denmark**]{.underline}, [both **founding members** of
NATO]{.underline}, [are **flourishing** social democracies where social
democrats and **democratic socialists** have spent **more time** in
power than in opposition since 1949]{.underline}.

Clearly, [NATO **has not impeded** progressive political movements
within its member states]{.underline}. In fact, [the existence of NATO
has had **positive repercussions**]{.underline} [for the European
left]{.underline}. The [unification of Western Europe under a single
military alliance]{.underline} [forced member states to **abandon** the
**nationalist**]{.underline} [and **revanchist grudges**]{.underline}
[that had dogged European politics for **centuries**]{.underline}. The
political moderation this encouraged has meant that---even in those
European countries where social democrats have not had much political
success---the right-wing opposition generally takes the form of
Christian Democrats, who are far more moderate than the reactionary,
nationalist conservative parties that were prominent prior to World War
II. At the same time, the strength of NATO's collective opposition to
the Soviet Union prevented that brand of highly authoritarian and
reactionary socialism from gaining traction in Europe. Instead, leftist
movements have been largely characterised by a more liberal tradition,
which opposes state-sponsored violence and emphasises human rights.

[Far from propping up the military-industrial complex]{.underline}---as
NATO is often accused of doing---[mutual defence and the guarantee of
peace have allowed **defence spending** to be **dramatically
decreased**]{.underline} [throughout Europe]{.underline}. Part of this
decrease may be attributed to the end of the Cold War---but defence
spending has been on the decline since the 1960s and this is at least
partly due to the peace between Western European neighbours that NATO
has assured. In fact, defence spending has arguably declined too much.
Most nations in the alliance have still not met NATO's defence spending
target of 2% of GDP, leaving America to foot the remaining bill. While
this has meant that many European nations have been able to develop
their welfare states, this has been at the expense of Americans, who
still face a particularly vicious brand of capitalism with limited
safety nets.

As Germany's overnight policy shift following the invasion of Ukraine
has shown, committing to the 2% target is not a tall order. It would
enable us to maintain our collective defence while allowing America a
much-needed financial reprieve. It would also diminish America's
influence upon the alliance, allowing European nations more of a say on
collective defence policy and procurement. Hopefully, this would
encourage a shift away from the American military-industrial complex and
toward a more competitive, less monopolised defence industry, which
holds less sway over governments.

History is often viewed as an inexorable march of progress and
development from the barbarism of war to enlightened peace. This seems
to be the underlying thinking of NATO's left-wing detractors. But just
as Rome fell, [peace and progress are never inevitable, nor should they
ever be **taken for granted**]{.underline}. Francis Fukuyama's argument
that we have reached the end of history has been widely derided by many
on [the left]{.underline} who find the idea that humanity will not
progress past neoliberal democracy absurd. I agree with them---but [in
looking only forward, they have **failed** to **look
back**]{.underline}. [The fact that they see capitalist liberal
democracy as the **archenemy** of peace and progress is not only
**extraordinarily privileged**]{.underline} [but **terrifyingly
dangerous**]{.underline}. The west's terrible interventions in Iraq and
Afghanistan have confirmed this narrative for many. This thinking
explains Young Labour's tweets: NATO is to blame for Putin's invasion,
since neoliberalism is the sole force of evil in the world. However, [as
the tanks rolled into Ukraine, history returned once more to remind us
that there are **far darker**, **more dangerous** enemies of
progress]{.underline}. [It is these enemies that NATO continues to
**forestall** and, in doing so, allow for the **peace** and **progress**
of which]{.underline} we [Europeans are beneficiaries
today]{.underline}. While it is a tragedy that it has taken the whiplash
of war for us to look back at history, I hope these events may foster
newfound gratitude for NATO and the peace and progress that it has
helped achieve. I look forward to the day when the progressive left---of
which I am proud to be a part---will view NATO, alongside the NHS and
the welfare state, as one of Labour's greatest achievements.

In the wake of Russia's war against Ukraine, demand for NATO membership
has spiked once again, even in the historically neutral countries of
Finland and Sweden. Further south, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are
also desperately seeking a fast track to NATO membership.

[Many]{.underline} in the West [see NATO as a tool of U.S. imperialism
and empire]{.underline}, and in important ways it is. NATO has afforded
the United States the legitimacy to militaristically intervene abroad,
most notably in the case of Libya in 2011. NATO is both a cause and
effect of the United States' global hegemony via its grand strategy of
primacy, despite the end of Cold War rivalries.

[In the post-Cold War era, **however**, NATO **did not grow** simply
because the United States dictated it]{.underline}. [On the contrary,
**foreign demands** for security assurances have **consistently
spurred**]{.underline} [NATO's enlargement]{.underline} long before
Russia's war in Ukraine.

NATO's eastward enlargement is member-driven. Yet, both pro-NATO and

politics only through the **preferences** and **choices** of **Western

citizens]{.underline}. Even a more restrained U.S. foreign policy
requires an assessment of why [there remains so much **local demand**
for NATO]{.underline}, which is partially driven by the West's
complicity in spurring authoritarian regimes in Europe.

NATO Membership Was Popular in Eastern Europe

It is now clear to even casual observers why countries bordering Russia
have sought NATO membership, often with high public support at every
step of the way. These countries have been ringing the alarm on
escalating Russian aggression for decades.

And still, prominent Western voices, from [**conservative libertarians**
and]{.underline} European leftists to [**American neorealists** and Fox
News' **Tucker Carlson**, blame NATO's eastward expansion for Russia's
aggression. They claim that Ukraine's nonalignment is a **core national
interest** for Russia]{.underline}. [The Democratic Socialists of
America]{.underline} even [released a statement blaming Western
imperialist expansion]{.underline} for stoking Russia's legitimate
fears. Of course, [Russian foreign policy perpetuates this **same
narrative**]{.underline}.

But as neo-realist John Mearsheimer has himself admitted, Ukraine
presents a vital national interest to Russia because "[Putin is a **19th
Century** man]{.underline}." In other words, [Ukraine's NATO aspirations
are **only threats** to Russian core interests when seen through the
lens of its **imperial past**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} renewed
imperialistic **[ambitions]{.underline}**. [Also telling is Putin's
recent statement on **Sweden and Finland**'s]{.underline} pending NATO
membership applications. [He proclaimed that Russia]{.underline} "[has
**no problem**]{.underline} ... [these countries do not pose a **direct
threat** to Russia]{.underline}." [Only Ukraine poses a problem. Yet,
**neither Ukraine nor NATO** directly threatens Russia's **borders**,
**sovereignty**, or **physical survival**]{.underline} [in **any clear
way**]{.underline}. Moreover, [**until now**, Ukraine had **little
chance**]{.underline} [of joining NATO]{.underline} in the coming years.
Therefore, [it is **imperialism**, **not** core interests or **NATO
enlargement**, that drives Russian aggression]{.underline} in Ukraine.

These prominent voices do not consider that **[Russian
aggression]{.underline}** [has been the **primary reason**]{.underline}
[Baltic and Eastern European countries have **sought**]{.underline}
[NATO's protection]{.underline}. At its most basic iteration, [Russia
aims to halt NATO expansion to preserve a **privileged sphere of
influence**]{.underline} [and **domination** in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. In contrast, [Eastern European countries seek NATO
membership to ensure their **survival**]{.underline} [as **sovereign**
nation-states against a regional imperial power]{.underline}. [NATO,
**with all its flaws**, has been a **guarantor of
sovereignty**]{.underline} [for its European members]{.underline}.

It is not surprising that [new members have shown **strong public
support**]{.underline} [for NATO]{.underline} prior to accession. As
shown in the table below, ten out of eleven countries that joined NATO
in the 2000s did so with public support over 50 percent, often even over
70 percent, prior to membership. The only country that bucked this trend
was Montenegro, which at the time of polling in 2017 was divided between
pro-Western and pro-Russian factions.

Public opinion data taken from the Pew Research Center in 2021 continues
to show strong, consistent support for NATO among Eastern European and
Balkan countries.

Note: Publicly-available poll sources hyperlinked within the table. Most

[Therefore, it is **misleading** to use the language of NATO "expanding
into]{.underline}" the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999, the
Baltic [countries]{.underline} in 2004, and then the Balkan states in
2009 and onward. Furthermore, [NATO is **not a monolith**]{.underline}.
[Member states **disagree ardently** at times, even against **key U.S.
demands**]{.underline} [as in]{.underline} the case of the 2003
intervention in **[Iraq]{.underline}**, [where NATO had **no
involvement**]{.underline} [given member objections]{.underline}.

[In trying to condemn Western imperialism, such passive language
**perpetuates imperialist notions** and **withholds agency** from
non-Western citizens]{.underline}.

[Eastern and Southern European countries **actively sought**
membership]{.underline} in the alliance, [**prioritizing** NATO
accession in their foreign and domestic policies for
**decades**]{.underline}. [When these countries finally joined the
alliance, many citizens **cheered in relief**]{.underline}.

Even countries that do not directly border Russia are enthusiastic about
NATO membership, particularly in the Western Balkans. This is because
the United States is not the only imperialist power afoot.

The Case for NATO in the Western Balkans

While Western imperialism should be condemned, so should the non-Western
variety. [In Eastern Europe, it was the Soviet Union that embodied the
**worst of imperialism**]{.underline}. [Today it is Russia, with its
numerous **military invasions** and **occupations** in the region since
1999]{.underline}.

In the Western Balkans, [the United States and NATO have not posed an
existential threat to the citizens of **Albania**, **Croatia**,
**Bosnia** and **Herzegovina**, **Greece**, and **Kosovo**]{.underline}.
Instead, these citizens worry about threats to their homelands stemming
from regional hegemons and revisionist powers, including Russia, Serbia,
and Turkey.

For instance, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia, citizens
and leaders fear the rise of a revisionist Serbia echoing the
aspirations of a Serbian-led Yugoslavia, now called Serb World. [The
**genocides** and **gruesome wars** of the 1990s remain fresh and
terrifying reminders of such **existential fears**, as **mass graves**
of **civilian victims**, continue to be uncovered]{.underline}. For
others, it is the rise of a revisionist Turkey, renewed land grabs, the
suppression of minority rights in Greece, or fears of a Russian-backed
coup in Montenegro that spark dread. The youngest state in the region,
Kosovo, fears for its very survival as it vies for United Nations (UN)
recognition against Serbia's derecognition campaigns and
hyper-nationalist mobilizations, as well as Russia's opposition.

Balkan and Eastern European [support for NATO membership **originates**
from a **history of oppression** by regional powers, prompting **strong
demands** for **external protection**]{.underline}. [Any scholar or
policymaker who does not acknowledge this **local reality** will
**reproduce incomplete perspectives**]{.underline} [or worse, promote
accounts that **hollow out local agency**]{.underline}.

Even Anti-Imperialists Cite Imperialist Solutions

[Discussing NATO]{.underline} enlargement within Eastern Europe and the
Balkans [without delving into the **complexities** of **regional
history** and **politics** is an **imperialist project**]{.underline}.
[When Western actors explain NATO membership through the lens of
**Western machinations** and **blame** European states for their NATO
aspirations, they are **really saying** that Eastern European and Balkan
countries should be content to serve as **buffer states** between
empires and accept their lot as **second-class** nations]{.underline}.

Ironically, [even when famous scholars]{.underline} such as Mearsheimer
[**critique** U.S. imperialism and militarism, they still manage to
**promote a world** in which **only the United States** has **agency**
and **only** the United States' **great power rivals
matter**]{.underline}.

The West can engage in self-criticism of its foreign policy without
blaming the victims of other imperialist powers. In fact, [the West can
begin its **moral reckoning** by understanding and accepting how its
**accommodation of Russia**]{.underline} and other local aggressors [has
**inflamed regional fears**]{.underline} [and **magnified demands** for
NATO enlargement]{.underline}.

For instance, [by buying Russian energy on Russia's terms
and]{.underline} remaining ~~mute~~ [or even **legitimizing** Russia's
invasions of its weaker neighbors, the United States and European Union
have perpetuated **corruption**]{.underline} [and
**authoritarianism**]{.underline} [in Russia and Europe]{.underline}. By
propping up authoritarian "ethnocrat" leaders in the Western Balkans in
the name of regional stability, the West has inflamed regional
imperialists, encouraged separatist agendas, and exacerbated instability
and tension. All of this only fuels regional demands for NATO
protection.

Instead of blaming the victims of another imperialist power, the West
should focus on its own complicity in enabling regional aggressors.

Other countries have agency in international relations; NATO membership
proves it. [**Any account** that portrays NATO's eastward expansion only
through the lens of **Western politics dismisses** Eastern European and
Balkan countries as **powerless pawns** of empire]{.underline}.

Of course, [NATO's obituary has been written many times
before]{.underline}. In the opening to Why NATO Endures, quietly one of
the best books on the alliance, Wallace J. Thies wryly notes that Henry
[Kissinger]{.underline} owns the unique distinction of having [declared
the alliance to be in serious peril in each of the first six decades of
NATO's existence]{.underline}.\[5\] For the time being, [**better
policies** on how NATO is used should be the **focus**, rather than
scrapping it altogether]{.underline} or withdrawing U.S. support. Key to
this will be working to enhance strategic stability between the alliance
and Russia.

DE-MYSTIFYING THE PAST

To some extent, NATO is a victim of its own myth-making. Support for the
alliance is often couched in somber testaments to the wisdom of the
founders and odes to the selfless nobility of collective defense. The
reality is quite different.

Interestingly, the main strategic rationale for NATO that emerges in the
pages of Thies' book is as a complement to the Marshall Plan: just as
funds from that initiative would allow the Europeans to rebuild their
economies, NATO would remove the burden from the European allies of
having to devote scarce money to their militaries. It would also provide
psychological reinforcement to nations still traumatized by the Second
World War, living in Stalin's long shadow. Once the West European
economies had stabilized and rebounded, they could---in theory---take on
a greater share of their defense and the United States could
recede.\[6\]

Thus, in the late 1940s, many U.S. officials didn't expect to base
American troops in Europe indefinitely.\[7\] Nor did they necessarily
expect them to have to fight. While the Soviets might attempt mischief
within their own sphere of influence---as seen in the 1948 coup in
Czechoslovakia and the blockade of West Berlin---their ability and
willingness to go beyond that was considered limited by key thinkers
such as George Kennan, who believed the Soviet military and people too
spent from the Second World War to threaten Western Europe.\[8\]
Moreover, Stalin was seen as distinct from Hitler in terms of his
willingness to pursue risk. While the Soviet leader might try to
capitalize on existing chaos and weakness, he wasn't disposed to the
outright aggression that characterized the Nazi regime.\[9\]

But in a prescient prelude to the defensibility issues surrounding the
admission of the Baltic states, not a great deal of thought was given to
how Western Europe would actually be defended when the alliance was
formed---at least in terms of conventional forces. Of course, in April
1949, America still had a nuclear monopoly.

The Soviet detonation of its own atomic device in August 1949 changed
the U.S. calculus somewhat, but it was events around the world a year
later that truly focused America's mind on what it had signed up for in
NATO. The conventional defeats suffered by the U.S. military in the
opening stage of the Korean War ,  as much as any development, led to a
realistic discussion of what collective defense would really look like
in Europe---almost eighteen months after the alliance's inception.\[10\]
It was only then that planners on both sides of the Atlantic began to
take seriously the practical questions of defensibility and to set up
integrated military structures---such as the Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe, or SHAPE---to coordinate those efforts.\[11\]
Subsequently, NATO's role as an institution and U.S. force deployments
in Europe would both take on permanence.

The ad hoc nature of this process is the point worth underscoring. NATO
was not formed by strategic gods implementing their divine wisdom; it
was the result of hardworking government officials and political leaders
doing their best to deal with the security challenges of the day using
the means at their disposal. That is all the alliance has ever been, and
we exalt its past at the risk of its future.

[NATO AS AN **INSTRUMENT**, NOT A THEOLOGY]{.underline}

Understanding that NATO outlasted its original purpose---to allow the
Europeans to focus on rebuilding their economies in tandem with the
Marshall Plan---well before the end of the Cold War illustrates that the
alliance has always been an adaptable instrument. It is true that some
twentieth-century luminaries such as Kennan and Dwight Eisenhower didn't
foresee NATO evolving into a permanent fixture in European security at
its inception.\[12\] But should that have stopped the alliance from
becoming an effective military bulwark against the Soviets as the Cold
War developed and demands on the alliance evolved?

Just as it adapted and changed throughout its early history, [NATO's
purpose now can be **whatever is required**]{.underline}. This doesn't
mean that NATO should do everything---or be everywhere. The past thirty
years have shown that there are some things the alliance does better
than others and also that there are questionable benefits to unending
expansion of its membership. President George W. Bush's support for
Georgian and Ukrainian membership at the 2008 Bucharest Summit is the
most prominent example of this and likely contributed to both the August
War in Georgia and Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.\[13\]

But here, too, perspective is needed. [Because the alliance should
consider ending expansion doesn't mean previous rounds were inherently
mistakes]{.underline}. [Enlargement permanently settled the **Polish
Question**]{.underline}---[which provided grist for a **century and a
half** of European **wars**]{.underline}---[and also has]{.underline} on
balance [contributed to **stability** between Russia and the Baltic
states]{.underline}. Likewise, [being realistic about the failure of the
Libya intervention doesn't mean the 1995 operation to stop **ethnic
cleansing** in **Bosnia** was also a mistake]{.underline}. [The 1999
Kosovo intervention probably falls somewhere in the
middle]{.underline}.\[14\]

[NATO frankly does its best work when no one hears about
it]{.underline}. [Its strength lies in the **day-to-day** military
cooperation it fosters and the general sense of **deterrence** and
**stability** it promotes]{.underline}. These contributions are neither
as dramatic as facing off against the Red Army at the height of the Cold
War, nor as controversial as the Libyan intervention, but they would be
glaring in their absence.

[Why arbitrarily remove the structure that provides that
stability]{.underline}---[both with **Russia** and also among NATO's
many **disparate members**]{.underline}? Withdrawing NATO protection
from the Baltic states or the smaller Balkan members, for example, will
not preclude the possibility of their becoming involved in a war with
Russia or Serbia; just the opposite, it could make it more likely. Once
such a conflict begins, is it certain the United States will not be
entangled or affected even if it is no longer actively participating in
NATO?

Again, it is worth reiterating that NATO is an instrument. Many of the
alliance's opponents may actually be opposed to the way the United
States and its partners have employed force since the end of the Cold
War---especially in the case of operations falling under the rubric of
regime change. [The argument]{.underline}, implicit in Posen's OpEd, for
example, [is that NATO needs to be taken away from reckless U.S.
policymakers to prevent them from future adventures]{.underline}.

[This argument is **backwards**]{.underline}. [Yes, the **consequences**
of]{.underline} three decades of continuous [military operations should
be examined.]{.underline} [But]{.underline} increasing national
restraint and [making **better strategic decisions** seems like a
**smarter path** than summarily scrapping an **effective**]{.underline},
[**tested tool** that could play an **essential role** in a wiser
foreign policy]{.underline}.

lie**]{.underline}\"; ThePrint;

KL\]

The great NATO enlargement debate never ends. In the 1990s, U.S.
officials and academics argued about whether pushing the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization into Eastern Europe was likely to sustain the
post-Cold War peace or prematurely end it. More recently, critics have
charged that Russia's war in Ukraine is a natural response to the
aggressive expansion of America's most powerful alliance.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."

The "blame NATO" argument tells a story of hubris, arrogance and
tragedy. It holds that there was a golden chance for lasting peace in
Europe, but the U.S. threw it all away. Rather than conciliating a
defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it by expanding a vast
military alliance up to Russia's borders and even into the former Soviet
Union. This pursuit of American hegemony in a liberal-democratic guise
eventually provoked a violent rebuke.

In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia and Ukraine are just the
natural response of one great power whose vital interests are being
heedlessly threatened by another.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part,
to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But the idea
that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
geopolitically bizarre.

Far from being a historic blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the
**great American successes**]{.underline} of the post-Cold War era. [Far
from being the act of a domineering superpower, it was part of a long
tradition of **vulnerable states begging** to join America's liberal
empire]{.underline}. [And far from posing a mortal threat to Moscow,
NATO enlargement actually provided Russia with far **greater
security**]{.underline} [than it could have provided
itself]{.underline}.

NATO's big bang

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

[To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember
something]{.underline} that nearly [everyone has now
forgotten]{.underline}: [There was **no guarantee** that Europe would be
mostly **stable**, **peaceful** and **democratic** after the Cold
War]{.underline}. In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO
expansion as a catastrophe once warned that [a post-Cold War Europe
could become a **violent hellscape**]{.underline}.

[It wasn't an outlandish scenario]{.underline}. [A reunified Germany
might once again try to **dominate** its neighbors]{.underline}; [the
old enmity between Moscow and Berlin could **reignite**]{.underline}.
[The collapse of Soviet influence]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [could
liberate]{.underline} those [states to pursue]{.underline}
long-suppressed [**territorial claims** and **nationalist
agendas**]{.underline}. [**Ethnic tensions** and **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline} [might **explode**]{.underline} [as the
Cold War order crumbled]{.underline}.

[If the U.S. pulled back]{.underline} once the Soviet threat was gone,
[there would be no]{.underline} extra-European [superpower to **put out
fires**]{.underline} [on a continent with lots of **geopolitical
kindling**]{.underline}. "[The prospect of major crises, even
wars]{.underline}, in Europe [is likely to **increase
dramatically**]{.underline}," Mearsheimer predicted in 1990.

[NATO enlargement was the **logical answer**]{.underline} to these
fears. Expansion was a way of binding a reunified Germany to the West
and surrounding it with democratic allies. [Joining NATO required new
members to lay aside any **revanchist designs**, while allowing them to
pursue]{.underline} economic and **[political reforms]{.underline}**
[rather than investing heavily in military capabilities]{.underline} to
defend their newly won autonomy.

[NATO's move]{.underline} to the east [also ensured that Poland and
other states that easily could have built **nuclear weapons** didn't
need to, because they had **American protection**]{.underline}. Most
important, enlargement kept the U.S. firmly planted in Europe, by
preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from
becoming obsolete.

[**No other initiative** could have accomplished these
objectives]{.underline}. Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose
security cooperation agreements with former Soviet-bloc states ---
didn't offer the ironclad guarantees that came with NATO membership.
([If you want to understand the difference between]{.underline}
"[security partner]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[NATO
ally]{.underline}**," [just look at what is happening]{.underline} today
[to **Ukraine**]{.underline}, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

[Only American power]{.underline} and promises [could provide
**stability**]{.underline} in Europe, [and NATO was the continent's
**critical link**]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}. Since 1949,
Washington had tamped down rivalries between old enemies such as France
and Germany, while also protecting them from external threats. After
1991, NATO expansion took this zone of peace, prosperity and cooperation
that had emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern Europe as
well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier," protecting the continent from dangers
within and without.

Russia as the victim

Today, of course, the critics don't buy this account. They argue that
NATO expansion represented crude power politics, as the U.S. exploited
the Soviet collapse to engorge its own empire. What resulted, pundits
such as Thomas Friedman contend, was a sort of Weimar Russia --- a
country whose dignity was affronted, security imperiled and democracy
undermined by a harsh, humiliating peace.

There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy began to
wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration saw NATO
expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent.

In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues --- including
disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian economy in the
late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's relationship with the
West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.

First, all policies have costs. [The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites]{.underline} --- although we often
forget that Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, bringing Russia into elite Western institutions
such as the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in the
intervention in Bosnia in 1995-96. [Yet the cost of not expanding NATO
might have been **forfeiting** much of the stability that initiative
provided]{.underline}. [**Trade-offs** are **inevitable** in foreign
policy]{.underline}: [There was no magic middle path]{.underline} that
would have provided all the benefits with none of the costs.

Second, [if NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it
was a remarkably **benign**]{.underline} [and **consensual** form of
empire]{.underline}. When Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did
so at the urging of the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians. [The Baltic
countries and others were soon **banging at the door**]{.underline}.
[The states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were
**desperate** to **join America**'s sphere of influence, because they
were desperate to **leave Moscow's**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline}, too, [was part of an **older pattern**]{.underline}:
[The U.S. has often extended its influence by
"**invitation**]{.underline}" [rather than imposition]{.underline}. [The
creation of NATO]{.underline} in 1949 [was mostly a European
idea]{.underline}: [Countries]{.underline} that were [terrified of
Moscow sought protection from Washington]{.underline}. One reason
Putin's wars to keep countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so
abhorrent to Americans is that the U.S. empire has trouble keeping
members out.

Putin may not see it that way. All that matters to him is that the
mightiest peacetime alliance in history has crept closer to Russian
soil. But here a third fact becomes relevant: Russia was one of the
biggest beneficiaries of NATO's move east.

Making Russia safer

Open terrain has often left Russia vulnerable to invasion and
instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany
and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern Europe to wreak havoc on
Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason why the great strategist
George Kennan opposed NATO expansion --- because it would surely
re-activate this fear of encroachment from the west.

Yet this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat. The
alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign troops
in Eastern Europe. After the Cold War, America steadily withdrew most of
its troops and all of its heavy armor from the continent. U.S. allies
engaged in a veritable race to disarm.

The prospect that NATO could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was
laughable. What the alliance could do was tame the perils that might
otherwise have menaced the Russian state.

Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled snugly into an
alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket. NATO, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could "play a
containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry about a
nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy.

NATO expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack.

Putin's easy excuse

So what went wrong? Why couldn't Putin make his peace with a larger
NATO?

Part of the answer is that NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in
the sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony
in its near-abroad. The Soviet Union, and [the Russian
empire]{.underline} before it, [had traditionally sought to **control
countries** along their frontiers and used **brutal means**]{.underline}
to do it. [To say that NATO expansion caused Russian belligerence is
thus to make an **extremely dubious assertion**]{.underline}: [that
absent NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a
**satisfied**]{.underline}, **[status quo]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}.

And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire. [For 20 years, Putin has been **publicly lusting** after the
sphere of influence that the Soviet Union once enjoyed]{.underline}.
NATO expansion stood athwart that ambition, by giving Moscow's former
vassals the ability to resist its pressure.

[NATO]{.underline} also [threatened]{.underline} a certain type of
Russian government --- [an autocracy that was **never secure** in its
own rule]{.underline}. [A democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded
being neighbors]{.underline} with Western-leaning democracies, because
political liberty in those countries wouldn't have threatened to set a
subversive example for anti-Putin Russians.

Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early 2000s, and as Putin's
popularity declined with the Russian economy after 2008, the imperative
of preventing ideological spillover from a U.S.-backed democratic
community loomed large.

So Putin began pushing back against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he
invaded Georgia, a country that was moving --- too slowly for its own
safety --- toward the West. Since 2014, he has been waging war against
Ukraine, in hopes of rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's
westward drift. America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's
program of violent coercion.

West missed the danger signs

To be sure, U.S. officials made mistakes along the way. Because Russia
was prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s, Washington
acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without really
considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon has thus
been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of NATO's
eastern flank.

As Russia regained its strength, U.S. officials also failed to grasp the
danger of provoking Putin without adequately deterring him. When, in
2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for Georgia and Ukraine but
issued a vague statement saying that they would someday join the
alliance, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving Putin both the
pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by tearing those two
countries apart.

Yet there is a curious morality in [accounts]{.underline} that [blame
the West, which sought to protect **vulnerable** states]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe, [for the current carnage, rather than blaming Putin, who
has worked to **dismember** and **intimidate** those
countries]{.underline}. It is sloppy thinking to tally up the costs of
NATO expansion without considering the historic achievements of a policy
that served American, European and even certain Russian interests
remarkably well.

And if nothing else, NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between
Moscow and the democratic world to the east after one Cold War --- a

Cooperation\"; Center for American Progress;

Fighting climate change is often considered a valuable but secondary
goal for many security-minded politicians who see it as a distraction
from the real threats posed by terrorism in Syria, Russian aggression in
Europe, and the potential of a nuclear Iran. But [even a **hard-nosed
realist**]{.underline} [should support international cooperation on
climate change]{.underline}. [Due to climate change's impact as a
"**threat multiplier**]{.underline}," [the benefits of cooperation now
**outweigh** the potential gap in relative gains]{.underline} between
cooperating countries. [When climate change is viewed as an **external
threat**]{.underline} similar to a hostile state, [**realist theory**
concludes]{.underline} that [the United States should ally with other
threatened countries]{.underline} against it until the threat subsides.

Realism and the relative gains problem

Realism, one of the grand theories of international relations, is a
worldview and set of assumptions about the way the world works that
dates back to Thucydides of ancient Greece. [Realism has]{.underline}
long [been the **dominant strand**]{.underline} [of thinking in U.S.
national security circles and **undergirds** much of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}. Realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz, focus on
the state as the primary actor in international politics; assume anarchy
in the international system is the principal force shaping state action;
and believe states are primarily concerned with their own power and
security---often at the expense of mutually beneficial cooperation.

Realist scholars and practitioners have traditionally spent little time
devoted to climate change compared with adherents of liberalism---the
other grand theory of international relations. For realist theorists
focused on hard power and interstate warfare, debates about peak carbon
dioxide emissions and global temperature goals are ancillary at best to
the primary challenges facing states. Furthermore, realists such as
Joseph Grieco are skeptical of the potential for international
cooperation on most issues, arguing that even when cooperation would be
mutually beneficial to both parties, states often fail to cooperate
because one state would gain more than the other.

This is known as the relative gains problem. Realists argue that states
are not only concerned with maximizing their own absolute gains but they
are also concerned with their gains relative to the gains of other
states out of concern that they may end up relatively weaker even if
they are stronger in absolute terms.

But [the relative gains problem **does not prevent** all forms of
cooperation]{.underline}, even when one state gains disproportionately.
[For realists, the main reason that a state would cooperate is if the
gains of cooperation are so large that they **overcome** the relative
gains problem]{.underline}---a threshold that is usually only met when
states face an external security threat.

Climate change as an external security threat

For years, scientists have warned of the potential implications of the
current wave of changes to the Earth's climate. 2014 was the hottest
year ever recorded and continued a trend of rising sea levels that
threaten major coastal cities and even some island nations, as well as
more intense and frequent severe weather events, increased
desertification of vital arable land, and climate-driven migration,
which has contributed to the European refugee crisis.

If the most pessimistic projections are realized without international
action, the planet could warm by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end
of this century. To put it another way, that is the same as the global
temperature change that occurred during the last ice age but at 10 times
the speed. [Failure to **limit** climate change and better manage
**global resources**]{.underline} [will soon disrupt the **physical**
and **economic** security of citizens]{.underline} across the planet.

Climate change does not fit the traditional realist image of a security
threat, but as [climate change **intensifies** existing conflicts and
**exacerbates instability**]{.underline}, [states are increasingly being
forced to **grapple with** and **defend against** it, just as they would
a hostile adversary]{.underline}. Whether through the extreme weather
events that have killed 2.5 million people since 1980, the rising sea
levels that threaten to swallow island nations such as the Maldives, or
the droughts that doubled the price of wheat in the lead up to the 2011
Arab uprisings, climate change is threatening lives, destabilizing
states, and disrupting economies in ways an adversarial state might
using different means.

[U.S. intelligence, military, and diplomatic agencies are already
thinking through the **security implications**]{.underline} [of a
warming planet]{.underline}, an acidifying ocean, and an increase in
extreme weather events. In 2008, the National Intelligence Council began
a multiyear project analyzing the implications of climate change for
U.S. national security interests between 2008 and 2030 and concluded
that climate change would likely exacerbate political instability,
migration crises, and intrastate warfare. [The U.S. Department of
Defense's]{.underline} "2010 Quadrennial Defense [Review]{.underline}
Report" [identified climate change as one of the **key
issues**]{.underline} [that will shape the future security
environment]{.underline}, affecting the U.S. military's capabilities,
missions, and operations. The U.S. Department of State's 2015
"Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review" highlighted climate
change as a "national and global security threat," as well as one of the
department's four strategic priorities.

For U.S. security officials, climate change now meets the high threshold
used by realists for international cooperation, regardless of a
potential relative gains gap.

An alliance against climate change

Realists such as Stephen Walt argue that [when faced with a hostile
external threat, threatened states will **band together**]{.underline},
[creating an alliance to counter the threat]{.underline} and to restore
a balance of power in which no one actor can overpower the others. These
alliances are usually narrow and short-lived, lasting until the
threat---whether it be Napoleonic France or the Islamic State of Iraq
and al-Sham---recedes. If the threat of climate change is now comparable
to the threat of a hostile state, then [the realist response would be to
develop an **international alliance** against climate
change]{.underline}.

President Barack Obama's administration has largely adopted this
approach, enlisting not only traditional European and Japanese allies in
the effort but also nontraditional partners such as China, India,
Brazil, and Indonesia. The direct and indirect threat posed by climate
change has altered the calculus of countries such as China and India,
which previously cited the principle of common but differentiated
responsibilities as a reason for not fully contributing to a global
effort to fight climate change. This is in part a relative gains
argument that says unified action to combat climate change would
disproportionately hurt economically developing and newly industrialized
states in light of differing national circumstances. The diverse range
of countries participating in the alliance against climate change
reflects the new geopolitics of the issue, in which both developing and
developed countries are affected by, contribute to, and thus are
responsible for fighting the problem.

As with alliances against hostile states, the alliance against climate
change should not be expected to remake the global order or resolve
disagreements with partner countries on other issues. [As history has
shown]{.underline}, however, [the United States can **successfully
work** with nontraditional partners or even competitor states to combat
a common threat]{.underline}, whether improving relations with China to
counter the Soviet Union in the 1970s or leading a diverse coalition of
nations to fight piracy off the Horn of Africa more recently.

Abstract Creating institutions that effectively manage interstate
conflict is a priority for policy-makers. In this article we demonstrate
that military allies are well positioned to influence the
crisis-bargaining behavior of both challengers and targets in ways that
often lead to peace. Through a three-player game-theoretic model, we
demonstrate that a target's alliances not only have an effect on the
demand that the challenger makes, but also on the behavior of the
target. When a target values an alliance highly, an ally's
recommendation for settlement can encourage the target to concede to
demands without further escalation. [Our **statistical analysis**
provides evidence in support of the theoretical finding]{.underline}.
Allies can both deter challengers and restrain partners, and as a
result, can encourage peaceful behavior not only from adversaries, but
from member states as well. [Our **study** thus sheds **new
light**]{.underline} [on the role of military alliances as potential
conflict management devices]{.underline}.

Interstate wars cost more than thirty million lives during the twentieth
century, and nine new interstate wars have begun since the end of the
Cold War.1 Finding ways to avoid interstate disputes and to manage those
that arise short of war, therefore, is a major priority for
policy-makers and for scholars of international relations. [It is **well
recognized**]{.underline} [that military alliances play a role in
conflict prevention by deterring attacks]{.underline} on their members,
but less attention has been paid to the role of allies in conflict
management. We argue that [allies]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}
coercive [actors with a **stake** in the dispute]{.underline},
[are]{.underline} sometimes [especially **well positioned**]{.underline}
[to help resolve disputes]{.underline} short of war.

We examine the influence of allies to a target state on crisis
bargaining. Not only do [allies have an interest in the outcome of
crisis bargaining]{.underline} but [they]{.underline} also may [have the
ability to make **credible threats**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} both
the challenger and the target that [influence the bargaining stances of
**both disputants**]{.underline}. [A target's ally can make it clear to
the challenger]{.underline} that [if the challenger demands too much,
the ally will intervene]{.underline} in the war on behalf of the target.
[But]{.underline} a target's ally may also be able to make a credible
threat to the target---that [if the target refuses to concede to a
demand that the ally finds reasonable, the ally will not
intervene]{.underline} in the war on the target's behalf. [The ally
may]{.underline} therefore [have a **moderating effect** not only on the
challenger's demand]{.underline}, [but also on the **target's
response**]{.underline}, making peaceful settlement more likely. We
refer to the former as the deterrence effect of alliances, and the
latter as the restraining effect of alliances.

To study this process, we develop a three-player game-theoretic model.
Most recent game-theoretic models of crisis bargaining assume that a
challenger and a target bargain without influence from any outside
states.2 Yet, allies who would be obligated to intervene in a war that
develops between a challenger and target will often cast a shadow over
crisis negotiations. Dyadic bargaining models that assume a challenger
and a target bargain without influence from any outside states are
inadequate for our understanding of conflict dynamics in such
situations.

We derive a number of propositions about the relationships between such
factors as the costs of war, the value of the stakes, and the value of
an alliance and specific outcomes. The demands challengers make, the
conditions under which targets concede demands without fighting, and the
conditions under which targets resist demands militarily are all
influenced by the presence of an ally. [Given the **richness** of our
**formal results**]{.underline}, we make no attempt to test all of the
implications of the model. We do, however, discuss a few stylized cases
that highlight different outcomes, and [we provide a **large-N**
empirical test of one proposition drawn from the model]{.underline}. We
find support for the claim that when a target depends heavily on an
alliance for security, that target is less likely to resist a challenge
militarily.

Our [**research** suggests that military alliances have an influence in
international politics **well beyond** collaborative war fighting and
deterrence]{.underline}. [Alliances **deter conflicts**, which in itself
is a **force for peace**, but even when challengers are not
deterred]{.underline} from making demands, [allies can facilitate
**peaceful settlement**]{.underline}. [Alliances can be important
institutions for **conflict management**]{.underline}, [not only among
their members, but between their members and outside states as
well]{.underline}. As such, [alliances can be broad institutions for
**peace** that play an **important role** in maintaining]{.underline}
the **[stability]{.underline}** of the international system.3

#### NATO peacekeeping [mitigates]{.underline} war intensity. 

PSO = peace support operations

PKO = peacekeeping operations

**Sällström 21** \[Robin Sällström, Bachelor Thesis, Peace and Conflict
Studies C, Department of Peace and Conflict Studies, Uppsala University;
1-2021; \"Keeping the peace?: The effect of NATO and UN peace operations
on war intensity\"; Uppsala University;
https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1518905/FULLTEXT01.pdf; KL\]

The purpose of [this paper]{.underline} was to [conduct a
comparative]{.underline} case **[study]{.underline}** [analysing the
effect of NATO PSOs and UN PKOs on **war intensity**]{.underline}, to
help fill the existing gap concerning disaggregated research on non-UN
peacekeeping operations. To do so, this paper focused on comparing NATO
peace support operations and UN peacekeeping operations abilities to
mitigate war intensity through a structured focused comparison and
aspects of theory-testing process tracing. However, results of the
analysis did not confirm the proposed theory that UN PKOs would mitigate
war intensity to a greater degree than NATO PSOs, but rather seem to
imply that some [NATO PSO]{.underline} might [**reduce** war intensity
to a **greater extent**]{.underline} [than UN PKOs]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the results also imply that NATOs **seemingly biased**
behaviour **does not**]{.underline} necessarily **[hamper]{.underline}**
[their abilities to provide security guarantees, nor does it necessarily
hinder NATO from using persuasion effectively]{.underline}.

Thus, some possible policy implication of this study is that
[Peacekeeping organisations can **use force** against warring parties in
an armed conflict **without hampering** potential peacekeeping efforts,
and that strict peacekeeper impartiality might **hamper** conflict
mitigation]{.underline}. Furthermore, this paper also indicates that
[NATO peacekeepers are suitable alternative to UN
peacekeepers]{.underline} when the UN is either unable or unwilling to
send peacekeepers themselves, and that [NATO PSOs can **mitigate** war
intensity to a]{.underline} similar or [even **greater degree** than UN
PKOs.]{.underline}

KL\]

[Reality]{.underline}, however, [tells a **different
story**]{.underline}. Over the last twenty years, [numerous **empirical
studies**]{.underline} [have examined the role of]{.underline}
third-party [peacekeeping in reducing violence around the
world]{.underline}. [The data **overwhelmingly** reveal that
peacekeeping]{.underline}, especially UN peacekeeping, [is surprisingly
**effective**]{.underline}. [Using **different datasets** and
**statistical models**]{.underline}, [leveraging different time periods
and measuring peacekeeping in]{.underline} somewhat [different
ways]{.underline}, **[dozens]{.underline}** [of researchers at
**different universities**]{.underline}, [with **diverse funding**
streams and **different preferences**, have all found that peacekeeping
has a **large**]{.underline}, **[positive]{.underline}** [and
**statistically significant**]{.underline} [effect on reducing violence
of **all sorts**]{.underline}. Despite the very real problems associated
with UN [peacekeeping]{.underline}, it [is **remarkably effective** at
bringing peace]{.underline}.

This review article has three goals. The first is to summarize the
results of past empirical research to move the debate beyond the
question of whether peacekeeping works to the more pressing questions of
how, when and why it works. The second goal is to reveal the limitations
of current quantitative studies in order to identify areas in which
scholars can make big, new contributions to the field. The final goal is
to propose a new research agenda that is heavily evaluative --- one that
informs policy makers about the specific practices, mission
compositions, and mandates that work, and also identifies the local,
regional, and international conditions that amplify or diminish
peacekeeping's success. This type of research could help reduce the
costs of peacekeeping operations (PKOs), eliminate some of the negative
consequences of interventions and potentially save even more lives.

What the Current Evidence Reveals

[Numerous **large-n** statistical studies have explored the
relationship]{.underline} between third-party peacekeeping and different
forms of violence (Dorussen 2014; Gizelis, Dorussen and Petrova 2016);
Di Salvatore and Ruggeri 2017; Sandler 2017). [What is **most
striking**]{.underline} [about these studies is the **consistency** of
their findings]{.underline}. [Almost all of them find that peacekeeping
is **highly effective**]{.underline} [at preventing violence **before**
it begins, reducing violence in the **midst** of war and preventing
violence from **recurring** once it has **ended**]{.underline}. All else
equal, [countries and regions that receive peacekeeping missions
experience **less armed conflict**, fewer **civilian** and
combatant]{.underline} **[deaths]{.underline}**, [fewer **mass
killings**]{.underline}, [longer periods of post-conflict
**peace**]{.underline} [and fewer repeat wars]{.underline} than those
that do not receive peacekeepers. [This relationship]{.underline} ---
[between peacekeeping and **lower levels** of violence]{.underline} ---
[is **so consistent**]{.underline} [across different large-n analyses
that it has become one of the **strongest findings**]{.underline} [in
the **international relations** literature to date]{.underline}.

The power of peacekeeping is all the more striking given that the UN
tends to intervene in the toughest cases. Multiple scholarly studies
have found that the UN Security Council tends to send peacekeepers to
countries with more violence, particularly bad governments and ongoing
conflict (Beardsley and Schmidt 2012; Costalli 2013; de Jonge Oudraat
1996; Fortna 2004a; Fortna 2008a; Gilligan and Sergenti 2008; Gilligan
and Stedman 2003; Hegre, Hultman and Nygard 2019 Ruggeri, Dorussen, and
Gizelis 2017). The most recent study by Ruggeri, Dorussen and Gizelis
(2018) found that UN peacekeepers are deployed to places experiencing
active conflict. Using geographically and temporally disaggregated data
on UN peacekeepers' deployment in eight African countries between 1989
and 2006, they find that [peacekeepers tend to be deployed to the
**dangerous frontlines** of a conflict]{.underline}. Their research did
reveal some problems with deployment. Peacekeepers tended to arrive late
and be sent to conflict zones near urban areas, ignoring violence
further afield. But [the fact that peacekeepers often go to the **most
demanding** places]{.underline} (even if late and disproportionately
urban) [suggests that academic studies have]{.underline} probably
**[underestimated]{.underline}** [the effectiveness of peacekeeping at
reducing violence]{.underline}.

[These findings do not imply that peacekeeping works **all the
time**]{.underline}, or as efficiently and successfully as it could.
There are many well-known cases such as Bosnia and Rwanda where UN
peacekeeping failed. There are also additional cases such as those in
South Sudan and Malí where peacekeeping missions are not progressing
well (Autesserre 2010; Autesserre 2014; Day 2019; Howard 2008; Van der
Lijn 2019).1 Moreover, we understand that the data and analyses of even
the best quantitative studies are imperfect. Analysis of peacekeeping
and violence is constrained by the messy and sometimes unreliable nature
of data on death rates, the potentially untenable assumptions made by
scholars in employing statistical models in cross-national and
cross-conflict analysis, and the hard constraints (both practical and
ethical) on scholars' ability to randomize treatments in ways that make
airtight causal inferences possible. The findings in the quantitative
literature can also appear mixed or contradictory on some topics, when
in fact [the disparity is due to **different** research designs and
empirical strategies]{.underline}. [This can be **confusing** and can
also **distract**]{.underline} [from the **bigger** and **more
important** picture, which is that peacekeeping **works amazingly
well**]{.underline} [given its many challenges]{.underline}.

[In what follows we present **overwhelming evidence**]{.underline} [from
more than **two dozen** studies that peacekeepers]{.underline}: (1)
[reduce civilian and military deaths]{.underline}, (2) [prevent the
spread of violence]{.underline}, (3) [help]{.underline} belligerents
[achieve peace and]{.underline} (4) [help countries maintain the
post-conflict peace]{.underline}.2 We also provide an overview of the
general problems related to peacekeeping that the qualitative literature
explores.

Last week, the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Foreign Policy---a
bipartisan advocacy group calling for congressional oversight of
America's lengthy list of military interventions abroad---released the
results of a survey that show broad public support for Congress to
reclaim its constitutional prerogatives in the exercise of foreign
policy (see Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution) and for fewer
US military interventions generally. Undertaken last November by J.
Wallin Opinion Research, [the new survey revealed]{.underline} "[a
national voter population that is **largely skeptical**]{.underline} of
the practicality or benefits [of **military intervention**
overseas]{.underline}, including both the physical involvement of the US
military and also extending to military aid in the form of funds or
equipment as well."

Bill Dolbow, the spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Foreign
Policy, said, "We started this initiative to give a voice to the people
and the people have spoken---Congress needs to enact more oversight
before intervening in conflict abroad."

The headline findings show, among other things, that
**[86.4]{.underline}** [percent of those surveyed feel the American
military should be used only as a **last resort**]{.underline}, [while
**57** percent feel that US military aid to foreign countries is
**counterproductive**]{.underline}. The latter sentiment "increases
significantly" when involving countries like Saudi Arabia, with 63.9
percent saying military aid---including money and weapons---should not
be provided to such countries.

Low**]{.underline}\"; Foreign Policy;

In August 2020, the man who is now U.S. President Joe [Biden's deputy
national security advisor]{.underline}, Jonathan Finer, co-[wrote a
privately circulated **memo** titled]{.underline} "**[Ending the
'Forever Wars]{.underline}**.'" Written with two others who have since
joined the Biden administration, Christine Abizaid and Brett Rosenberg,
the memo laid out a detailed program for extricating the United States
from the two-decade-long campaign dubbed the "war on terror" that began
on 9/11.

Six months into Biden's presidency, the administration has said little
about its longer-term plans in dealing with Islamist terrorist groups
around the world, apart from announcing the withdrawal of U.S. troops
from Afghanistan. [And yet airstrikes by **drones** and other U.S.
**kinetic operations**]{.underline} in trouble spots around the world,
outside conventional battlefields, [have **dramatically
dropped**]{.underline} since Biden took office. [The president imposed a
**partial moratorium**]{.underline} [as his team conducts an **intensive
review**]{.underline} [of **every aspect** of America's global
counterterrorism efforts]{.underline}, which have spread over two
decades from Afghanistan post-9/11 to "Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Libya,
Somalia, and parts of the Maghreb, Southeast Asia and West and Central
Africa," as the Finer memo notes.

This limited stand-down is happening in spite of rare exceptions like
this week's airstrikes by U.S. F-15s and F-16s on storage facilities
used by Iran-backed militias in Iraq.

And while Finer's 13-page memo has hardly become official administration
policy, it's notable that [Biden's]{.underline} senior [team seems to be
**acting**]{.underline} on some of its recommendations---and that Finer
himself is one of the top officials working on a broad review of
counterterrorism policy led by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

One of the recommendations enacted from the memo is **[to]{.underline}**
"\[[**r\]aise the threshold** for use of force]{.underline}." This
[includes eliminating]{.underline} "[strikes against
individuals]{.underline} whose specific identities are not known and
[who are not]{.underline} identified as tied to immediate \[U.S.\] force
protection concerns or otherwise [posing an **imminent
threat**]{.underline}" to the United States, as the memo puts it.

According to the Finer memo, "[Operations requiring force should be
considered **extraordinary**, require **approval** at the highest
levels, and pursued only when **absolutely necessary**, for instance, to
avert a clear and **present danger** to **U.S. persons**]{.underline}."

The [Biden administration has since **restricted** field commanders from
making **independent decisions**]{.underline} on strikes outside of
conventional battlefield zones. [Under the new rules the]{.underline}
"[military and the C.I.A. must now obtain **White House
permission**]{.underline} [to attack terrorism suspects]{.underline} in
poorly governed places where there are scant American ground troops,
like Somalia and Yemen," the New York Times reported on March 3. A
forthcoming directive is also being prepared by the Department of
Defense laying out stricter guidelines for limiting civilian casualties
in overseas attacks and setting new and higher thresholds for future
U.S. attacks.

Already [there has been a **dramatic reduction**]{.underline} [of drone
attacks and other types of airstrikes]{.underline}, which once reached
thousands a year. "The \[United States\] appears to be in a holding
pattern in most conflict theaters that it still has a presence
in---[with **no** reported strikes in Yemen, Libya, Pakistan, or Somalia
since Biden took office]{.underline}. [U.S. strikes are
continuing]{.underline} in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria---though [at
**historically low** rates]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Chris Woods
of [the]{.underline} London-based **[Airwars]{.underline}** [monitoring
organization]{.underline}, considered perhaps [the **most reliable**
tracker of U.S. airstrikes around the world]{.underline}. "What the
strategic plan here is, other than for Afghanistan, we don't yet know."

Until Biden took office, the U.S. military had often followed a pattern
of secretly striking alleged terrorists from the air without any
accountability or announcement: no casualty lists, no public
after-action reports, and few follow-up investigations about collateral
damage. "Cumulatively we're talking tens of thousands of civilians
conservatively who have died in America's wars since 9/11"---almost all
without acknowledgement, Woods said.

No truly reliable figures exist, especially for drones, since for most
of its existence the drone program has been shrouded in secrecy. In his
final year in office, President Barack Obama briefly opened the window,
revealing that during his term drone strikes, conventional airstrikes,
or cruise missiles used outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan
had killed as many as 116 civilians. But other independent monitors put
the figures much higher. Obama's successor, Donald Trump, made the
numbers classified again.

[The cutback in drone strikes is **one element** of a **much bigger
rethink**]{.underline}. One Biden administration official who has been
involved in discussions said that while a policy isn't yet set and it's
not clear when it will be, the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11 is an
important target date in what is amounting to an exhaustive evaluation
of the overseas terrorist threat. The [Biden]{.underline}
administration, he said, [is now focused on **demoting**]{.underline}
[the Islamist terrorist threat]{.underline} on the priority list of U.S.
strategic interests.

"[Biden **wants** one of his major foreign policy accomplishments to be
to **end the forever wars**]{.underline}," said this official, who would
speak about internal deliberations only on condition of anonymity. [The
president is expected to]{.underline} deliver a speech that will sketch
out the broad outlines, including possibly setting new
[restrict]{.underline}ive and transparent drone rules, announcing the
shutdown of **[Guantánamo Bay]{.underline}** ([where only about **40**
prisoners remain out of a total of nearly **800**]{.underline}), [and

"[He wants to show]{.underline} we made the world safer, to say that [we
are taking a **multilateral approach**]{.underline} [and returning to
**smart power**, reducing our military footprint and increasing our
**diplomatic footprint**]{.underline}, and adapting to new threats of
today," the official said.

The White House team is also seeking a broader reorientation toward what
the president has called "the battles for the next 20 years, not the
last 20," including climate change, the threat from China, COVID-19-type
pandemics, and America's economic and social problems at home.

"[At the Department of Defense]{.underline} but also in the U.S.
intelligence community, [counterterrorism has taken a **back
seat**]{.underline}," said Seth Jones, a senior vice president and
counterterrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "The focus of efforts is primarily on how to deal with China
and to some degree Russia. And you don't need drones to deal with either
of them. It's just not a priority, and that's a big shift certainly from
the Obama years and partly the Trump years."

KL\]

When it comes to fighting war without soldiers, the weaponized drone has
been an essential tool --- perhaps the most iconic weapon in the United
States' post-9/11 war on terrorism. Given Biden's pledge that
over-the-horizon counterterrorism operations would continue around the
world, it would be reasonable to expect that drone use would have
continued --- or become even more common. In fact, the opposite has
happened. [The U.S. has **stopped bombing** Afghanistan **entirely**
since the withdrawal, and strikes are **down dramatically**]{.underline}
[in other theaters as well]{.underline}. The long-standing practice of
American drones regularly raining missiles on suspected terrorists and
unfortunate civilians has ended --- at least for now. One might suspect
that this drop-off was the result of growing public criticism of the
drone war and recent revelations about the civilian casualties it has
caused. But the decline predates the revelations; [it's a trend that
began **several years** ago]{.underline}.

What happened to the drone war? Why, in the new over-the-horizon era,
are drones being used so rarely? And what are the implications of a
world in which dozens of nations now have the deadly capability --- and
are using it more often, not less?

The drop-off

The United States' first drone strike came on the first day of the U.S.
war in Afghanistan --- Oct. 7, 2001 --- when a CIA Predator drone fired
a Hellfire missile near Kandahar, narrowly missing Taliban leader Mullah
Omar. The escalation that followed was swift and steep. In the two
decades since, the U.S. has used weaponized drones thousands of times as
part of air campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia,
Syria and Yemen.

Since Biden took office, there have been just 39 declared U.S. strikes
(including air, drone and ground operations) in Iraq and Syria. In
Somalia, nine strikes have been carried out under Biden compared with
276 under Donald Trump. The Biden administration has ordered only two
reported strikes in Yemen and none in Pakistan, once ground zero of the
American drone war. (There were 122 strikes in 2010.)

Overall, [U.S. airstrikes]{.underline} (including both drones and manned
strikes) [were down **42 percent**]{.underline} [in 2021 from the year
before]{.underline} --- [falling from 1,459 to **852**.]{.underline}
[That may still seem like a lot, but consider that there were nearly
**13,000**]{.underline} [strikes in 2016]{.underline}, when the war
against ISIS was at its height.

To the extent this development has received any media coverage,
observers have tended to credit the Biden administration. In fact, the
decline began earlier. "The bulk of what's being discussed is the result
of trends began under the Trump administration, although I wouldn't
really frame it as the result of Trump's specific policy decisions, as
the way the wars are going," David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at
New America, told Grid.

According to the monitoring site Airwars, March 2019 was the last month
when the U.S.-led coalition launched more than 100 air and artillery
strikes in Iraq and Syria. (There were 389.) Not coincidentally, this
was the month that the last remnants of ISIS's "caliphate" fell. After
that, the tempo of strikes fell dramatically; in all of 2020, there were
only 201. Similarly, in Yemen, the number of airstrikes peaked at 131 in
2017, according to New America. In 2020, there were only four. In
Pakistan, the steep drop-off in drone strikes began even earlier, in the
second half of the Obama presidency.

height="3.180823490813648in"}

According to Sterman, "the one exception that I definitely would
acknowledge and think is clearly something to do [with]{.underline}
Biden is **[Somalia]{.underline}**, where [there was a high pace of
strikes under Trump]{.underline}. [Biden just]{.underline} [**completely
paused** it]{.underline}." The Biden administration did carry out at
least four strikes against al-Shabaab militants in Somalia in the summer
of 2021, but there's been no sign of a return to the pace of strikes
under Trump.

Bombing less --- or less to bomb?

There are signs that while the drop-off predates his presidency, [Biden
is **listening** to the drone war's critics]{.underline}.

Shortly after taking office, [Biden **quietly imposed**]{.underline}
[limits on drone strikes and commando raids]{.underline} outside of
declared war zones like Afghanistan and Syria. [The CIA and military now
must obtain White House permission]{.underline} for strikes in Yemen and
Somalia, among other theaters of counterterror operations. (Under Trump,
commanders had been allowed to make their own decisions on strikes in
those countries.) [Biden also ordered a **review** of U.S. targeting
policy]{.underline}. Several analysts I spoke with suggested [commanders
may be **reluctant** to order strikes until the **new guidelines** are
in place]{.underline}.

But the overall drop-off may be driven less by White House policy than
by changes on the battlefield. In short, there may be fewer strikes
because there are fewer targets.

The original al-Qaeda, the group that carried out the 9/11 attacks, is a
shell of its former self and hasn't been linked to an attack against the
U.S. in years. ISIS at one point threatened to redraw the map of the
Middle East, but since 2019, it has largely been driven underground.
This isn't to say that there still aren't violent Islamist militant
groups operating around the world --- there are likely even more of them
than there were in 2001 --- but the vast majority are focused on local
grievances and enemies rather than what Osama bin Laden once called the
"far enemy": the United States.

In the specific case of Afghanistan, Robert Grenier, former CIA head of
counterterrorism and a Grid contributor, points out that drone strikes
there and across the border in Pakistan were always less about
counterterrorism per se than about preventing attacks against NATO and
Afghan forces: "With the drawdown of U.S. and NATO troops, there was a
commensurate drop in the number of attacks against them, and a similar
drop in drone operations designed to protect them."

Now that the U.S.-backed Afghan government has fallen to the Taliban,
Grenier said "the current administration is focused on maintaining an
over-the-horizon capability, rather than a pattern of actual
over-the-horizon strikes. As of now, militants of various stripes in
Afghanistan, to include those who are ISIS affiliated, do not appear to
be much focused on Americans."

#### Intervention is an ethical policy tool that [reduces]{.underline} global violence. 

**Gritten 20** (William Gritten; Contributing Writer @ the Week; 3/2/20;
\"In defense of \'endless\' wars\"; *The Week*;
https://theweek.com/articles/896649/defense-endless-wars)

[As the]{.underline} two-decade-long U.S. [war in Afghanistan comes to
its]{.underline} technical [end]{.underline} with a peace deal signed
between the U.S. and the Taliban, [both poles of the current political
spectrum have concluded]{.underline}, along with most of the country,
[that the massive investment of resources and lives in this conflict
was]{.underline} materially, not to mention morally,
[fruitless]{.underline}. Western confidence has been undermined, and the
belief that prosperous democracies can project their power for good now
seems anachronistic --- naive to some, arrogant to others. [There is a
**consensus**: It is time to \"**end our endless wars**.\"]{.underline}

However, [[it is **dangerous** to draw such an **unqualified
conclusion**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair learned
[from **[Kosovo]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- where [[intervention
**stopped a war**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and
**Rwanda**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- where [[calls for intervention went
**unheeded** and]{.mark} up to [a **million people were
butchered**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- that [inaction can in fact be
**shameful**]{.underline}, and this fostered a categorical conviction in
righteous humanitarian intervention that propelled them into the follies
of this millennium\'s first decade in Iraq and Afghanistan. The belief
that liberalism can be forced on societies at gunpoint was then handed a
crusading energy by the shock of 9/11. But [now, the received wisdom is
intervention does not work]{.underline}, but what if this new conviction
propels us into the next decade\'s disaster? [Why must we **swing
between such unnuanced extremes?**]{.underline}

It is important we understand that [sometimes **failing to intervene**
is the **more costly decision**, both **morally** and in terms of
**national self-interest**]{.underline}.

[When it comes to [the **Afghan** ]{.mark}**war**, the mistake was **not
in the intervention itself**, rather in **how it was
managed**]{.underline}. Soon [after the initial invasion
\[**defeated**\]]{.underline} ~~crippled~~ [the **Taliban**]{.underline}
and sent it into hiding, its [leadership consistently asked to meet at
the negotiating table, but were **rebuffed**]{.underline}.
Understandably, Washington\'s blood was up after September 2001, and the
Bush administration was categorical: \"We do not negotiate with
terrorists.\"

[This was a **mistake**. Talks could have brought a reduction in NATO
involvement under **better terms** than are being agreed now. The
intervention could have been conducted with a **pragmatism** that
acknowledged the **impossibility of all-out military victory** and
brought the Taliban to the table **early**]{.underline}. The [**NATO
[presence]{.mark}** could still have [brought]{.mark} the country what
it did: [**huge improvements** in **ag**]{.mark}**riculture**,
**[infrastructure]{.mark} projects** like the successful Dahla Dam
rebuild, [the]{.mark} **social [empowerment of women]{.mark}**[, and
**health initiatives**]{.mark} like the one [that **vaccinated children
nationwide.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Writing in The Atlantic, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is right to
decry the \"approach to foreign policy that relies on the U.S. military
to achieve the impossible, instead of doing the hard work of
statecraft.\" But this isn\'t, as she claims, an argument for ending the
endless wars: We can, and should, ask the military to do the possible,
while running intensive statecraft at the same time.

Many think the cost of military intervention is simply too high --- but
there are times when the cost of doing nothing is far greater. This is
the case, for example, in Syria, where more than 1 million internal
refugees face what the U.N. calls the \"biggest humanitarian horror
story of the 21st century.\"

Learning the wrong lessons from Western intervention in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the [Obama]{.underline} administration [chose not to
provide the rebels who rose up in 2011\'s Arab Spring with the support
necessary to **topple** Syrian President Bashar al-**Assad**. [A
**stronger**]{.mark} **U.S. [commitment]{.mark}** early on [could have
**prevented ISIS from rising**]{.mark} **in Syria** --- [and prevented
the **huge, expensive war**]{.mark} against ISIS [that
followed]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would also have helped stem the tide
of refugees that continues to fuel de-democratizing forces across
Europe. [It could also have meant the end of the]{.underline} rapacious,
[**vindictive Assad**, who now **terrorizes his people** for **daring to
resist him**]{.underline}. [Intervening in Syria **now** would be a
mistake, and this is another lesson: To be effective, intervention must
be **timely**.]{.underline}

[The U.S. did maintain a limited troop presence [in]{.mark} Northeastern
**[Syria]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but, to President Trump, these troops
were simply more Americans involved in an endless war. As far as he saw
it, the generals and national security advisers who urged him to let
them stay were just repeating the conventions that got the U.S. too
deeply involved in the Middle East to begin with. So, [[Trump **got the
troops** out --- and all **hell broke loose**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Turkey and Assad moved to **fill the vacuum**, America\'s **Kurdish
allies** were **betrayed**, **ISIS fighters** escaped captivity, and a
**million** homeless Syrians now face **devastation**.]{.underline}

[[In **Libya**]{.mark}, another country whose civil war seems to be
reaching a nightmarish crescendo after a botched Western intervention,
[the problem was **not in the intervention**]{.mark} **per se**,
[but]{.mark} in, as]{.underline} former President [Obama himself
diagnosed, \"[**failing** to plan for the **day
after**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} That failure, he contends, was his worst
mistake as president. Obama shared Trump\'s instinct for retrenchment
--- most people agree with them both today --- but here he directly
admits that instinct was wrong: [It was [**more** investment]{.mark},
**not less**, that [would have prevented today\'s Libyan]{.mark}
hellscape]{.underline}. But why did Obama fail to commit fully after
Moammar Gaddafi was toppled? Surely it was the
[[mistakes]{.underline}]{.mark} made in Iraq and Afghanistan that
drained, and continue to drain, Western governments of the confidence in
their ability to do good through action.

[[There are **many examples** of **effective intervention**]{.mark} and
**long-term presence**[,]{.mark} and they\'re **not obscure**:
[**Japan**, **Taiwan**, and **Eastern Europe**]{.mark} have their own,
complex, imperfect stories, but [each is a **relatively stable,
prosperous beneficiary** of **many decades** of]{.mark} political and
military [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United Nations Command in
South Korea maintains a presence amid a war that has technically never
ended since its outbreak in 1950.

Another, lesser known example is [the British-led United Nations
involvement in Sierra Leone, in which military intervention ended a
**violent decade-long civil war**]{.underline}. [The Revolutionary
United Front]{.underline}, whose leaders were convicted of war crimes in
2009, [was bearing down on Freetown, the country\'s capital, but the
British intervention **stopped them short** and **brought
peace**]{.underline}. What\'s more, [**long-term engagement** in the
conflict\'s wake **bolstered institutions** and **restored
stability.**]{.underline} [Sierra Leone is still a country with
problems, but it is **no longer a country at war**]{.underline}. It is
no coincidence that this successful campaign began in 2000, at the
height of Western confidence, before the tragedy of 9/11 turned
intervention from something undertaken with discernment, strategy, and
planning, into a solipsistic exercise in emotional therapy, craving
glorious, impossible, all out victory.

\"The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the
statesman and commander have to make is to establish \... the kind of
war on which they are embarking,\" wrote the Prussian General Carl Von
Clausewitz, in Vom Kriege (On War), 200 years ago, \"neither mistaking
it for, nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its
nature.\" Failing to heed this guidance led to mistakes in Iraq and
Afghanistan, but heeding it, as Western governments could have done in
Syria soon after the Arab Spring by giving decisive support to
legitimate democratic forces, can lead to intervention that works.

[After the Afghanistan chapter closes, the world will **continue to
present Western governments** with **stark** and **urgent decisions** on
**whether they should intervene**. If the horror currently developing in
**Idlib** province were unfolding, instead, in 1999, then
Washington]{.underline}, intoxicated with recent successes and moral
certitude, [would be working much harder to protect the refugees --- and
that would be the **right thing to do. Caution** is always appropriate,
but the window of opportunity is **invariably narrow**, and **closing
fast.**]{.underline}

[As a broader geopolitical strategy, **[well-judged
intervention]{.mark}** plus its sometimes-necessary accompaniment ---
**indefinite military effort** --- [can help **keep**]{.mark} **the
forces of [totalitarianism at bay]{.mark}**[;]{.mark}]{.underline} not
everywhere, and never without diplomatic engagement. [Rather than
**vacillating** between **opposite doctrines** that say intervening is
**good or not,** or realistic or not, democracies should be **engaging
their collective thought** to **get better at it**]{.underline}. We must
remember that the destructive force behind the Afghanistan conflict was
the collapse of the Twin Towers, not the principle of intervention
itself, or even that of endless war.

#### [External]{.underline} humanitarian intervention is necessary\-\--emphasis on 'local solutions' guarantees [genocide]{.underline} and [protracted conflict]{.underline}

**Stockton 98** -- former lecturer of sociology, Executive Director of
the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (Nicholas, "In Defence of
Humanitarianism," Disasters, 22.4)

There are four [major [challenges to the humanitarian
system]{.mark}]{.underline} that have caused great damage to its
reputation. These [[can be summarised as]{.underline}]{.mark}: The
demonisation of the \'undeserving\' disaster victim and asylum seeker.
The \'new [[pragmatism\' that favours]{.mark} the resolution of \'local
problems\' by [local actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. The growing hegemony
of the theory of welfare dependency. The end of the \'age of innocence\'
in media relations with aid agencies. The \`undeserving\' disaster
victim Perhaps the most insidious challenge to humanitarian values has
been the widely reported claim that many disaster victims have no one
but themselves to blame. Indeed, in the case of Rwanda it has become a
commonplace that the \'extremist Hutu\' leadership was able to sustain
its political control over the refugee population by their astute
manipulation of humanitarian aid. This story line was and is used by
many, including African Rights, the US and Rwandan governments, to
justify the forced repatriation of most of the refugees (or \'fugitive
Hutu extremists\' as they have been labelled), and the \'disappearance\'
of the remainder. [[This argument]{.mark} has also [suited many]{.mark}
official [aid agencies who found]{.mark} in [it a]{.mark}n excellent
[reason to]{.mark}]{.underline} suspend humanitarian aid and to [be
\'pragmatic\', i.e. to **[do nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline},
irrespective of any further distress experienced by this group of pariah
refugees. This argument is flawed in many places. First, by no means all
refugees were guilty of genocide. Indeed some 750,000 of those forcibly
repatriated or \'lost in Zaire\' were children under five. Over 1.5
million were under 16 years of age. Of those who disappeared in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, some 50,000 were children under five,
the majority of whom had never set foot in Rwanda. Second, withholding
humanitarian assistance on the grounds that those in need may be
criminals is like suggesting that the ambulance service should conduct
triage on the basis of alleged criminality rather than upon the clinical
urgency of each case. This is the arbitrary application of punishment
before trial and it constitutes cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment
on a massive scale. Such treatment is arguably a crime against humanity
as the right to life applies to all people. This right is non-derogable
and cannot be legally removed as an act of capricious vengeance. Third,
rights are indivisible and inalienable. [The [withholding of]{.mark}
humanitarian [aid]{.mark}]{.underline} as a substitute for judicial
action [[is]{.mark} ethically and morally
[indefensible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, extra-judicial killings and
deaths arbitrarily meted out through \'humanitarian sanctions\' simply
serve to reinforce fear, prejudice and to fuel the cycle of violence,
revenge and retribution. The concept of the \'undeserving victim\' is
therefore morally and ethically untenable, and practically
counter-productive. It represents an outright rejection of the
principles of humanity, impartiality and universalism, fundamental
tenets of human rights and humanitarian principles. When
operationalised, the evidence from the Great Lakes and elsewhere is that
the abandonment of humanitarian principles in fact reinforces the
culture of impunity\--it does not, as many had naively predicted,
eradicate it. The \`new pragmatists\': local solutions for local
problems As well as blaming the victims, [many [commentators]{.mark}
have [claim]{.mark}ed that [aid]{.mark} [prolongs suffering]{.mark} as
it obviates]{.underline} the need for local people to invent [local
solutions]{.underline} and that it undermines political accountability
and the social contract between citizen and state. Warlords can tear
countries to shreds in the full knowledge that the humanitarian system
will clear up the mess afterwards, and in effect, subsidise the human
costs of warfare. Furthermore, as humanitarian aid does not discriminate
between just and unjust causes, it consequently acts as quartermaster to
all parties to any conflict and thereby prolongs warfare, irrespective
of any moral and ethical considerations. Humanitarian aid also diverts
attention away from long-term political solutions and focuses solely
upon treating symptoms. With no prospect of international humanitarian
action, local leaders would be obliged to act more humanely and
responsibly. [[This]{.mark} argument [assumes]{.mark} that [the \'root
cause\']{.mark} of the problem [is]{.mark} to be found and [resolved
locally]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, forget colonialism,
imperialism and apartheid, forget structural adjustment, forget
international debt, forget economic globalisation, forget the
international arms trade and forget rapacious corporate behaviour.
Forget covert superpower military and intelligence operations. While not
going to the other extreme by claiming that external agency is to blame
entirely for the post-Cold War increase in the numbers of internal
conflicts, these external forces can surely not be completely absolved
of all responsibility either. Available evidence suggests that
international aid is a drop in the ocean compared to war economies. For
example, total international aid to Afghanistan stands at about \$120
million per annum. The UK street value of Afghanistan\'s annual
production of narcotics is an estimated \$15 billion. This is about 150
times more than is spent annually on international aid to Afghanistan
and perhaps five times the amount spent on humanitarian aid globally in
1997. If only an estimated \$45 million is paid to Afghan farmers, the
remainder is presumably shared out between international drug dealers
and Afghan \'warlords\'. This would suggest that cutting humanitarian
aid would have little or no impact upon the ability of the Afghans, and
their foreign sponsors, to wage war, nor do many in Afghanistan believe
that it would persuade the warlords to shoulder the burden of the
humanitarian programme and spend less on waging war.(n5) Criminalised
economies obviously thrive on lawlessness and the collapse of civil
authority. Embargoes on humanitarian aid can however strengthen the hold
that warlords and drugs barons have over already desperate people. [Bad
as well as good local solutions also exist and [it is very hard to see
how humanitarian assistance]{.mark} necessarily [favours]{.mark} [only
bad]{.mark},]{.underline} or conversely, only good local
[[solutions]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Were it not so tragic, [it would
be]{.mark} **almost [laughable]{.mark}** [to suggest that
without]{.mark} humanitarian [aid wars and natural disasters would
stop.]{.mark} It is like saying that we can prevent traffic accidents
and fires by abolishing ambulances and fire-engines. [Confusing
correlation with causation is a]{.mark} **potentially [deadly
error]{.mark}** [in this]{.mark} policy
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the cessation of
humanitarian aid to Rwandan refugees in 1996, the wars in the region
have all heated up and tens of thousands have died. Some speak about the
resumption of the genocide in Rwanda. This contrasts with a lull in
political violence in the region [[during the height of the humanitarian
programme]{.mark} in 1995 and 1996]{.underline}. Arguably, [[the Great
Lakes was a more peaceful place]{.mark} with international humanitarian
aid and protection than it has become without it]{.underline}. Yet
[humanitarian [protection was]{.mark}]{.underline} quite deliberately
[[suspended and]{.underline}]{.mark} tens of [[thousands]{.mark} of
people [were sacrificed on the altar of]{.mark} a]{.underline}
convenient combination of political correctness and short-term financial
expediency that seem to underpin the \'new pragmatists\', \'do no harm\'
and [[\'local solutions\']{.mark} policies. [Cutting]{.mark}
humanitarian [assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} as a punishment for waging
war [[is]{.mark} now [advocated]{.mark} by some [as a]{.mark} global
[panacea for ending conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [only likely [result is]{.mark} that the
[victims of war will have their sentences enhanced]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Finally, and perhaps most crucially, those who are willing to trade
lives and suffering today for political gains tomorrow should perhaps
examine the reliability of economic, political and social forecasting.
The demonstration of causation and attribution in a globalised
environment is perhaps more difficult than ever. The application of \'do
no harm\' policies is tantamount to playing God\--a deadly, perhaps
totalitarian business to indulge in without the benefit of 20:20 future
vision, a faculty which is conspicuous by its obvious absence. There is
no firmly established relationship between the provision of humanitarian
aid and the prolongation of war, either in quantitative or in
qualitative terms. Aid policies, including the application of
\'humanitarian\' sanctions or embargoes, founded upon such arguments are
built upon weak theory and anecdote only. Much of the \'new
pragmatists\' argument is been captured in the phrase \'humanitarianism
should not be used as a substitute for political action\' which most
prominently surfaced from the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance
to Rwanda (Borton et al., 1996). In co-opting this argument, the \'new
pragmatists\' have slightly modified the sentence, with a profound
transformation in meaning and implication. For example, a British
Foreign Office official writes that \'humanitarianism as a substitute
for political action is unsatisfactory\' (Evans, 1997). Does that mean
that the UK will not provide humanitarian assistance if it is seen to be
at odds with its political interests? Such an argument travesties the
actual meaning of the Joint Evaluation\'s conclusion which might well
have included a caveat to the effect that political action (or inaction)
should not be used as a substitute for humanitarian action. [This lesson
very clearly emerges from the latest study of international assistance
co-ordination in the Great Lakes]{.underline} (Lautze et al., 1998).
[The failure to mount coherent]{.underline} political and military
[interventions in 1994 allowed the genocide to happen. Again, [in
1996/7]{.mark}, some blame for tens of thousands of predictable deaths
in the Great Lakes region must be attributed to the failure (or
subversion) of international political will]{.underline} to guarantee
protective asylum or custody for those at risk (see, for example,
Stockton, 1996). [In this case [**\'local solutions\'** were applied,
while]{.mark} international [humanitarians]{.mark} mainly [watched
in]{.mark} frustrated impotence and [exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Does anyone now wish to claim this as a great success?

#### Even if humanitarianism has flaws, it is more effective than non-intervention\-\--representing the harm is better than sweeping under the rug

**Stockton 98** -- former lecturer of sociology, Executive Director of
the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (Nicholas, "In Defence of
Humanitarianism," Disasters, 22.4)

As many as 100 NGOs are said to have turned up to \'help\' in Goma in
1994 (Borton et al., 1996). The place was awash with the modern symbols
of international aid: T-shirts, car stickers and flags. Humanitarian
\'heralds\' were there, the NGO press officers, doggedly pursuing
journalists, brandishing their new angles on the story, often relating
to their own agency\'s courage, skill and impact. All clamoured for
television coverage and made claims about what could be achieved, some
of which were indeed outrageous. [[Many have subsequently argued that
the relief system is]{.underline}]{.mark} now badly [[out of
control,]{.mark} having become a self-perpetuating expatriate
industry]{.underline} unscrupulously [exploiting]{.underline} other
people\'s [misery]{.underline}. Where genuine compassion exists, it is
all too often combined with a gross naivety and amateurism that produces
unforeseen and damaging side-effects. Finally, the international
agencies operate in a manner that grants their staff near complete
impunity for professional incompetence. They can get away, literally,
with murder. [While there is doubtless]{.underline} some
[truth]{.underline} in all of this, [it is important to establish how
generalisable the picture is]{.underline}. **[[There is very little
empirical evidence that actual harm has been
caused]{.underline}]{.mark}** by increased numbers of agencies per
se.(n9) In fact increased agency competition has certainly demanded more
efficient and more professional approaches. It also offers the donors,
both private and official, more choice of potential implementation
partners. Indeed in the \'development\' zone, many of the same critics
of the humanitarian scene actually celebrate institutional proliferation
as an indicator of the health of \'civil society\'. [It is surely right
that humanitarian agencies pursue television and media coverage of major
humanitarian calamities. Would it be better to ignore them or cover them
up? [The failure to engage]{.mark}]{.underline} much serious [[media
attention to long-term suffering and structural poverty is hardly likely
to be remedied through **cleansing our screens** of disaster
stories]{.underline}]{.mark}. Surely it makes little sense to argue that
because some ambulances leave the scene of some accidents
\'empty-handed\' that in future ambulances will be despatched one at a
time, no matter what the scale and severity of the reported incident. If
in Goma some agencies turned up unnecessarily, it is very important to
consider carefully what might have happened if an insufficient number
had turned up, before jumping to the conclusion that it is possible to
define and plan for an optimal response. [Of course]{.underline} the
[humanitarian agencies]{.underline} and their staff are not perfect.
[But compare their response after the disaster of the Great Lakes with
that of governments]{.underline}. While [France, the UK and the US
variously denied responsibility and buck passed furiously]{.underline},
the [NGOs got on with the Sphere project]{.underline},(n10) [People in
Aid]{.underline},(n11) [and the]{.underline} [Humanitarian
Ombudsman]{.underline} (n12) project. These very complex exercises in
inter-agency co-operation, involving hundreds of very diverse
organisations, are laying down clear standards of ethical behaviour,
minimum standards in service delivery, best practice standards in human
resource management and methods of enhancing accountability to
legitimate humanitarian claimants. [It is of course easy to build up a
portfolio of cases pointing to]{.underline} venality, inefficiency and
[ineptitude within the humanitarian system]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, as is often said in legal circles,
[**[bad]{.underline}** **[cases do not necessarily make for good
laws]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [[Abolition of the health service as a
whole is not a rational and justifiable response to the identification
of bad practice in particular circumstances]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Evidence for and against needs to be weighed carefully and the principle
of proportionality reflected when reforming the system. Conclusion The
remarkable resilience of Henri Dunant\'s concepts of humanity,
impartiality, neutrality and independence are based very particularly
upon his recognition in 1859 at the Battle of Solferino that
humanitarian aid will only be politically possible and ethically
justifiable so long as it favours neither warring party with military
advantage. These humanitarian principles are as valid now as they were
in 1859; in essence the right of non-combatants to protection from
violence, inhumane or degrading treatment. The Geneva Conventions and
other human rights and humanitarian treaties do therefore confer
obligations upon humanitarian organisations and it is absolutely right
that the humanitarian system should be held accountable to these norms.
In this respect, Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red
Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief (1994) offers a powerful
normative framework to judge the performance of the humanitarian system.
In general, the humanitarian agencies are improving their performance in
terms of quality, and their willingness to be held accountable to these
principles and associated technical standards. This is well illustrated
by the phenomenon of over 100 humanitarian agencies co-operating on the
Sphere humanitarian standards project. However, growing evidence
suggests that the humanitarian system is doing badly as humanitarian
demand seems to be outstripping the supply of official and private
compassion. But [[when contrasted with the failures of an international
political culture that fails to get to grips with war-crime
impunity]{.mark}, [the illegal arms trade and those macro-economic
processes that sustain the iceberg of poverty and inequality that lies
below]{.mark}]{.underline} the surface of most [[violent
conflicts]{.underline},]{.mark} then the [[humanitarian system]{.mark}
and its underlying values sometimes [look like a warm, albeit
beleaguered, beacon of hope]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[This must not be
extinguished]{.underline}**]{.mark}. A [public engagement with the human
tragedies of poverty and violence **must be renewed**]{.underline}, [no
matter how distant these may seem geographically or
politically]{.underline}.

#### Leaving the Horn alone ensures widespread conflict\-\--states are complicit

**Wolf 12** -- Tetra Tech ARD Project Manager (Lucas, "EAST AFRICA
REGIONAL CONFLICT AND INSTABILITY ASSESSMENT," Final Report)

[[Conflict and instability trends in]{.underline}]{.mark} East
Africa---encompassing [[the Horn]{.underline}]{.mark} of Africa, the
Great Lakes, and the traditional East Africa region (Kenya, Uganda, and
Tanzania)---[[continue to make it one of the most unstable regions in
the world]{.underline}.]{.mark}3 [The region's chronic instability
stands in sharp contrast to the notable successes in conflict management
across most of the rest of Africa]{.underline}. Conflicts in South
Sudan, southern Somalia, Darfur, and eastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC)---combined with heavily armed communal clashes in some other
parts of the region---wreak havoc on local, state, and regional
security. [Transborder [criminal networks seek refuge in remote and
weakly governed borderlands]{.mark}]{.underline}. While parts of the
region are relatively stable and peaceful today, [[significant portions
of East Africa remain unable to break free of a brutal and prolonged
history of armed conflicts,]{.mark} violent crime, extremism, communal
violence, political instability, displacement, human rights abuses, and
state failure. [The **inability** of central governments to protect
their citizens from this violence---in some cases,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[government complicity in the crises]{.underline}**]{.mark}---has
**[[eroded communities' trust in the state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most
of East Africa's zones of armed conflict and instability today are
concentrated near border areas and feature powerful crossborder drivers,
interests, and actors. Crossborder spillover is thus a major problem in
East Africa, and has the effect of tying the fates of relatively stable
countries to their troubled neighbors. At its worst, spillover has
produced new crises of armed violence that match or exceed the fatality
levels of the original conflict, as the case of the 1994 Rwandan
genocide and ensuing wars in eastern DRC illustrates. Under such
circumstances, regional governments can ill-afford to ignore violent
conflicts in neighboring countries, nor can they rest assured that
containment strategies will adequately shield them. [[Few of the
region's central governments have the **capacity** (or in some cases the
**political will**) to police and patrol their remote, expansive border
areas]{.underline}.]{.mark} As a result, [much of what passes for
transborder conflict management and prevention falls on the shoulders of
regional organizations, local communities, and local government
authorities]{.underline}, in partnership with often distant central
governments. [Their resilience and adaptability are critical factors in
determining whether and to what extent crossborder conflict and
instability issues are successfully managed]{.underline}.

#### These factors impede community-led efforts

**Wolf 12** -- Tetra Tech ARD Project Manager (Lucas, "EAST AFRICA
REGIONAL CONFLICT AND INSTABILITY ASSESSMENT," Final Report)

Even so, [[community efforts to manage crossborder violence and
instability have faced **significant problems**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
Kenya, the formalization of PDCs has allowed for the model to be
replicated across much of the country, but has an uneven record. Some
PDCs have been used as political platforms for aspiring politicians; in
the process, the PDCs have been politicized, and their neutrality
damaged. In southern Somalia, community-based governance is well
developed thanks to 21 years of state collapse, but in recent years has
had to contend with the violent and intimidating presence of Al-Shabaab.
Local civic leaders have been able to negotiate terms with Al-Shabaab,
but at great risk, and as a result have been constrained by the threat
of assassination from acting autonomously. In Ethiopia, the government's
recent restrictive laws on civil society (the Charities and Societies
Proclamation) has reduced formal roles for CSOs in peace building and
conflict management in border areas, though civil society
representatives are represented in LPCs. In some war-torn areas of East
Africa, CSOs in remote border areas are weak or in disarray. Capacity
and leadership quality are critical, and vary tremendously from place to
place. Finally, in some conflict areas of East Africa, [[local community
leadership is simply not committed to peace
building]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Years of clashes have hardened ethnic
animosities and deepened distrust]{.underline}; competing [[narratives
are jarringly at odds, and appear to offer only modest prospects for
negotiation and mediation]{.underline}.]{.mark} Our research encountered
this in the Turkana border area of Kenya and Ethiopia, where the Turkana
and Dassenesh communities are locked in spiraling violence over land and
the fisheries of the shrinking Lake Turkana. Border
[communities]{.underline} typically take on a broad portfolio of roles
in maintaining peace. At their best, they serve as eyes and ears for
early warning systems; create deterrence, by placing social pressure on
would-be criminals and armed militia; mobilize the community for both
conflict prevention and management; are a source of customary or
religious law within their group; and serve as diplomats in managing
tensions with neighboring groups. They also [face serious constraints,
and are]{.underline} especially [limited in effectiveness]{.underline}
when deprived of a strong partnership with local and national
governments. [[Some of the factors constraining community peace building
include ineffective or hostile local government in some locations, poor
communication systems]{.underline}]{.mark} with crossborder groups,
[[increasingly complex new conflict drivers and fatality levels which
can overwhelm customary systems of justice]{.underline}]{.mark} and
conflict management, [powerful spoilers, and organizational challenges
of keeping hybrid governance coalitions working together]{.underline}.

#### The existence of habeas petitions promoting human rights proves that an institution can be caught up in systems of whiteness while still combatting violence

**Williams 90** - American lawyer who is a notable author and legal
scholar in the field of federal Indian law, international law,
indigenous peoples\' rights, critical race and post-colonial theory
(Robert, "Encounters on the Frontiers of International Human Rights Law:
Redefining the Terms of Indigenous Peoples\' Survival in the World",
Duke Law Journal, Vol. 4)

Not too long ago, it was fashionable for some legal [[academics]{.mark}
in this country to [assert that rights discourse]{.mark}---that is, talk
and thought about rights---[was]{.mark} actually [harmful to]{.mark} the
social movements of [peoples of color]{.mark}]{.underline} and other
oppressed groups.1 And as recent times have shown, legal
[[academics]{.mark} of color [can attract]{.mark} a great deal of
attention and the [sympathies of]{.mark} anonymous [white colleagues by
telling]{.mark} [us that the sufferings and stories of peoples of
color]{.mark} in this country [possess no unique capacity to transform
the law]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 [[These]{.mark} legal academic
[denials]{.mark} of the efficacy of rights discourse and storytelling
for the social movements of peoples of color now [seem disharmonious
with the larger transformations occurring in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why any legal academics would discount the
usefulness of such proven, liberating forms of discourse in the
particular society they serve from their positions of privilege is a
curious and contentious question. The disaggregated narratives of human
rights struggles on the nightly news apparently have not been sufficient
for some legal academics. They want documented accounts demonstrating
the efficacy of rights discourse and storytelling in the social
movements of outsider groups. Empirical evidence of the traditions,
histories, and lives of oppressed peoples actually transforming legal
thought and doctrine about rights could then be used to cure skeptics of
the critical race scholarly enterprise.3 \"See here,\" the still
unconverted in the faculty lounge can be told, \"this stuff works, if
applied and systematized correctly.\" Despite the attacks from
society\'s dominant groups in the legal academic spectrum---both the
left and right---the voices of legal scholars of color have sought to
keep faith with the struggles and aspirations of oppressed peoples
around the world. These emerging voices recognize that [[now is the time
to intensify the struggle for human rights on all fronts]{.mark}--- [to
heighten demands, engage in intense political rhetoric, and sharpen
critical thinking about all aspects of legal thought and
doctrine]{.mark}. The rapid emergence of [indigenous peoples]{.mark}\*
[human rights]{.mark}]{.underline} as a subject of major concern and
action in contemporary international law [[provides a unique
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} to witness the application of rights
discourse and storytelling in institutionalized, law-bound settings
around the world.4 By telling their own stories in recognized and
authoritative intcrnational human rights standard-setting bodies during
the past decade, indigenous peoples have sought to redefine the terms of
their right to survival under international law.5 Under present,
Western-dominated conceptions of international law, indigenous peoples
are regarded as subjects of the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of the
settler state regimes that invaded their territories and established
hegemony during prior colonial eras.6 At present, international law does
not contest unilateral assertions of state sovereignty that limit, or
completely deny the collective cultural rights of indigenous peoples.7
Contemporary international law also does not concern itself with
protecting indigenous peoples\' traditionally-occupied territories from
uncompensated state appropriation, even when indigenous territories are
secured through treaties with a state. According to contemporary
international discourse, such treaties should be treated as legal
nullities.8 Finally, modern international law refuses to recognize
indigenous peoples as \"peoples,\" entitled to rights of
self-determination as specified in United Nations and other major
international human rights legal instruments.9 Since the 1970s, in
international human rights forums around the world, [[indigenous
peoples]{.mark} [have contested the]{.mark} international [legal
system\'s]{.mark} continued [acquiescence to]{.mark} the assertions of
[exclusive]{.mark} [state sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} and
jurisdiction over the terms of their survival. Pushed to the brink of
extinction by state-sanctioned policies of genocide and ethnocide,
indigenous peoples have demanded heightened international concern and
legal protection for their continued survival.10 The emergence of
indigenous rights in contemporary international legal discourse is a
direct response to the consciousness-raising efforts of indigenous
peoples in international human rights forums. [[Specialized]{.mark}
international and regional bodies, non-governmental organizations
([NGOs]{.mark}), and advocacy groups [are]{.mark} now
**[devoting]{.mark}** greater **[attention to indigenous human
rights]{.mark}** concerns]{.underline}.\" By far the most important of
these specialized initiatives to emerge out of the indigenous human
rights movement is the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous
Populations (Working Group). The Working Group is composed of five
international legal experts drawn from the United Nations Sub-Commission
on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. The
Working Group was created by the Sub-Commission\'s parent body, the
United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1982 and given a
specific mandate to develop international legal standards for the
protection of indigenous peoples\' human rights.12

**Paris 14**, (founding director of the University of Ottawa\'s Centre

School of Public and International Affairs, Peacekeeping Works Better
Than You May Think,
politicalviolenceataglance.org/2014/08/12/peacekeeping-works-better-than-you-may-think/)

[[Does **peacekeeping work?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Janice Stein
(University of Toronto) and I had a lively exchange on this subject on
the CBC radio program "The House" last weekend. Have a listen. In the
interview, I said that [more than two dozen major peace operations have
been deployed over the past 25 years]{.underline} in countries emerging
from civil wars, and that [although some have been]{.underline} terrible
[failures]{.underline} (e.g., Rwanda 1994), [their overall record has
been]{.underline} reasonably [good at preventing]{.underline} a
[recurrence of fighting.]{.underline} Prof. [Stein was unconvinced. Some
studies]{.underline}, she said, "[show]{.underline} that [the majority
\[of peace operations\] are failures]{.underline} and that [there is a
return to violence after 5 to 7 years]{.underline}. So I think the
record is the reverse." So, which is it? Does peacekeeping generally
help to prevent a return to violence, or does it generally fail to do
so? The answer to this question matters -- quite a lot, actually. If
peacekeeping is ineffective and if outsiders can do little to help
post-conflict societies transition towards a more stable peace, as Prof.
Stein suggests, then Western policymakers and other leaders would be
foolish to consider contributing to, or even supporting, such efforts.
If, on the other hand, peacekeeping has a reasonably positive record, it
would seem foolish for the same policymakers not to support these
efforts. Prof. [[Stein is]{.underline}]{.mark} a fine scholar and fluent
analyst of international affairs, but she's [**[not correct]{.mark}**
about the peacekeeping record.]{.underline} Michael [Doyle]{.underline}
(Columbia University) [and]{.underline} Nicholas [Sambanis]{.underline}
(Yale University) [demonstrated]{.underline} in 2000 that the [[presence
of a large peacekeeping operation]{.mark} in a country emerging from
civil war **[significantly reduced]{.mark} the [chances of]{.mark} that
society [slipping back into violence]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} They reached
this conclusion by analyzing post-conflict countries that had, and had
not, received peace missions, and by holding other factors constant,
including the intensity of the preceding war, the type of conflict, etc.
[Their finding has been **replicated, modified, and reconfirmed many
times** ]{.mark}**in the ensuing decade-and-a-half** [and is]{.mark} now
[**widely accepted**]{.mark} among international security
scholars]{.underline}. One recent survey of this literature put it
simply: "there is considerable evidence that \[United Nations
peacekeeping operations\] are effective in maintaining peace." In fact,
most debates on this subject are now focusing not on whether
peacekeeping reduces the risk of renewed fighting, but on how much it
does so. Of course, [this does not mean]{.underline} that [every
peacekeeping mission]{.underline} has succeeded or [will succeed;
rather, it indicates]{.underline} that "[on average" peacekeeping works
to reduce the risk of renewed conflict. [It is a statistical
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- [and a **very strong
one**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** as other contributors to
this literature, including Paul Collier (University of Oxford) and Page
Fortna (Columbia University and contributor to this blog), have
demonstrated. [[This finding may seem counter-intuitive]{.mark} at
first, [given]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**lingering images of failed
peacekeeping**]{.mark} efforts]{.underline} in Rwanda and Somalia, for
example. [But]{.underline} [it begins to make sense if you
[consider]{.mark} how many countries have navigated the war-to-peace
transition with the assistance of international peacekeepers --
including [**El Salvador**, **Nicaragua**, **Namibia**, **Mozambique**,
**Sierra Leone**, **Cambodia**, **East Timor**, **Bosnia** and
**Kosovo**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps [[these]{.mark} cases [have
fallen from **public view**]{.mark} precisely [because they are **no
longer at war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Still [no return to massive
bloodshed in Bosnia" is very important news to]{.underline} the
[inhabitants]{.underline} of that country, [but don't count on seeing
this headline in tomorrow's paper]{.underline}. If it doesn't bleed, it
doesn't lead. Nevertheless, [the [**evidence is clear**: ***on
balance***, peacekeeping works]{.mark}]{.underline} reasonably
[well]{.underline} at [preventing conflicts from
reigniting.]{.underline} I've included a list of studies at the end of
this post in case you wish to read further, but I'll leave the last word
to Steven Pinker of Harvard University, who, in the video clip below,
sums up the findings of this scholarship more eloquently than I can. In
response to the question of whether peacekeeping works, Pinker says:
[[The answer from]{.mark} the [**statistical studies is**: **absolutely,
they work massively**.]{.mark} A country is much less likely to fall
back in civil war if they've got armed peacekeepers]{.underline}. And
[the better financed and armed]{.underline} the peacekeeping force, [the
more effective]{.underline} they are... The United Nations does a number
of things badly, but it does a number of things well, and one of them is
peacekeeping -- on average, not 100 percent of the time. [**The
[headlines would never tell you that. Only a statistical study
would]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Here's another study.

**Beardsley** et al. **18** \[[Kyle Beardsley]{.underline}, Duke
University; [David E. Cunningham]{.underline}, University of Maryland &
Peace Research Institute Oslo; [Peter B. White]{.underline}, University
of Maryland; 6-30-2018; \"Mediation, Peacekeeping and the Severity of
Civil War\"; Journal of Conflict Resolution;
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002718817092; KL\]

In this article, we argue that [[international actors]{.mark} can work
to **[reduce]{.mark}** the level of [violence]{.mark} in ongoing civil
wars]{.underline}. In particular, we argue that mediators can contribute
to a reduction in violence by facilitating negotiated settlements and by
creating lulls during which negotiations can occur. [We also expect
peacekeeping to reduce **civil war violence**]{.underline}, for reasons
similar to the arguments of Hultman, Kathman, and Shannon (2014,
hereafter HKS). Moreover, we argue that the mechanisms through which
mediation and peacekeeping can help attenuate violence are both
additive---the mediators help reduce violence in ways that peacekeeping
operations alone cannot and vice versa---and interactive---mediation and
peacekeeping reinforce one another and may even depend on one another.

[[We examine]{.mark} these expectations in an analysis of]{.underline}
**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** intrastate
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} months [[in Africa from]{.mark} 19[89
to]{.mark} 20[08]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since mediated peace processes
and peacekeeping deployments often occur in close temporal proximity, it
is important to examine their distinct contributions to reductions in
armed violence within the same empirical framework. We find, consistent
with our expectations, that mediation leads to a dramatic decline in
battlefield casualties. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[find]{.underline}]{.mark}, consistent with HKS, [[that peacekeeping
**reduces** battlefield casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to
these independent effects, we find that mediation and peacekeeping have
a conditional effect wherein the presence of both leads to a greater
reduction in battlefield fatalities. We also find that this interaction
is driven primarily by mediation and peacekeeping occurring
simultaneously rather than by a sequencing in which mediation precedes
peacekeepers. These results illustrate that mediation and peacekeeping
can have important positive impacts on conflict beyond complete
termination.

### ! --- NATO Good --- AT: Interventions --- Libya

#### NATO's involvement in Libya prevented massacres. 

**Hamid 16** \[Shadi Hamid; senior fellow at the Project on US Relations
with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle
East Policy; 4-5-2016; \"[Everyone says the Libya intervention was a
failure. **They're wrong**]{.underline}.\"; Vox;
https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success; KL\]

Libya and the 2011 NATO intervention there have become synonymous with
failure, disaster, and the Middle East being a \"shit show\" (to use
President Obama's colorful descriptor). It has perhaps never been more
important to question this prevailing wisdom, because how we interpret
Libya affects how we interpret Syria and, importantly, how we assess
Obama's foreign policy legacy.

[Of course, Libya]{.underline}, as anyone can see, [is a
mess]{.underline}, [and Americans are reasonably asking if the
intervention was a mistake]{.underline}. [But just because it's
reasonable doesn't make it right]{.underline}.

[Most criticisms of the intervention]{.underline}, even with the benefit
of hindsight, **[fall short]{.underline}**. [It is certainly true that
the intervention didn't]{.underline} produce something resembling [a
stable democracy]{.underline}. [This, however, was never the
goal]{.underline}. [The goal was to **protect civilians** and **prevent
a massacre**]{.underline}.

[Critics **erroneously compare** Libya today to any number of **false
ideals**]{.underline}, [but this is not the correct way to
evaluate]{.underline} the [success or failure]{.underline} of the
intervention. [To do that, [we should compare Libya]{.mark} [today to
what]{.mark} Libya would have looked like [if we hadn't
intervened]{.mark}]{.underline}. By that standard, the Libya
intervention was successful: [[The country is **better off**]{.mark}
today than it would have been had the international community allowed
**dictator Muammar Qaddafi** to continue his **rampage**]{.underline}
[across the country]{.underline}.

[Critics]{.underline} further [assert that the intervention
caused]{.underline}, created, or somehow led to [civil war]{.underline}.
In fact, [the civil war had **already started** before the intervention
began]{.underline}. As for today's chaos, violence, and general
instability, these are more plausibly tied not to the original
intervention but to the international community's failures after
intervention.

[[The]{.mark} very fact that the [Libya]{.mark} intervention and its
[legacy]{.mark} have been either **[distorted]{.mark}** or misunderstood
[is]{.mark} itself [evidence of]{.mark} a]{.underline}
[**[warped]{.mark} foreign policy [discourse]{.mark}** in the US, [where
anything short of success]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [in this case, Libya
quickly becoming a stable]{.underline}, relatively democratic
[country]{.underline} --- [[is viewed as a failure]{.underline}]{.mark}.

NATO intervened to protect civilians, not to set up a democracy

As stated in the UN Security Council resolution authorizing force in
Libya, the goal of intervention was \"to protect civilians and civilian
populated areas under threat of attack.\" And this is what was achieved.

[In February 2011, [anti-Qaddafi demonstrations
spread]{.mark}]{.underline} across the country. [[The regime
responded]{.underline}]{.mark} to the nascent protest movement [[with
**lethal force**]{.mark}, [killing]{.mark} **more than [100]{.mark}**
[people in]{.mark} the first few [days]{.mark}]{.underline}, effectively
sparking an armed rebellion. The rebels quickly lost momentum, however.

I still remember how I felt in those last days and hours [as Qaddafi's
forces marched toward Benghazi]{.underline}. In a quite literal sense,
every moment mattered, and [the longer we waited, the greater the
cost]{.underline}.

It was frightening to watch. I didn't want to live in an America where
we would stand by silently as [a **[brutal
dictator]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[using that]{.mark} distinct
[language of]{.mark} **[genocidaires]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[announced]{.mark} rather clearly [his intentions to
**kill**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In one speech, [[Qaddafi called
protesters]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[cockroaches]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[and vowed to cleanse
Libya]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[**[inch by inch]{.mark}**, house by house,
**[home by home]{.mark}**, alleyway by alleyway]{.underline}.\"

Already, [on the eve of intervention, the death toll was estimated at
somewhere between 1,000 and **2,000**]{.underline}. (This was when the
international community's tolerance for Arab Spring--related mass
killings was still fairly low.)

As Obama's advisers saw it, there were two options for military action:
a no-fly zone (which, on its own, wouldn't do much to stop Qaddafi's
tanks) or a broader resolution that would allow the US and its allies to
take further measures, including establishing what amounted to a
floating no-drive zone around rebel forces. The president went with the
latter option.

The NATO operation lasted about seven months, with an estimated death
toll of around 8,000, apparently most of them combatants on both sides
(although there is some lack of clarity on this, since the Libyan
government doesn't clearly define \"revolutionaries\" or \"rebel
supporters\"). A Human Rights Watch investigation found that at least 72
civilians were killed as a result of the NATO air campaign, definitively
contradicting speculative claims of mass casualties from the Qaddafi
regime.

Claims of \"mission creep\" have become commonplace, most forcefully
articulated by the Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Zenko may be right, but he asserts rather than explains why mission
creep is always a bad thing. It may be that in some circumstances, the
scope of a mission should be defined more broadly, rather than narrowly.

If anything, it was the Obama administration's insistence of minimizing
the mission --- including the absurd claim that it would take \"days,
not weeks\" --- that was the problem from the very start. Zenko and
others never make clear how civilians could have been protected as long
as Qaddafi was waging war on them.

[What Libya would look like today if NATO hadn't intervened]{.underline}

[It's helpful to engage in a bit of **counterfactual
history**]{.underline} here. As Niall Ferguson notes in his book Virtual
Alternatives, "[To understand how it actually was, we therefore need to
understand how it actually wasn't]{.underline}."

Applied to the Libyan context, this means that [we're not comparing
Libya, during or after the intervention, with some imagined ideal of
stable, functioning democracy]{.underline}. [Rather, we would compare it
with]{.underline} what we judge, to the best of our ability,
[[the]{.mark} **most likely [alternative]{.mark}** outcome would have
been [had the US not intervened]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Here's what we know: By March 19, 2011, when the NATO operation began,
the death toll in Libya had risen rapidly to more than 1,000 in a
relatively short amount of time, confirming Qaddafi's longstanding
reputation as someone who was willing to kill his countrymen (as well as
others) in large numbers if that's what his survival required.

[There was **no end in sight**]{.underline}. After early rebel gains,
Qaddafi had seized the advantage. Still, he was not in a position to
deal a decisive blow to the opposition. (Nowhere in the Arab Spring era
has one side in a military conflict been able to claim a clear victory,
even with massive advantages in manpower, equipment, and regional
backing.)

[Any Libyan who had opted to take up arms [was]{.mark} liable to
be]{.underline} captured, arrested, or [killed]{.underline} if Qaddafi
"won," [so the incentives to accept defeat were nonexistent, to say
nothing of the understandable desire to not live under the [rule of a
**brutal**]{.mark} and **maniacal [strongman]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The most likely outcome]{.underline}, then, [was
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} Syria-like [[situation of
**indefinite**]{.mark}, **[intensifying violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Even President Obama, who today seems unsure about the decision to
intervene, acknowledged in an August 2014 interview with Thomas Friedman
that "[had we not intervened]{.underline}, it's likely that Libya would
be Syria. ... And so [there would be **more death**, more disruption,
more destruction]{.underline}."

What caused the current Libyan civil war?

Critics charge that the NATO intervention was responsible for or somehow
caused Libya's current state of chaos and instability. For instance,
after leaving the Obama administration, Philip Gordon, the most senior
US official on the Middle East in 2013-\'15, wrote: \"In Iraq, the U.S.
intervened and occupied, and the result was a costly disaster. In Libya,
the U.S. intervened and did not occupy, and the result was a costly
disaster. In Syria, the U.S. neither intervened nor occupied, and the
result is a costly disaster.\"

The problem here is that US intervention did not, in fact, result in a
costly disaster, unless we are using the word \"result\" to simply
connote that one thing happened after a previous thing. [The NATO
operation ended in October 2011]{.underline}. [The current civil war in
Libya began in May 2014]{.underline} --- [a full **two and a half
years** later]{.underline}. The intervention and today's violence are of
course related, but this does not necessarily mean there is a causal
relationship.

[To argue that the current conflict in Libya is a result of the
intervention, one would basically need to assume that the outbreak of
civil war was **inevitable**, irrespective of anything that happened in
the intervening **30 months**]{.underline}.

#### The alternative was [mass genocide]{.underline} and [hundreds of thousands]{.underline} of deaths.

Since the Afghanistan debacle, more and more analysts have raised their
voices against interventions by the West. According to some, the West
should only intervene militarily when self-interest is at stake and if
there is no alternative.

For example, many believe that the intervention in Libya was a mistake.
That its late leader Muammar Gaddafi would still be in power would not
matter to our interest. In other words, they believe that doing nothing
is usually better than doing something.

Let me first zoom in on Libya. [Following Tunisia and Egypt, [Libyans
took to the streets]{.mark}]{.underline} for the first time on 17
February 2011 [[to demand the end of the Gaddafi]{.mark} regime, which
had been a **[reign of terror]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 1969.

That happened first in Benghazi, the second largest city in Libya, which
then had a population of about 630,000. In March 2011, [Gaddafi\'s army
marched]{.underline} with a huge force to Benghazi [to]{.underline}, as
the \"Brotherly Leader and Guide\" announced, [**nip all resistance** in
the bud]{.underline}, \"[from house to house]{.underline}, alley to
alley\".

[[No one doubted]{.mark} that]{.underline} tens of thousands, if not
**[[hundreds of thousands]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of people would be
killed]{.underline}]{.mark}. A genocide 10, maybe 50 times bigger than
Srebrenica was about to happen.

[[It was the **Libyans themselves**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially the
future prime minister Mahmoud Jibril, [[who]{.mark} **first
[convinced]{.mark}** the [Europe]{.mark}an Parliament]{.underline}, then
French president Nicolas Sarkozy [and]{.underline} finally
[US]{.underline} secretary of state Hillary Clinton [to try [to stop
this]{.mark} massacre]{.underline}.

When the planes took off from France to Libya on 17 March, the Libyan
army was literally already at the gates of Benghazi.

[[A]{.mark} **massive [massacre]{.mark}** [had been **avoided**]{.mark},
[thanks to]{.mark} the Libyan opposition and
**[Nato]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### The mistake of Libya was [not enough]{.underline} intervention.

[If the U.S. hadn't intervened, the result might have been
another]{.underline} Syria-like situation of a **[protracted civil
war]{.underline}**. I was in favor of intervening, but I also warned at
the time that the U.S. needed to seriously prepare for a post-Gaddafi
Libya, and that the only way to ward off chaos was to send an
international peacekeeping force.

[[The **Problem**]{.mark} [with Obama]{.mark}]{.underline} In Libya,
[[was]{.mark} that [he]{.mark} employed American airpower]{.underline}
to topple Muammar Gaddafi [but [refused]{.mark} to sanction any
**[follow-on peacekeeping]{.mark}**]{.underline} forces [[to help a
new]{.mark}, pro-Western [government establish]{.mark} its
[authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} The predictable result: a vacuum of
authority that allowed militias and terrorist groups to flourish. U.S.
Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three of his colleagues paid with
their lives for that failure.

The Obama administration's mission while "leading from behind" over the
skies of Libya was never regime change. "Of course, there is no question
that Libya and the world would be better off with Qaddafi out of power,"
Obama said in an address to the nation. "But broadening our military
mission to include regime change would be a mistake." In that address,
the president noted that regime change in Iraq was not worth the cost in
lives or dollars. That's perhaps why the administration was ill-prepared
for the crumbling of Gaddafi's regime.

**[[The Mistake]{.mark} of Libya [was not enough
Intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**

With the Arabian Revolt sweeping the Middle East in early 2011, Libya's
turn came on February 17. Throwing off decades of fear, and not
bothering with peaceful demonstrations as Tunisia and Egypt had to free
themselves of tyranny, nor the Syrians who tried peaceful demonstrations
for six entire months, the Libyans went straight to armed rebellion, and
soon [the city of Benghazi had been pried from the regime's grip and
become the de facto capital of the **revolution**]{.underline}. [The
Libyans had **no confidence** in protests]{.underline} to alter the
regime of Muammar el-[[Qaddafi]{.underline}]{.mark}. They were right.
The demented Colonel [[responded with a **brutality**]{.mark} [that
included]{.mark} using]{.underline} [[**fighter jets**against civilian
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the violence escalated, on March 17 the
U.N. Security Council passed resolution 1973, which

Authorize\[d\] Member States ..., acting nationally or through regional
organizations or arrangements, ... to take all necessary measures ... to
protect civilians.

Celebrations erupted in Libya at the news that deliverance was coming.
For reasons unclear there was a 48-hour delay, which allowed Qaddafi's
forces to be right at the gates of Benghazi by the time the American
intervention came on March 19 in the form of Operation ODYSSEY DAWN.
Qaddafi's rudimentary air defences were disabled and a no-fly zone
instituted. President Obama then made the decision, on March 31, to hand
the operation to NATO. This was the infamous "leading from behind".
Still, it was enough to bring down the regime. In late August, Qaddafi
was driven from his capital, and on October 20, Qaddafi's escape from
his hometown of Sirte was cut off by French jets and he was pulled out
of a drainage ditch and given to the crowd. They were not pretty those
closing scenes in Sirte, but they were long overdue.

The Russians would protest that their abstention on the U.N. resolution
was never meant to encompass regime-change, and the West, including the
U.S. Defence Secretary and the British Chief of Defence, denied that
this had been the intention. How they proposed to protect civilians
without killing the despot giving the orders that endangered them was
never explained. On Oct. 31, NATO's Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR was
ended, and that was more or less it for Western involvement, except for
the victory lap of course.

In the elections that followed liberation in June 2012, the
tribalists/nationalists would carry the day; the Islamists were
trounced. But the problems had already begun. Between April and
September 2012 there had been "at least five ... attacks against foreign
interests in Benghazi," and this would culminate in the fiasco on Sept.
11, 2012, when the American ambassador and three other U.S. citizens
were killed by al-Qaeda jihadists at the Consulate in that city. There
were many democratic and pro-American people in Libya --- protesters had
expelled the Islamic militants who attacked the U.S. Consulate from
their base in Benghazi after the attack --- but a small group of violent
fanatics can impose themselves if nobody else has the power to resist
them. Lawlessness was allowed to overtake Libya, and the decent
government that had come to office by elections was unable to enforce
its writ. America had made one effort to send a training mission to
Libya to buttress the forces of law and order but it was withdrawn in
mid-2012 "until the security of U.S. personnel and equipment could be
guaranteed"!

2013 did not shape up any better. The parliament passed laws at
gun-point, a proposed NATO training mission went nowhere, and there were
numerous kidnappings, including the Prime Minister. The east of Libya
had always been fertile ground for the jihadists. Derna, for example,
had contributed "far and away" the most holy warriors on a per capita
basis to the jihad against constitutional government in Iraq. With no
State to keep this at bay, and collapsing order around Libya, notably
Mali, the jihadists converged on Libya for shelter and al-Qaeda and
other Salafi-jihadists' presence in the country became more pronounced.

Major cities in Libya, predominantly Tripoli in the west and Benghazi in
the east

Elections in June 2014 had again defeated the Islamists but this time
the zealots decided to take by force what they could not get by the
ballot, and on Saturday, the situation unravelled completely when
Tripoli fell to Islamic militants under the banner of Fajr Libya (Libyan
Dawn). The Islamists set ablaze Tripoli International Airport, further
destruction of the city was reported, and the remnants of the police and
army, as well as militiamen loyal to the government, were being
systematically rounded up by Dawn. In the east, fighting is ongoing
between the Islamists and the supposedly-nationalist militias of Khalifa
Haftar, a former General, a leftover of the old regime who has seemingly
modelled himself on Abdel Fattah as-Sisi, a putschist and autocrat who
claims he can keep the Islamists in check. Libya's Parliament calledfor
international intervention earlier this month and was rebuffed. This is
the harvest.

But this wasn't all. Regional dynamics soon intruded:

Twice in the last seven days, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have
secretly launched airstrikes against Islamist-allied militias battling
for control of Tripoli ... The United States, the officials said, was
caught by surprise: Egypt and the Emirates, both close allies and
military partners, acted without informing Washington, leaving the Obama
administration on the sidelines. Egyptian officials explicitly denied to
American diplomats that their military played any role in the operation
... In recent months, the officials said, teams of "special forces"
operating out of Egypt but possibly composed primarily of Emiratis had
also successfully destroyed an Islamist camp near ... Derna ...

Several officials said in recent days that United States diplomats were
fuming about the airstrikes, believing the intervention could further
inflame the Libyan conflict as the United Nations and Western powers are
seeking to broker a peaceful resolution.

Officials said the government of Qatar has already provided weapons and
support to the Islamist-aligned forces inside Libya, so the new strikes
represent a shift from a battle of proxies to direct involvement. ...

"In every arena --- in Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Libya, even what happened in
Egypt --- this regional polarization, with Saudi Arabia and the ...
U.A.E. on one side and Qatar and Turkey on the other, has proved to be a
gigantic impediment to international efforts to resolve any of these
crisis \[sic\]," said Michele Dunne, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and a former Middle East specialist at
the State Department.

A snapshot but a very dense one: The region's actors, perhaps especially
America's allies, have taken to free-lancing because they have no
confidence that the President will actually do anything; Qatar is
playing as destructive a role as it can; the struggles within the Muslim
world are the major front in the region (Israel is not even on the radar
of these States); the Obama administration's failure to intervene
properly and stay to secure the aftermath has led to disaster in Libya,
as it has in Iraq; and while bad actors are making real military gains,
the administration worries that using force to stop them will only make
it worse and tries to bring about a political solution in situations
that have long-since passed the point of no return.

Credit where it is due: [The United States had come to the **rescue** of
Libya when **nobody else** would]{.underline} ([Russia and
China]{.underline}) or could (the Arab League). But the U.S. had not
secured the aftermath, the one lesson all sides of the argument should
surely have learned from Iraq.

It didn't have to be this way. Consider an alternative history of the
region over the last three years. If the intervention against Qaddafi
had come sooner, in the first two weeks rather than after four, and if
it had targeted him and his elite directly and unapologetically, the war
would not have dragged out for eight months; there would have been much
less destruction and the jihadists would have had much less time and
space to set themselves up. If Special Forces, military advisers, and
other help were made available to the elected government afterwards then
order could have been restored, in no small part because it wouldn't
have broken down so badly. If fifteen or twenty thousand troops could
have been left in Iraq it would have allowed a fighting chance of
keeping peace between the sects, stopped Iran using Iraq as a transit
point to support the Assad dictatorship, kept Syria's furies largely out
of Iraq, and ensured that the Islamic State didn't get a chance to
regenerate in Iraq.

If an early aerial intervention were mounted in Syria in late 2011 or
early (or even mid-) 2012 it would have stopped the Zarqawi'ites
metastasizing on Syrian soil, denying them the conditions they needed
--- including the complicity of the regime and Iran --- and ensured a
much better outcome by helping to power nationalists, who were
overwhelmingly powerful early in this rebellion, breaking Iran's power
in the Mediterranean, and not incidentally preventing a great deal of
killing and destruction. Project the worst you like for casualties from
a NATO intervention in Syria and it's not 220,000. (In Libya, 72
civilians were collateral damage in NATO's entire campaign, less than
one day's work from Assad, and estimates of the total casualties are
being revised down all the time.)

For those who worry that this is taking on too much, just remember: The
West is going to get dragged in anyway. It will be on terms much less
advantageous, the outcomes will be worse than they could have been with
earlier intervention, and many more people will die, but these
situations will eventually reach a point where they can no longer be
ignored whether, as in Iraq and Syria, it is the rise of transnational
terrorist groups or, as will soon be the case in Libya, the rise of
transnational terrorist groups and a destabilising flood of refugees
into Europe, some of whom will be agents of these terrorist groups. In
Iraq and Libya, it would have been much easier to simply stay on and
secure the gains the West had already achieved. As in so many other
cases, what to do about Syria has not been made easier by letting it
drag out.

The next question of the anti-interventionists tends to be on the "exit
strategy," but this is a fantasy on at least two counts. One is that it
sets up a standard of prescience on interventionists that
anti-interventionists never get held to. For example, Edward Miliband,
having organised the defeat of the proposal in the British Parliament
that said Bashar al-Assad should pay a military price for gassing
children, now bears partial responsibility for everybody who has been
killed in Syria by the regime since last August because he emboldened it
by sending the message that chemical weapons use was cost-free.

But somehow the costs of inaction never seem to register in the same
way. Second, an "exit strategy" can't be known until it's seen. [The
U.S. still has troops in **Germany**, **Japan**, **South Korea**,
**Bosnia**, and **Kosovo**]{.underline} --- [and so much the
better]{.underline}. Look how well they turned out as opposed to the
American South, Somalia, Haiti, and Iraq where American troops were
pulled out too soon. By being prepared to stay for as long as it takes,
there's every chance you won't have to stay so long. If it is understood
that you are determined to see it through, the local actors will make
their long-term arrangements with you. If, like Obama in Afghanistan,
you announce a commitment and simultaneously announce the end-date, the
local actors make their arrangements instead with internal and external
forces they know will be there forever.

In short, the lesson of Libya is not that the intervention in 2011 was a
mistake. It is the lesson once articulated by Representative Charles
Wilson of Texas, who was rather over-sold as having single-handedly
driven the Red Army out of Afghanistan in the excellent film Charlie
Wilson's War. "These things happened. They were glorious and they
changed the world," said the Congressman. "And then we fucked up the
endgame."

Did the United States Violate its Nuclear Agreements with Libya?

To Quote Wikipedia:

In 1968, Libya became signatory of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), ratified the treaty in 1975, and concluded a safeguards agreement
in 1980. The Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials were quoted
"Libya had bought nuclear components from various black market dealers",
and provided the various designs of centrifuges to U.S. officials and
gave the name of its suppliers."

So right there, you have Libya admitting to violating the NPT.

Recognizing that his country was vulnerable to a similar fate as Iraq
and wishing to have lifted the sanctions that had been in place since
the 1980s, Gaddafi announced his intention to destroy his WMD and to
allow inspectors to confirm this fact. The process began in December
2003 and was officially completed by February 2014.

"On 22 September 2011, near Sabha, Libya, toward the end of the Libyan
Civil War, anti-Gaddafi forces discovered two warehouses containing
thousands of blue barrels marked with tape reading "radioactive" and
plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same tape. The IAEA
stated, "We can confirm that there is yellowcake stored in drums at a
site near Sabha ... which Libya previously declared to the IAEA. ... The
IAEA has tentatively scheduled safeguards activities at this location
once the situation in the country stabilises.""

So maybe he didn't actually give up his WMD as promised?

At any rate, the US lifted its sanctions against Libya in 2004 as
promised. (U.S. Lifts Remaining Economic Sanctions Against Libya)

SEVEN years later, the Libyan people decided to overthrow the Gaddafi
regime. When he responded by indiscriminately bombing their cities, NATO
enacted various "no fly zones" in order to minimize the civilian
casualties. This air support from NATO allowed Libya rebel forces to
topple Gaddafi's regime and eventually kill him.

Conclusion:

[The failure of Western policy in Libya was not the decision to
intervene to prevent a massacre in Benghazi and to help the Libyans with
their **only viable defence** against Qaddafi, namely **toppling the
dictator**]{.underline}. The failure was in not committing what would
have been really quite limited resources mostly military and
intelligence trainers and advisers to stabilising the aftermath. Indeed
none other than President Obama appears to agree with this assessment.

"Had we not intervened, it's likely that Libya would be Syria," said the
President. His close adviser Ben Rhodes echoed this sentiment. So Obama
agrees that the intervention per se even with a messy outcome --- was
better than no intervention. [[In Libya]{.mark}, [**72** civilians were
killed]{.mark} **accidentally** [in NATO's entire campaign]{.mark},
[less than **one day's work** from Assad]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
estimates of the military casualties are being revised down all the
time. In Syria, 300,000 people and more are dead and the chaos has
opened the way to worse actors. (That Obama has elsewhere said the idea
that intervening earlier in Syria to support the moderates would have
resulted in a better outcome was "horseshit," can be safely put down the
political necessity of never admitting a mistake.)

On the other half of this argument that more needed to be done in the
aftermath Obama also agrees but says he "underestimated the need to come
in full force if you're going to do this." Obama ran for office against
the Iraq invasion in no small part highlighting the incompetence of the
Bush administration's reconstruction. The need for a post-war plan is
the most salient lesson of the Iraq experience. It seems unlikely this
came to Obama after 2011: the 2012 Election, where the President ran on
his record of extricating the U.S. from the Middle East, Iraq most
notably, serves as a much better explanation for why Obama would not
commit to Libya in a way that could be interpreted as "boots on the
ground".

Ultimately, the lesson of Libya is one that keeps being shown from
Afghanistan to Iraq to Bosnia: by refusing the small, early intervention
when allies would be easier to enlist, the U.S. ends up intervening at
much greater cost later, almost alone, and achieving a far less
desirable outcome.

The way we remember Libya suggests that the way we talk about America's
role in the world has changed, and not for the better. Americans are
probably more likely to consider the Libya intervention a failure
because the US was at the forefront of the NATO operation. So any
subsequent descent into conflict, presumably, says something about our
failure, which is something we'd rather not think about.

Outside of the foreign policy community, [politicians are usually
criticized for what they do abroad, rather than what they don't
do]{.underline}. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it,
"\[[Qaddafi]{.underline}\] [was not a threat to us]{.underline}
anywhere. [He was a threat to his own people, and that was about
it]{.underline}." [If the US had decided against intervention, Libya
would have]{.underline} likely [reverted to some noxious combination of
**dictatorship** and **insurgency**]{.underline}. [But we could have
**shirked responsibility**]{.underline} (a sort of inverse "pottery
barn" principle if you didn't break it, you don't have to fix it). We
could have claimed to have "done no harm," even though harm, of course,
would have been done.

[[It's easy]{.mark} for some [to suggest]{.mark} that Western
[interventionism is the problem]{.mark} here, [and the world would be
better off if the cries of]{.mark} the [civilians]{.mark} Gaddafi
slaughtered **[went ignored]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's only an
argument that can be made from outside the Oval Office, but it is one
that has a broad political constituency. [To claim that Libya is a
"neo-con" failure]{.underline}, however, [is a **willful
misrepresentation**]{.underline} of neo-conservatism. [[Libya is a
disaster]{.mark} today as a result [not of]{.mark} Western [engagement
but **withdrawal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The worst lesson from the
Libyan debacle is: half-measures will almost always produce suboptimal
results.

There was a time when the United States seemed to have a perpetual bias
toward action. The instinct of leaders, more often than not, was to act
militarily even in relatively small conflicts that were remote from
American national security interests. Our country's tragic experience in
Iraq changed that. Inaction came to be seen as a virtue. And, to be
sure, inaction is sometimes virtuous. Libya, though, was not one of
those times.

Today is the 16th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, and Twitter is
alive with condemnations of the conflict --- countered by precious few
defenses. Yet I believed the Iraq War was just and proper in 2003, and I
still believe that today. When Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** condemned
the war during the 2015 primary campaign and [claimed]{.underline} that
[if Saddam was still in power we]{.underline} "[wouldn't have the
problems you have right now]{.underline}," I believed he was dead wrong.
As I argued then, from the moment Hussein took power until he was
deposed in 2003, [there were few greater **instruments of instability**
in the world than Saddam Hussein]{.underline}.

[Before he was allegedly]{.underline} "[contained]{.underline}"
[by]{.underline} constant, substantial [American military
deployments]{.underline}, [he invaded his neighbors, **gassed his
people**]{.underline}, [harbored and supported terrorists]{.underline},
[and was responsible for **not one but two**]{.underline} [of the
largest conventional military conflicts since World War II]{.underline}
--- [the **horrific** Iran--Iraq war and Operation Desert
Storm]{.underline}. Even after American containment efforts attempted to
lock into place and limit his malign reach, he was a prime supporter of
a deadly Palestinian suicide-bombing campaign that caused
proportionately more Israeli civilian casualties than American civilians
lost on 9/11, [he tried to **assassinate** an American
president]{.underline} --- George H. W. Bush --- and he routinely fired
on American pilots enforcing lawful no-fly zones. [He violated the Gulf
War cease-fire accords, interfered with weapons inspections, and hid
away **chemical weapons** by the thousands]{.underline}. [No, his WMD
program wasn't nearly as extensive]{.underline} as we thought, [but it
is **fiction** to believe his weapons were entirely gone]{.underline}.
Americans were injured by Saddam's chemicals during the war.

Moreover, it's easy to forget that [before]{.underline} Barack
[Obama's]{.underline} terrible [decision to withdraw]{.underline} in
2011, the Iraq War had been won. [Saddam was gone, the follow-on
insurgency had been **wiped-out**]{.underline} --- reduced to a few
hundred fighters scattered in a vast country --- and American and Iraqi
forces were masters of the battlefield. Joe Biden asserted that
Americans would look at Iraq as "one of the great achievements of this
administration." But [Obama withdrew **too soon**]{.underline}. He
squandered American gains, opened the door to unrestrained factionalism,
and left the fragile Iraqi nation vulnerable to renewed jihadist
assault.

And lest we think that non-intervention can't also carry a terrible
price, [we can't forget the Ba'athist **dictator** we left
alone]{.underline}, [Hafez al-Assad]{.underline}. [His nation was caught
up in]{.underline} the unrest and ferment of [the Arab
Spring]{.underline} --- a movement that began far from the Iraq War.
[His nation has since become a charnel house, and not only did it spark
a **refugee crisis**]{.underline} that has helped destabilize Europe,
[but it became the battleground where the remnants of al
Qaeda]{.underline} in Iraq [were reborn as ISIS,]{.underline} a
genocidal force that invaded a weakened Iraq from Syria, ignited yet
another phase of the Iraq War, and inspired a renewed wave of terror in
the Europe (and deadly attacks in the United States). [Non-intervention
does not]{.underline} always [bring peace, and the consequences can
include death on a **mass scale**]{.underline}.

While I believe [the war against Saddam represented the best of a series
of **bad options**]{.underline}, there is no question that our
intervention in Iraq was marred by two very costly mistakes. I've
already mentioned one --- Obama's premature withdrawal. The first
mistake belongs to George W. Bush and his commanders. It's by now quite
clear that we invaded with insufficient force to properly secure the
country and then compounded that error with early blunders after Saddam
was deposed. We not only failed to secure vast quantities of munitions,
we disbanded the Iraqi Army and then pursued seriously flawed
counterinsurgency tactics before righting the ship during the Surge.
Bush's mistakes made the war more costly. Obama's mistakes gave room for
the ISIS offensive and necessitated renewed American involvement in
Iraq. Both men eventually corrected their errors. Bush reinforced
American forces as his commanders changed tactics, and Obama put boots
back on the ground to help save Iraq from potential collapse.

More than 4,400 Americans died during Operation Iraqi Freedom, including
men I served with and loved like brothers. They died in a just cause
fighting enemies of this country --- a regime and an insurgency that in
different ways threatened vital American interests and actively sought
to kill Americans and our allies. [War is horrible]{.underline}, [and
the Iraq War is no exceptio]{.underline}n to that rule. Civilian
casualties were terrible and often intentionally inflicted by our
enemies to destabilize the country and inflame sectarian divisions.
[But]{.underline} I truly believe [the choice our nation faced was to
fight Saddam **then**]{.underline}, on our terms, **[or
later]{.underline}**, when he had recovered more of his nation's
strength and lethality. The United States is safer with him gone. It's
just a terrible shame that for a time we chose to throw away a victory
bought with the blood of brave men.

#### Iraq's doing [way better]{.underline} now. The solution to incorrect justifications is to conduct [careful analysis]{.underline}, not to reject all action.

As we consider further military action in Syria and elsewhere in the
Middle East, we cannot avoid assessing the Iraq War.

The Iraq War was controversial and polarizing. [Our sharply [divisive
debate]{.mark}]{.underline} about it [[can impair]{.mark} **[objective
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many label the Iraq War a
failure]{.underline}. **[They are wrong]{.underline}**.

The key question in assessing the Iraq War is what kind of Iraqi state
did the war produce? We have objective measures used to judge states
around the world to answer this question. What are the state's relations
with other states? Does it repress its population? Is it a dictatorship
or a democracy? What are its levels of prosperity, life expectancy and
infant mortality? [[By]{.mark} each of these [measures]{.mark}, [the
Iraq War was a **success**]{.mark} because the resulting Iraqi state is
**vastly better**]{.underline}.

**[Peace with other states]{.underline}**

[In 1980, Saddam [Hussein's Iraq attacked]{.mark}
**[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In 1990, it attacked
**[Kuwait]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In 1991, it attacked **[Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Between
1993 and 2001, it attacked patrolling American aircraft. [[Since
the]{.underline}]{.mark} war and the [[overthrow]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Hussein in 2003, [[Iraq **has not attacked**]{.mark} another
state]{.underline}.

[No more systematic **military repression** of most of the
population]{.underline}

[[Hussein used Iraq's military to]{.mark} **violently** and
**[systematically repress]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Iraq's [Kurds and Shia
Arabs]{.mark}, even [using]{.mark} **[chemical weapons]{.mark}**
[against civilians]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kurds are about 16% of Iraq's
population and Shia Arabs are about 49%. [[The war
ended]{.underline}]{.mark} the systematic military [[repression
of]{.underline}]{.mark} this combined [[**65**% of Iraq's
population]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The freest system of government in the Arab world

[The war transformed Iraq from one of the world's most repressive states
into a state with the **freest system**]{.underline} of government in
the Arab world. The war began in 2003. [Since 2004, Iraq has had **seven
major elections**]{.underline}: the 2004 National Assembly Election; the
2005 Constitutional Referendum; the 2005, 2010 and 2014 Parliamentary
Elections; and the 2009 and 2013 Provincial Council elections. All have
been judged free and fair by international monitors. These seven
elections are more free and fair elections than the rest of the Arab
world has ever had. More than 11 million voted in both the 2010 and 2014
Parliamentary Elections. In 2014, 27 political parties won seats. No
other Arab state has been remotely as democratic, during this period or
over any other decade.

Higher income and life expectancy, and lower infant mortality

The other important objective measures used to assess states around the
world show that life has improved for Iraqi citizens. More Iraqis are
alive today than before the war.

World Bank data show that in 2002, the last year before the war, Iraq's
population was 24.94 million. In 2015, it was 36.42 million.

[[Iraqis are **living longer**]{.underline}]{.mark}. World Bank data
show that [in 2002, average life expectancy in Iraq was 68.94
years]{.underline}. [By 2015, it was 69.59 years]{.underline}. The data
show similar increases in life expectancy for both men and women.

[[**Infant mortality** has declined]{.mark} in Iraq]{.underline}. World
Bank data show that [in 2002, the infant mortality rate per 1,000 births
was 34.6]{.underline}. [By 2015, it was 26.5]{.underline}.

[[Iraqis are]{.mark} much [more]{.mark}
**[prosperous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. CIA World Factbook data show that
[in 2002, per capita GDP, measured in]{.underline} purchasing power
parity ([PPP]{.underline}) terms, [was \$2,400]{.underline}. [By
2013]{.underline}, the last year of this PPP data series, [it was
\$7,100]{.underline}. (Tradingeconomics.com data show a modest 3.4%
decline since 2013.)

[[None of this excuses the intel]{.mark}ligence [failure about]{.mark}
**[w]{.mark}**eapons of **[m]{.mark}**ass
**[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline}. [None of this suggests
that]{.underline} the [[we should]{.mark} not [use]{.mark} the **most
[careful analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [before deciding whether
to]{.underline} risk significant amounts of blood and treasure and
[invade or take other militarily action]{.underline}. None of this
suggests that Iraq is an easy place to live. Iraq's political and civic
institutions need to take big steps to reach Western standards.
Relations between Shia Arabs, Sunni Arabs and Kurds need significant
improvement. Iraq must defeat the remaining Islamic State forces in the
country and prevent other groups from committing similar violence.
Iranian influence in Iraq is undesirable and unhelpful.

[[Decisions]{.mark} concerning military action in the Middle East [are
**difficult** and **complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In making these
decisions, we should recognize that by important objective measures, the
Iraq War was a success -- a victory for America that resulted in a much
better Iraq.

### ! --- NATO Good --- AT: Interventions --- Afghanistan

#### NATO wasn't eager to intervene; the UN got them involved.

An additional concern arose over the precedent invoking Article V could
set if U.S. authorities subsequently determined that the attack had
originated from within the U.S. homeland and not from abroad. The Bush
administration feared that the United States could then be asked to
intervene against domestic terrorist attacks in NATO treaty states in
the future. The Canadian chief of defense, who by happenstance found
himself in the room when NATO ambassadors began debating whether or not
to invoke Article V on Sept. 12, recalls the Americans "wanting to be
absolutely sure that it was an attack from outside the U.S.\[,\]" and
not a domestic terrorist act like the Oklahoma City bombing, before NATO
authorized any follow-on action. After confirming that the attacks
originated outside the United States, [it]{.underline} then
[took]{.underline} "**[substantial work]{.underline}**" on the part of
U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns [to convince]{.underline} other
Bush administration [officials that having the NATO alliance formally
invoke the mutual defense clause was important]{.underline}.
Consequently, it was not until Oct. 4, 2001, that the North Atlantic
Council formally invoked Article V, paving the way for NATO allies to
send Airborne Early Warning and Control Force aircraft (AWACs) to patrol
U.S. skies and offer other assistance, such as intelligence sharing, to
Washington.

Although some NATO [allies]{.underline}, including Canada, Britain and
Germany, [chose]{.underline} early on [to contribute]{.underline}
special operations forces (SOF) and, later, other military assets to the
U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, which
lasted from 2001 to 2014), they did so **[independent]{.underline}** [of
NATO]{.underline} headquarters and command structures.

[Nor did NATO play any part in the creation of the International
Security Assistance Force]{.underline}, despite subsequently going on to
lead it for more than a decade. When the security assistance force was
announced at the Bonn Conference in December 2001, [it was done so under
the auspices of the **U.N**. Security Council, not the
alliance]{.underline}. [U.N. Security Council Resolution]{.underline}
1386 officially [mandated ISAF to]{.underline} "[assist the Afghan
Interim Authority]{.underline} in the maintenance of security in Kabul
and its surrounding areas." Responsibility for overseeing the original
5,000-person multinational force for the first six months was assigned
to the United Kingdom. Thereafter, ISAF's command rotated to a new lead
nation every six months, first to Turkey (July 2002-January 2003) and
then Germany (January 2003-August 2003).

By fall 2002, however, [it was becoming increasingly]{.underline} clear
[to nations contributing]{.underline} forces [to ISAF that the security
force would benefit from having NATO's military
headquarters]{.underline} in Mons, Belgium, [assume
responsibility]{.underline} for the force generation process needed to
sustain the Kabul-based operation. The difficulties ISAF's lead
countries experienced sourcing personnel to sustain the Kabul force,
coupled with the Pentagon's waning attention toward Afghanistan as it
prepared to invade Iraq in spring 2003, led Washington and its NATO
allies to conclude that the time had come for the alliance to take
charge of ISAF. Accordingly, on Aug. 11, 2003, NATO assumed command of
ISAF, marking the alliance's official entree into Afghanistan.

Yet while NATO would remain in charge of ISAF until the security force
was eventually stood down at the end of 2014, [ISAF remained a
NATO-led]{.underline} ([as opposed to a purely NATO]{.underline})
[force]{.underline}, [owing to the large number of **non-NATO**
countries]{.underline}---including Australia, Georgia, Jordan and the
Republic of Korea, each operating under its own rules of
engagement---that contributed personnel to the mission. Following the
conclusion of ISAF's operations in Afghanistan in December 2014, NATO
stood up a new mission, Resolute Support, focused on building Afghan
National Security Force (ANSF) sustainability. But, like its
predecessor, Resolute Support was a NATO-led mission, comprising both
NATO allies as well as non-NATO countries, and not an Article V
collective defense mission by the alliance.

#### The Afghanistan intervention was good.

The end of a war is a time to reflect. So is a milestone anniversary
like the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11. Now, in September 2021, the two
are bound up together---the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, not
coincidentally, taking place in close proximity to the milestone
anniversary.

For Lawfare, the two events are also intimately tied to the history of
the site itself. Lawfare surely wouldn't exist but for the Sept. 11
attacks and the war in Afghanistan. The early years of the site were far
more concerned with issues arising out of that conflict than they were
with cybersecurity, disinformation, authoritarian populism and the other
issues that predominate on the site these days.

It is probably not possible to over-reflect on the withdrawal and the
anniversary. But [it is possible to draw the wrong
conclusions]{.underline} from reflections on what went wrong in the
Afghanistan war---which ended, as it began, with the Taliban in control
of the country. And with Afghanistan today facially seeming like
Afghanistan as it was on Sept. 11, it is possible to reflect one's way
to the conclusions that the invasion of Afghanistan was a mistake, that
it accomplished nothing and that Americans died in vain. It is possible
to conclude that any gains were ephemeral, that only the civilian
casualties and the policy blunders had lasting consequences, that 20
years of keeping the Taliban at bay was worth nothing and that the
destruction of al-Qaeda's base of operations was all an exercise in
squandered blood and treasure.

A great many sober, serious people have embraced these gloomy
conclusions---in some cases selectively, in many cases as a morose,
defeatist package. [The instinct to evaluate the war in binary terms is
understandable. People tend to think of wars as won or
lost]{.underline}. And watching the chaotic evacuation from Kabul, it
certainly didn't look like a win. It didn't even look like a stalemate.
It looked like a rout.

The final scorecard looks bad too. The vicious gambler played by George
C. Scott scoffs at the young pool shark played by Paul Newman in the
movie "The Hustler," for suggesting he had been way ahead in a game
against the world's best player before losing it all. "This game isn\'t
like football. Nobody pays you for yardage," the gambler says. "When you
hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your
money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way." By this
standard, certainly, the Taliban bested us. U.S. forces smashed them for
years, but at the end of the game, they have Afghanistan---and the
government the United States supported evaporated just like Paul
Newman's early lead.

Yet there is more to be said on behalf of America's two-decade-long
effort in Afghanistan than these crude analyses allow. [We certainly
don't mean to suggest that the war was a complete success. It was
not]{.underline}. Many Americans lost their lives fighting there (and
far more Afghans died), and the United States spent trillions in a vain
effort to build the Afghan state. [Yet]{.underline} here it's not just
the end point that matters but the nature of the curve that led to that
endpoint. And there's a great deal of area under the curve of the
Afghanistan war, area one shouldn't throw away lightly.

[The truth is that the war actually accomplished a **good
deal**]{.underline}---even if its most ambitious objectives remained
ever-elusive. [Far from a mistake, the invasion of Afghanistan to topple
the first Taliban regime was a **necessity**]{.underline} in the
post-Sept. 11 environment. Indeed, it's hard to imagine a successful
counterterrorism campaign in the years that followed Sept. 11 without
it. It played a decisive role in dismantling what had become a major and
persistent threat to American lives. [It provided for a long period of
imperfect but **nonmurderous**]{.underline} [government for many
Afghans, particularly **urban**, **minority** and **female
Afghans**]{.underline}. And it helped to facilitate a long period in
which successful foreign-based terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland
simply did not happen.

Whether one regards the war ultimately as a success or a failure, it is
important to tally its costs and benefits accurately. As people
currently seem to be tallying only its costs, we offer this post to
remind people of the complexity of assessing the Afghanistan war.

The Afghanistan Sanctuary

With two decades of water under the bridge, people often treat the Sept.
11 attacks as a bolt out of the blue to which the country responded by
reorganizing and militarizing its entire foreign policy and domestic
politics. [There's some truth in this story, but lost in it is just how
active and menacing al-Qaeda had become]{.underline} in the years
leading up to Sept. 11. Jihadists with ties to Afghanistan had bombed
the World Trade Center in 1993, killing six people and injuring over
1,000. [In 1996, al-Qaeda moved to Afghanistan and, in 1998, attacked
two U.S. embassies in East Africa---**killing hundreds** and wounding
thousands]{.underline}. [Two years later, it pulled off a bombing of a
U.S. warship]{.underline}, the USS Cole. Sept. 11 was really a
culmination of a mounting and increasingly deadly terrorism campaign
that no reasonable government would have continued to tolerate.

[It was a campaign run chiefly from Afghanistan, and it was possible
because the Taliban allowed al-Qaeda a haven]{.underline} from which it
could build a mini-army and launch attack after attack on its enemies.

So while the 20-year military intervention in Afghanistan may have been
a mistake, it was important, indeed essential, that the United States
remove the Taliban from power in 2001 and destroy al-Qaeda bases in
Afghanistan and Pakistan in the years that followed.

Indeed, Afghanistan became an important base for al-Qaeda well before
Sept. 11, and high-profile terrorist attacks were only one element of
the danger posed as a result. As long as al-Qaeda enjoyed a base in
Afghanistan, it could convene planning sessions and generate new plots:
The United States was always playing defense.

To get a sense of how important Afghanistan, and nearby facilities in
Pakistan, were to al-Qaeda, and the many facets that the Afghanistan
base played in al-Qaeda's overall operations and successes, it's useful
to examine the Sept. 11 plot in more detail:

Plotting began in earnest in late 1998 or early 1999, more than two
years before the attack occurred. The plot's mastermind, Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed, met with al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to
pitch his novel idea for an attack. He received approval, and, crucially
from his point of view, gained the money and recruits that bin Laden had
available. These leaders and others enjoyed a sanctuary in Afghanistan
to oversee the operation with little interference. From there, they
could confer with one another, communicate with operatives, and
otherwise organize a broad movement even as they launched individual
attacks.

The cell leader, Mohammed Atta, had originally sought to fight in
Chechnya, and he ended up going to Afghanistan to train, along with
three friends who also went on to play important roles in the plot. Once
he arrived in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda leaders spotted Atta's leadership
abilities, discipline and fluency in English, redirecting him to the
Sept. 11 operation. As Atta's experience suggests, in Afghanistan
al-Qaeda was able to screen and vet would-be members, choosing the most
committed and skilled to join its own ranks while enabling others to
become more capable.

Indoctrination and control were important parts of what made the camps
so dangerous. Al-Qaeda was able to knit together a disparate array of
groups and causes---anti-Israel, anti-Egypt, anti-Russia, pro-Taliban
and so on---and make them a more unified movement. This was a tremendous
achievement for a movement that often fought (and would fight) more
within its ranks than against outsiders. In addition, it could take
committed activists like Atta and redirect them against the leadership's
preferred targets.

Al-Qaeda leaders later selected other plot members, the so-called
muscle, primarily from Saudi volunteers who had come to Afghanistan to
join the jihad.

The hijackers were not alone: Other jihadists, between 10,000 and
20,000, according to CIA estimates, received a wide array of training in
Afghanistan. Most volunteers learned basic weapons skills and had a
boot-camp-like experience to weed out the uncommitted, enabling them to
become more effective insurgents in various struggles around the Muslim
world. These al-Qaeda recruits would also help the Taliban in its
campaign to conquer all of Afghanistan. Indeed, during the invasion
after Sept. 11, U.S. soldiers found that the Arab jihadists, not the
Taliban, were the most ferocious and skilled fighters. A select few went
to camps that offered more advanced training, such as
counterintelligence, bomb-making and other skills useful for terrorism.
The muscle hijackers, for example, received the basic training to
determine their fitness and dedication and then received more advanced
training on how to hijack airplanes, disarm air marshals and use
explosives.

The training camps and Afghan experience proved instrumental for
insurgencies around the Muslim world. Figures like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
who later founded al-Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner of ISIS, went to
Afghanistan in the late 1990s and ran a training camp there.

Taken together, these factors made the pre-Sept. 11 haven in Afghanistan
devastatingly dangerous. Al-Qaeda could knit together a divided and
far-flung movement, train operatives to a lethal degree of proficiency,
and plan elaborate operations with little interference.

The Taliban sheltered al-Qaeda. Although the Taliban did not approve of
al-Qaeda's terrorism operations against the West, it did not stop them
either. Nor would the Taliban surrender bin Laden or other terrorists,
doubting the veracity of U.S. charges and being unwilling to lose face
with Taliban members and supporters by handing over to the infidels a
man they considered a good Muslim. Even today, Taliban officials deny
bin Laden's responsibility for Sept. 11.

The U.S. invasion quickly toppled the Taliban and proved devastating for
al-Qaeda. Some of those captured included leaders or others in the
movement who revealed ongoing plots, such as a plot to conduct multiple
terrorist attacks in Israel that was well along in its planning. The
movement lost its archipelago of training camps and with it the ability
to provide a wide array of training to thousands of recruits. Nor could
it indoctrinate as effectively, although advances in information
technology would pose new challenges. The movement also lost much of its
cadre fighting the U.S. invasion. Its leaders who survived found
themselves under constant pressure. Finally, the apparent overthrow of
the Taliban, which many jihadists deemed the one true Islamic
government, made many jihadists question the wisdom of al-Qaeda's
strategy.

Post-Sept. 11 Operations

Despite these many advances, al-Qaeda's terrorism threat didn't end with
the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 and the establishment of a new
government in Afghanistan. Key leaders, including bin Laden, dispersed
to Pakistan, and from there, they directed numerous operations against
the West and in the broader Middle East. Many of these involved
individuals who were recruited and trained before Sept. 11, but the
plans and operations continued in its aftermath with direction from
Pakistan. Notable attacks and plots included the 2002 Bali bombing and
2004 Madrid and 2005 London transportation bombings, which killed 202,
193 and 52 people, respectively. Bin Laden financed the Bali bombing,
and terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman noted in 2007 that "almost all major
incidents" in Europe had ties to al-Qaeda, with key operatives being
trained or based in Pakistan. In 2006, security officials disrupted a
plan to smuggle liquid explosives aboard airplanes flying from Europe to
the United States and Canada and detonate them midair, which would have
killed around 1,500 people according to prosecutors---a plot that also
had many of its origins in Pakistan.

Although the Pakistani government arrested many important al-Qaeda
leaders, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Afghanistan proved an
important base for the U.S. in going after the al-Qaeda haven in remote
parts of Pakistan, removing senior figures that Pakistan could not, or
would not, take out. The United States conducted numerous strikes on
al-Qaeda in the remote Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along
Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. According to analyses from the New
America Foundation, the first drone strike in Pakistan was conducted in
2004, and the dozens that occurred during the Bush administration would
grow to hundreds under President Obama, peaking in 2010 before declining
rapidly as the decade went on. The United States killed almost 100
leaders, as well as numerous lower-level cadre.

Many of these strikes were launched from bases in Afghanistan. To do
persistent surveillance and regular strikes, as was being done a decade
ago, bases in Afghanistan close to the FATA proved essential. In
addition, the most famous counterterrorism operation in U.S. history,
the killing of bin Laden, also depended on access to Afghanistan, the
base from which operatives launched their cross-border operation.

Over time, the strikes hollowed out al-Qaeda. As New America's David
Sterman contends, "\[T\]hese drone strikes have knocked out the ability
of Al Qaeda to plot from Pakistan." In addition to the death of
experienced commanders, if its leaders communicated in real time by
phone or by using the internet, they risked being located and killed.
Forced into hiding, the core was no longer able to orchestrate attacks
in the West. And although the drone strikes caused significant civilian
casualties, an analysis by Aqil Shah found that---contrary to common
mythology---they did not increase terrorist recruitment.

In other words, Afghanistan was essential to al-Qaeda in the years
before Sept. 11, and depriving al-Qaeda of the use of it was,
consequently, a post-Sept. 11 necessity. Less well understood,
Afghanistan became an important base of operations for ongoing U.S.
counterterrorism activity in the decades that followed, particularly in
the critical period in which U.S. forces were able to reduce the
once-menacing organization to a husk of itself. These are both major
successes of the Afghanistan operation. Few people imagined in the
period immediately after Sept. 11 that the United States would go two
decades without a second major homeland attack emanating from abroad.
That accomplishment simply cannot be separated from the decision to go
into Afghanistan and stay there a good long while. Whether it can be
sustained in the absence of U.S. forces on the ground there remains to
be seen.

The Edifice of American Counterterrorism

There's a legal aspect to this point as well: The entire legal edifice
of post-Sept. 11 U.S. counterterrorism policy was bound up with the war
in Afghanistan. That is, because the enemy was in Afghanistan, U.S.
administrations needed a legal framework that allowed U.S. forces to
operate in Afghanistan. Because suspects were not reachable by
traditional law enforcement means, the Bush, Obama and Trump
administrations required an operating framework that engaged military
authorities. That framework was the war in Afghanistan. And it's a bit
difficult to imagine, even in retrospect, what that framework might have
looked like without the war.

It is, to be sure, perverse to suggest that the Afghanistan war was
necessary so that the United States could have the 2001 Authorization
for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the rules and authorities that
flowed from it. Laws authorize wars, after all, not the other way
around. It is also not quite accurate. The AUMF did not, after all,
require the invasion of Afghanistan; it merely authorized it. The
statute's broad operative language, which does not mention Afghanistan
and operated worldwide, could have supported---and did, in fact,
support---other military activity, or it could have supported no
military activity at all, as some AUMFs historically have done. Yet it
is safe to say that the AUMF, passed in the immediate wake of Sept. 11
with policymakers eyeing the Afghan sanctuary, presumed that the coming
military action would take place in Afghanistan. It seems unlikely it
would have been passed had the Bush administration not envisioned an
attack on that country imminently on its passage.

So try to imagine, for a moment, that the Bush administration had not
headed in that direction---as so many analysts, with the hindsight of
two decades, now think would have been wiser. What would the combined
strategic and legal framework for counterterrorism have looked like?

One possibility is that it might have looked very much as it did.
Congress might have passed an AUMF like the one it did, in fact, pass;
it just would have been used more sparingly, less ambitiously---for the
occasional spree of air strikes, or special operations forces raids.
American forces still would have the statutory authority to do all the
things they did that were so effective in counterterrorism. They just
would have done them without a long-term presence in Afghanistan. But
this scenario raises a significant obstacle to the lethal force and
detention aspects of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism operations. Without
the bona fide armed conflict in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the American
invocation of law of armed conflict authorities would have depended (as
they now, in fact, depend) solely on the claim that episodic violent
engagements between the United States and al-Qaeda suffice to create a
real armed conflict. That has always been a hotly disputed claim, even
in the U.S. court system. So the no-invasion scenario would have made it
significantly harder, in practice, to legally justify detention,
military commissions and possibly even air strikes.

But there's another possibility too. The rejection of "forever war" in
Afghanistan is not, after all, an argument for more limited forever
wars. It is an argument against protracted military commitments at all.
If we project that Congress and the Bush administration in 2001 shared
that skepticism, so in vogue today, we are left with the probability
that there would have been no reason for them to pass a broad AUMF in
the first place. If America was not going to invade Afghanistan to deal
with the entrenched al-Qaeda presence there, it probably wouldn't have
bothered to deal with lesser presences such as jihadists in Somalia,
Yemen or other countries. It therefore would have needed the legal
architecture policymakers put in place---on either the military or
covert sides of the ledger.

So one possibility when analysts retrospectively reject the war in
Afghanistan is that they are actually proposing to throw out a large
portion of the legal edifice of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism policy.
That has implications well beyond Afghanistan itself. Under the AUMF,
remember, the United States conducted drone strikes in Yemen, crushed
ISIS, and killed hundreds of al-Qaeda operatives in Pakistan. It
detained operatives around the world. It's fair to ask those who
casually now assert that the war was a mistake: Is the rejection of the
war in Afghanistan a rejection of that entire military approach to
counterterrorism, or is it merely a rejection of that approach coupled
with an invasion and long-term presence in Afghanistan? The answer to
this question is surely different from analyst to analyst. But those who
mean the former should answer the question of what combined
strategic-legal approach they imagine the Bush administration should
have adopted in the war's place. And those who mean the latter would do
well to specify what kind of conflict they imagine having taken place in
the absence of the underlying war in Afghanistan.

We are not suggesting there are no possible answers to these questions.
One might imagine a more purely law-enforcement-based post-Sept. 11
response with limited uses of force under, say, a narrower AUMF. One
could also imagine a legal approach similar to the one the U.S. took,
only used less aggressively---or with a briefer stay in Afghanistan.
Moreover, as is true today, alternatives to basing and access in
Afghanistan did exist. The United States has launched drone attacks from
bases in Pakistan in the past, but as relations soured the United States
was expelled from these bases. As the United States left Kabul, it
launched a drone strike from the United Arab Emirates against the ISIS
branch in Afghanistan.

But these questions do require answers. It will not do to pocket the
gains of the Afghanistan war as though they were given and tally only
the costs. Giving up the war means giving up the gains as well.

And those gains were not all military, and they are not all counted in
enemy fighters captured or killed. It has become an empty talking point
to mention that [millions of Afghan girls attended school after the
Taliban's ouster, and thousands of women went on to university and to
jobs outside the home, that religious minorities like the Shiite Hazara
population enjoyed **greater rights**, and that soccer stadiums were not
used for public executions]{.underline}. It is certainly true that human
rights gains in Afghanistan, however real, were not the purpose of the
mission---and that they cannot ultimately be the metric by which the
mission gets evaluated. Yet if one is counting the yardage of gains and
loss, these human rights improvements are not negligible either. [Such
collateral improvements to the human rights and lives of **millions of
people**]{.underline} [are no more to be ignored than]{.underline} the
[collateral damage]{.underline} to individuals in errant military
operations. [It is **simply a fact** that]{.underline} over 20 years,
[the United States]{.underline} made itself safer by
[improv]{.underline}ing [life for millions of Afghans]{.underline}.

factor in military intervention to deal with supply disruptions and
other contingencies, maintaining a peacetime military presence in the
region is not necessary. The United States can rely on carrier-based
airpower and long-range bombers if military intervention in a crisis
becomes necessary. 137

Political Science," p. 26-33; GR\]

I mean that [[what **IR is**]{.mark} **or is not** [is not]{.mark}
**nearly [as important]{.mark}** [as what it
**achieves**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So the question should not be whether
IR is scientific, but rather, how scientific does it need to be to get
the job done? To this, there are many answers, but I suggest a line of
reasoning: the scientific method in the most general sense is useful in
helping to explain how and why, all else equal, causal processes work.
Put differently, [[if we want to know]{.mark} **how and [wh]{.mark}y**
some [states **go to war**]{.mark}]{.underline} and others do not, [[it
would be]{.mark} **more [useful]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[in the sense
of [getting]{.mark} **logically [coherent]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}
**empirically [verifiable]{.mark}** [answers]{.mark}---[to
analyze]{.mark} **historical [cases]{.mark}
systematically**]{.underline} than it would be to consult with a shaman
or use a crystal ball to obtain an answer. This is not say that there is
not an important role for textual interpretation in the process of
studying war and other international phenomena. Indeed, I elsewhere
argue that interpretation of historical texts is crucial to making valid
claims about wars.47 But the main point here is that interpretation is a
means toward an end, namely, the process of coping with the world via
human experience. Toward that end, interpretation is necessary and
useful, but it is not the end itself.

A second point is that there is clearly a pragmatic and justifiable need
for certain types of quantitative methods, namely, statistics, though
not necessarily formal models, in some segments of IR. Taking a simple
example for illustrative purposes, if one wished to study the effect of
speed limits on motor vehicle fatalities, the use of aggregate data
statistically analyzed would be far superior to standing on the corner
waiting for an accident to observe or reading several diary accounts of
individual accidents. The key point here, however, is not that
statistical methods are inherently better, or more "rigorous" than any
other type of method. Rather, [[the use of]{.mark} **statistically
analyzed [data]{.mark}** to find answers to problems]{.underline} of
highway fatalities [[creates **knowledge** that]{.underline}]{.mark} if
properly applied, [**would [alleviate]{.mark}** ["concrete]{.mark}
**human [woes]{.mark},"** which is to say it would help to save lives.
[That is **pragmatic**]{.mark} **political
[science]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

48 What Is a Problem?

Many political scientists believe in the idea of having a "problem
orientation" for the field. For example, Atul Kohli asserts that there
is a strong consensus among leading experts "that comparative politics
is very much a problem-driven field of study." "What motivates the best
comparative politics research are puzzles of real-world significance,"
writes Kohli, in "The Role of Theory in Comparative Politics: A
Symposium."49 Similarly, Ian Shapiro, responding to the question of what
would be a better alternative than RCT asks the question: "What is the
phenomenon to be explained?... The formulation of alternative
explanations, in other words, should be a problem-driven activity."50
This is clearly consistent with Deweyan pragmatism; in fact, it is
inherently pragmatist. "A Deweyan pragmatic approach to political
inquiry," writes Maurice Meilleur, "would transform political science
from a discipline, based on a set of methods, into a profession, based
on a set of problems."51 But what, more specifically, is a "problem
orientation?" First, it is clear that Kohli and his colleagues mean an
empirically driven problem orientation. That is, the study of [[politics
should be driven by **empirical**, **not theoretical**]{.mark}, or
**methodological [problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Careful not to push
this point too far, a Deweyan pragmatist would suggest that theorization
is an important activity, but it must not lose its link to problems of
human experience, which is to say empirical problems. However, Kohli and
others advocating an empirically driven problem orientation have little
to say about how to identify and value problems. After all, there is a
limitless supply of political problems only a fraction of which can be
studied.

In response, I would argue that some problems are more significant to
the detection and response to human suffering and thus more deserving of
study, than others. This is itself a tricky ethical problem, for who is
to say what is or is not a "real problem?" One reader of this manuscript
suggested that "What is really going on here, when one scratches the
analytical surface, is not that IR theorists aren\'t discussing
problems; it\'s that they are discussing problems that the author does
not feel are worthy of attention. But why should we accept that the
author\'s "problems" are more important or privileged? Why does the
author get to decide what a "real" problem is?" This is a good question
but it is a misreading of the argument. Nowhere does Dewey or this
author imply that any individual could or should decide or dictate which
problems matter and which do not. To the contrary, the question of "who
decides" is a public deliberation problem, a subject Dewey addressed
exhaustively in his classic The Public and Its Problems.52 According to
Dewey, problems are the direct outcome of a public\'s determination of
its common good. A full analysis of how this works, or in some cases,
fails to work in practice is beyond the scope of this article. But it is
important to note that there is no argument here for the privileging of
one private individual\'s notion of what constitutions "real problem"
versus that of another. That is for the public to decide.

Human Woe and Issues That Matter

The final point to be made about reconstruction stems directly from the
previous discussion: some problems matter more than others with regard
to the alleviation of concrete human suffering. Which issues matter the
most in our world? Ultimately, per Dewey\'s political philosophy touched
on above, that is for the public to decide. Assuming that there ever
could be a "common good," we can hypothesize that [[people might
**choose** to **focus on**]{.mark} issues]{.underline} that affect them
daily, issues [such as **climate change**, **poverty**]{.underline},
health care, education, [**racism**, and **sexism**]{.underline}, as
well as **[[war]{.mark} and peace]{.underline}**, all [[issues that are
of]{.mark} **grave [importance]{.mark}** [to
**humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. IR, especially in its American form,
with its disproportionate emphasis on global security and great power
war, has given scant attention to too many other issues, and when
attention is given to the "lesser" topics, they are relegated to
sub-sub-specializations within the discipline, "Gender and IR," for
instance. More **[[problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
standpoint of pragmatism, [[the **approach**]{.mark}**-driven
wing**]{.underline} of the discipline [is **more [concerned]{.mark}**
[with which **paradigm** has scored]{.mark} **more [points]{.mark}** [in
the]{.mark} **epic [contest]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **paradigmatic
[supremacy]{.mark}** [than with]{.mark}]{.underline} the matter of [[how
the world **could or should** respond]{.underline}]{.mark} to climate
change or why hundreds of million of children lack basic nutrition and
medical care. The interpretivist/linguistic wing, in contrast, is more
concerned with how texts are interpreted in graduate seminars than with
the fact that children in inner cities cannot even read a text at all.

53 [[Many]{.underline}]{.mark} IR scholars are still fighting over
whether and to what extent "unit-level variables" should be taken into
consideration in understanding international politics (and if so,
whether one might still rightly be accepted in the club of realism).54
Others [[are **trying** to demonstrate that IR]{.underline}]{.mark}
constructivism [[is]{.mark} really "**[liberalism]{.mark} in
disguise**]{.underline}."55 [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark} not a stab at
"why realism is (yet again) wrong." It is [a critique of the
**[self-]{.mark}definitionally [obsessed]{.mark}**, paradigm-driven
culture]{.underline} of academic IR. I would not go so far as to claim
that there are no scholars who study everyday politics; many clearly
do.56 Rather, [[the problem is that]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
incentive structure to contribute to the "big debates" of the
discipline, namely, those at [[the]{.mark} paradigmatic
level]{.underline}, is a [[project]{.mark} that [drifts]{.mark} **ever
[afar]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the problems of "**[concrete]{.mark} human
[woe]{.mark}**[" that affect the]{.mark} **other [millions of

**DeBoer '16** \[Fredrik; March 15th; Ph.D. from Purdue
University; Fredrikdeboer, "c'mon, guys,"
http://fredrikdeboer.com/2016/03/15/cmon-guys/; GR\]

I could be wrong about the short-term dangers, and the stakes are
incredibly high. But in the end we're left with the same old question:
[[what tactics]{.underline}]{.mark} will [**actually [work]{.mark}** [to
secure a **better world?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

In a sharp, sober piece about the meaning of left-wing political
violence in the 1970s, Tim Barker writes "If you can't acknowledge
radical violence, radicals are reduced to mere victims of repression,
rather than political actors who made definite tactical choices under
given political circumstances." The problem, as Barker goes on to imply,
is those tactical choices: [[in]{.mark} **today's
[America]{.mark}**]{.underline} they will essentially
[[never]{.underline}]{.mark} break on the side of [**armed
[opposition]{.mark}** [against **the state**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
government knows everything about you, I'm sorry to say, your movements
and your associations and the books you read and the things you buy and
what you're saying to the people you communicate with. That's simply on
the level of information before we even get to the state's incredible
capacity to inflict violence.

Look, the world has changed. The relative military capacity of regular
people compared to establishment governments has changed, especially in
fully developed, technology-enabled countries like the United States.
The Czar had his armies, yes, but the Czar's armies depended on manpower
above and beyond everything else. The fighting was still mostly
different groups of people with rifles shooting at each other.
[[If]{.mark} tomorrow [you]{.mark} could [**rally** as many]{.mark}
people [as the **Bolsheviks**]{.mark}]{.underline} had at their
revolutionary peak, [[you're still]{.mark} left [in a world of
**F-15s**, **drones**, and]{.mark} **cluster
[bombs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And that's to say nothing of the fact
that establishment governments in the developed world can rely on the
numbing agents of capitalist luxuries and the American dream to damper
revolutionary enthusiasm even among the many millions who have been
marginalized and impoverished. [[This]{.mark} just [isn't **1950s
Cuba**]{.mark}]{.underline}, guys. It's just not. In a very real way,
[modern [tech]{.mark}nology **effectively [lowers]{.mark}** the [odds of
**armed**]{.mark} **political [revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a
country like the United States [[to **zero**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
so much the worse for us.

[[This **isn't fatalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It doesn't mean there's
no hope. [It means that [there is **little alt**]{.mark}**ernative**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}organization, to changing minds
through **[committed [political action]{.mark}]{.underline}** and using
the available nonviolent means to create change: a concert of grassroots
organizing, labor tactics, and partisan politics. Those things aren't
exactly likely to work, either, but they're a hell of a lot more
plausible than us dweebs taking the Pentagon. Bernie Sanders isn't
really a socialist, but he's a social democrat that moves the
conversation to the left, and if people are dedicated and committed to
organizing, the local, state, and national candidates he inspires will
move it further to the left still. You got any better suggestions?

Listen, commie nerds. My people. I love you guys. I really do. And I
want to build a better world. Not incrementally, either, but with the
kind of sweeping and transformative change that is required to fix a
world of such deep injustice. But [[seriously: **none of us**
are]{.mark} ever [going to take]{.mark} to **the
[barricades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And it's a good thing, too, because
we'd probably find a way to shoot in the wrong direction. I can't
dribble a basketball without falling down. American socialism is largely
made up of bookish dreamers. I love those people but they're not for
fighting. And even if you have a particular talent for combat, you're
looking at fighting the combined forces of [Google, Goldman Sachs, and
the defense industry]{.underline}. Violence is hard. Soldiering is hard.
[[In an era of]{.mark} **the [NSA]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **military
[robots]{.mark}**[, it's]{.mark}]{.underline} really, [**really
[hard]{.mark}**[. "Should we condone]{.mark} **revolutionary

**conversation**]{.mark} **fodder**]{.underline}, of precisely the moral
and intellectual weight of "should we torture a guy if we know there's a
bomb and we know he knows where it is and we know we can stop it if we
do?" It's built on absurd hypotheticals, propped up by the power of
anxious machismo, and [[undertaken to no]{.mark} **practical [political
end]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's understandable. I get it, I really do.
But it's got nothing to do with us. The only way forward is the grubby,
unsexy work of building coalitions and asking people to climb on board.

both cell based (Weathermen Underground, Black Panthers, Aryan Nations

system [using the same tactics [the]{.mark} American Corporate [State

**psy**]{.mark}**chological [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**[. The]{.mark}
American Corporate [State]{.mark}]{.underline} attained primacy through
the effective application of terror and psychological operations.
Therefore, it [[has]{.mark} **far [more]{.mark}** [skill]{.mark} and

**[insurgency]{.mark} tactics**.]{.underline}

\- Political Activism and the ACS Counterinsurgency Apparatus

[[The]{.mark} American Corporate [State employs]{.mark} a **full-time
[counterinsurgency]{.mark}** [infrastructure with resources]{.mark} that
are [**unimaginable** to]{.mark} most would be
[insurgents]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quite simply, [**violent
[insurgents]{.mark}** [have **no idea**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of just
[how **powerful** the foe]{.mark} actually [is.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Violent insurgents typically start out as peaceful, idealistic,
political activists. Whether or not political activists know it, even
with very mundane levels of political activity, they are engaging in low
intensity conflict with the ACS.

The U.S. military classifies political activism as "low intensity
conflict." The scale of warfare (in terms of intensity) begins with
individuals distributing anti-government handbills and public gatherings
with anti-government/anti-corporate themes. In the middle of the
conflict intensity scale are what the military refers to as Operations
Other than War; an example would be the situation the U.S. is facing in
Iraq. At the upper right hand side of the graph is global thermonuclear
war. What is important to remember is that the military is concerned
with ALL points along this scale because they represent different types
of threats to the ACS.

Making distinctions between civilian law enforcement and military
forces, and foreign and domestic intelligence services is no longer
necessary. After September 11, 2001, [**[all]{.mark} national security
[assets]{.mark}** [would be brought to bear against **any**]{.mark}
**U.S. insurgency [movement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, the
U.S. military established NORTHCOM which designated the U.S. as an
active military operational area. [[Crimes]{.underline}]{.mark}
involving the loss of corporate profits [[will]{.mark} increasingly [be
treated as]{.mark} **acts of [terrorism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} could
[garner]{.mark} anything from a local law enforcement response to
activation of regular **[military forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Most of what is commonly referred to as "political activism" is viewed
by the corporate state\'s counterinsurgency apparatus as a useful and
necessary component of political control.

Letters-to-the-editor\...

Calls-to-elected-representatives\...

Waving banners\...

"Third" party political activities\...

Taking beatings, rubber bullets and tear gas from riot police in free
speech zones\...

Political activism amounts to an utterly useless waste of time, in terms
of tangible power, which is all the ACS understands. Political activism
is a cruel guise that is sold to people who are dissatisfied, but who
have no concept of the nature of tangible power. Counterinsurgency teams
routinely monitor these activities, attend the meetings, join the groups
and take on leadership roles in the organizations.

It\'s only a matter of time before some individuals determine that
political activism is a honeypot that accomplishes nothing and wastes
their time. The corporate state knows that some small percentage of the
peaceful, idealistic, political activists will eventually figure out the
game. At this point, the clued-in activists will probably do one of two
things; drop out or move to escalate the struggle in other ways.

If the clued-in activist drops his or her political activities, the ACS
wins.

But what if the clued-in activist refuses to give up the struggle?
Feeling powerless, desperation could set in and these individuals might
become increasingly radicalized. [[Because]{.mark} the corporate
state\'s counterinsurgency [operatives]{.mark} have [**infiltrated**
most]{.mark} **political [activism]{.mark}** [groups]{.mark}, the
**radicalized [members]{.mark}** [will be]{.mark} **easily

THE COUNTERFACTUAL: A COMPLETE U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM EUROPE

[The **counterfactual scenario** examined in this article]{.underline},
the one favored by restraint scholars, [is that the United States
officially exits from NATO and fully withdraws]{.underline} its forces
and military units from Europe, including the roughly 65,000 active-duty
personnel under the U.S. European Command, 2,000 reservists, 16,350
Department of Defense civilian personnel, and around 930 personnel
assigned to NATO's Command Structure. The United States also would no
longer continue its rotational presence of air, land, and sea forces
throughout Europe as part of the European Deterrence Initiative (which
includes a U.S. armored brigade combat team and a combat aviation
brigade).33 In addition, the United States would remove all its
European-based nuclear capabilities.

Although it is difficult to envision a full U.S. pullback from Europe in
the short term, it is hardly implausible in the longer term in light of
both domestic and international dynamics. Structural trends in the
international system--- most notably, the rise of China relative to the
United States and the growing strategic centrality of the Asia-Pacific
region---have caused the United States to downgrade the importance of
Europe in its grand strategy.34 Moreover, the United States pursued an
isolationist grand strategy for most of its history; leaving Europe
would simply be a return to its traditional foreign policy baseline
regarding the region. And significantly, there is every indication that
Trump tapped into, rather than created, the political momentum for
curtailing the United States' security presence overseas. Prior to Trump
becoming president, U.S. public opinion in favor of the United States
disengaging from the world had already increased substantially.35
Reflecting these public attitudes, in the early 2010s, a number of
Republican fiscal hawks and liberal Democrats ramped up their calls for
eliminating the U.S. presence in Europe.36 Likewise, according to a 2011
poll, 65 percent of the U.S. public favored scaling back U.S. military
commitments to reduce the country's debt.37

A U.S. decision to actively withdraw from Europe is not the only means
by which this outcome could occur; it could also unfold passively with
Europe and [the United States]{.underline} [drift]{.underline}ing
further [apart over **many years**, eventually reaching a point where
NATO has been **hollowed out**]{.underline} [and exists essentially in
name only]{.underline}. In fact, because of rising doubts about the
long-term credibility and robustness of the U.S. commitment, many
prominent European policymakers and security analysts have concluded
that Europe should rely less on the transatlantic partnership and
bolster its capacity for autonomous action.38 As then President of the
European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker stated in 2016, "If Europe does
not take care of its own security, nobody else will do it for us."39
[Yet, as we show]{.underline} in the next two sections, two
**[overarching constraints]{.underline}** jointly [limit the capacity of
Europeans to achieve strategic autonomy]{.underline}: Europe's strategic
cacophony and profound capability shortfalls that will take a long time
to close.

Europe's Strategic Cacophony

The first two decades after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the
collapse of the Soviet Union constituted an era of strategic exception,
characterized by the absence of a major conventional security threat.
During this period in which European states lacked any semblance of a
unifying threat, wide discrepancies emerged in their national threat
assessments. The threat perceptions of European defense policymakers
shifted away from conventional state threats to nonconventional ones
such as terrorism, instability in the Mediterranean area, migration, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and failed states.40

Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014 shattered the
long-held assumption that the European territorial status quo would not
be upset via the use of military force. Yet, far from bringing Europe
together, Russia's assertiveness only further deepened Europeans'
profound divergences of threat perceptions, with growing disagreements
among Europeans about how to prioritize Russia versus other
challenges.41

Below we provide a bottom-line assessment and systematic coding of
national threat perceptions across twenty-nine European countries. We
include all countries that are members of the EU or NATO, or both,
except for Turkey and seven countries that have GDPs smaller than \$25
billion: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Iceland,
Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, and Montenegro. We identify where the
threat assessment of each country falls across five categories: (1)
Russia is unimportant or not a threat; (2) Russia is a threat, but other
threats are more significant; (3) Russia and other threats have roughly
equal significance; (4) Russia is the highest threat, but other threats
also are significant; and (5) Russia is the dominant threat by far.

To produce these codings, we adopted a nested approach. First, we coded
the threat evaluations of these countries made by eighteen experts who
contributed to a recent comprehensive examination of European defense
policies.42 To double-check our codings, we consulted all eighteen
authors to ensure that our understanding of each country corresponded
with theirs.43 Second, we looked at all available government reports
that provide a national assessment of the regional threat environment
and prioritize among different threats. In particular, we examined the
national security/defense/military strategies, the intelligence threat
assessments, the analyses of particular threats (e.g., cyberthreats and
terrorism), and regional/geographic analyses of all twenty-nine European
states in our study. In total, we examined eighty-seven official
documents and reports. (Online appendix A provides a full list of these
sources; they are referenced in the footnotes by document number as
indicated in this appendix.)44

For most states, the combination of these first two sources provided
enough information to reliably code national threat assessments. But for
others, they were insufficient because official threat assessments were
somewhat ambiguous. For these countries, a third step was thus to
interview senior foreign policy and defense officials to obtain
additional information and gain further clarity into the national threat
assessment.45 We conclude that Europe is characterized by strategic
cacophony (see table 1). Whereas some states rank terrorism and
instability in the Mediterranean region at the top of their threat
assessments---with little, if any, threat perception vis-à-vis
Russia---others identify Russia as their overarching security concern,
while largely ignoring the diffuse threats on Europe's southern shores.
Between these two extremes, different countries and groups of countries
exhibit varying perceptions of their core security challenges. Overall,
the continent is marked by profoundly divergent threat assessments and
ensuing strategic priorities.

The varied threat perceptions of European states have been shaped by a
complex mix of history, politics, and geography, as well as by changes
in the regional strategic environment. Details on our country codings
are discussed below, according to category of threat prioritization.

RUSSIA IS UNINMPORTANT OR NOT A THREAT

Most smaller powers in Western and Southern Europe prioritize as their
main sources of concern transnational terrorism, WMD proliferation, and
instability across the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) and the
resulting flows of migrants (see table 1).46 By contrast, ever since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, which was perceived as the overarching
conventional and nuclear threat during the Cold War, Russia has little,
if any, significance in their national threat assessments.47 Indeed,
some of these countries, such as Italy or Spain, have long advocated for
sustained engagement with Moscow.48

Likewise, two countries that do not share the same level of anxiety held
by most Central and Eastern European countries vis-à-vis Russia are
Hungary and Bulgaria. Considering the threat of conventional war to be
minimal, and given their strong ties with Moscow, they instead
prioritize terrorism, migration flows, WMD proliferation, and
cyberattacks.49

RUSSIA IS A THREAT, BUT OTHER THREATS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT

Other countries also prioritize transnational terrorism, regional
turmoil around Europe and the MENA, cyberattacks, and illegal migration,
but display higher threat perceptions of Russia than do states in the
first category (see table 1). They perceive Russia as a threat, but
nonetheless see other threats as relatively higher sources of concern.50

Croatia's threat assessment, for instance, focuses largely on challenges
such as terrorism, regional instability, migration, and the
proliferation of WMD.51 Still, in a veiled yet clear reference to
Russia's influence in the Western Balkans, Croatian policymakers put
greater emphasis than the first group of countries on threats such as
"non-conventional, asymmetric, and cyber actions" that are "planned,
permanent and systematic activities supported by state bodies."52

France is the only major power in this group. Its threat perceptions
revolve, foremost, around transnational terrorism and regional
instability in Europe's southern periphery. French policymakers consider
jihadist terrorism as "the most immediate" threat,53 especially in light
of the steep rise in the number of terrorist attacks on French soil
since the mid-2010s.54 France is also concerned with the proliferation
of conventional and WMD-related technology,55 as well as with regional
instability in Northern Africa and the Middle East.56 The French
government puts particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, where, partly
because of its postcolonial history, France retains "a direct security
and economic interest" in the stability of the region.57 Accordingly,
although France has displayed growing concerns vis-à-vis Russia's
assertiveness after the Ukrainian crisis,58 other threats remain more
significant.

RUSSIA AND OTHER THREATS HAVE ROUGHLY EQUAL SIGNIFICANCE

The United Kingdom and Germany---together with less powerful Western
European states (Belgium and the Netherlands) and Denmark---consider
Russia and other security challenges to be equivalent threats (see table
1).

British policymakers include both Russia and terrorism in the UK's "Tier
One" category of risks (in terms of probability and impact).59 In light
of Russia's increasingly assertive behavior, they assess that the "risks
from statebased threats have both grown and diversified,"60 which is why
the UK "cannot rule out the possibility that \[Moscow\] may feel tempted
to act aggressively against NATO Allies."61 According to a UK former
senior defense official, the main areas of concerns vis-à-vis Moscow are
(1) Russia's military modernization, including the development and
deployment of weapon systems that can threaten the UK's NATO allies; (2)
Russia's gray-zone activities (e.g., subversion, use of proxies,
cyberattacks, use of military-grade nerve agents for targeted killings);
and (3) Moscow's activities outside Europe, such as in parts of Africa,
but, most notably, in the Middle East.62

Yet, at the same time, the UK sees transnational terrorism as an equally
substantial threat. British policymakers have perceived a rising threat
from terrorism since at least the 2005 London bombings and the
subsequent wave of terrorist attacks that swept across Europe and the UK
in the 2010s.63 In their eyes, "ISIL \[the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant\], Al Qa'ida, and affiliates remain committed to attacking UK and
Western targets" and continue to be "the most direct and immediate
threat" to the UK's "domestic security."64 In 2015, the British
government therefore decided to increase its counterterrorism spending
by 30 percent, including £2 billion of new investment in the
capabilities of UK special forces.65

Germany, too, considers terrorism and Russia to be threats of roughly
equal significance. German policymakers view terrorist attacks as "the
most immediate challenge" to their country's domestic security.66 In
2018, Germany's minister of interior stated that the security situation
concerning terrorism continued to be "very threatening."67 For Germany,
transnational terrorism is tied closely to regional stability in the
MENA and to the existence of failing states in which terrorist
organizations can thrive.68 Accordingly, it seeks to bolster cooperation
with partners in Africa and the Middle East to train their security
forces so as "to create a bulwark against international terrorism."69

At the same time, Germany sees Russia as "openly calling the European
peace order into question with its willingness to use force to advance
its own interests and to unilaterally redraw borders guaranteed under
international law, as it has done in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine."70
According to the ministry of defense, "this has far-reaching
implications for security in Europe and thus for the security of
Germany."71 A comparison of Germany's 2006 White Paper and of the
subsequent strategic documents (i.e., the 2011 Defense Policy Guidelines
and the 2016 White Paper) highlights the enhanced focus of the German
armed forces on territorial defense since the Russia-Georgia war and
Moscow's landgrab in Crimea.72

Interviews with current and former German officials reveal that the
foreign affairs, interior, and defense ministries have different threat
assessments. Whereas the first two consider terrorism to be Germany's
main security challenge, the latter prioritizes Russia as the main
threat.73 Across the German government, terrorism and Russia ultimately
emerge as being roughly equally significant threats.

Smaller Western European powers such as the Netherlands and Belgium
similarly consider Russia and other threats to be largely equivalent.74
Likewise, in Northern Europe, Danish policymakers rank terrorism and
regional instability in the MENA---which can provide fertile ground for
terrorists--- relatively higher than do their Nordic neighbors in their
threat assessments.75 At the same time, Russia is seen as posing "a
significant security challenge,"76 and its military buildup and
increased military exercises in the region, as well as its use of
gray-zone operations, are considered "a clear challenge" to Denmark.77
The Danish government thus sees Russia, terrorism, and regional
instability in the MENA as equally signiªcant threats.

RUSSIA IS THE HIGHEST THREAT; OTHER THREATS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT

Several Northern and Eastern European states have displayed mounting
threat perceptions of Russia---which they see as their major
threat---especially since the Russo-Georgian War and, increasingly, the
Ukrainian crisis (see table 1). Yet, they continue to share security
concerns vis-à-vis terrorism, regional instability in the MENA, and
illegal migration.

In Northern Europe, Norway and Sweden emphasize both the "long belt of
instability" to the south of Europe and terrorism as signiªcant national
security concerns.78 Yet, most notably since the 2010s, Russia has
returned to the top of their national security concerns. In particular,
they highlight the development of Russia's anti-access/area-denial
(A2/AD) capabilities, its numerous military exercises in Northern
Europe, and its activities in the Arctic as amplifying the risk of an
accident or a crisis resulting in unintended escalation to war.79 The
Norwegian government, for example, considers that "Russia's overall
military capacity is the most signiªcant security challenge for Norway
and NATO."80

Likewise, in Central and Eastern Europe, although the Czech Republic,
Romania, and Slovakia also emphasize other security challenges (e.g.,
instability in the Southern Mediterranean and terrorism), their threat
assessments prioritize Russia's assertiveness.81 While refraining from
ofªcially labeling Russia a threat, the Romanian government argues that
Russia's naval buildup--- and the ensuing "destabilization of the
security situation in the Black Sea Extended Region"---"represent the
most important factor of military risk against national security."82

RUSSIA IS THE DOMINANT THREAT BY FAR

The Baltic states, Finland, and Poland exhibit the highest threat
perceptions of Russia in Europe. The former Soviet-controlled states in
the Baltic region (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) prioritize
Russia's conventional and grayzone military threats as their core
national security concern.83 Likewise, given Finland's geographical
proximity to Russia and their shared border, policy makers in Helsinki
have viewed Russia as their dominant national security threat throughout
the post--Cold War period.84 Finland considers that the "use or threat
of military force against Finland cannot be excluded."85

Given its history of recurrent invasion by foreign powers, Poland has
also consistently put Russia at the center of its security concerns
since the end of the Cold War.86 Moscow's "aggressive policy"---through
which it aims to "destabilize the internal order of other states and to
question their territorial integrity"---is seen as "a threat mainly for
Poland and other countries in the region."87

European Defense Capacity Shortfall

European national assessments thus diverge profoundly regarding the
prioritization among different threats. Significantly, Europe's
strategic cacophony greatly exacerbates a second overarching constraint
on Europe achieving strategic autonomy: [severe military capacity
gaps]{.underline} that [cannot be closed anytime soon]{.underline}.
Since the end of the Cold War, [Europe's defense capacity has markedly
decreased]{.underline}.88 Operationally, the 2011 European military
action in Libya revealed a severe shortage of key enablers for offensive
military operations: the United States had to provide critical
capabilities that the Europeans otherwise lacked, such as air-to-air
refueling; suppression of enemy air defenses; and intelligence, target
acquisition, and reconnaissance.89 Indeed, [a recent **systematic
study**]{.underline} by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies (IISS) and the German Council on Foreign Relations [found that,
because their capability shortfalls are **so significant**]{.underline},
[Europeans would struggle to autonomously undertake operations even at
the **low end**]{.underline} of [the spectrum of conflict]{.underline}
(such as peace enforcement missions).90 In this section, we focus on
Europeans' capacity for conventional warfare because it is indispensable
for defense and deterrence vis-à-vis Russia and because this allows us
to directly address the argument of restraint scholars who maintain that
the Europeans could autonomously balance Russia with ease. We identify
four major challenges that are likely to hinder the capacity of
Europeans to develop an autonomous conventional defense capacity.

LACK OF WEAPON SYSTEMS FOR CONVENTIONAL DETERRENCE AND DEFENSE

During the Cold War, Europeans invested heavily in the kind of
conventional capabilities required for conventional deterrence and
defense. But [after the Cold War, European defense spending
**plummeted**]{.underline}, and a great proportion of these limited
resources were directed toward out-of-area operations.91 As a result,
[Europeans are lacking in even the **most basic**
conventional]{.underline} deterrence and [defense
capabilities]{.underline}. [A key reason]{.underline} for this situation
[is Europe's strategic cacophony]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} five
economically [largest European countries]{.underline}---the UK, France,
Germany, Spain, and Italy---[are all]{.underline} located [in Western or
Southern Europe, which]{.underline} collectively [have]{.underline}
greatly [de-emphasized]{.underline} the [territorial
defense]{.underline} mission since the end of the Cold War. In contrast,
states in [Central and Northern Europe]{.underline} have tended to focus
relatively more on territorial defense, especially after Russia's 2014
invasion of Crimea; yet, these parts of Europe [contain only small to
medium-sized countries]{.underline}.92 Until now, there has been no
long-term examination of the year-to-year shift across all of Europe of
the kinds of core capabilities needed for conventional deterrence and
defense. To address this gap, [we systematically gathered
**data**]{.underline} from the IISS Military Balance [for the 1990--2020
period]{.underline} on three core military systems for conventional
warfare: main battle tanks (MBTs), armored personnel carriers (APCs),
and artillery. To be sure, conventional warfare requires more than
simply land capabilities. Yet, Russia's A2/AD capacity is aimed at
eroding, or nullifying, NATO's local control of its airspace, thus
compelling NATO forces, in the case of confiict, to operate in an
environment of land warfare with contested air support.93 In this
context, land resistance---and thus

![Chart Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image7.png){width="5.737053805774278in"
height="4.310071084864392in"}

land capabilities---become key, which is why we focus on these three
specific systems (they constitute a sample of the needed land warfare
capabilities). The data for MBTs of Europe's major powers are displayed
in ªgure 1.94 (Online appendix C shows the data on MBTs of medium and
smaller European countries as well as the data for APCs and artillery
for all European countries.)

[These data underscore the **marked decline**]{.underline} [of European
conventional warfare capabilities in the past three
decades]{.underline}. From 1990 to 2020, [the combined
European]{.underline} total number of MBTs plunged by 85 percent; APCs
fell by 64 percent; and [artillery declined by **56
percent**]{.underline}. As Sven Biscop concludes, "[Europe's capability
shortfalls are such that it can neither meet its NATO
obligations]{.underline} for territorial defense, [nor achieve
**strategic autonomy**]{.underline} with regard to the protection of
Europe."95

In reality, [the situation is **even worse** than these data indicate,
because most European militaries have **significant readiness
deficiencies**]{.underline}. For example, an analysis by the German
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces concluded in 2018 that
the "readiness of the Bundeswehr's major weapons systems is dramatically
low in many areas,"96 noting that only 39 percent of Germany's Leopard 2
battle tanks were available for use given a lack of spare parts; the
operability of only a quarter of its PUMA infantry combat vehicles; the
nonavailability of any of its six submarines; and the ability of less
than half of its Eurofighters and Tornado combat aircraft to fly.97
Significantly, [Europe's readiness problems]{.underline}, such as the
obsolescence of its MBTs, [are projected to become even **more
challenging**]{.underline} [in the decades ahead]{.underline}.98

THE COMPLEXITY OF EMPLOYING MODERN WEAPONS SYSTEMS

As dramatic as these weapons shortfalls are, European defense
spending---if allocated properly---could eventually secure the needed
systems. Yet, [not only is the efficient allocation of resources a major
challenge because of Europe's strategic cacophony]{.underline} (as
detailed below), [but securing the needed weapons systems would only be
the first step]{.underline}.

[The effective employment of **modern weapons** systems is]{.underline}
far more **[challenging]{.underline}** than in past eras for a variety
of reasons. [A key consideration is the immense premium put on command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (**[C4ISR]{.underline}**).
[C4ISR]{.underline}---often referred to as [the]{.underline} "**[nervous
system]{.underline}**" [of modern militaries]{.underline}---[is crucial
for gathering]{.underline} information about the combatants, for
effectively [processing]{.underline} that information, and for
[disseminating and using]{.underline} that [**information** to develop
and implement complex plans]{.underline}.99 NATO's 2011 mission in Libya
shows the heavy reliance of Europeans on the United States' C4ISR
capacity. [Europeans would]{.underline} therefore [need to develop their
own C4ISR capacity to be able to autonomously balance
Russia]{.underline}, which would not be an easy undertaking given that
Russia is no Libya. They [would need **large amounts** of new C4ISR
systems]{.underline} (e.g., reconnaissance and communication
**[satellites]{.underline}**; [early warning]{.underline} and control
**[aircraft]{.underline}**; [**sensor** systems]{.underline}; [air,
naval, and land command and control **platforms**]{.underline}), the
most complex of [which have very long development times]{.underline}.
Notably, the already significant difficulty of Europeans assembling the
needed systems would be made even more acute if the UK's exit from the
EU ends up meaning that British capabilities also need to be replaced:
at present, the UK detains, among other capabilities, 53 percent of the
EU's combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance heavy unmanned
aerial vehicles (CISR UAVs), 42 percent of airborne early warning and
control aircraft, and 38 percent of electronicintelligence aircraft.100

In addition, [European countries lack]{.underline} the kind of
**[specialized personnel]{.underline}** needed to operate modern weapons
systems effectively. [Redressing this weakness would be a significant
undertaking, as they have reduced their number of military personnel
**drastically**]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War. As figure 2
shows, [the size of]{.underline} the total active
[militaries]{.underline} of the large European powers [declined by **57
percent**]{.underline} during the 1990--2020 period.101 Furthermore,
[beyond the difficulty of securing the financial resources]{.underline}
to pay the needed personnel, [recruiting sufficient specialized
personnel would be a major challenge]{.underline}, as demonstrated by
the difficulties faced by many European militaries in attracting
personnel for skilled positions.102 Notably, a recent study has shown
that the employment of advanced weaponry calls for highly skilled and
highly trained military personnel, which are now more difficult to
recruit and retain in the military.103 Obtaining specialized military
personnel to operate modern weaponry is only the beginning; they must
also be trained to effectively use modern weapons, which is extremely
challenging and time consuming, partially because these weapons need to
be used as part of a cohesive package that places a premium not just on
information gathering, but also on coordination and delegation.104 [It
has taken U.S. military personnel]{.underline} an extraordinarily long
time to develop the skills required for effectively using today's
weapons systems: as Posen stresses, the United States' "development of
new weapons and tactics

![Chart, bar chart Description automatically

height="4.30501968503937in"}

depends on **[decades]{.underline}** [of expensively accumulated
technological and tactical experience]{.underline}."105 [It would likely
take Europeans **even longer** to develop the needed skills, **given
differences** across countries regarding operational cultures, levels of
ambition, languages, and so on]{.underline}.106 Finally, the effective
use of modern weaponry in the European theater depends on European
forces being able to move quickly and securely over large distances
within Europe. Yet, as a UK parliamentary report puts it, "NATO has
difficulty moving large forces" across Europe.107 In recent years, the
Europeans have sought to bolster military mobility through a variety of
initiatives dispersed across different institutions (within both the EU
and NATO).108 Yet, the movement and training of military personnel and
assets in Europe remain severely hampered by a combination of capability
shortfalls, legal/procedural hurdles, and infrastructural deficiencies
that will not be easy to resolve.109

THE DIFFICULTY OF INSTITUTIONALIZED MILITARY COOPERATION

An additional challenge is institutional. Europe's strategic cacophony
has prevented Europeans from developing an autonomous,
military-planning, command and control (C2) structure.110 Indeed, a
report by the European Parliamentary Research Service explains that one
of the greatest challenges of European defense is "the lack of
integration of the military structures of the Member States."111
Although an effective and autonomous European defense would require the
creation of a permanent planning and C2 infrastructure, the question of
developing an autonomous Operational Headquarters (OHQ) has proven
highly divisive.112 An OHQ was never established because of conflicting
national interests and priorities among Europeans, in particular France,
Germany and the UK. Whereas Paris has long supported the establishment
of a military OHQ to bolster the EU's strategic and operational planning
structures and its contingency planning and C2 capacity, London has
strongly resisted, seeing it as a duplication of NATO's assets. Germany
has stood somewhat in between, though closer to the UK, favoring a focus
on civilian-military planning and C2, not least to avoid duplicating
structures already existing at NATO.113 As a result, the EU remains
entirely dependent on NATO or national assets for the planning and
conduct of major executive operations, for which it has no autonomous
military structures.114

If the United States were to pull back from Europe, it remains to be
seen whether the Europeans could rely on a "Europeanized" NATO, in which
the integrated structures would stay in place but without the United
States.115 Military planning and C2 require a clear chain of command.
When NATO was created, Europeans agreed to be under U.S. military
command, rather than attempting the far more difficult task of agreeing
to be under the command of another European country or group of European
states. More generally, as the hegemonic power in NATO, the United
States has facilitated institutionalized cooperation among Europeans and
helped partly contain Europe's strategic cacophony.116 For decades, a
U.S.-led NATO has been the overarching shaper of national defense
policies and military transformation in Europe, helping overcome
coordination and collective-action problems.117 In light of Europe's
deep-seated strategic divisions, a U.S. disengagement would amplify
these coordination and collective action problems (assuming NATO
survived) and would further hinder institutionalized, intra-European
defense cooperation at all levels: strategies and doctrines; training;
operational learning; interoperability; and joint capability
development. Likewise, without the United States, the persistent and
profound divergence of threat perceptions and strategic priorities among
Europeans is likely to impede their capacity to agree on shared C2
structures for conducting operations, except for the lowest end of the
spectrum of conºict (e.g., peace support operations).118

As a result of strategic cacophony, the EU has, in fact, struggled
mightily to create even the most minimal C2 structure. As Luis Simón
underscores, "It has taken nearly 20 years of allegedly significant
steps for the European Union to establish a 'Military Planning and
Conduct Capability' composed of up to 25 staffers, devoted to assisting
with the planning and conduct of so-called non-executive (i.e., training
and assistance) missions," with an advisory role only.119 Ultimately,
given Europe's deep-seated divergences, there is no basis for optimism
that Europeans will be able to agree being under the permanent command
of another European country for deterrence and defense or to
consistently undertake effective institutionalized military cooperation
without the enabling role played by the United States within NATO.

THE FRAGMENTATION OF EUROPE'S DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE

If Europeans want to be strategically autonomous, they will have to
produce the defense systems they need without being reliant on the
United States. The entrenched fragmentation of Europe' defense
industrial base, however, would make this a daunting task.

On the demand side, European states have consistently privileged
domestically procured defense equipment over European arms cooperation.
According to data from the European Defense Agency, from 2006 to 2015,
collaborative defense procurement in Europe accounted for less than one
quarter of total procurement.120 For example, a mere 7 percent of the
European surface vessels currently in use have been built through
European armament cooperation.121 As for fighter aircraft---where the
economic incentives for Europeanwide collaboration are especially
powerful given the immense cost and complexity of these systems---there
has been relatively limited defense cooperation: less than a third (32.6
percent) of combat aircraft used by EU militaries come from European
collaborative production.122 Similarly, European states spend more than
80 percent of their military research-and-development budgets within
national borders.123

On the supply side, these compartmentalized national markets for weapons
systems have resulted in a fragmented and noncompetitive European
defense and technological industrial base (EDTIB) characterized by
duplication, inefficiencies, endemic overcapacity, and a lack of
economies of scale.124 In 2017, 178 different weapons systems were in
use in the EU, compared to 30 in the United States.125 As a result, the
components that sustain the industrial capacity to deliver high-end to
low-end capabilities are scattered across Europe.126 This is a
significant problem given that today's scale requirements are massive
for many weapons systems, which also explains why Europe remains highly
dependent on the import of key components and weapons systems from the
United States.127

Europe has recognized the need for stronger defense production
coordination for a long time, and the mechanisms for fostering
European-wide collaboration in weapons production have been a topic of
discussion for the past several decades. On the demand side, this
coordination would require a uniform European procurement policy, with
common requirements and with defense industrial cooperation among EU
countries being prioritized over national procurement.128 And on the
supply side, this would require an integrated defense and technological
industrial base (e.g., with one or two major European prime contractors
per sector) capable of sustaining military innovation and the
development, production, and maintenance of arms at reasonable cost.

Yet, efforts to formulate the kinds of policies that would foster
Europeanwide defense collaboration have been feeble. As Matthew Uttley
explains, initiatives taken over the years to rationalize and bolster
the EDTIB have had a "limited impact," because governments see a strong
national DTIB as a necessary prerequisite for national political
sovereignty and, as a result, "national protectionist practices" remain
"the dominant driving force in E.U. defense procurement."129 A report by
the European Parliament conªrms that a key reason for this lack of
collaboration is Europe's strategic cacophony, speciªcally, "the current
fragmentation of the defense market in terms of demand, regulations,
standards and supply."130

Assessing the Counterargument: Can Europeans Balance Russia?

Together, Europe's strategic cacophony and its defense capacity
shortfalls feed and reinforce each other. For one thing, many of the
needed steps to make up for Europe's defense capacity shortfalls will
require prolonged cooperation; Europeans would thus need to overcome
their entrenched strategic cacophony not just for a short time, but over
a very long period. Moreover, because diverging interests hamper defense
industrial cooperation among Europeans, this---coupled with major
capability shortfalls---deepens their technological dependency on the
United States, further reinforcing the challenges to addressing Europe's
capability shortfalls.

Restraint scholars arguing for a U.S. pullout would undoubtedly respond
that, even if Europe is currently split by strategic divisions and has
severe defense capacity shortfalls, a U.S. withdrawal would result in
heightened European threat perceptions of Russia and thereby lead
Europeans to bolster their defense investments---thus prompting them to
come together to balance Russia (through a balancing coalition or
through the EU, or both). For restraint scholars, it is the U.S.
presence in Europe that affords Europeans the luxury of low threat
perceptions of Russia and thereby drives them to underinvest in defense.
Below, we assess the validity and robustness of this counterargument.

EUROPEAN THREAT PERCEPTIONS AFTER A U.S. WITHDRAWAL

We now evaluate how European threat perceptions would likely evolve if
the United States were to pull back, focusing first on Europe's three
major powers (France, the UK, and Germany) and then on its medium and
lesser powers.

Given its geographical location, colonial past, and continued engagement
in Africa, France tends to look south rather than east for the defense
of its core strategic interests.131 Furthermore, France's strategic
outlook remains shaped partly by its Cold War, Gaullist foreign policy
legacy, which was based on the willingness to carve out a "third way"
between the Soviet-led and the U.S.-led blocs through some form of
accommodation with Moscow while maintaining an independent nuclear force
and a French area of influence in Africa.132

The UK, as an offshore seapower, has since the early Cold War concluded
that the only way to deter the Soviet Union (and later Russia) is to use
the United States as a counterweight.133 Accordingly, the "special
relationship" with the United States, both bilaterally and through NATO,
has been the center of gravity of the UK's defense policy---as
illustrated by its heavy reliance on U.S. military technology.134
Indeed, NATO has been the main vehicle through which Britain has sought
to entrench U.S. power in Europe and deter external threats.135

Likewise, Germany, because of its history and location in the heart of
the European continent, has strategic priorities different from those of
France. The defeat and subsequent occupation of Germany in World War II,
including by the Soviet Union, was followed by the division of the
country in two, with one side under Soviet influence---thus making
Germany the geostrategic epicenter of the Cold War. After its
reunification and the end of the Cold War, as well as its self-imposed
stringent parliamentary constraints on the use of military force,
Germany has opted for a combination of economic and political
integration with the EU and military reliance on NATO, with the United
States as the ultimate guarantor for its security and the stability of
the continent.136

Idiosyncratic historical legacies, geography, and distinctive local
security environments have thus profoundly shaped the threat assessments
of the three major European powers. To be sure, these differences
existed during the Cold War, too, but they were muted by the
overwhelming, common Soviet threat.137 By contrast, in light of the
diversification of the post--Cold War threat environment, if the United
States withdrew from the continent, the threat perceptions of these
major powers would be unlikely to converge around Russia.138

In such a scenario, the UK and Germany would be prone to exhibit
heightened threat perceptions vis-à-vis Russia. Given their historical
reliance upon NATO as their ultimate security guarantee, if the United
States were to remove its conventional and nuclear forces, the
credibility of NATO's deterrent vis-à-vis Russia would founder in the
eyes of British and German policymakers. As a result, there is every
reason to expect they would raise the significance of Russia and of
territorial defense in their defense planning. At the same time, they
would still have to reckon with other significant threats (e.g.,
transnational terrorism and regional stability in the MENA).

By contrast, France's threat assessment would most likely remain
unchanged if the United States withdrew. Although France might view
Russia with greater concern, it would continue to prioritize terrorism
and, crucially, threats on Europe's southern periphery (i.e., regional
instability in the greater Mediterranean area, in general, and in
Africa, in particular). As a senior current French defense official put
it in an interview, "If the United States withdrew, the risk represented
by Russia would ostensibly be greater but, at the same time, it would be
greater only if France considered that the threat posed by Russia to the
Baltic states, Poland, etc. constitutes a threat to our vital interests,
which is far from sure." This is because threats to Europe's southern
periphery, such as "the destabilization of Africa or the Middle East are
considered to be a much higher priority than Russia. . . . Our vital
interests are not threatened by Russia."139

In sum, in the case of a complete U.S. pullback from the continent,
London and Berlin would likely move rightward into the second column
from the right in table 1 (Russia is a higher threat, but other threats
are also significant), while France would not shift from its current
position. Given their differing threat prioritizations, the United
Kingdom, Germany, and France would be very unlikely to reach agreement
on a common position vis-à-vis Russia. Germany and the UK might lean
more toward balancing and expand bilateral defense cooperation to that
end. However, unlike countries that view Russia as the dominant threat
by far (i.e., the Baltic states and Poland), they would face important
trade-offs in their allocation of resources---between territorial
defense and power projection capabilities, between Europe's eastern and
southern periphery, and so on---given that they would continue to
grapple with other signiªcant threats. For its part, because France
would likely continue to prioritize threats on Europe's southern
periphery, it would be unlikely to provide a substantial (if any)
contribution to a balancing coalition. In fact, it might opt for
accommodation with Russia to develop a sphere of inºuence in Western/
Southern Europe or, potentially, even see some strategic advantages to
bandwagoning with Russia.

This predicament would be further compounded by fundamental divergences
in threat perceptions among Europe's medium and small powers. Except for
lesser powers in Northern and Eastern Europe (i.e., the Baltic states
and Poland), which would consistently see Russia as their overriding
threat, the other medium and small European states would likely display
profoundly different reactions to a U.S. pullback, depending on their
geographic location, history, and strategic priorities. While some
countries would undoubtedly perceive a higher threat from Russia and
thus revise their threat assessments (moving one column to the right in
table 1), others would likely maintain their existing threat
hierarchization given the equivalent or higher priority they as sign to
other threats or regions, or both. In fact, there is every indication
that most medium and small European countries that currently perceive
threats other than Russia to be more signiªcant or dominant would be
highly unlikely to revise their threat assessment. Several of these
countries might even become neutral or bandwagon with Moscow. It is
therefore extremely implausible that all European states would move
Russia up in their ranking of threats. And even if they did, the
cacophony of threat perception would remain, with only a few lesser
powers in Northern and Eastern Europe perceiving Russia as their
dominant threat.

Restraint scholars might reply that the above discussion is excessively
pessimistic about the chances for European defense coordination because
it neglects the role the EU can play in bringing Europe together in the
security realm if the United States leaves.140 The EU is not an
effective institutional platform for overcoming Europe's strategic
divergence, however. There are many reasons for this, with the most
notable being that the EU is a kaleidoscope of countries with diverging
interests that operates on the basis of consensus in the ªeld of foreign
and defense policy---thus making the Common Security and Defense Policy
a "structurally limited undertaking."141 If the United States were to
pull back, rather than work to overcome European divisions, the EU would
be prone to inaction because of such divisions. Thus, only an effective
institutional structure could probably overcome, or at least mitigate,
Europe's divisions, but strategic cacophony would prevent the EU from
being enabled to perform this function.

HOW EASILY CAN EUROPEANS BALANCE RUSSIA'S MILITARY STRENGTH?

A complete U.S. withdrawal would thus not mitigate Europe's strategic
cacophony and could exacerbate it. Restraint scholars might argue,
however, that, even if threat perceptions did not converge across
Europe, balancing Russia would not require much effort because it is so
weak. Yet, Russia is a much tougher adversary to match than restraint
scholars now assess it to be--- both in the conventional and the nuclear
realms.

CONVENTIONAL DEFENSE AND DETERRENCE. As Michael Kofman and Richard
Connolly convincingly argue, "Russian military expenditure is
considerably higher" than commonly estimated.142 Of key importance, they
stress, is that Russia gets a lot for what it spends on its military: it
pays its soldiers a pittance in rubles, and, even more important, it
buys its weapons from its own defense contractors in rubles, not
dollars. Moreover, the Russian government has squeezed profits in the
defense sector, making the weapons it buys artificially cheap. Notably,
Russia's unusually high capacity to produce advanced weaponry using
domestic resources is a legacy of the Soviet Union's massive level of
defense production during the Cold War. Ultimately, Kofman and Connolly
maintain that, because Russia's rubles can purchase so much military
power so cheaply, it is inappropriate to use market exchange-based
estimates of its military spending. Based upon purchasing power parity
exchange rates, "Russia's effective military expenditure actually ranged
between \$150 billion and \$180 billion annually" (from 2015 to 2019),
and "taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure,
Russia may well come in at around \$200 billion."143 Given this
understanding, [Russian military spending]{.underline} likely
[**exceeds** the combined levels of defense expenditures of the **three
major** European powers]{.underline} (France, Germany, and the UK).

[High levels of military spending have]{.underline}, in turn, [spurred
**significant modernization** and **expansion** of Russia's military
forces]{.underline}, particularly in the 2010s.144 The Russian
Federation is the descendent state of the Soviet Union, which created a
formidable military industrial base with a huge cadre of highly trained
personnel, providing a strong foundation for Russia's current military
infrastructure. Although the Russian armed forces still display
important weaknesses in areas such as surface shipbuilding, in the past
decade Moscow has substantially "modernized its armed forces through a
massive introduction of new and modernized weapons and infrastructure,
accompanied by radical structural changes in the military organization,
evolving modes of operation and a sharply increased number, scale and
complexity of military training and exercise."145 Of particular note,
from 2015 to 2019, Russia's army increased in size by almost 25
percent.146 (In online appendix D, we measure the military capabilities
of Russia and four potential European balancing coalitions regarding two
overall indicators of military personnel \[total active and total
reserves\] and three core weapon systems for conventional warfare \[main
battle tanks, artillery, and armored personnel carriers\]. Across all
five of these measures, the data show that Russia possesses a very
substantial military superiority as compared to all four potential
European balancing coalitions.)

Additionally, Russia possesses substantial C4ISR capabilities for
employing weapons systems in a coordinated manner and for managing
military operations. These capabilities are the combined result of
legacy Soviet systems and of the Kremlin's ongoing military
modernization effort.147 Especially in the past decade, Russia has
developed a more modular, flexible force structure with an emphasis on
joint forces through a large-scale military modernization.148

Military satellites are a useful indicator for understanding why
Europeans would have difficulty building up the necessary C4ISR
infrastructure for balancing Russia. For one, military satellites are
critical, because they enable the rest of the C4ISR architecture to
operate effectively by facilitating the flow of informational inputs.
Specifically, military satellites are crucial for communications,
navigation, early warning, attack assessment, and surveillance and
reconnaissance---and thus are key for pooling and employing military
power. Other C4ISR systems, such as ISR UAVs and airborne early warning
and control systems constitute more specific components of a C4ISR
architecture that play particular roles therein. Furthermore, whereas
full comparison data are available for military satellites, existing
databases do not list other C4ISR capabilities systematically. The
profound gap between Russia and European countries in military
satellites is shown in table 2.

To be sure, notwithstanding such quantitative preponderance in military
satellites, one challenge faced by the Russian military in past decades
has been the integration of highly interoperable systems for
network-centric warfare.149 Yet, Russia has placed such systems
(referred to as the Reconnaissance Strike Complex in Russian strategic
parlance) at the "epicenter" of its military modernization in the 2010s,
investing massively in C4ISR integration and electronic warfare and in
modernizing infrastructure, while boosting and streamlining command and
control, among other features.150

The net result is that, as stressed by a 2019 RAND report, the Kremlin
has

![Graphical user interface, text Description automatically
generated](media/image9.png){width="6.38012467191601in"
height="3.3230850831146106in"}

implemented "a modern, whole-of-government C4ISR infrastructure that
will enable Russia to pursue its vision of net-centric or 'non-contact
warfare'"; these "advances in long-range strike, Russia's command and
control and information gathering systems are fundamental in their
ability to compete directly with the West and dominate regional
adversaries"151---an assessment shared by other studies.152
Significantly, the Russian military tried and tested its C4ISR
capabilities during the Syrian conflict.153

The experience of European states during the 2011 Libyan conflict showed
that they lack the technological infrastructure and personnel to
autonomously use weapons systems in a coordinated manner: they would
need to replace the United States' C4ISR systems that they currently
rely on; hire and train the personnel to operate them; and develop a
permanent, effective command structure to conduct effective joint
military operations in wartime. Likewise, in stark contrast to Russia's
unity of command, Europeans display an "enormous variation" in their
C4ISR capacities, with "both technological and operational gaps within
Europe."154 In sum, Europe exhibits a cacophony of C4ISR capabilities.

A final and related consideration that restraint scholars do not
sufficiently recognize is that Russia gains efficiencies---when compared
to Europe--- because it is a single actor, rather than a collective
patchwork of countries. By contrast, as a 2018 European Parliament
report concludes, "It is precisely because European defense is
fragmented by the decisions of 27 political and military chiefs of
staff, duplicates the same research, the same programs and the same
capabilities and has no chain of command that it is, collectively,
inefªcient."155 The report notes further that "increasing the level of
spending without ªrst addressing the coherence between the different
national defense systems would only increase the amount of wastage."156
Exactly how much efªciency is lost would depend on how many European
countries would need to act together to balance Russia; but even two
actors working together would result in less efªcacy and effectiveness
as compared to a single, unitary actor of comparable size.157 If the
United States pulled back, a single, centralized Russian actor would
confront a group of potential European balancers with diverging threat
perceptions that would face coordination challenges likely to hamper
their capacity to devise a common strategy, to share the burdens of
their defense investments, to rationalize Europe's highly fragmented
defense industrial base, to build integrated C2 structures, and to
sustain the development and deployment of a C4ISR capacity. As a report
of the French Senate states, "Compared to other European countries,
Russia enjoys a considerable but not quantifiable advantage: unity of
command. The Russian army has one commanding authority, one hierarchy,
one language, and one equipment range. Obviously, at the operational
level, these are very important assets."158

NUCLEAR DETERRENCE. As a legacy of the Cold War, [Russia maintains a
**formidable arsenal** of approximately **6,400** nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [which **vastly overshadows** the combined
arsenals of France and the UK]{.underline} ([290 and 195 nuclear
weapons, respectively]{.underline}).159 [In addition to Russia's
numerical preponderance, it matters greatly that this force is wielded
by a **single actor**]{.underline}, not a collective one. In contrast,
strategic divergences and technological constraints are highly likely to
hamper the emergence of a European nuclear deterrent either through the
Europeanization of the French and/or British nuclear deterrents and/or
through a German nuclear deterrent.

As Ulrich Kühn and Tristan Volpe explain, Germany would have to surmount
major technical, political, and security obstacles before acquiring a
nuclear deterrent.160 Not only would it face the domestic and
international pressures fueled by reviving fears of German hegemony, but
it would have "to either repurpose its nuclear energy infrastructure for
weapons production or sprint to the bomb from new military
facilities,"161 a prospect made even more unlikely given that Germany
plans to shut down its entire nuclear fleet by 2022.162 Accordingly,
"Germany does not have the required wherewithal for even a rudimentary
program."163

In turn, the Europeanization of nuclear sharing (or Euro-deterrent)
based on the nuclear capabilities of France and/or the United Kingdom
independent of the United States would also "face high hurdles and
immense costs that might well prove prohibitive."164 French nuclear
experts note that there is "near-zero appetite in France for
transferring its nuclear assets to Europe."165 Likewise, Barbara Kunz
observes that analysts across Europe agree that the Europeanization of
the French bomb, however defined, is "unlikely and hardly feasible."166

The prospects of a Franco-British nuclear deterrent are even less
likely. For one, it is highly improbable that French or British
policymakers would be willing to sacriªce London or Paris for Tallinn or
Riga. Second, the UK has left the EU, so France and the UK would have to
overcome their previously discussed divergent strategic priorities to
create an integrated Franco-British military structure for nuclear
planning outside the EU. Finally, the heavy dependence of the UK's
nuclear deterrent on U.S. technology and on cooperation with the United
States would further complicate such an endeavor.

Ultimately, the notion forwarded by restraint scholars that European
countries can easily and quickly balance Russia is ungrounded. Balancing
Russia would be extremely difficult, and such a buildup would
necessarily take a very long time. Our interviews with European
policymakers reveal that they clearly understand this problem. A former
UK ministry of defense official stresses that the "temporal factor would
be quite long. . . . These sort of capabilities take a long time to
develop."167 Likewise, as a former German official bluntly explains,
"The whole defense and capability requirements would be so extreme that
the upgrade that would be needed to fill the gap if the U.S. completely
withdrew is totally off limits for the foreseeable future."168

Conclusion

Europe is characterized by profound, continent-wide divergences across
national defense policies, particularly threat perceptions, as well as
by a fundamental defense capacity shortfall that cannot be closed
anytime soon because of a series of overlapping challenges. Given the
combination of strategic cacophony and capacity gaps, which are mutually
reinforcing, Europeans are currently not in a position to autonomously
mount a credible deterrent and defense against Russia. [This situation
would likely continue for a **very long time**]{.underline}, even if
there were a complete U.S. withdrawal from the continent, and [all the
more so in the event of a **partial** U.S. withdrawal]{.underline}, a
much more likely counterfactual. If a U.S. pullback were to occur, it
would leave Europe increasingly vulnerable to Russian aggression and
meddling, allowing Russia to exploit Europe's centrifugal dynamics to
augment its influence. [A U.S. withdrawal would]{.underline} also likely
make institutionalized intra-European defense cooperation appreciably
harder. Accordingly, [a U.S. pullback would have **grave
consequences**]{.underline} [for **peace** and **stability** on the
continent]{.underline}.

These findings have major implications for both sides of the Atlantic.
In Europe, [scholars and policymakers need to be
**realistic**]{.underline}. The strong desire for strategic autonomy is
justified and understandable, but [it is **necessary** to **discern**
between **distant hopes** and **present realities**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, the barriers to strategic autonomy are so substantial that
the achievement of this goal would require a long-term, sustained and
coordinated effort. Sound European defense policymaking needs to reflect
this: [working under an unrealistic assumption]{.underline} that
Europeans can quickly achieve strategic autonomy [is both
**unwarranted** and **unwise**]{.underline}. [Pursuing unrealistic goals
can, in fact, undermine the achievement of realistic ones]{.underline}.
Instead, [European policymakers should focus on a **manageable**,
**affordable**]{.underline} [set of initiatives for **augmenting**
military capacity in the short term that the United States would see as
valuable]{.underline}---[and thus would help
**consolidate**]{.underline} [the transatlantic
alliance]{.underline}---but that would nevertheless also prove useful if
the United States does someday pull back. Such an approach could
gradually and cumulatively create the foundations for greater
commonality and cooperation in the future and, over time, help mitigate
the centrifugal dynamics at play in Europe. In the United States,
restraint scholars---virtually all of whom are selfdescribed
realists---also need to be realistic. Far from portraying the world as
it is, their assessment of Europe is guided by an unfounded optimism
that Europeans can easily balance Russia if the United States pulled
out. Currently, Europe is presented by restraint scholars as the "easy"
case for a U.S. withdrawal, with Asia being the "hard" case.169 Although
China is rising fast and already has much more latent power than
[Russia]{.underline}, the latter [is a]{.underline}
[great]{.underline}er [threat]{.underline} to the United States'
European allies than the former [based on]{.underline} the other three
components of the balance of threat: [geographic location, offensive
military capabilities, and aggressive intentions]{.underline}.170 The
assessment of restraint scholars that pulling back from Europe is an
easy call ultimately rests on a wholly unsubstantiated assumption: that
an effective European balancing coalition would emerge quickly if the
United States pulled back. What our analysis shows is that Europeans
would for a very long time be unable to effectively confront Russia on
their own if the United States were to withdraw, and thus if America
does want stability in Europe, it should retain a presence on the
continent.

While I follow a relational and primarily historical and interpretive
approach, [I]{.underline} do [depart from]{.underline} many [other
adherents of relationalism]{.underline} in two significant ways.4 [The
first involves the assumption of]{.underline} an ethical or normative
content [to]{.underline} what Milja Kurki calls the "[relational
cosmology]{.underline}" of the "relational revolution" (Chapter 3, this
volume). [Kurki believes an ethical impulse is]{.underline} "[baked
in]{.underline}to" a relational worldview. There are a number of
examples of this in contemporary theory inside and outside of IR. [Two
variants]{.underline} are those [follow]{.underline}ing [Judith
Butler]{.underline} and her debt to [Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah
Arendt]{.underline}, who account for violence as an abrogation of
relations and a possibility of nonviolence in relations themselves.
Here, violence is in some sense the ignoring of a fundamental
relationality among human beings that would, if recognized, create an
understanding mutuality opposed to violence. From these accounts,
consciousness-raising about the fact of relationality is a solution to
global violence just as "realizing" and "experiencing" relationality
makes us open or indebted to "the other," to use Levinas' terms. The
second variant focuses more on the natural environment and violence
against nonhuman others. [From this perspective on relationality,
environmental destruction and extreme cruelty toward nonhuman animals
is]{.underline}, like the Levinasian/Arendtian account, [the result of a
loss of relationality]{.underline} often attributed to modernist
accounts of mind/body and nature/culture dualisms, or, more generally,
of anthropocentrism. Like normative relationalism, the environmental
strand believes that an awareness of this fact, or a cultivation of an
ethos of interdependence beyond the human species, will reduce violence
and possibly may make planetary life more sustainable. It is not unusual
to take as evidence of this position the confluence of environmental
protections by indigenous peoples with relational cosmologies.

[Both variants **conflate** the **methodological insights** of
relationalism with a relational **worldview**]{.underline}. [One is
empirical while the other is **aspirational**]{.underline}. [The
risk]{.underline}, I believe, [in this conflation is a confusion of
expectations and a **false sense**]{.underline} [that one has solved
more philosophical questions **than are possible**]{.underline} [to
solve]{.underline}. It is enough to have an account of the world that
integrates ideational and material forces into a single substance and
ontology. [We ought not expect that this]{.underline}, in addition,
[restores the world to some **perfect order**]{.underline}, [or that
striving for a more universal notion of the good escapes somehow the
**deep problems**]{.underline} [of competing interests]{.underline},
relativism, or incommensurable worldviews. [Too often the appeal to
relationalism's debt to]{.underline} science or fundamental, ancient
[ontologies is used to **depoliticize** its normative
commitments]{.underline}. However, the ambivalent relationship between
relationalism's cosmological and scientific origin stories ought to
demand the inverse. Rather than seeing relationality as an ethical exit
from particularity and the divisions in politics, it ought to insist
upon both as the beginning of inquiry.

While an ethics can be built within a relational ontology, it does not
necessarily follow from the ontological insights. After all, [seals and
great white sharks are **deeply relational**]{.underline} [and aware of
each other, and yet could not easily arrive at a common sense of the
good]{.underline}. [If any interspecies consensus could be reached
between predator and prey, it would be **minimal**]{.underline} (maybe a
consensus value on saving the ocean, for instance) [and not as a **mere
result** of their relationality, which is mostly characterized by
**teeth** and **blood**]{.underline}. [Could such a relationship be at
least free of violence]{.underline}? [Even that seems
**far-fetched**]{.underline} given the findings of animal behaviorists
that predators enjoy their hunt; killing for fun has been observed in
orcas, dolphins, and cats.

In fact, [rather than say that relationality and violence are
opposed]{.underline}, I believe that [the **opposite** claim can and
should be made]{.underline}. [If everything is relational]{.underline}
--- [from our cells to our consciousness]{.underline} --- [then
certainly **violence is relational** too]{.underline}. To go a step
further, violence --- a thoroughly human concept --- only distinguishes
itself from force or change because of the particular relationships of
attention and intimacy which make cruelty possible. What makes an
earthquake tragic --- that is, unavoidable and indebted to no
misanthropy or purposive end --- is precisely what makes an act of war
violent. Malice, sadism, cruelty, cultivated indifference --- all of
these extra characteristics are what change the ecological and political
relations of actions such that they are violent as opposed to something
else.

[This volume challenges us to stretch our imagination and rethink the
world of international relations]{.underline}. It engages modern
substantialist, Weberian approaches to social science [with new
**postmodern**, **relationalist** or **quantum** approaches and
concludes that **substantialist** views which emphasize the
**individual** are **outdated**]{.underline}. 1 [This conclusion is
**premature**]{.underline}. [Stretching our imagination is **one
thing**; tearing it up is **another**]{.underline}. As we proceed, we
need a clear picture of what we are stretching and potentially tearing
up; it could be the reasoning individual and the human capacity to
imagine itself.

This chapter offers a full-throated (albeit limited) exposition and
defense of the Enlightenment/Weberian worldview that underlines modern
social science. [The **Enlightenment worldview**]{.underline} [gave form
to the aspiration for **individual freedom**]{.underline} [and
**choice**]{.underline}. [It rescued humanity from the **stultifying
clutches** of **mysticism**]{.underline} (Nature) [and
**religion**]{.underline} (the Divine). [It dethroned **philosopher
kings** and **papal elites**]{.underline} [and empowered **ordinary**,
individual human beings, equipped with **reason**, spirit]{.underline}
(emotion, faith), [and **education**]{.underline}, [to create,
**assess**,]{.underline} **[debate]{.underline}**, [and pass
judgment]{.underline} on alternative worldviews. Natural science
exploded under Isaac Newton's vision of an orderly universe fixed in
time and space following predictable laws. And social science spawned a
virtual cornucopia of modern worldviews, both individualistic and
authoritarian. Liberalism (John Locke), capitalism (Adam Smith),
humanism (Max Weber), communism (Karl Marx), and fascism (Friedrick
Nietzsche), among others, competed (and fought) to organize and direct
social and scientific life. 2 In the West, through struggle, humanist
and capitalist worldviews prevailed, fueling material progress, the
spread of republican institutions, and gnawing anguish about minorities
left behind.

Now, [postmodern worldviews]{.underline} of relationalism and
hyper-humanism (unity of human beings and nature) challenge
Enlightenment worldviews. They [**reject** the individualistic ontology
of human affairs in favor of a wholistic]{.underline} or cosmological
[one]{.underline}. Milja Kurki writes: "The relational perspective
explored here suggests that the sciences -- natural and social -- are
undergoing a 'relational revolution,' moving from Cartesian, Newtonian,
and empiricist ways of knowing toward more relational ontologies and
epistemologies in line with not only quantum science and relativity
theory but also with ecological thought and decolonization of the
sciences." 3 Relationalist views envision a world of intense and
entangled relationships deeply embedded in historical and cosmological
context, in which substantialist things such as individuals and
institutions do not exist or exist only in emergent form when they are
investigated. In this holistic and processual universe, individual human
beings have no location (position), no alternative (choice), and no
escape (only one observed universe). The relationalist worldview draws
from quantum science, in which reality is not fixed in time or space but
appears simultaneously and unpredictably in multiple places and
dissolves the distinction between the observer (individual) and the
observed (universe).

These different worldviews not only reflect different ontologies, they
prescribe different world politics. As Kurki infers, [the relationalist
turn entails a **political agenda**]{.underline} -- [a broadside assault
on western **rationality**]{.underline} (reason),
**[individuality]{.underline}** (freedom), capitalism (growth), and
colonialism (control/hierarchy). [4 In place of Enlightenment goals,
relationalism advocates]{.underline} a future agenda of environmentalism
that prioritizes climate change, [**hyper-humanism** that
**relinquishes** human control of nature,]{.underline} [and
egalitarianism that **flattens** material and moral
differences]{.underline}. [Much more is **at stake** than abstract
intellectual discourse]{.underline}. [The relationalist turn may
**imperil** the **very notion** of free, reasoning
individuals]{.underline} capable of self-conscious thought and choice in
human affairs.

This chapter insists that [individual human beings remain at the
**epicenter** of social science inquiry]{.underline}. Quantum science
does not mandate an epochal transformation of worldviews from
rationality and individualism to relationality and cosmology. 5
[Modeling the social sciences after the natural sciences is, in fact, a
**cardinal mistake**]{.underline}. Relationalists highlight that mistake
when they argue that Enlightenment science under Newton hijacked the
social sciences and created a disenchanted modernity of atoms
(individuals) and laws (causality) devoid of spirit and meaning. Now
they make the same mistake by modeling the postmodern world after
quantum science. But the Newtonian world was never just a billiard ball
world of fixed entities, time and space. It was inspired and limited by
Christian beliefs that the divine did not roll dice (a predictable
world) and human beings were made equally worthy in the image of the
divine. And the quantum worldview today is not just a mathematical model
of entanglement and uncertainty; it is also a social vision to reimagine
the political world as harmonious, contingent, and relationally or
group-based (identity politics, multiculturalism, etc.), rather than as
competitive, progressive, and individually based (markets, individual
human rights, etc.).

[The Enlightenment produced good and evil]{.underline}. This chapter
does not claim otherwise. [The Enlightenment's crown jewel]{.underline},
however, [was the **emancipation**, for better and worse, of the
individual human being as a reasoning, responsible, and rights-seeking
agent in society]{.underline}. [On balance]{.underline},
[this]{.underline} secular, [individually driven humanist worldview was
**progressive**, materially and socially. Despite all of its wars and
warts, the Enlightenment era superintended **unparalleled expansion** of
**material prosperity**]{.underline}, **[human longevity]{.underline}**,
**[public education]{.underline}**, **[political freedom]{.underline}**
(yes, more democracies than ever before), [and **global
equality**]{.underline} (yes, [half of the world's population is now
**middle class**]{.underline}). 6 [Any post-Enlightenment worldview that
challenges the individualist ontology of the Enlightenment has a **high
bar** to meet]{.underline}.

The chapter proceeds in four parts. The first part explores the
relationship between the individual and the whole, the timeworn
conundrum of agency and structure. It contends that the individual
remains primary over structure in several principal ways: as a source of
endless diversity, a repository for the capability of reason, a portal
of entry for human conversation, and the only species thus far that
practices science and is capable of representing and studying itself.
Individuals are not autonomous, but they have space in their embedded
situation for choice and change. The main issue between this chapter and
others in this volume is how much space they have and where that space
resides. Relationalist accounts tend to discount agency at the
individual level, Weberian accounts at the structural level. We risk a
lot by disregarding either.

The second and third parts address the content and juxtaposition of
competing worldviews. How do we compare and test them? This part holds
fast to the notion of a universal capability of individual human beings
to reason and a universal method of science to test alternative
propositions (worldviews) by experiment against an outside physical and
social world. To be sure, the content of reason and science is parochial
and differs by culture. In some worldviews, rational and individualistic
factors play the larger role, in others nonrational (e.g., emotion,
intuition) and holistic factors. 7 If these multiple worldviews are
incommensurable, however, we have no way to evaluate and test them.
Worldviews become religious not scientific undertakings, adopted by
faith not reason. On the other hand, if we retain science as a common
method (mathematics, experimentation), we can compare and evaluate
worldviews across different cultures. In this section I assume that all
worldviews incorporate two elements: content, or their relative emphasis
on rational vs. nonrational factors; and scale, or their relative
emphasis on individualistic vs. structural levels of analysis. 8

The fourth part addresses the ethics of different worldviews. Worldviews
have consequences -- some horrific, such as the Holocaust. Who or what
is accountable for these outcomes? If Weberian worldviews have moral
shortcomings -- and they do -- relationalist worldviews do as well.
Calling for openness and multiple worldviews (modernities),
relationalist views are at times quite dogmatic. They pass judgment on
worldviews as "right" or "wrong" not as "false" or "not false," and
speak of the pursuit of "truth" against which, they claim, resistance is
futile. 9 They downplay individual agency and emphasize entangled
relationships, conjuring up a "totalizing" worldview that marginalizes
individual rights and privacy. They blur distinctions between science
and religion and argue that worldviews "are inescapably normative." 10
Yet, curiously, relationalists say little about the substance of
relationalist norms. They pass over the question of how a relationalist
world, in which all possibilities are welcomed, defends itself against
the barbarity of an Adolf Hitler or a Joseph Stalin; they infer that
other religions (Hinduism, Buddhism) are more in tune with nature than
Christianity; they refrain from spirited criticism of worldviews that
discriminate against women (Saudi Arabia, India) or Muslims (China); and
[they blame America and the Enlightenment for elevating European
worldviews and marginalizing others]{.underline}. [Weberian worldviews,
by contrast, with their **individualistic** and **disaggregated**
ontology, accommodate alternative worldviews as long as these worldviews
submit to **objective falsification**]{.underline} [and do not claim
that their world is the only world which cannot be tested or
resisted]{.underline}. 11

6.3 Worldviews and Science

To do this, however, we need standards. [The Enlightenment gave us the
standard of science as a **universal method**]{.underline}:
**[mathematics]{.underline}**, **[experimental practice]{.underline}**.
[That method depends upon the assumption of a **real**
"**objective**]{.underline}" [world]{.underline} even if we can never
know that world. We ask and test how that world works, based on the
values we hold (e.g., world is predictable or uncertain), and the real
world pushes back against our experimental inquiries and tells us which
worldviews are consistent with it and which are not. Notice science as
method tells us only which worldviews are not false (i.e., not
inconsistent with reality); it never tells us which worldviews are true
(i.e., the actual reality).

This is a crucial point, at least for me. Truth lies not in the
universal method of science but in the multiple values that inform
science as method. Newton's Christian views led him to expect and
practice a "predictable" science; Weber's human-centric views led him to
anticipate a "progressive" science; the values held by Weber's critics
led them to expect a "disenchanted" science; Hitler's fascist and
Stalin's communist worldviews led them to promote "racist" and "pseudo"
sciences (Mengele and Lysenko). Relationalists value conjunctive
relationality (not individuals) and pursue a science of local not
universal knowledge. Values inform all worldviews, but science as method
tells us which worldviews fare best against an assumed objective world.

Strong [relationalists reject science as a universal method of testing
against an objective reality]{.underline}. [They talk about]{.underline}
"[different sciences]{.underline}" 55 [and argue that]{.underline}
"[science]{.underline} ... [is not defined by a 'method']{.underline}."
56 Quoting Roberto Unger and Lee Smolin, Kurki concludes: "There is no
scientific method, science is fundamentally defined as a collection of
ethical communities." 57 Here [we come very close to worldviews as pure
values]{.underline} (ethical communities) [with methods being
**anything**]{.underline} -- [scientific, **magical**,
**religious**]{.underline} -- [that values dictate]{.underline}. Each
community defines its own value and methods, and presumably the "real"
world accommodates them all because there is no common method to
determine which worldviews are not consistent with an assumed "real"
(i.e., objective) world.

There are three layers of uncertainty involved in this issue of
scientific objectivity (universality). Newtonian science studies the
natural (nonhuman) world: objects such as planets and particles which
cannot change their characteristics and which scientists neither like
nor dislike. Laws are fixed and cannot be affected by the scientist. The
human observer is also situated outside and independent of the natural
world. In Newtonian science, the observer can be mostly objective even
though scientists still operate in an intersubjective, ethical (social)
community (for Newton, the Church of England) that defines what is or is
not to be investigated and expected.

Weberian science studies not only the natural but also the social world
in which human beings are involved and can change their minds. Laws are
no longer fixed, and the observer, though still distinct, studies things
it likes and dislikes, such as churches, trade unions, markets,
political parties, etc. While Weberian scientists assume they can strip
their social preferences from their scientific pursuits, they are human,
not superhuman, and can succeed only up to a point. Objectivity is more
elusive. 58

Quantum science adds a third level of uncertainty. 59 It assumes that
the human observer is not only studying itself but is now inextricably
entangled with the world it is studying. The observer, the observed, and
the background exist only together (there is no separate individual,
observation, or background), and emerge only when a particular question
(measurement) is asked (made). Observation triggers or collapses the
entangled quantum world and reveals the only world we can know. There is
no world behind the observed one. Objectivity, in short, is now out of
the question. The world depends entirely on the questions the observer
asks.

[Relationalism]{.underline} in general pushes us toward this quantum
level of uncertainty. But a strong relationalism [goes beyond quantum
scien]{.underline}ce in two ways: [it]{.underline} drastically reduces
(if not **[eliminates]{.underline}**) [the role of the
observer]{.underline} (the individual investigator), [and it gives up
the universal method of experimental science in favor of a
**localized**]{.underline} [and **diluted** method of]{.underline}
"**[trial and error]{.underline}**." 60 [Quantum science does
neither]{.underline}. [In the case of the observer, it **elevates**, not
eliminates, the significance of the observer]{.underline} (individual).
Through the act of measuring, the observer now literally "creates"
("gives meaning to") the world we observe, which is the only world we
can know. 61 As Steven Weinberg muses, "Man may indeed be the measure of
all things." 62 [That seems to **reinforce** the Weberian worldview that
individuals are a significant location of agency]{.underline}. But in
quantum physics the observer now has no way to test observations against
an objective world because there is no objective world. The universal
scientific method is no longer available, and we have to settle for a
localized form of experimentation based on trial and error, yielding
results which cannot be generalized. That point seems to reinforce the
relationalist worldview.

But wait a minute. Some Newtonian (classical) physicists still contest
the quantum proposition that there is no objective world. They argue
that wave collapse is going on all the time objectively in a real but
unknown world behind the observed world. They seek evidence of such
"objective" wave collapse, independent of "subjective" measurement. 63
Interestingly, in these efforts, [Newtonian and quantum scientists use
the **same methods** of **science**, **mathematics** and
**experiments**]{.underline}, but derive very different content from
those methods. [Neither]{.underline}, however, [has given up on the idea
of science as a **universal method**]{.underline}. [Quantum science may
still prevail, but if it does it won't prevail forever, any more than
Newtonian science did]{.underline}. Science advances from one falsified
theory to another "not yet" falsified theory, not from false to true (at
which point science ends). 64 And, since scientists tell us that we know
only about 4 percent of the universe as we see it, the real world that
we don't see is likely to remain elusive for a very long time to come.
Scientists therefore should not speak about "the reality" let alone "the
truth" of their findings, only about a method that tells them which
findings are not false or not yet false.

[In the meantime, quantum science raises some **harrowing ethical
issues**]{.underline} [when applied to the human world]{.underline}:
[the potential of unhinged human observers playing the **role of
creator**]{.underline}, [and the **absence** of any common moral
standard by which to hold varying worldviews
**accountable**]{.underline}.

#### Absent analyzing the decisions of [individual leaders]{.underline} and treating them [culpable]{.underline}, genocide becomes [inevitable]{.underline}.

6.4 Worldviews and Ethics

Having downsized if not eliminated the role of the reasoning individual
in shaping worldviews, and having adopted a quantum view that the world
we see is the only one there is, [relationalism]{.underline} in this
volume [has]{.underline} surprisingly [little to say about **ethical**
and **moral** responsibility]{.underline}, either individual or
collective. This neglect follows from relationalist logic. [Because the
world is holistic and incorporates all possibilities, there is little or
**no choice**, and hence little or **no responsibility**. We have
removed practically all degrees of human freedom to **act** and
**change** the world]{.underline}. [What's left are different
**values**]{.underline} [or **religions**]{.underline} [and related
methods of science]{.underline} which are compatible but not
commensurable, harmonious but not integral, and equivalent but not
competitive. Katzenstein writes:

> both science and religion are variegated practices of different ways
> of knowing ... Both inquire into the possibility that the world might
> be different than it appears. Both are instances of us living in
> multiple realities and thus are examples of the profound human
> capacity of meaning-making ... Religious and scientific practices are
> rooted in the world of play. 65

Play is an interesting term, implying a game or imaginary reality. In
that game, however, what are the rules, and who makes them? Maybe no
rules are needed. Science and religion are drawing closer together: "the
border between quantum mechanics and religion is porous." 66 Religious
values and scientific methods do not collide, they resonate. Multiple
beliefs and realities cut or "smear" into one another like quantum
waves. They blend, harmonize.

Such a harmonious concatenation of multiple worldviews expresses an
aspiration that we all share. If relationalism is nothing more than an
appeal for curiosity, openness, and tolerance, it is welcomed. But [what
if multiple worldviews do not harmonize]{.underline}? [What if some
worldviews condone **slavery**, deny individual **human rights**,
justify **genocide**]{.underline}, discriminate against women (Islam in
Saudi Arabia) or minorities (Uighurs in China), wage holy war against
the infidel, and so on? [In the **flattened ontology** that
relationalists advocate]{.underline}, are all worldviews "true" or
"moral"?

[The issue here is not whether human beings are entangled but what the
**content** of that entanglement is]{.underline}. The content of
entanglement is what Haas and I try to get at with the concept of
"ideological distance," whether worldviews are converging or diverging.
67 [According to relationalists, the quantum social world is
**cooperative**; ideological distance is always at or **near
zero**]{.underline}. [Conversely, the Weberian world is
**conflictual**]{.underline}; [ideological distance is always positive
and sometimes large]{.underline}. As Alexander Wendt explains:

> If your starting premise for thinking about social life is atomistic,
> then conflict is the natural starting point for life -- every organism

> cooperation may be much easier to achieve. It may even be the default
> situation, and conflict is the exception. So it turns upside down a
> lot of the foundational assumptions, I think, of mainstream social
> science. 68

Whether social life is atomistic or entangled, however, does not tell us
much about outcomes. The master--slave relationship is entangled but not
cooperative. The relationship between liberal states in the democratic
peace is separate but not conflictual. No conflict in either case may
mean no freedom to challenge slavery or democracy, and therefore no
moral accountability -- a totalitarian entanglement for which no one is
responsible and which, apparently, no one can change.

Over time, of course, the content of social entanglement does change.
Outright slavery is no longer acceptable. Communism, at least in the
Soviet form, is gone. How does such change occur, and who is responsible
for the original conflict and its eventual outcome? Katzenstein writes:
"Divergent worldviews do not get resolved by appeals to logic and
evidence but through individual experiences and social processes." 69
So, how do "individual experience" and "social processes" accomplish
this resolution? [If **logic** and **evidence** are ruled out, what are
the means of resolution]{.underline} -- [**emotion**, **habit**,
**intuition**, etc]{.underline}.? [Are these means peaceful or
violent]{.underline}? [Practically everyone agrees that Nazism had to be
defeated by **rationalist instruments**]{.underline} (Grove might say
assemblages) of power; Nazi ideology could not be blended or
accommodated by relationalist effects of norms.

The relationalist worldview lacks any ethical standard for evaluating or
resolving divergencies in the content of alternative worldviews.
[Everything is local and specific even though the world itself is
holistic and entangled]{.underline}. [And all events are uncertain even
though the quantum model itself is certain and can't be
challenged]{.underline}. [The combination of the **loss of
objectivity**]{.underline} ([no real world behind the observed
one]{.underline}) [and the **multiplicity** of **incommensurable** but
**equivalent worldviews**]{.underline} [leaves almost everything **up
for grabs**]{.underline}. [A flattened ontology leads to a flattened
ethical landscape as well]{.underline}.

Kurki seeks a relational ethic of response-ability: an ability to
respond sensitively, openly, and thoughtfully to human and nonhuman
relationships. 70 It is an appealing insight. But in a world in which
there are no things (individuals) or backgrounds (objective world),
where exactly is this responsibility located, and what is its substance?
[**Grove**, for example, sees violence as relational but not easily
overcome by consciousness-raising]{.underline}. 71 [You can become aware
of relations, he points out, without coming to a sense of the common
good]{.underline}. Kurki ponders the same point about knowledge:
[science]{.underline} "[is part of becoming]{.underline} ... [what this
means is that we do not have clear criteria for good or bad
knowledge]{.underline}." 72 The substance of ethics or knowledge, what
is good and what is bad, is hard to pin down. Even harder to pin down is
the location of ethical responsibility. [In Grove's
examination]{.underline} of presidential powers and nuclear weapons, [he
admits that]{.underline} the president is ultimately unaware of who or
what is in control." 73 And [if no one is in control, no one has
responsibility]{.underline}.

Responsibility is not merely the "ability to respond." It's the ability
to respond "by someone or something" in a "substantive" way toward some
moral "end." Weber distinguished between an "ethic of responsibility,"
which Kurki's formulation might capture, and an "ethic of ultimate
ends," which Kurki does not consider. 74 Perhaps this is because an
ethic of ultimate ends requires more than a relationship; it requires a
direction, an arrow, not simply a flat surface or "fold."

As noted earlier, Grove suggests that "the scale of the investigator ...
radically alters what appears as a part and what appears as a whole." If
that's the case, the individual investigator, the individual, is back at
the heart of a quantum-based social science model. 75 The Weberian
commitment to the individual human being as the source of meaning and
morality in a multiscalar world remains indispensable. That does not
rule out agency at other levels. Relationalist factors are multiple,
real, and often confining. But, to a meaningful extent, they form out of
the interpretations and interactions of reasoning individuals, they
change because of individual initiatives, and they dissolve because
individuals leave and join other relationships. The only "authenticated"
actors beyond the individual in a Weberian worldview, therefore, are
those groups, institutions, classes, etc., that are chosen or affirmed
voluntarily by the consent of individual human beings acting in a
setting where they have a meaningful degree of choice. Holistic
worldviews diminish that degree of choice and consent, however
well-meaning they may be by embracing all possibilities.

[The Weberian view **judges** and **chooses**]{.underline}. That is
neither easy nor pleasant. No one wants to be accused of being
judgmental. But we all do it. 76 Indeed, how does one avoid it? The
[Holocaust was a **monstrous act of evil**]{.underline}. How do we
understand it in a world that blends religion and science? As Barnett
(Chapter 5) shows, [the Holocaust poses a wrenching question of
existence, not just a **vague smearing**]{.underline} [of relationships
and]{.underline} "[response-ability]{.underline}" [to **change** or
**becoming**]{.underline}. [If such a question can be answered only in a
**specific situation**]{.underline} (when the quantum wave function
collapses), [then we have **abandoned** both **our humanity** and our
influence on world affairs]{.underline}.

Am I forcing everyone into a Weberian worldview? 77 Possibly, but I am
not saying that the Weberian view is the only view. I am saying that I
can find a location in the Weberian universe to host an alternative
point of view (and do so when I compare the worldviews in this volume;
see earlier in this chapter); I cannot find such a location in a
relationalist universe. At the beginning, this project postulated a
revolution in natural and social science thought rejecting Enlightenment
and Newtonian worldviews. In later stages, Katzenstein emphasized
complementarities among Newtonian and Post-Newtonian worldviews. 78 By
complementarity, however, Katzenstein forces the Newtonian view into the
relationalist universe where "[the determinist or probability-inflected
Newtonian world]{.underline} can be thought of as a special case that
[reveals itself when the quantum world of infinite possibilities and
radical uncertainty **collapses**]{.underline}." 79 **[Bottom
line]{.underline}**? [There is **no location** in the relationist world
for dissent]{.underline}. Alternatives either fit into the quantum world
or are patently false.

Moreover, understanding another worldview does not mean accepting it or
making it equivalent. Would the world be better off today if the
Reformation and Enlightenment had not occurred, or if the Haitian lwa
not the Weberian worldview had dominated world politics after 1600? 80
Best, you say, if neither dominated? OK, but spell out the global
consequences of the Haitian worldview or the specific parameters of
equal coexistence which makes all worldviews (fascism, communism)
acceptable and worth learning from. Unless we specify "what" we learn
from "which" worldview, we are simply treating worldviews like
souvenirs, collecting and trivializing them. Worse, we are opening the
floodgates to any worldview with no standard for judging good and bad.
Maybe the relationalist turn pops open an irresistible, new window of a
more harmonious world that we have missed because of the atomistic and
competitive frame of western modernism. But maybe it doesn't. And if it
doesn't, not only material progress but individual freedom is at stake.

Which leads to a final question: where do relationalist cosmologies
place the divine? What lies behind the Big Bang? Relationalists are
eager to unify the human and natural worlds and see a growing
commonality between science and religion. The obstacle to unifying the
human and natural worlds, however, is an understanding of consciousness
which humans have and nonhumans do not. And the obstacle to uniting the
scientific and religious (supranatural) worlds is an understanding of
the soul, the human capacity to imagine the divine. 81 Separating these
three worlds -- nature, humanity, and the divine -- has led to abuse:
humanity masquerading as gods (the Church before the Enlightenment) or
humanity "lifted up" to control nature (the critics' view of the
Enlightenment). But uniting them may lead to even worse abuse. What
stands in the way of a science that poses as a religion or a nature that
restrains prosperity? 82 [By **blurring** the distinction between
religion and science, nature and humanity, relationalism weakens
Enlightenment institutions]{.underline} that separate state and church,
markets and feudalism. [It enables potentially powerful **new gods** of
**unchallenged expertise** and science to take the stage]{.underline}
([because]{.underline}, remember, [there is **no objective**
universe]{.underline}). [We could wind up again in a pre-Enlightenment
world wherein scientists and their authoritarian enablers usurp the
power of privilege to **suppress** the rights of reasoning individuals.
Resistance would be anti-science and futile]{.underline}, as it was
anti-God and heresy in pre-Enlightenment times. As Timothy Byrnes
writes, "[if a relational cosmology is grounded in faith or in the
pursuit of what is 'really real,' then the unknown itself is the basis
of Truth and the human propensity to resistance is ultimately
futile]{.underline}." 83 [And if the unknown is truth and cannot be
resisted, the Dark Ages may be upon us once agai]{.underline}n.

6.5 Conclusion

[I come back to]{.underline} the need, therefore, to [maintain a
Weberian worldview, whatever the debate in physics]{.underline}, if only
to retain a "critical" perspective on the totalizing tendencies of the
relationalist school of thought. As Mike Barnett concludes, "[Without
worldviews we would not know how to go on, and would be lost in the
wilds until a charismatic leader arrived to provide
guidance]{.underline}." 84 In the barren "wilds" of relationalism (the
jungle), that charismatic leader would probably be a totalizing
ideology, one admitting of no alternatives -- radical Islam under the
Caliphate, Medieval Christianity under the Inquisition, totalitarian
atheism under fascism and communism, or scientific elitism under a
relationalist banner that substitutes expertise for politics and human
choice. The Weberian worldview is still a necessary defense against that
sort of evil.
