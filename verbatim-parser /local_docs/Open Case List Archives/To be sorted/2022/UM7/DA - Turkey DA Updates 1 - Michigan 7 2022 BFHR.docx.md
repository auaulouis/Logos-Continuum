**[Despite]{.underline}** [the progress]{.underline}, [the road
to]{.underline} full [membership for Sweden and Finland is]{.underline}
still likely to be **[fraught with bumps]{.underline}** as their
accession protocols need to be ratified by all existing NATO members.
[Turkey would **prefer to delay**]{.underline} [this]{.underline}
process [so]{.underline} that [Ankara]{.underline} [can]{.underline} use
it as leverage to press the Nordic duo to implement their commitments --
and even [make]{.underline} **[new demands]{.underline}** [not in the
trilateral agreement.]{.underline}

But [the]{.underline} **[whole saga]{.underline}** [over
Turkey's]{.underline} **[threat of veto]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}
probably **[cost]{.underline}** [Ankara a]{.underline} **[loss of
goodwill]{.underline}** in Stockholm and Helsinki, two capitals which
were supportive of Turkey's EU membership bid. And the question of
implementation is intimately linked to the question of the
interpretation of the deal.

Stockholm and Helsinki would probably adopt a minimalist interpretation
of the deal whereas Ankara would go for a maximalist version.
[Erdogan]{.underline} has already [claimed Sweden committed to
**extradite** 73 people]{.underline} on terrorism charges, [but
Stockholm]{.underline} has **[denied this]{.underline}**, saying any
extradition request must go through due legal processes.

Although the threat of Turkey's vetoing of both countries' membership
bid is now removed, [more]{.underline} **[haggling and
disputes]{.underline}** between Turkey and the two Nordic countries, and
hence more delays, [is likely remain]{.underline} **[on the
horizon]{.underline}** until Stockholm and Helsinki finally acquire
their full membership in NATO.

**Strat Con's NEG. It's [bedeviled]{.underline} relations by increasing
tension over the Kurds.**

[With NATO's]{.underline} [new]{.underline} **[Strategic
Concept]{.underline}** being designed to address a global security
environment defined by the great power competition, it was key for
Ankara to ensure that the issue of terrorism was not de-emphasized, and
so the fact this remained a major part within it was a win for Turkey.

Putting aside major global subjects such as climate, cybersecurity, or
competition over space, it is state-centric and conventional security
threats that ultimately define the spirit of this document.

Moving forward, Ankara will likely use this document -- and its new
trilateral memorandum with Sweden and Finland -- to press NATO and its
members to provide more support in its fight against the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK) and to refrain from supporting the Syrian Kurdish
People's Protection Units (YPG) and its associated Democratic Union
Party (PYD).

However, as [the]{.underline} [PYD/YPG is]{.underline} **[only
proscribed]{.underline}** [as a]{.underline} [terrorist
organization]{.underline} [by Turkey]{.underline} [and not]{.underline}
**[any other]{.underline}** [NATO states]{.underline},
[this]{.underline} issue [will]{.underline} likely [continue
to]{.underline} **[bedevil relations]{.underline}** -- [especially with
the US as the]{.underline} **[main partner]{.underline}** of the group.

**Turkey feels like they [need]{.underline} NATO now. They want NATO to
respond to [Russia]{.underline}.**

In addition, with the Ukraine invasion, it is understandable that the
eastern flank has become a primary focus of NATO action. But [Russia
has]{.underline} arguably **[never had]{.underline}** [that much
presence in the Mediterranean]{.underline}, [being a major player
in]{.underline} **[Syria]{.underline}**, **[Libya]{.underline}**, [and
the eastern]{.underline} **[Mediterranean]{.underline}**, [and
maintaining]{.underline} **[extremely close]{.underline}** [relations
with]{.underline} **[Algeria]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Egypt]{.underline}** -- Moscow has air and naval bases in Syria,
Libya, and Algeria. [From a]{.underline} **[Russian
perspective]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} **[east]{.underline}**
[and **south** are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** seen as two
[separate]{.underline} spaces but as a single space, and [Turkey is
a]{.underline} **[major actor]{.underline}** [in both]{.underline}
spaces.

Ankara is one of the primary powers in the Black Sea region but [Turkey
and Russia]{.underline} **[are already]{.underline}** [facing each other
in]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** [Mediterranean conflicts,
notably]{.underline} **[Syria]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Libya]{.underline}**. And so, [in the face of]{.underline}
**[continuing]{.underline}** [regional instability and disorder, state
collapse, and growing Russian]{.underline} and Chinese [footprints,
Turkey **wants**]{.underline} [NATO to]{.underline} **[remain
committed]{.underline}** to the southern flank and southern
neighbourhood. The strong emphasis on the southern neighbourhood, the
Middle East and Africa, in the concept note was in line with this
preference.

On Monday [Secretary of Defense]{.underline} Lloyd [Austin met with his
**Greek counterpart**]{.underline} Nikolaos [Panagiotopoulos to discuss
the recent sale of]{.underline} **[F-35 fighter]{.underline}** [jets and
**joint** U.S.-Greek cooperation]{.underline} [in the Aegean Sea and the
eastern Mediterranean area]{.underline}.

[Tensions **have risen**]{.underline} [in recent months
between]{.underline} the two NATO countries, [with Turkey issuing
a]{.underline} **[series of threats]{.underline}** [against
Greece]{.underline}.

Victoria Coates, former deputy national security adviser for the Middle
East and North Africa, said of the meeting, \"[Greece is a]{.underline}
**[critical partner]{.underline}** [in the eastern Mediterranean that
has been]{.underline} **[foundational]{.underline}** [in
establishing]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[security coordination]{.underline}** [in the region]{.underline}. [As
Turkey takes an]{.underline} **[increasingly adversarial]{.underline}**
[posture]{.underline}, [we will need]{.underline} [more
cooperation]{.underline} **[with Greece]{.underline}** [not
less]{.underline}.\"

According to the Associated Press [Greece and Turkey have]{.underline}
**[strained relations]{.underline}** [over a]{.underline}
**[slew]{.underline}** [of issues including competing]{.underline}
**[maritime]{.underline}** [boundary claims that affect]{.underline}
**[energy exploration]{.underline}** rights [in the eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}. Tensions flared in 2020 over exploratory
drilling rights in areas in the Mediterranean Sea where Greece and
Cyprus claim their own exclusive economic zone, leading to a naval
standoff.

[Turkey also claims]{.underline} [Greece is violating international
agreements by]{.underline} **[militarizing islands]{.underline}** [in
the Aegean Sea]{.underline}. [Athens]{.underline} says it [**needs to
defend** the islands]{.underline} --- many of which lie close to
Turkey's coast --- [against a]{.underline} **[potential
attack]{.underline}** [using Turkey's large fleet of military landing
craft]{.underline}.

[In a major]{.underline} **[military exercise]{.underline}** last month,
Turkish president Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan]{.underline}, according to media
reports [said]{.underline}, \"Once again, [we call on Greece to stop
equipping]{.underline} the [islands]{.underline} that are under civilian
status and to act in accordance with international agreements. I'm not
kidding, **[I'm serious]{.underline}**. [This nation is]{.underline}
**[determined]{.underline}**, [if it says anything]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} **[will follow]{.underline}** [it]{.underline}.\"

In May Erdoğan said he would stop talking with the Greek Prime Minister
Kyriakos Mitsotakis, after he accused him of persuading Washington not
to sell F-16 fighter jets to the Turks during a trip to the U.S.

During Monday\'s press availability, [Secretary Austin
said]{.underline}, \"[The defense relationship between the United States
and Greece has]{.underline} **[never been]{.underline}**
[stronger]{.underline}. We especially thank [Greece]{.underline} for
hosting the U.S. Naval Support Activity at Souda Bay, which
[is]{.underline} a **[cornerstone]{.underline}** of our defense
relationship.\"

[His Greek counterpart stated]{.underline}, that [Greece]{.underline}
\"[reaffirmed the importance of a]{.underline} strong and
**[profound]{.underline}** [and ever-growing]{.underline} society
strategic defense [partnership between the United States and
Greece]{.underline}\" and highlighted the \"two updates of the Mutual
Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2019.\"

Notably, Minister Panagiotopoulos referenced the sale of F-35 fighter
jets to the Greek military: \"[A new milestone]{.underline} of this
strategic partnership [is]{.underline} without doubt [the procurement
of]{.underline} the state of the art **[F-35 fighter]{.underline}**, [a
major step for]{.underline} our **[deterrence]{.underline}** [and
even]{.underline} **[closer interaction]{.underline}**, [coordination
and interoperability]{.underline} between the armed force of Greece and
the United States.\"

Selling U.S. fighter jets to Turkey has been a contentious subject in
recent years as [Erdoğan commits]{.underline} Turkish [forces
to]{.underline} the fight in [Syria at the cost of belligerence
to]{.underline} **[U.S. allies]{.underline}** [and
interests]{.underline}. [Erdoğan has threatened to block Sweden and
Finland's]{.underline} entry into NATO, [waged a]{.underline}
[limited]{.underline} **[intervention]{.underline}** [and raids
into]{.underline} **[Northern Iraq]{.underline}**, and, [as
such]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} U.S. **[House]{.underline}** of
Representatives recently [added]{.underline} **[new
roadblocks]{.underline}** on Biden's plan [to sell the F-16 fighter
jet]{.underline} to Turkey.

[Turkey faced]{.underline} **[heavy criticism]{.underline}** by the
Trump administration and lawmakers [when it purchased **Russian
S-400**]{.underline} air missile defense system, which led to U.S.
sanctions in 2020. At the time, U.S. officials raised alarm bells that
the S-400 deal with Russia could endanger NATO security and jeopardize
American-Turkey intelligence sharing.

\"[The Greek defense minister will]{.underline} likely **[look for
assurances]{.underline}** [from the U.S. government]{.underline} that it
will not make that F-16 sales to Turkey without stronger guarantees from
Turkey --- including that air-space violations by Turkish jets will not
continue,\" said Sinan Ciddi, a non-resident senior fellow focusing on
Turkish domestic politics and foreign policy at the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies. \"Without this, Greece is likely to attempt to
pressure the Biden administration not to support F-16 sales to Turkey.\"

**F-16 won't go through but F-35 will.**

WASHINGTON -- [Greek Defense Minister]{.underline} Nikolaos
[Panagiotopoulos]{.underline} [is visiting the United
States]{.underline} this week [as Athens]{.underline} **[continues its
bid]{.underline}** [to join]{.underline} [Lockheed Martin's
F-35]{.underline} **[co-production]{.underline}** [program]{.underline}
and lobby against a potential F-16 sale to Turkey.

Panagiotopoulos said Tuesday that he discussed Greece's potential entry
into the F-35 program with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as well as
Sean Burke, the director of the Pentagon's F-35 joint program office. He
also noted that he would tour Lockheed's F-35 production line Fort
Worth, Texas on Wednesday alongside the company's CEO, Jim Taiclet.

"We already have made our interest known," he told Defense News. "We
sent a letter of request, and we have to wait for a time -- that's the
procedure -- for the letter of acceptance. But everything that needs to
be done on a procedural level for a swift entrance into this program is
being done."

Greece sent its official letter of request to buy 20 F-35As last month
with an eye on delivery after 2028. Athens has also expressed interest
in purchasing an additional batch of F-35s down the line. Joining
Lockheed's co-production program alongside the U.S. and eight other
countries would also require Greece to stake its own equities in
manufacturing the advanced fighter jets.

Panagiotopoulos said that joining [the program reflects the commitment
of Greece and the U.S.]{.underline} [to **intensify**]{.underline}
[cooperation]{.underline} "[in]{.underline} the domain of **[defense
procurement]{.underline}**."

He made the remarks after a meeting with [Sen.]{.underline} Bob
[Menendez]{.underline}, D-N.J., who [exercises]{.underline}
**[considerable leverage]{.underline}** [over arms sales]{.underline}
[to other nations]{.underline} [as chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee]{.underline}. Menendez's home state of New Jersey boasts the
sixth largest Greek American population in the U.S. and the fourth
largest Armenian American population, making Greece's adversarial NATO
ally Turkey particularly unpopular among many of his constituents.

Greece, Turkey jockey for position in Washington

[Menendez]{.underline} **[has threatened]{.underline}** [to use his
leverage to block the]{.underline} [\$6 billion sale of]{.underline} 40
Lockheed Martin Block 70 [F-16 fighter jets to Turkey]{.underline}.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis directly appealed to Congress
to block the F-16 sale during an address before a joint meeting of
Congress in May -- immediately after he announced Greece's intention to
acquire the F-35 at the White House.

[The U.S. **kicked Turkey** out of the F-35 co-production
program]{.underline} in 2019 [over Ankara's purchase of the Russian
S-400 missile defense]{.underline} amid fears [its advanced radar system
could]{.underline} **[allow Moscow]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[spy]{.underline}** [on the stealth fighter jets]{.underline}.

[The Greeks have found a]{.underline} **[critical ally]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} **[Menendez]{.underline}** as they seek to block the
F-16 sale to Turkey amid repeated Turkish violations of Greek airspace,
the ongoing occupation of Northern Cyprus and maritime disputes over gas
exploration in the eastern Mediterranean.

This puts Athens at odds with President Joe Biden, who voiced support
for the F-16 sale at the NATO summit in Madrid last month after Turkey
dropped its opposition to Swedish and Finnish accession to the alliance.
The Turks are also seeking a separate \$400 million sale to upgrade
their current F-16 jets with new missiles, radar and electronics.

"We should sell them the F-16 jets and modernize those jets as well,"
Biden said in Madrid. "But I need congressional approval to be able to
do that, and I think we can get that."

[It remains]{.underline} **[unclear]{.underline}** [how the White House
plans to]{.underline} **[persuade Menendez]{.underline}**, [who
remains]{.underline} **[committed]{.underline}** [to using his position
to]{.underline} **[block the sale]{.underline}**.

Menendez told Defense News on Monday that [he remains a]{.underline}
**[hard no]{.underline}** [on the F-16s]{.underline} but said he could
consider the sale if Turkey addresses issues he has previously raised
with Ankara. Those include its actions in the eastern Mediterranean, its
continued possession of the S-400s, it human rights record and ongoing
attacks against the US-backed fighters in northeast Syria.

[The]{.underline} Kurdish-dominated [Syrian Democratic Council
has]{.underline} **[also lobbied]{.underline}** [Congress]{.underline}
and the Biden administration **[against the sale]{.underline}**, noting
that Turkey has used F-16s to target civilian infrastructure in areas
under its control as recently as February.

Sinam Mohamad, [the]{.underline} Syrian Democratic [Council's
envoy]{.underline} to Washington, told Defense News in May that she has
[engaged lawmakers]{.underline} and the State Department "**[at senior
levels]{.underline}**" to urge them not to approve the F-16 sale.

The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, [James
Risch]{.underline} of Idaho, [also has the]{.underline}
**[authority]{.underline}** [to block the F-16 sale]{.underline} and
noted that "the situation is fluid right now."

[Risch has]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** yet [given
the]{.underline} **[green light]{.underline}** for the sale to proceed.
Still, he told Defense News in May that he was "positively disposed in
that direction, but I'm not completely there yet."

[Turkey's reputation on Capitol Hill]{.underline}
**[plummeted]{.underline}** [following its]{.underline} 2019 [S-400
acquisition]{.underline} and attack on the Syrian Kurds that same year,
but recently Ankara has managed to claw back some goodwill in Congress
over its support for Ukraine.

The chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
Democrat Gregory Meeks of New York and Republican Mike McCaul of Texas,
have both indicated that they would not block the sale so long as Turkey
continue to work with the U.S. to address outstanding issues.

[The House voted 244-179]{.underline} last week [to]{.underline} **[add
an amendment]{.underline}** from Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., [to its
annual defense authorization that would require]{.underline} Biden to
submit "[a]{.underline} **[detailed description]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[concrete steps]{.underline}**" [to ensure that
Turkey does not use the F-16s to violate Greek airspace]{.underline}
before proceeding with any sale. [The amendment also]{.underline}
**[requires]{.underline}** [that Biden certify]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} F-16 [sale]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [in
U.S.]{.underline} national **[security interests]{.underline}**.

**Congress opposes Turkey now which is key to Mediterranean peace.
Specifically, they won't sell F-16s.**

[Turkey's]{.underline} 2019 [purchase and activation of the
S-400]{.underline} surface-to-air missile [defense system]{.underline}
from Russia **[violated]{.underline}** [United States law]{.underline},
[resulting in its ejection from]{.underline} [the F-35 program
and]{.underline} the imposition of [CAATSA sanctions]{.underline}. More
than three years later, the [Erdogan]{.underline} government
[has]{.underline} **[made it clear]{.underline}** [it has]{.underline}
**[no intention]{.underline}** [of backing away from the S-400
system]{.underline} [or addressing the]{.underline} **[underlying
issues]{.underline}** [that led to]{.underline} **[its
ejection]{.underline}** from the F-35 program and the Congressional
holds on purchases of American-made weapons by Turkey. **[In
fact]{.underline}**, President [Erdogan has declared]{.underline} **[his
intention]{.underline}** [to purchase]{.underline}
**[additional]{.underline}** [S-400s]{.underline} multiple times since.
One of the reasons Congress insisted on Turkey's ejection from the F-35
program was because of the significant risks associated with collocating
S-400s and F-35s. Experts have noted that [providing Turkey F-16
modernization]{.underline} kits [poses]{.underline} similar
**[collocation risks]{.underline}** [if Ankara continues to possess
Russian S-400s]{.underline}. Since upgraded F-16s still play such a
significant role for us and our reliable allies, that is a risk that I
do not find acceptable. To make matters worse, [Turkey continues
to]{.underline} **[fly the F-16s]{.underline}** already in its
possession [over Greek islands and]{.underline} has
**[violated]{.underline}** [Greece's airspace]{.underline}
**[thousands]{.underline}** [of times]{.underline} in recent months,
[with]{.underline} **[no end]{.underline}** [in sight]{.underline}. This
isn't a matter of "just or unjust" -- [we]{.underline} **[cannot
reward]{.underline}** [the Erdogan government for its
aggression]{.underline} [or allow it to]{.underline} **[escape
accountability]{.underline}** [for its]{.underline} continued [violation
of]{.underline} US law and the standards of [the NATO
Alliance]{.underline}.

What is the timeline moving forward? What is the legislative process
until that amendment makes it to the final bill and becomes a US law? It
is a long, difficult and uncertain process but I guess that you are
optimistic, correct?

In the House, I've submitted my amendments for consideration, and we
expect to consider the National Defense Authorization Act by the end of
July. If the amendment is approved for consideration, I'm confident that
[it will pass on a]{.underline} **[bipartisan basis]{.underline}** as
part of the House NDAA. While it's a long road from submitting my
amendment to the NDAA being signed into law, I am optimistic that [the
amendment will]{.underline} **[make it across]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[finish line]{.underline}** [because of
the]{.underline} **[diverse]{.underline}**, [bipartisan]{.underline}
**[coalition]{.underline}** of supporters we're building in the House.

Should we expect a similar amendment to be introduced in the Senate?

I'm actively in discussions with Senate offices to have a similar
amendment introduced for the Senate NDAA and I'm hopeful [we'll
be]{.underline} **[able to secure]{.underline}** [bipartisan,
**bicameral** support]{.underline} for this provision.

Are your colleagues in Congress fully aware of [Turkey's aggression in
the Aegean]{.underline} [and the open]{.underline} **[threats of
war]{.underline}** [against Greece]{.underline}?

I don't believe enough of my colleagues fully appreciate the threat
Turkey's actions and rhetoric toward Greece pose and the [potential for
**conflict to erupt**]{.underline}. [Turkey repeatedly flies its F-16s
over]{.underline} inhabited [Greek islands,]{.underline} [has launched
a]{.underline} **[baseless campaign]{.underline}** [disputing Greece's
sovereignty]{.underline} in the Aegean Sea, [and]{.underline} President
[Erdogan]{.underline} **[openly threatens]{.underline}** [armed
conflict]{.underline} with Greece [on a]{.underline} **[regular
basis]{.underline}** -- as recently as last month. [Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} **[illustrates]{.underline}** [the consequences
of]{.underline} **[inaction]{.underline}** [in the face of
a]{.underline} **[revisionist power]{.underline}** [intent
on]{.underline} **[rewriting history]{.underline}**, [violating
the]{.underline} **[sovereignty]{.underline}** [of its
neighbor]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [**forcibly changing** borders
through **intimidation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[outright]{.underline}** threats of [war.]{.underline}
[Turkey's]{.underline} **[membership]{.underline}** [in
NATO]{.underline} cannot and [should]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}**
[shield]{.underline} the [Erdogan]{.underline} government [from
being]{.underline} **[held responsible]{.underline}** for its behavior
by US policymakers, and [its increasingly **belligerent
rhetoric**]{.underline} [and behavior]{.underline} [toward
Greece]{.underline} -- [a]{.underline} **[truly reliable]{.underline}**,
[democratic NATO ally]{.underline} -- **[cannot]{.underline}** [be
ignored.]{.underline}

Are you confident that your colleagues in the House will support the
amendments?

I am confident my colleagues will support my amendments. [The US-Greece
relationship]{.underline} **[has exploded]{.underline}** [in recent
years due]{.underline} in large part [to the]{.underline} **[bipartisan
support]{.underline}** [across administrations]{.underline} [and in
Congress for strengthening]{.underline} our bilateral
**[cooperation]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} cooperation [is
founded upon the recognition of Greece]{.underline} [as a]{.underline}
**[reliable, democratic]{.underline}** [NATO ally]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[pillar]{.underline}** [of stability in
the]{.underline} Eastern [Mediterranean]{.underline}.
**[Meanwhile]{.underline}**, [Turkey was warned]{.underline} **[several
times]{.underline}** [of the repercussions]{.underline} of violating
CAATSA and given ample opportunities to pursue alternative options
[and]{.underline} **[still proceeded]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
the purchase and activation of [the S-400 system]{.underline}. Without
any meaningful change on Turkey's part, I don't see any reason for
Congress to back off its opposition to requests from Turkey.

Your amendments also take measures to address Turkey's destabilizing
role inside NATO. How big of a problem has Turkey become as a NATO ally?

[It's]{.underline} **[unfortunate]{.underline}** [to **see the path**
Turkey has taken]{.underline} under Erdogan's government.
**[Time]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[time again]{.underline}**,
President [Erdogan has]{.underline} **[gone out]{.underline}** [of his
way to]{.underline} **[weaken]{.underline}** [NATO solidarity and
security]{.underline}. [Turkey weaponized]{.underline} the flow of
**[Syrian refugees]{.underline}** into Europe [as part of a strategy
to]{.underline} **[blackmail]{.underline}** [its allies]{.underline}.
[Turkey continues to possess the]{.underline} **[S-400]{.underline}**
missile system [despite the]{.underline} **[threat]{.underline}** [it
poses to our]{.underline} [F-35s and NATO's]{.underline} **[security
architecture]{.underline}**. [And Erdogan has]{.underline}
**[unwisely]{.underline}** [chosen to undermine NATO's
unity]{.underline} **[amid its response]{.underline}** [to Russia's
illegal invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} **[by
threatening]{.underline}** [Greece with war]{.underline}. [This
raises]{.underline} **[serious doubts]{.underline}**, especially in
Congress, [over whether]{.underline} [Erdogan]{.underline}
[can]{.underline} **[ever be]{.underline}** [a]{.underline}
**[reliable]{.underline}** [ally]{.underline}.

Finally, [as expected]{.underline}, [Russia is]{.underline}

[Turkey's]{.underline} **[rejection]{.underline}** [of NATO accession
for Sweden and Finland]{.underline}, beyond undercutting NATO's response
to Russia's aggression, [reflects a]{.underline} **[deeper
rift]{.underline}** [between the West and Turkey]{.underline}. [This is
further]{.underline} **[manifest]{.underline}** [by
Ankara's]{.underline} **[recent threat]{.underline}** [to expand
into]{.underline} **[northern Syria]{.underline}** [and its]{.underline}
**[overflights]{.underline}** [of **Greek territory**]{.underline}. For
the sake of the Alliance, immediate responses are vital, but [the
rift]{.underline} **[will worsen]{.underline}** unless Washington and
European capitals work with Ankara to fundamentally shift their
relationship. While such a shift has long been advisable given Turkey's
importance, the existential threat of Russian aggression for both Turkey
and the Alliance make it urgent.

A month ago, Washington hosted Turkish Foreign Minister Melvut Cavusoglu
and signaled a new bilateral strategic dialogue. This included possible
sales of F-16's to Ankara, symbolically ending the bitter dispute over a
Turkish Russian missile purchase, and Washington's subsequent cutting
Turkey from the F-35 program. Turkey was also following analogous
rapprochement with Arab states, Israel, Greece, and Armenia, and now
plays a central role in the Ukrainian conflict providing weapons,
closing the Straits to Russian naval reinforcements and pressing on
various diplomatic exchanges. Then [almost]{.underline}
**[overnight]{.underline}** [Ankara lashed out against Finland and
Sweden,]{.underline} **[threatening to block]{.underline}** [their NATO
accession if they did not cut]{.underline} [real]{.underline} [and
**alleged ties**]{.underline} [to the PKK, and followed up with
the]{.underline} aforementioned [threats]{.underline} **[in
Syria]{.underline}** [and escalation in the Aegean]{.underline}.
Predictably, [American commentators]{.underline} **[reacted
vigorously]{.underline}**, [even suggesting]{.underline} once again [for
Turkey to be **thrown out** of NATO]{.underline}.

Shifting attitudes toward Turkey

[Such]{.underline} **[dramatic flips]{.underline}** [in Turkish
policy]{.underline}, **[gelding]{.underline}** [any predictable
diplomacy]{.underline}, [have become a]{.underline}
**[hallmark]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} both Turkish president
[Erdogan and the]{.underline} **[convoluted]{.underline}** [internal
political system]{.underline} with his party, [dependent on
an]{.underline} **[extremist nationalist]{.underline}**
[partner]{.underline}. [Such flips]{.underline} also [make efforts
to]{.underline} **[resolve issues]{.underline}** [such as those
above]{.underline} ([let alone the]{.underline} **[underlying
rift]{.underline}** [between Ankara and NATO allies]{.underline}),
[a]{.underline} **[high-risk]{.underline}** [endeavor]{.underline}
[which]{.underline} most [Western leaders avoid]{.underline}, [writing
Turkey off as]{.underline} **[a lost cause]{.underline}**. But as
Ukraine has demonstrated, Turkey is vital to containing Russia, as it
has been to NATO's nuclear deterrence, missile defense against Iran,
operations in the Balkans, and Afghanistan. It is just too big, too
important, and at times too problematic to ignore.

Despite the tense nature of bilateral relations that stem from their
centuries-long imperial rivalry and the Islamic revolution---after which
Iran sought to export its revolution to Turkey---[Turkey and
Iran]{.underline} **[have never]{.underline}** [engaged in
a]{.underline} [conventional war since]{.underline} the
[1639]{.underline} Treaty of Zuhab.

On June 27, [Turkish Foreign Minister]{.underline} Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu
**[posed for pictures]{.underline}** [with his Iranian
counterpart]{.underline} Hossein Amir Abdollahian in Ankara as if
nothing had happened the previous week, [which]{.underline}
**[testifies]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline} **[durable
nature]{.underline}** [of relations between the two]{.underline}
countries.

[Iran and Turkey]{.underline} do [share]{.underline}
**[common]{.underline}** [interests]{.underline}. For instance,
[both]{.underline} Ankara and Tehran [struggle against]{.underline}
**[Kurdish separatism]{.underline}** within their borders [and
collaborate against Kurdish independence in northern Iraq]{.underline}.
In addition, [they]{.underline} have **[expressed
solidarity]{.underline}** [on the Iranian **nuclear
program**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the question of
[international]{.underline} **[sanctions]{.underline}**. [Since border
trade with Iran is]{.underline} **[an essential]{.underline}** [source
of income]{.underline}, [Turkey]{.underline}, Brazil and Iran [led an
initiative to prevent sanctions]{.underline} in May 2010. Then, [Turkey
attempted to **store Iranian** low-enriched uranium on Turkish soil in
return for nuclear fuel]{.underline}. However, this initiative was not
embraced by the international community.

In June of that year, [**despite** being a **NATO member**]{.underline},
[Turkey did]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [hesitate to act against
the Western bloc and]{.underline} [**vote against**
sanctions]{.underline} at the U.N. Security Council. Further,
[Turkey]{.underline} **[circumvented]{.underline}** U.N.
[sanctions]{.underline} [by conducting trade with Iran]{.underline}
through its state-owned Halkbank.

**[Today]{.underline}**, [Turkey's position remains]{.underline}
**[essentially unchanged]{.underline}**. During the last
Çavuşoğlu-Abdollahian summit in Ankara on June 27, [Turkey once again
emphasized the need to]{.underline} **[abolish all sorts]{.underline}**
[of sanctions against Iran]{.underline} while calling on the U.S. to
revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement.

[There are]{.underline} **[shocking omissions]{.underline}** [in the
supposedly liberal]{.underline} (?) Washington Post\'s [coverage of
Turkey]{.underline}. "Liberal" ‌in‌ ‌the question‌ ‌mark‌ ‌because‌ genuine
liberals don't cherry-pick.

[Real liberals defend]{.underline} **[democracy]{.underline}**,
**[justice]{.underline}**, [and the]{.underline} [rule of
law]{.underline} **[everywhere]{.underline}** and respect different
opinions and perspectives. [They don\'t]{.underline} **[justify
aggressors]{.underline}** [and human rights violators]{.underline}, [and
they don't]{.underline} **[conceal]{.underline}** [their
transgressions]{.underline}, as The Washington Post does in articles
concerning Turkey.

[Nor do liberals]{.underline} **[remain silent]{.underline}** [or
**neutral** in the face of injustice]{.underline} or wrongdoing. To
quote Desmond Tutu: "If you are neutral in situations of injustice,
you've chosen the side of the oppressors."

One of The Washington Post\'s most recent [articles]{.underline} by Josh
Rogin (June 30) [argue]{.underline}s that [if the United
States]{.underline} **[sucks up]{.underline}** [to Turkey]{.underline},
[the latter could help Ukraine]{.underline} "[win the war]{.underline}."
**[Groveling]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[autocratic]{.underline}** [Turkey is]{.underline}
**[preposterous]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[demeaning]{.underline}** for a superpower, and [it will]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [achieve]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}**
[results]{.underline} [because Ankara]{.underline} **[does not
want]{.underline}** [Russia]{.underline} to be
**[defeated]{.underline}** or weekend. [A]{.underline} **[bleeding
Russia]{.underline}** [would diminish Turkey\'s]{.underline}
**[strategic importance]{.underline}** [to the West and undermine
Turkish]{.underline} trade and economic **[interests]{.underline}**.
[Turkish foreign minister]{.underline} Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu
[was]{.underline} **[fervently critical]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
"some" [NATO countries for seeking to]{.underline} prolong the conflict
to **[weaken Russia]{.underline}**.

[It would be]{.underline} **[hard to believe]{.underline}** [that
Turkey]{.underline}, [which bought S-400s from Russia,
evades]{.underline} **[Western sanctions]{.underline}**, [calls Moscow
a]{.underline} "**[friend]{.underline}**," [and seeks to]{.underline}
**[remain independent]{.underline}** from the West [will
help]{.underline} to [defeat it]{.underline}.

Cynics may even argue that Mr. Rogin's article may be a ploy by The
Washington Post and the State Department to persuade members of Congress
to approve the sale of F-16 air-fighters to Turkey. President Biden
backed the deal after Turkey lifted its objections to allowing Sweden
and Finland into NATO. But **[many lawmakers]{.underline}**, [led
by]{.underline} Bob [Menendez]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
**[influential]{.underline}** [Chair of the Senate\'s Foreign Relations
Committee]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} Carolyn [Maloney]{.underline},
Gus [Bilirakis]{.underline}, Chris [Pappas]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} Frank [Pallone]{.underline}, Jr. in the House,
**[oppose it]{.underline}**. [They are unwilling to ignore]{.underline}
[Turkey's]{.underline} **[human rights]{.underline}** violations,
[hostility towards its]{.underline} **[neighbors]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[blackmail]{.underline}**.

[Ankara\'s]{.underline} **[duplicity]{.underline}** in the war [in
Ukraine and Turkey\'s **insistence**]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
continuing to possess its Russian-built [S-400]{.underline} missile
system also **[troubles many]{.underline}** lawmakers. They prepare for
a fight. Congressman Pallone's letter to President Biden is
self-explanatory.

Others may claim that our military industries are also behind Mr.
Rogin's scheme. The Washington Post\'s independence and self-proclaimed
role as a champion of free press, speech, and democracy are at stake
here.

**[Even]{.underline}** [from a]{.underline} **[realpolitik
perspective]{.underline}**, [it makes]{.underline} **[little
sense]{.underline}**. [Suppose we]{.underline} **[bow to]{.underline}**
and hand over to [Erdoğan]{.underline} F16s, as Mr. Rogin suggested. In
this case, [we will give the Turkish autocrat a]{.underline}
**[significant victory]{.underline}** [that he will take
home]{.underline} [to]{.underline} help **[win the
elections]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [prolong his grab on power
and]{.underline} **[despotic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[anti-Western]{.underline}** [rule]{.underline}.

**[Overrating]{.underline}** [Turkey's strategic value and]{.underline}
**[ignoring]{.underline}** [its aggression]{.underline} and human rights
violations [has been a]{.underline} **[trademark]{.underline}** [of our
foreign policy elites]{.underline} **[for decades]{.underline}**.
[A]{.underline} **[meticulous]{.underline}** [observer]{.underline} of
Turkey\'s foreign policy, **[however]{.underline}**, [would agree that
appeasing and]{.underline} **[pampering]{.underline}** [the Turks
do]{.underline} **[not work]{.underline}** [and only make
them]{.underline} **[more arrogant]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[aggressive]{.underline}**.

[The Turks will]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** use these air
fighters to [defend themselves]{.underline} as American laws require
[or]{.underline} **[fight Russia]{.underline}** [but]{.underline} to
**[harass Greece]{.underline}**, [a]{.underline}
**[staunch]{.underline}** [U.S. ally]{.underline}, [and maintain
their]{.underline} **[occupation]{.underline}** [of northern
Cyprus]{.underline}, [an EU member state. They will]{.underline} **[kill
Kurds]{.underline}**, **[Armenians]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Greeks]{.underline}** [as they did in the past and drop]{.underline}
**[bombs]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} **[innocent]{.underline}**
[Yazidi children and women]{.underline}. However, these issues did not
concern Mr. Rogin.

The Washington Post\'s mournful analysis of the declining status of
democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong and other parts of the world
while remaining silent or [supporting anti-democratic and belligerent
Turkey]{.underline} **[undermines]{.underline}** [its

and]{.underline} [the **rule of law**]{.underline}.

In May, The Washington Post published an article on Turkish women
wearing headscarves. There is no point in publishing an article about
headscarves when [the Turkish regime]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[trampling]{.underline}** [on women's rights]{.underline}, [and Turks
are]{.underline} **[murdering]{.underline}** [Turkish women
in]{.underline} **[epidemic]{.underline}** [proportions]{.underline}.

Dying to Divorce (2021), a British documentary film directed by Chloe
Fairweather portrays the brutal treatment of women in Turkey. President
[Erdoğan tells his audiences]{.underline}, "[You cannot put]{.underline}
[women and men on]{.underline} an **[equal footing]{.underline}**," and
"that's against nature."

If The Washington Post was genuinely liberal, independent and a vanguard
of democracy and the rule of law as it ‌professes to be, it would have
been at the forefront of the fight against arming the Turkish regime.

[Erdoğan has been]{.underline} **[shredding]{.underline}**
[Turkey's]{.underline} **[democratic]{.underline}** [norms, laws, and
institutions]{.underline}. In addition, [he]{.underline}
**[imprisons]{.underline}** [and **mistreats** his political opponents

[is]{.underline} **[among the worst]{.underline}** [jailers of
journalists]{.underline} **[in the world]{.underline}**. Additionally,
[the Turkish ruler has]{.underline} **[significantly
curtailed]{.underline}** [the rights of women]{.underline}. Recently,
[Ankara withdrew from the Istanbul Convention, an international treaty
combating violence against women]{.underline}. Under the AKP, the number
of women murdered by men rose rapidly. Turkish femicide rates are among
the worst. [The regime has]{.underline} also [been]{.underline}
notoriously **[brutal]{.underline}** [toward LGBTQ+
communities]{.underline}.

**[Even worse]{.underline}** [is the way the Turks treat

But now, the war in Ukraine has once again enhanced Turkish power, and
[an]{.underline} **[opportunistic]{.underline}** [Erdoğan seems keen
to]{.underline} **[grab]{.underline}** [what he can]{.underline}.

[In the early phases]{.underline} of the war, [Turkey]{.underline}
[**positioned itself** as a mediator]{.underline} between Moscow and
Kyiv, [and then it capitalized on]{.underline} the NATO membership
applications of [Sweden and Finland to]{.underline} **[extract
benefits]{.underline}**. Now, it can seek advantages from Russia's Black
Sea blockade too: Given its role in the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey
is the go-to-place for any agreement --- whether negotiated with Russia
through the U.N. or unilaterally pursued by a coalition of the willing
--- to get grain out of Ukraine. It also plays a key role in the East
Med gas conundrum, the strategic relevance of which hasincreased as
Europe weans itself off Russian gas.

So, [with elections]{.underline} **[scheduled]{.underline}** for June
2023 [and an economy in trouble,]{.underline} [Erdoğan is]{.underline}
once again **[banking]{.underline}** [on nationalism]{.underline} ---
[stoked by]{.underline} such [foreign policy]{.underline} maneuvers and
**[confrontations]{.underline}** --- to come to his rescue. With
inflation soaring at near 79 percent, the lira continuously sliding, and
Erdoğan unwilling to halt his refusal to increase interest rates,
Turkey's economy is in tatters --- and its prospects are unlikely to
improve in the coming year.

To make matters worse, yet **[another war]{.underline}** [is
on]{.underline} **[the horizon]{.underline}**. [It would]{.underline}
even [be a conflict between]{.underline} two Nato members. I am
referring to [Greece and Turkey]{.underline}, of course. (Or Türkiye, as
the country now wants to be called.)

If there is a traditional arch enmity in international affairs, it is
the one between Athens and Ankara. [Their conflict]{.underline} **[dates
back]{.underline}** [more than]{.underline} **[half a
millennium]{.underline}**, which makes it older than the two modern
states of Greece and Turkey.

The potted history is this: In the 15th century, the Ottoman and
Byzantine empires struggled for dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean.
After the Ottomans captured Constantinople in 1453, the Greeks were
forced into centuries of minority status in the Ottoman Empire.

Even after Greece became independent and recognised by the Ottoman
Empire in 1830, the animosity continued. A hundred years ago, the
Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 ended with a Greek defeat as well as
ethnic cleansing and resettlement on both sides.

After this tumultuous history, it was a small miracle that both
countries formed friendly relations that led them to join Nato in 1952.

However, since the mid-1950s the old animosities returned. First, over
who controls Cyprus, and then increasingly over access to natural
resources in the region. All this always played out against the backdrop
of a long-running cultural rivalry.

The Greek-Turkish conflict is so old it is almost part of European
folklore. Yet the escalation of rhetoric over the past weeks is extreme,
even by its normal standards. The timing was also surprising.

When Putin started his aggression against Ukraine, there was a brief
moment when it looked like both Athens and Ankara had buried the
hatchet. Instead of their usual bickering they may for once stand
together and confront the Russian invasion as Nato members.

But then the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, gave a speech to
both chambers of the US Congress on May 17. It was an address dominated
by foreign policy issues, not least the importance of US military bases
in Greece for supplying Ukraine with weapons.

Mitsotakis, however, did not stop there. Instead, he made Greece's case
for acquiring the F-35 stealth fighter jet from the US -- and against
allowing Turkey to upgrade their F-16 jets with new missiles, radar and
electronics.

In his address, Mitsotakis said: "The last thing that Nato needs at a
time when our focus is on helping Ukraine defeat Russia's aggression is
another source of instability on Nato's South-Eastern flank. And I ask
you take this into account when you make defence procurement decisions
concerning the Eastern Mediterranean."

It did not take long for Ankara to reply. Its president, Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan, tweeted: "We warn Greece once more to avoid dreams, statements
and actions that will lead to regret, as it did a century ago, and to
return to its senses."

The threat of war may not be obvious unless one is familiar with the
history of the conflict. "A century ago" refers to the last
Greco-Turkish war. The "lead to regret" line was a hint that Greece
lost.

In other words, rather than coming closer together in the face of the
Ukraine war, Greece and Turkey are drifting further apart.

This is a nightmare scenario for Nato. It is the opposite of what it
would have hoped for. Turkey and Greece being on the same page would
have contributed to the alliance's collective security in the
Mediterranean.

In the years before the Ukraine war, Russia and China became more active
in the Eastern Mediterranean with economic initiatives. Counteracting
this would have required a new Turkey and Greece to find a way to live
together -- a possibility that now looks less likely.

How will Nato members position themselves in this conflict? **[At the
moment]{.underline}**, [the majority of Nato]{.underline} members
[support Greece]{.underline}. Or perhaps more accurately, [they
are]{.underline} **[against Turkey]{.underline}**.

[Erdoğan has]{.underline} **[irritated]{.underline}** Western
[Europe]{.underline} for many years. The role he played in the various
refugee crises is questionable. His domestic economic policy is a
disaster. [His relationship with Russia has]{.underline} long **[been
ambiguous]{.underline}**.

It is no wonder more Nato members are siding with Greece in this
conflict. [The US has]{.underline} traditionally [been on Greece's
side]{.underline} anyway. Regardless of how other Nato members are
positioned, the most important question is how the Turkish president
will handle this crisis.

It is a challenging situation for Erdoğan. Next year, he will face
presidential elections. The economy of his country is in turmoil, with
an inflation rate of more than 70 percent. Because of Erdoğan's
idiosyncratic understanding of economics and his constant interference
in the Turkish central bank, Turkish price increases are directly linked
to him.

In these circumstances, [it]{.underline} [may be tempting for the
president to]{.underline} **[start a war]{.underline}** against Greece
[to win back]{.underline} **[popular respect]{.underline}**. [A war
would provide a]{.underline} **[distraction]{.underline}** [from
domestic politics and inflation.]{.underline}

Over the past decade, [Turkey has]{.underline}
**[launched]{.underline}** [its defense industry into]{.underline} the
[space]{.underline} domain, in an attempt to match the fast-developing
capabilities of its regional and global counterparts. The oft used term
'space race' does not represent global industrial activities in the
domain, but it does hint at the growing pressure for countries who
previously were not involved in extra-terrestrial activities to catch up
and participate. Turkey's goals include a plan for a hard landing of a
domestically produced rocket on the moon by 2023, with a soft landing
and rover launch by 2028, the construction of a Turkish space port, and
plans to send a Turkish citizen to the ISS.

Madeline Wild, Associate Defense Analyst, comments: "[Turkey's
ambitious]{.underline} aim [to have launched a rocket that can reach the
moon]{.underline} by 2023 [reflects the]{.underline} **[overall
nature]{.underline}** [of its space program]{.underline}.
**[Rather]{.underline}** [than purely being necessitated by]{.underline}
**[the desire]{.underline}** [for sovereign use and control]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[satellites]{.underline}**, [it revolves
around]{.underline} the **[power]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[political superiority]{.underline}** [that **headline grabbing**
achievements]{.underline} (such as reaching the moon) [can
bring]{.underline}. The introduction of [Turkey's space
program]{.underline} in 2021 [came]{.underline} **[shortly
after]{.underline}** [Turkey's longtime rival]{.underline} [the
UAE,]{.underline} [announced]{.underline} that [its space probe had
entered Mars' orbit.]{.underline} President Erdogan's speech in February
2021, launched the Turkish space program and reinforced the geopolitical
importance of the space program, much of which was rhetorically charged
with ideas of domain leadership and the 'space race'.

"Last year NATO made space the fifth domain to be covered by the
collective security principles set out in the organizations charter.
Subsequently it is unsurprising that members such as Turkey are boosting
their space programs, in order to fulfil their commitments in the event
of any potential incident in this domain. This will have been noted by
TUA, [the Turkish Space Agency]{.underline}, but it [will not be the
desire to]{.underline} [uphold NATO's]{.underline} **[collective
security]{.underline}** [principle]{.underline} [driving Turkish space
development.]{.underline} **[Instead]{.underline}**,
[Turkey's]{.underline} **[fractious relationship]{.underline}** [with
certain NATO members will fuel the desire to become a]{.underline}
**[regional leader]{.underline}** in the domain."

Wild continues: "In the Strategic Plan 2019-2023, Turkey set out its
aims to produce and procure 75% of all goods domestically by 2023. In
order to do so whilst still meeting its space related targets, Turkey's
aerospace industry will have to rapidly upskill. Whilst Turkey will
benefit from the fact that its domestic industry (namely state-owned
company Rokestan) has already launched a sounding rocket, much of the
current space activities are reliant on international cooperation. For
example, US-based SpaceX is currently responsible for the launch of
Turkish satellites, Türksat 5A being the most recent of these. Elon Musk
and President Erdogan have had direct communication to discuss future
cooperation and collaboration."

"[Turkey is]{.underline} also **[collaborating]{.underline}** [with
Russia on space-based tech]{.underline}nology, a move which could
heighten already tense relationships between NATO and the Black Sea
state. [Russia will help Turkey construct **two launch
