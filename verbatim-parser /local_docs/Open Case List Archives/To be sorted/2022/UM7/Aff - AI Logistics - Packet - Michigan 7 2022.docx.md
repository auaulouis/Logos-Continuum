Just like with the commercial and public sector, then,
[[tech]{.mark}nological progress [has allowed militaries]{.mark} and
security sector professionals to gather [large amounts of data,]{.mark}
and a number of [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (governments and armed
forces[) [are]{.mark} [**in the process** of constructing]{.mark} and
implementing [governance]{.mark} models [to ensure]{.mark} the benefits
of Big Data in terms of real time intelligence, enhanced
decision-making, situational awareness and **[overall competitive
edge]{.mark}** against increasingly capable opponents. The **synergy
between Big Data**]{.underline}, ML [**and [AI is particularly
important]{.mark} in** this context when it comes [to]{.mark} all
aspects of **[combat readiness]{.mark},** with experts agreeing that
**[AI]{.mark}** and its application in the armed forces [is "**present
in all** ]{.mark}**domains...and all [levels of
warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Svenmarck et al., 2018) [[with]{.mark}
the potential to have [a transformative impact]{.mark} on national
security technology]{.underline} (Allen and Chan, 2017; see also Tonin,
2019). **[[Many]{.mark}, however, [are at an early stage in]{.mark} the
[development of]{.mark} any [BDA strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Thus]{.underline}, the [lessons]{.underline} from other sectors -- and
indeed leading governments and security organizations -- [can provide
guidance on best practice as they move from their 'data' governance
models to 'Big Data' governance frameworks that will give them the
ability to ensure maximum value and advantage is extrapolated from the
BDA life-cycle]{.underline}.

[The **[first]{.mark}**]{.underline} lesson or [best practice relates to
having a clear rationale, goals and guiding principles in place to
ensure effective governance of Big Data in the
organization.]{.underline} This includes strategically assessing the
type of model required, based on current capabilities, resources and
future needs, i.e. decentralized/centralized/hybrid. More importantly,
governments and [security organizations need a clear understanding of
the value of Big Data across different domains (land, sea, air) and
landscapes (human, physical, information) so that high quality, usable,
real-time information can be delivered **through AI**]{.underline} and
ML [at strategic, tactical and operational levels]{.underline}. **[This
is certainly recognized in [the NATO]{.mark} context]{.underline}**,
with a Dutch Position Paper highlighting [that, in terms of Big Data and
[**AI**]{.mark}, "the [focus should be]{.mark} on **[assessing
and...demonstrating]{.mark}** the added [**value**]{.mark} that
innovations can provide to NATO military theatres"]{.underline}
(Smallgange et al., 2018). [This is critical, so that the full
possibilities of influencing the three landscapes]{.underline} --
[through situational awareness and effective command and
control]{.underline} -- [can be developed in a broader way
than]{.underline} that offered by [traditional military
means]{.underline}. This way, there is also a recognition that in order
[[to take full advantage]{.mark} of]{.underline} the data-centric
technologies ([BDA and AI]{.underline}), [[a data-centric methodology is
required, so]{.mark} that [effective support can be offered at different
levels]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Blunt et al., 2018).

In the **[[second]{.underline}]{.mark}** place, related to the first
lesson learned, [in a military and security context where there is often
a unified command in combination with tiered formal hierarchy that tends
towards specialization, there can also be structural inefficiencies in
the flow of information]{.underline}; [operating jointly can thus often
come at a high cost]{.underline} (Zelaya and Keeley, 2020). When
[[consider]{.mark}ing any data-driven methodology, then, much thought
has to be given to the organizational data management life cycle --
including [how to integrate]{.mark} the use of BDA and]{.underline} new
technologies (e.g. **[[AI]{.mark},]{.underline}** ML) [[with]{.mark}
human [decision-making]{.mark}, control and communication of
information]{.underline}. Indeed, it has been argued that [[whilst
BDA]{.underline}]{.mark} and associated technologies [[offer]{.mark}
significant [advances]{.mark}]{.underline} in rapidly collecting,
processing and deciphering complex forms and varieties of data for the
purposes of action, [[the human element is]{.mark} still
[critical]{.mark} in contextualizing any such data and offering insights
on the complexity and "shades of grey" that might be missed by
BDA]{.underline} (Van Puyvelde et al., 2018: 1414; see also Desclaux,
2018: 9). To this end, [thought has already been given to the
implementation of the Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop to
determine the type of decision support required and how [meaningful
human control can be enabled]{.mark}]{.underline}. The OODA perspective
or approach, it is argued, represents "the life cycle from data
acquisition to decision making and also reflects how sophisticated a
technology should be in order to provide value" (Smallgange et al.,
2017: 6). An important element within this loop is giving full
consideration to any legal, ethical and moral questions that arise in
relation to action and particularly the use of lethal autonomous weapon
systems (LAWS).

The **[[third]{.underline}]{.mark}** best practice relates to [buy-in
from the organization as a whole.]{.underline} That [means [not
just]{.mark} having the [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, tools and
mechanisms in place within a data driven environment that ensures access
to and use of Big Data for all team members, [[but]{.mark}
also]{.underline}: a) [Leadership]{.underline} from those at the top
(Commanders) and within the different echelons of command within and
across domains, landscapes and levels through to data engineers,
analysts, assessors, translators -- [and the ability]{.underline} of the
various communities of interest [to use data communicated to them in an
effective way]{.underline}; b) [The creation of an
organizational]{.underline} (big) [data-driven culture and data-centric
paradigm]{.underline} -- [including ensuring that all relevant staff are
data literate, have the requisite **[skills]{.mark}**, **[literacy and
readiness]{.mark}**, and are provided with the education, training and
skills to operate effectively]{.underline}. [To this end, **[NATO
has]{.mark} identified [a key capability gap]{.mark}** [when it comes to
**literacy** and **readiness**]{.mark} and has also recognized that in
terms of **[recruiting AI specialists]{.mark}**, engineers and data
scientists the pool of talent is shallow and it **[can be
difficult]{.mark}** to compete with Big Tech companies]{.underline}.

Here, leading [national governments]{.underline} in developing their Big
Data strategies [have sought to ensure the requisite investment is in
place going forward for developing a]{.underline} (resilient, secure and
trusted) [technology architecture and recruiting the right
talent]{.underline}. They have also, alongside leading security
organizations such as [[**NATO**, recognized]{.mark} that
[partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline} (in particular [[with]{.underline}
[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}) and contracted services, [as well as
in-house expertise]{.underline}, that [[will be needed]{.mark} to
deliver and sustain the necessary skills and understanding for
assessing, interpreting and communicating information in an effective
way]{.underline} (Tonin, 2019; Blunt, 2018; Defence IQ, 2020; Big Data
for Defence, 2019). Finally, [the non-defense commercial/industry sector
will not just be important in terms of the skills and expertise element,
but also for technological adaptation and integration, given that many
innovations stem from commercial companies]{.underline}; the UK
government, for example, has awarded IBM a GBP 3.8 million deal for the
development of an AI-powered military software platform prototype
(Defence IQ, 2020). More broadly, [governments and security sector
organizations will have to overcome certain hurdles]{.underline} --
organizational, cultural, and incentive structures -- [to
ensure]{.underline} that [new technologies are adapted so they can bring
advantages across strategic, tactical and operational
levels]{.underline} (Kostopoulos, 2019: 9) and allow efficient and
effective decision-making when needed.

Conclusions This chapter has highlighted the central ways in which
[commercial organizations have been successful in constructing and
executing a BDA strategy]{.underline}, and discussed the main pitfalls
that organizations should seek to avoid in embarking on any such
strategy. In this context it is clear that there are many lessons to be
learnt and best practices that can be adapted by the security sector in
relation the integration of BDA into existing strategies. Indeed, [a
cursory look]{.underline} at the leading nations [with regards to Big
Data strategies]{.underline} -- and security organizations [such as
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [demonstrate that their **central
[objectives have been developed]{.mark}** (and appropriately adapted)
**[with commercial best practice in mind]{.mark}** in relation to data
management, governance and analytics]{.underline}.

[To this end, there are general principles for success that are
underpinned by a need for a clear rationale, goals and strategy, a
strong leadership, an agile, resilient, secure and adaptable technical
infrastructure, a data-centric approach and methodology, and a data
culture that permeates the whole organization]{.underline}. Of course,
this chapter did not have the space or scope to discuss the micro-level
BDA requirements within the security sector in relation to all
dimensions, and in particular innovative hardware and software
architectures or indeed process techniques and challenges.

What is clear [[going forward]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, is that
[the security sector will face challenges of a technical and
nontechnical nature that [will require **financial investments in AI
systems and human talent**]{.mark}, as well as cooperation [and]{.mark}
**[collaboration with industry]{.mark}** and leadership, [if]{.mark} BDA
[strategies are to deliver]{.mark} the [advantages]{.mark} expected to
those engaged at strategic, tactical [and]{.mark} operational
levels]{.underline}. In this, lead nations and
[organizations]{.underline}, [whilst not starting from scratch, have
clearly started to [negotiate the steep learning curve]{.mark} when it
comes to Big Data and decision-making]{.underline} (Street et al.,
2019). **[[They are at a formative phase of development with regards
to]{.mark} constructing and implementing [strategies]{.mark} and
governance frameworks, and indeed modelling and simulation environments,
tools and techniques to allow them [to derive maximum value from Big
Data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The journey ahead]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, whilst entailing certain risks, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[an opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- if objectives and goals are
clearly defined, strategies grown and adapted according to ever-changing
needs, data and technological environments, and data governance and
management practices enabled by strong leadership are underpinned by a
philosophy of date-centric methodology, technology and clear legal and
ethical code of conduct. **[[Testing (through
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**, simulations, etc.), [failure and the
ability to reflect]{.underline} [[are important components of
evolving]{.underline}]{.mark} and (re)defining [[BDA governance
so]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[real value can be extracted in real
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[with trustworthy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
accurate [[data]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and systems,
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[and skills]{.underline}]{.mark}
required to exploit data all the way through [the decision-making
process [are sustained]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Digital revolution]{.mark} has substantially transformed the world we
live in, [provid]{.mark}ing great [opportunities but]{.mark} also
[mak]{.mark}ing [societies]{.mark} more [vulnerable]{.mark} and
transforming the meaning of state borders.
[Tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[makes]{.mark} external
[interference]{.mark}s [cheaper, faster and
all-encompassing]{.mark}]{.underline}: citizens can potentially become
direct targets of information warfare, all members of a society can be
part of conflicts one way or another. [From advanced weaponry to command
and control, most security-related domains are undergoing deep
transformations as data availability and transmission increase
exponentially]{.underline}. This is [especially]{.underline} true
[as]{.underline} the emergence of so-called **[[hybrid
tactics]{.underline}]{.mark}** contributes to [[universalize the
battlefield]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, **[[attackers may lose control
of]{.mark} their offensive [cyber weapons, and 'collateral
damages']{.mark} across the private sector and the public [worldwide
might be]{.mark} more and more [difficult to
contain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Less visible, yet important challenges
connected with Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) also exist.
For instance, [[data]{.mark} [overload can create problems for
decisionmakers]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [unable to detect important
signals]{.underline}. Losing sight of how machines make their
calculations -- a somewhat inherent feature of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) -- can hinder deeper understanding of phenomena as well as
learning, besides having dense ethical implications.

[[A crucial question]{.underline}]{.mark} for Western societies and
governments [[is how to]{.mark} deal with technological changes by
**[exploit]{.mark}ing** their many **[benefits]{.mark}** [while
**managing**]{.mark} to limit their **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Broadly speaking, observers have long noticed the potentialities of
technologies in the security domain: [better **[situational
awareness]{.mark}**, [early warning]{.mark} against threats and risks,
[the ability to]{.mark} prevent and/or [stop attacks]{.mark} to happen,
the [use of tech]{.mark}nology [against]{.mark} the
[adversaries']{.mark} own technologies, [and]{.mark} eventually
**[deterrence of]{.mark}** high-end **[hybrid warfare]{.mark}** or, at
least, the increase of resilience against it.]{.underline} In
particular, in order [to harness the potential of new technologies,
higher levels of security are needed.]{.underline} While internet is
unfortunately not secure by design, it has to be somehow retrofit to
guarantee a certain level of protection -- for instance by avoiding a
single point of failure, developing better firewalls, etc. Ultimately,
[[the digital revolution poses challenges]{.mark} to decision makers
both as potential users of new technologies and as leaders of targeted
societies. [Learning to achieve]{.mark} political [aims]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the support of [tech]{.mark}nological innovations [and
at the same time]{.mark} acquiring the ability to [prevent]{.mark} and
manage interferences, if not [attacks]{.mark}, [have become
paramount]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, [achieving such [results is not only]{.mark} about
[engineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Tech]{.mark}nologies
[need]{.mark} ad hoc [governance, organizations and skilled
users]{.mark} to properly function]{.underline}**. Actually, [history is
full of examples of good technologies that were improperly used and/or
unable to provide the expected gains]{.underline}. Therefore, a [[joint,
multi-disciplinary effort]{.mark}s [is needed]{.mark} to think and
manage technologies in a more comprehensive and secure way across
various domains]{.underline}. For instance, the very same design of
**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** needs exchanges with social scientists in
order to limit analytical biases and increase the quality of data that
will then be processed through Machine Learning (ML). Moreover, many
public policies involve technologies with a strong security dimension.
This is one of the main reasons [**[security standards should be
harmonized across]{.mark}** individual government's policies as well as
among **[Allies]{.mark}**:]{.underline} [this is what has been leading
NATO's renewed efforts on standardization beyond the strictly military
perimeter, for instance towards the 5G domain.]{.underline}

[While digital technologies]{.underline} continue to [dramatically
increase in scope and relevance, [they are **deeply embedded
in**]{.mark}**to [the broader geopolitical
framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[with the re-emergence of
multipolarism and looming great power
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This connection has to be
discussed and understood as it affects not only security but also
economic and technological domains. The globalized supply chain of
technology building block entails vulnerabilities and dependencies on
unreliable suppliers. Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) in hightech
companies, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and critical
infrastructures are guided not only by an economic rationale but also by
a politico-military one, and have to be monitored accordingly. [Cyber
space]{.underline} and, partly, outer space [are de facto unregulated
global commons where the ability to set regulations and [standards could
be a matter of competition and/or cooperation]{.mark} among major
countries worldwide]{.underline}. [The notions of 'whole-of-government'
and 'whole-of-society' approaches confirm that [these]{.mark} problems
[should be dealt with comprehensive strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Great and middle powers]{.underline} increasingly [rely on [stand-off
weapons]{.mark}, both physical and cyber ones,]{.underline} able [[to
create damages rapidly, worldwide and on a large
scale]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[This]{.underline}** trend **[[is going to
be]{.mark} [accelerated by AI.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[Some countries
are adopting principles]{.mark} on responsible use of AI]{.underline},
including in terms of control and accountability. **[[However, a vacuum
remains in international law]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And **[[such vacuum
is]{.mark} more [difficult to fill because of]{.mark} the aforementioned
[interaction between geopolitics and
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. **[[Different powers conceive
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** -- and what it can bring them in terms
of benefits -- **[[in different ways, and]{.mark} they [are unwilling to
regulate internationally this field of competition and
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[In such a rapidly changing security environment,
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and allied [[activities directly]{.mark}
or indirectly [defend]{.mark} citizens' daily life]{.underline}.
[[In]{.underline} [the age of]{.underline}]{.mark} [Big Data,
[AI]{.mark} and the **pervasive use of [internet]{.mark}**, the
challenge is to defend the ever-expanding information environment while
**maintaining** all its **[functionalities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Against this backdrop]{.underline}, in the post-Cold War period
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} somehow [[missed the opportunity]{.mark} to
involve Allies and partners [in]{.mark} a debate on how defense
technologies and [norms]{.mark} have been changing [with]{.mark} the
[ICT]{.mark} revolution]{.underline}. [[The result is]{.mark} that [the
web is not secure]{.mark} by design, [and]{.mark} both private and
public [actors struggle to mitigate risks]{.mark} and threats in an
unregulated environment where attackers are structurally advantaged over
defenders]{.underline}. **[Today, [the Alliance should not miss the
opportunity twice vis-à-vis]{.mark} Big Data, [AI]{.mark}
and,]{.underline}** broadly speaking, **[the current and future
(r)evolution of ICT]{.underline}**. The aim of the 2020 Academic
Conference was precisely to explore some fundamental aspects of the
challenges and opportunities posed by technological change to the
security environment in which NATO works. Below follows a brief
introduction to NATO, cyber defense and three sets of issues
investigated in closer detail: Big Data and decision-making; hybrid
threats to allied decision-making; AI adoption by allied armed forces.

[[NATO]{.mark}, Cyber Defense]{.underline} and Emerging Disruptive
Technologies NATO begun to focus on cyber defense already in 2008, and
over time it [[built up institutions]{.mark} and frameworks [to deal
with it from a well-limited military perspective]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Allies recognized a cyber attack could lead to]{.underline} the
activation of [Article 5]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty on
collective defense. [In that case, there is a clear procedure where NATO
authorities take the military lead. Article 5 does not prescribe a clear
procedure factoring in new technologies]{.underline}. On a regular
basis, headquarters and the Secretary General cabinet carry on
[exercises on situational awareness]{.underline}, whereby they [receive
intelligence and military advice and are immersed in an information
space with blue and red teams]{.underline}. Moreover, [every two years,
there is a large-scale exercise involving national governments.
These]{.underline} efforts aim to [build familiarity with]{.underline}
the [technology-related security challenges]{.underline}.
**[[However,]{.mark} further [evolution of AI-based cyber
attacks]{.mark} can [constitute an increasing threat for datareliant
organizations such as NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[[Beyond cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} defense, [[the Alliance started to
work on]{.underline}]{.mark} the broader issue of [[Emerging]{.mark}
Disruptive [Tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} (EDTs) [[only in
2019]{.underline}]{.mark}, by setting up an innovation board co-chaired
by the Deputy Secretary General and the Supreme Allied Commander
Transformation. Moreover, a dedicated unit was created in the Emerging
Security Challenge Division. Two [[White Papers were
produced]{.mark},]{.underline} respectively [[on AI]{.underline}]{.mark}
and on autonomous weapons, **[[to provide inputs for Allies' decisions
in this regard]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The current NATO approach is
based on the motto "adopting and adapting", entailing five complimentary
goals: (1) better understand emerging disruptive technologies; (2)
properly look at their implications for defense; (3) decide about their
use; (4) mitigate their risks; and (5) exploit their advantages.

Noticeably, [the traditional defense industrial ecosystem entails long
planning, oligopolistic supply and monopsonic demand.]{.underline} Over
time, it was [characterized by substantial technology transfers from the
military to the civilian domain]{.underline} (the so-called '[spin
offs']{.underline}), [including the]{.underline} very same embryonic
[Internet]{.underline}. In recent years, several [new technologies with
relevant implications for security and defense have been emerging from a
different ecosystem, marked by bottom-up innovation, a rapid
development-to-market cycle, and a technology transfer from the civilian
to the military domain]{.underline}. As a result, with the relevant
exception of certain space assets and hypersonic technologies, [the
civilian sector is increasingly developing into the innovation driver,
and defense]{.underline} one [has become]{.underline} quite
[dependent]{.underline}. [Such a shift implies that priority setting for
current and future technology development is not]{.underline}
substantially [driven by states]{.underline} anymore. In the US, the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) struggles
to develop a dialogue with the private sector gravitating around the
Silicon Valley to embrace certain research lines. The NATO Industry
Partnership on the cyber domain serves as platform for Alliance's
officials and industrial representatives to exchange notes, yet major
ICT players do not seem very interested in having such a structured
dialogue. Moreover, investments in these technologies require venture
capitals and the acceptance of the risks to fail -- something which
usually states, and particularly Ministries of Defense, cannot afford.
The US, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and other Allies made
certain steps to adapt their defense innovation models in these domains,
but this is only the beginning of a long transformation process.

As a matter of fact, [[adapting to emerging]{.mark} and disruptive
[tech]{.mark}nologies [is harder for some Allies]{.mark} than
others.]{.underline} [**[The]{.mark} related [risk is moving towards a
multi-layer Alliance]{.mark}**, [with some]{.mark} member [states
holding]{.mark} new [tech]{.mark}nologies, [and others not having such
advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**[Ideally, the solution would be to
collectively adopt certain new technologies]{.mark}**, but this
represents a challenge for the NATO Defence Planning Process, military
procurement, common funding, etc]{.underline}. A technology group of
experts has been appointed to reflect upon issues including but not
limited to these, and the Secretary General will probably present a
report to the next summit of Heads of state and governments.

Putting together the five characteristics of hybrid threats (use of
multiple synchronized tools, ability to create ambiguity and to hide
true intentions, deliberate threshold manipulation, exploitation of the
seams of democratic societies, and use of decoys); the SEES model
(situational awareness, explaining, estimating, and strategic notice);
and the new challenges of today's information environment (speed,
volume, AI, and degrading expertise), they result in a mix that can
influence decision-making algorithms and, in Omand's words, "it is our
own demons that are most likely to mislead us" (2020).

Since [[hybrid threats]{.mark} are designed to [interrupt
effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} of the SEES model at some point,
[[by]{.mark} trying to create [cognitive errors such as]{.mark} those
arising from [group think]{.mark}ing, 2 [mirror imaging or]{.mark}
applying [unconscious confirmation bias]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} can
[challenge]{.mark} organizations like]{.underline} the European Union
(EU) and [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} even more than a state. **[[The
multilateral setting]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [with several, connected
national interests]{.underline} -- **[[can be more vulnerable to hybrid
threat activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The things that can go wrong
in the SEES model are especially vulnerable in a multilateral setting,
unless there is a comprehensive approach, willingness to exchange
information, joint understanding on resilience, and mechanisms to
counter and respond in place.

The way Moscow and Beijing think about interference and influence is
different from countries with a democratic system.
[[For]{.underline}]{.mark} the EU and [[NATO]{.mark}, both [Russia and
China are difficult]{.mark} states to deal with.]{.underline} [China is
seen in the EU as a global partner, competitor and systemic
rival]{.underline}. [It has not been on NATO's radar before the 2019
London Summit, but the Report "[NATO 2030]{.mark}" delivered by the
Group of Expert appointed by the Alliance's Secretary General
[states]{.mark} that "[NATO must devote]{.mark} much more time,
political [resources]{.mark} and action [to]{.mark} the [security
challenges posed by China]{.mark}"]{.underline} (2020: 12). [Russia has
been viewed by the West as a systemic rival for much
longer,]{.underline} but it has also been considered part of the
European cultural heritage in the EU. [[For NATO, Russia has]{.mark}
been the greatest military power in the East, which has [conflicts of
interest]{.mark} with NATO.]{.underline} [[For the moment, open military
conflict is not viewed as]{.mark} very [likely]{.mark} neither [for
Moscow nor for Beijing, although]{.mark} it is [not
excluded]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This leaves the door open to hybrid
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}[, a mechanism that has roots in
authoritarian strategic culture but also has national
specificities]{.underline}. The things that can go wrong in the SEES
model are challenged by the new information environment being
manipulated according to the tactics of hybrid threats. Even if the EU
is not a military alliance, while NATO is, both organizations are
challenged in similar ways by hybrid threats. [Given]{.underline}
several factors, including [overlapping membership]{.underline}, it is
clear that [weakening one will also weaken the other]{.underline}.
[Therefore, in the landscape of hybrid threats, the EU and NATO are
considered as a united target by hostile actors -- and they can also
best counter and respond to these threats if working
together]{.underline}.

[Against this backdrop, here follow some recommendations aimed to
policy-makers and expert communities [in]{.mark}]{.underline} both
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and EU countries: • [[The importance of
analysis is growing]{.mark}. [Too much effort has been]{.mark} put into
[collecting data, and not enough]{.mark} into **[training]{.mark}**
analysts. Older analysts need to be trained about the new information
environment and its functioning. In turn, the younger generation needs
to be trained on history, context and connections.]{.underline} [Central
elements in training are understanding the psychology of the adversary,
the assessments of motivations, and rationales]{.underline}.

The cultural context of information is lost in the volume of
information. **[[International cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially **[[on the part of]{.mark} an alliance like [NATO, needs to
be lifted]{.mark} to a new level.]{.underline}** This does [not
only]{.underline} concern [joint situational awareness about hostile
actors, but also]{.underline} involves [[understanding partners and
their perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Without that]{.mark} mutual
understanding among allies and partners, [divergences can become]{.mark}
over [politicized and decision-making]{.mark} paralyzed, which is what
the actors behind hybrid threats want.]{.underline}

**[[There is a need for more]{.mark} effective [training]{.mark} in the
use of open-source intelligence,]{.underline}** focusing on the sources
and tools for finding information, including the biases they may have.
In addition, [more knowledge is needed to be able to detect linkages
between actions]{.underline}. [Hybrid threat activities start in a
settled way, often on a very legal basis, and the potential for such
activities to turn into hostile acts needs to be
recognized]{.underline}.

Military communities should reach out more often to non-military expert
communities. To counter hybrid threats, [a multidisciplinary approach
needs to be taken, which really means combining different disciplinary
fields and expertise coming from practitioners, academics and the
private sector]{.underline}.

[Sharing the vocabulary is important when building situational
awareness. Civil-military cooperation is needed here. The civilian side
uses different words than the military and sometimes, even if the
understanding of a concept would be shared, actors do not understand due
to the use of different terms, and discussions can turn into an
unnecessary battle of words.]{.underline}

[[Hybrid Threats to Allies' Decision-Making]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Hybrid threats is a broad category encompassing a variety of actors,
actions and targets]{.underline}. As for actors, [due to their actual
capabilities, intentions and recent track records, China and Russia can
be identified as the most gathering threats]{.underline}.

Concerning actions, [**[info]{.mark}**rmation [**is key**]{.mark} under
several respects]{.underline}. [[It refers to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Big
Data and AI]{.underline}]{.mark} taken [together]{.underline}, as the
latter [entails the use of [algorithms]{.mark} to [learn from the
former]{.mark} with a view [to exploit]{.mark} the target's
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Digital connections]{.mark} are
the underlying infrastructure used to perpetrate hybrid threats in the
information domain]{.underline}. [Western societies rely on virtual
world platforms that [can be targeted]{.mark} by potential attackers.
Since global networks defy borders and limit state jurisdiction, [they
are hard]{.mark}er [to defend and]{.mark} allow potential attackers to
act [below the threshold of]{.mark} detection and
[attribution]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Hybrid threats also benefit from the
unprecedent [speed and scope of information]{.mark}. This is not new in
principle, but it **[has reached game-changing
levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} On the one hand, [[managing this
massive flow of information is]{.mark} just **[prohibitive]{.mark}**
[for NATO]{.mark} and its member states; [on the other hand]{.mark},
[high speed of circulation translates into increased]{.mark}
[operational tempo]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark} may [take aim at a variety of
targets, yet particularly concerning are **offensive actions that**
might **[lead to]{.mark} societal [polarization, elite disagreement and
biased perceptions of foreign actors.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[These]{.mark} actions]{.underline} have the potential to [[affect
decision-making]{.mark} at different levels, even **[undermining
democratic]{.mark} states' [institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Accordingly, these hybrid threats could undermine decision-making
process of Allies -- and by reflex, [NATO]{.mark}'s too]{.underline}.
[[Decision makers face]{.mark} in particular [three]{.mark} main set of
[problems]{.mark} when crafting a response to hybrid
threats]{.underline}.

1\) **[[How to respond in non-escalatory ways]{.underline}]{.mark}**?
[Since [hybrid attacks]{.mark} exploit the grey zone to create
ambiguity, including by manipulating the threshold of detection and
granting plausible deniability, decision makers are faced with the
[risk]{.mark} of **[overreaction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

2\) **[[How to respond in democratic ways]{.underline}]{.mark}**?
[Potential [attackers]{.mark} may severely [impair the decision-making
process]{.mark} of democratic systems, [putting under stress]{.mark},
for example, **[the constraint to abide by domestic and international
law]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

3\) [How to get public support? Since hybrid threats are usually covered
or difficult to attribute, policy makers also have to persuade the
public opinion of the very same existence of the threat]{.underline}.

#### Maintaining the lead in military AI strategy is key to preserving the balance of power, preventing runaway great power competition, and deterring Russian and Chinese attacks that escalate to nuclear Armageddon\-\--creates space for political bargaining and diplomatic negotiations

cause nuclear war?" November 12.
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war>
//pipk

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason why [[new tech]{.mark}nology [might cause nuclear
conflict: by upending the existing balance of power]{.mark} among
nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} latter concern
[is]{.mark} more [probable]{.mark} and [dangerous and demands an
immediate policy response]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[For more than 70 years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and
many attribute this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In]{.underline}
situations of mutually assured destruction ([MAD), neither side has an
incentive to start a conflict because doing so will only result in its
own annihilation]{.underline}. [[The key to]{.mark} this model of
[deterrence is]{.mark} the maintenance of secure [second-strike
capabilities---]{.mark}the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and
respond with a devastating counterattack]{.underline}.

Recently analysts have begun to worry, however, that [[new strategic
military tech]{.mark}nologies [may make it possible]{.mark} for a state
[to]{.mark} conduct a successful [first strike]{.mark} on an
enemy]{.underline}. For example, Chinese colleagues have complained to
me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide to launch a
sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command and control,
essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will
follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic
missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese
forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop up China's
ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be
disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf,
untouched.

If the United States, or any other state acquires such a first-strike
capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined. Washington may be
tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may choose instead to
use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before they can be wiped
out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.

According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities.

This way of thinking about new technology and stability, however, is
open to question. Would any US president truly decide to launch a
massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear attack because he or she thought
s/he could get away with it? And why does it make sense for the country
in the inferior position, in this case China, to intentionally start a
nuclear war that it will almost certainly lose? More important, this
conceptualization of how new technology affects stability is too narrow,
focused exclusively on how new military technologies might be used
against nuclear forces directly.

Rather, [we should think more broadly about how new technology might
affect global politics]{.underline}, and, for this, it is helpful to
turn to scholarly international relations theory. [[The dominant]{.mark}
theory of the [cause]{.mark}s [of war]{.mark} in the academy [is the
"bargaining model]{.mark} of war]{.underline}." **[[This]{.mark} theory
[identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a primary cause of
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[International politics often presents states with conflicts that they
can settle through peaceful bargaining, but [when bargaining
breaks]{.mark} down, [war results]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Shifts in
the balance of power]{.mark} are problematic because they [undermine
effective bargaining]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [After all, [why
agree]{.mark} to a deal [today if your]{.mark} bargaining position will
be [stronger tomorrow]{.mark}]{.underline}? And, a clear understanding
of the **[[military balance of power can contribute to
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?)
But [[shifts in]{.mark} the balance of [power muddy understandings of
which states have the advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}.

You may see where this is going. **[[New tech]{.mark}nologies
[threaten]{.mark} to create potentially [destabilizing shifts]{.mark} in
the balance of power]{.underline}**.

For decades, [[stability in Europe and Asia has been supported by US
military power]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In recent years, however, the
balance of power in Asia has begun to shift, [as China]{.mark} has
[increased]{.mark} its military [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Already, [Beijing has become more assertive]{.mark} in the region,
claiming contested territory in the South China Sea. And the results of
[Russia's military modernization have been on full display in]{.mark}
its ongoing intervention in [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Moreover, [China may have the lead over the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [in]{.mark} emerging technologies that could be
decisive for the future of military acquisitions and warfare,
including]{.underline} 3D printing, hypersonic missiles, quantum
computing, 5G wireless connectivity, and [artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (**[[AI]{.mark}).]{.underline}** And Russian
President Vladimir [[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark} building new unmanned
vehicles while ominously [[declaring, **"Whoever leads in AI will rule
the world**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

**[[If China or Russia]{.mark} are able to [incorporate]{.mark} new
[tech]{.mark}nologies [into their militaries before the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, then [this could lead to the]{.mark}
kind of [rapid shift in]{.mark} the [balance]{.mark} of power
[that]{.mark} often [causes war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[If Beijing **believes**]{.mark} emerging [tech]{.mark}nologies
[provide]{.mark} it with a newfound, local military [advantage]{.mark}
over the United States, for example, [it may]{.mark} be more willing
than previously to **[initiate conflict]{.mark} over
Taiwan**.]{.underline} [And [if Putin]{.mark} thinks new [tech]{.mark}
has [strengthened his hand, he may]{.mark} be more tempted to
[launch]{.mark} a Ukraine-style [invasion of a NATO
member]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Either]{.mark} scenario could bring these nuclear powers into direct
conflict with the United States, and once nuclear armed states are at
war, there is an inherent [risk]{.mark} of [nuclear conflict]{.mark}
through limited nuclear war strategies, nuclear brinkmanship, or simple
accident or inadvertent escalation]{.underline}.

This framing of the problem leads to a different set of policy
implications. The concern is not simply technologies that threaten to
undermine nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather, any
technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the broader
balance of power. And [[the solution is]{.underline}]{.mark} not to
preserve second-strike capabilities, but [[to preserve prevailing power
balances]{.mark} more broadly.]{.underline}

When it comes to new technology, **[[this means]{.mark} that the United
States should seek to [maintain an innovation
edge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Washington should also work with other
states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new set of arms
control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls to deny
these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to potentially
hostile states.

These are no easy tasks, but **[[the consequences of]{.mark} Washington
[losing]{.mark} the race for [tech]{.mark}nological [superiority]{.mark}
to its autocratic challengers just [might mean nuclear
Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

\"Geostrategic Competition and Climate Change: Avoiding the
Unmanageable\" September 15.
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/geostrategic-competition-and-climate-change-avoiding-unmanageable>
//pipk

[[Humanity faces two]{.underline}]{.mark} [catastrophic, indeed
**[existential,
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---**[climate]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[change [and nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These risks
play out before us as if on split screen. On one side are the
here-and-now impacts of climate change: wildfires from Siberia to
California to southern Europe, scorching "heat domes" over the Pacific
Northwest, and "once in a thousand years" flooding in China. On the
other, [heightened [geostrategic competition carry]{.mark}ing the
[great]{.mark}est [risk of war between nuclear powers]{.mark} since the
depths of the Cold War]{.underline}: in the month of April 2021 alone,
[a [Russian]{.mark} troop surge on the Ukraine border]{.underline}
triggered an "imminent crisis" alert in NATO while [[Chinese]{.mark}
naval vessels and bombers conducted a largescale war-game encircling
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Though ostensibly discrete, the [events]{.mark}
playing out on the split screen [are linked]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[This]{.mark} new [nexus between geostrategic competition and climate
change must be]{.mark} understood and integrated in policy if the twin
threats are to be [averted]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In his landmark book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded, New York Times columnist
Thomas L. Friedman stated that the central challenge of climate change
to humanity is now "to manage what is already unavoidable and avoid what
will truly be unmanageable." To that compelling formulation can be added
a corollary reflecting the new nexus: **[[avoiding unconstrained
geostrategic competition is a prerequisite for]{.mark} managing [the
climate]{.mark} threat.]{.underline}**

[[The window for humanity]{.mark} to avoid unmanageable climate change
[is narrowing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United Nations'
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that global
temperatures will inexorably rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels by mid-century because of the projected level of
atmospheric carbon. The IPCC starkly warns that the [[dire
consequences]{.mark} arising from a temperature increase beyond that
point [can only be averted through]{.mark} prompt concerted global
action to bend the curve and sharply reduce atmospheric
carbon]{.underline}. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the
report a "code red for humanity." [[China, the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [and Russia]{.mark}
are]{.underline}, respectively, [the first, second, and fourth largest
carbon emitters.]{.underline}

Yet **[[at the precise historical juncture when unprecedented global
cooperation is necessary to forestall catastrophe, the world is on the
brink of unconstrained geostrategic competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Indeed[, [U.S. relations with Russia and China]{.underline} ]{.mark}[are
the worst they have been since the end of the Cold War, with a recent
Department of Defense policy document [warn]{.mark}ing [of an "increased
potential for regional conflicts involving]{.mark} nuclear-armed
adversaries ... and the potential for adversarial [nuclear
escalation]{.mark} in crisis or conflict]{.underline}.\"

One could logically argue against a linkage---that if the great powers
have a mutual interest in averting a climate catastrophe then
cooperation in that area could be compartmentalized from geostrategic
tensions. But [the onset of [unconstrained geostrategic competition
negates]{.mark} the possibility of
[compartmentalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrasting positions on the
nexus---the linkage between geopolitical competition and climate
change---were evident in an exchange between Chinese Foreign Minister,
Wang Yi and former Secretary of State John Kerry, now the Biden
administration's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate during his visit
to China in August 2021. [Wang warned that cooperation on climate change
"cannot possibly be divorced" from other geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}, while Kerry countered that climate change is
neither "a geostrategic weapon" nor "ideological"....but "a global, not
bilateral, challenge."

These contending perspectives divide along political theorist Arnold
Wolfers's classic dichotomy between "possession goals" and "milieu
goals." Possession goals relate to the preservation or enhancement of a
state's narrow national interest---for example, in relation to territory
or trade relations. In contrast, milieu goals pursued by a state aim to
shape and improve the international political environment beyond
parochial national interest---which in this context relate to the
fostering of favorable conditions for concerted action on climate
change.

Applying this framework, the Chinese Foreign Minister's comment suggests
that climate change is viewed within the context of furthering
conventional Chinese possession goals---that cooperation on climate
change can be leveraged to gain advantage on another issue (such as
Taiwan). Kerry's rejection frames climate change as a milieu goal whose
existential stakes transcend any one state's national interests. Through
Kerry, the Biden administration has signaled its aspiration to eschew
efforts by other states to relegate climate change to just another issue
in transactional diplomacy.

Yet on a macro level---elevating climate change to a milieu
goal---**[the [linkage between geostrategic competition and climate
change is unavoidable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Even if]{.mark}
unconstrained geostrategic [competition does not]{.mark} lead to
conflict that might itself [trigger catastrophic global
destruction]{.mark}, [virulent relations]{.mark} between the United
States and its great-power adversaries [create a political environment
in which close cooperation on climate change becomes]{.mark} difficult,
if not [impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For that reason the
**[avoidance of unconstrained geostrategic competition is a prerequisite
for]{.mark}** addressing **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be
sure, [[avoidance does not mean]{.mark} the [**elimination of**]{.mark}
geostrategic [**competition**, but rather]{.mark}, bounding it to
**[mitigate the risks of conflict through effective
management.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Avoiding Unconstrained Competition

[New **[risk factors have brought the great powers to the verge of
unconstrained geostrategic competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An
understanding of those risks provides insight into how they can be
mitigated and thereby managed.

A New Calculus of Risk

[Contemporary geopolitics is driven not by Cold War ideology, but by
nationalism and expansive assertions of state sovereignty. Nuclear
powers are engaged in strategic competition with the United States over
the territorial status quo in areas of vital interest---for China,
Taiwan and the South China Sea; for Russia, Ukraine and the periphery of
the former Soviet Union]{.underline}. This contrasts with the Cold War
era in which the superpowers engaged in competition in the regions of
what was then called the Third World, which were clearly of peripheral
interest. [[This]{.mark} geostrategic competition [runs the risk of war
through inadvertent escalation driven by miscalc]{.mark}ulation and
misperception]{.underline}.

[The territorial dimension, which could be the occasion for great-power
conflict, is compounded by key developments affecting the nuclear
deterrent relationship between the United States and its great-power
adversaries.]{.underline} All the nuclear-weapon states have embarked on
ambitious force modernization programs, and they are developing
capabilities, such as low-yield nuclear weapons, which critics warn make
them more usable in a crisis. The Trump administration's Nuclear Posture
Review claimed that the Russians had adopted an "escalate to deescalate
posture" involving the first use of tactical nuclear weapons. Moreover,
military escalation has traditionally been conceived as progressing from
conventional to nuclear forces. [With the advent of [new
tech]{.mark}nologies, however, escalation during a crisis would most
likely occur in a non-traditional domain]{.underline}---cyber or space.
[Conflict escalation could plausibly take the form of a cyberattack to
interfere with an adversary's communications with its nuclear systems or
an attack on reconnaissance satellites to blind an
adversary]{.underline}. [These [developments could have the
destabilizing consequence of creating an incentive for]{.mark} one side
or the other to take [preemptive action]{.mark} during a
crisis.]{.underline}

Managed Competition

The [[contemporary]{.underline}]{.mark} pursuit of [[strategic stability
is conditioned by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [recasting]{.underline} of
the traditional [tension between]{.underline} two Cold War dynamics. The
[first]{.underline} is the so-called "[stability-instability
paradox,"]{.underline} which captures the dynamic in which a nuclear
stalemate between adversaries may embolden lower-level aggression on the
regional level. The second is what Cold War strategist Albert
Wohlstetter described as the "delicate balance of terror" which
emphasized [the maintenance of a **[stable and robust
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [thereby [removing any
incentive]{.mark} for one power or another [to strike first]{.mark} in a
crisis]{.underline}.

As during the Cold War, **[this [tension can be managed, but]{.mark} it
can[not]{.mark} be [resolved]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Key
elements]{.underline}---some aspirational, others operational, many
surrounded by uncertainty---[will affect the prospects for successful
management]{.underline}:

Resolve/Manage regional flashpoints---The best way to avoid conflict
among nuclear-weapon states is to redouble diplomatic efforts to address
the territorial disputes that could precipitate it. To be sure, if these
territorial issues were easy to resolve, they would have been. In some
instances, domestic politics in one or both parties may be an impediment
to resolution; in others, the discrete territorial issue may be a proxy
for a more deeply rooted source of enmity or grievance. If resolution is
not possible, conflict management may be. For example, the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), to which both China and the United
States are signatories, may be a mechanism for managing maritime
tensions between their navies.

Maintain the residual arms control architecture---The new START treaty
has been extended until 2026 and provides certainty and time for Russia
and the United States to agree on a successor arrangement and
outstanding issues (such as non-strategic nuclear weapons and engaging
or taking Chinese capabilities into account).

Do not blur conventional and nuclear operations to prevent inadvertent
escalation---Placing conventional warheads on ballistic missiles, such
as that envisioned through the "Conventional Prompt Global Strike," has
utility (the ability to reach any target on the globe in under one
hour), but runs the risk that Russia may perceive (and respond to) the
launch of a ballistic missile that it associates with U.S. nuclear
capabilities as the initiation of such an attack. Another potential
driver of inadvertent escalation, with implications for both Russia and
China, is the targeting of an adversary's conventional capabilities that
are co-located with its nuclear capabilities.

Mitigate risks through strategic dialogue---In the absence of an arms
control architecture, each nuclear power in the multipolar system will
have strategic autonomy to structure its offensive and defensive
systems. All of the nuclear-weapon states have long been uncomfortably
ambivalent with vulnerability captured in the acronym MAD---mutual
assured destruction. But since the Cuban missile crisis, assured
retaliation---eliminating incentives for a surprise first strike---has
been the sine qua non of strategic stability. The risk now is that an
unconstrained arms race (unregulated numbers of offensive and defensive
systems, in tandem with new weapons technologies and cross-domain
threats to space and cyber assets) could revive those incentives and
undermine the deterrent relationships. In the past, arms control
negotiations provided a forum for strategic discourse. "On a bilateral
or a multilateral basis," scholars Christopher Chyba and Robert Legvold
argue, "the United States, Russia, and China should pursue discussions
intended to improve understanding of one another's strategic concerns
and views on which actions by an adversary would be especially
concerning or dangerous." The focus should be on negotiated restraints
(e.g., a ban on the deployment of anti-satellite weapons) to enhance
stability and reduce incentives for one side or the other to act
preemptively during a crisis.

Managing the Geopolitics of Climate Change

When George Kennan, the diplomatic architect of U.S. containment policy,
declared the end of the Cold War, he explained that the Soviet Union
under Mikhail Gorbachev had evolved from a revolutionary state into an
orthodox great power---the country "should now be regarded essentially
as another great power, like other great powers." Kennan was essentially
arguing that Russia's post-Soviet foreign policy, stripped of ideology,
was a renationalized version of traditional Russian foreign policy with
strategic priorities starting with the "near abroad" of the former
Soviet republics abutting the West.

A "risen" China presents an analogous case of an orthodox great power
making assertive claims of territorial sovereignty on its periphery.
This new superpower is deeply integrated into the global economy and
presents a variegated challenge in a way that Russia, a one-dimensional
superpower, does not. [[War between the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and China is not inevitable, but the]{.mark}
world's [two]{.mark} dominant powers [could mismanage]{.mark} their way
into [it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

**[[That Russia and China are orthodox great powers, not revolutionary
states seeking the overturn of the international order, creates
political space]{.mark} for the United States [to initiate]{.mark}
strategic [dialogues]{.mark} with them separately or together [to lower
tensions and reduce the risks of conflict]{.mark}---[thereby fostering a
favorable]{.mark} international [milieu to address]{.mark} the
exigencies of [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

A glance at the history of artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}) shows that the field [periodically [goes
through phases of development racing]{.mark} ahead [and slowing]{.mark}
down]{.underline} -- [often dubbed "AI springs" and "AI
winters]{.underline}". **[[The world is]{.mark} currently several years
[in]{.mark}to [an AI spring, dominated by important advances]{.mark} in
machinelearning technologies.]{.underline}** In Europe, policymakers'
efforts to grapple with the rapid pace of technological development have
gone through several phases over the last five to ten years. [The first
phase was marked by uncertainty among policymakers over what to make of
the rapid and seemingly groundbreaking developments in AI]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} phase [lasted until]{.underline} around
[2018]{.underline} -- [though, in some European states, and on some
issues, uncertainty remains]{.underline}. [The second phase consisted of
efforts to frame and AI challenges politically, and to address them, on
a domestic level: between 2018 and 2020]{.underline}, no fewer than [21
EU member states published national AI strategies designed to delineate
their views and aims, and, in some cases, to outline investment
plans]{.underline}.

**[[The next phase could be a period of
international]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and specifically
[**transatlantic[, cooperation on AI]{.mark}**. [After]{.mark} several
[years of Europe]{.mark}an states [working at]{.mark} full capacity to
understand how to support [domestic AI research]{.mark}, including by
assembling expert teams to deliberate new laws and
regulations]{.underline}, **[[there is growing interest]{.mark} among
policymakers and experts in looking beyond Europe.]{.underline}** [On
the EU level, AI policy and governance have already received significant
attention,]{.underline} with the European Commission playing an
important role in incentivising member states to develop AI strategies,
such as by starting to tackle issues around how to make sure AI is
"ethical" and "trustworthy". But **[recent months have seen a rise in
the number of calls [for international cooperation on AI driven by
liberal democracies across the world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Western
countries and their [allies have]{.mark} set up [new forums for
cooperation]{.mark} on how to take AI forward, and are activating
existing forums. More such organisations and platforms for cooperation
are planned.]{.underline}

[[Calls for cooperation between the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and Europe have become particularly]{.mark} regular
and [resonant]{.mark}]{.underline}: following last year's US
presidential election, it was reported that the European Commission
planned to propose [a "**[T]{.mark}**ransatlantic **[T]{.mark}**rade and
Technology **[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline}", [which [would set joint
standards on new tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}. [And, in September
2020, [the US set up a group]{.mark} of like-minded countries "[to
provide values-based global leadership in]{.mark} defense for policies
and approaches in adopting [AI]{.mark}", which included seven European
states, in addition to countries such as Australia, Canada, and South
Korea. In June 2020, [the Global Partnership]{.mark} on Artificial
Intelligence [was founded to consider]{.mark} the [responsible
development]{.mark} of AI; it counts among its members the US, four
European states, and the European Union]{.underline}.

[This paper examines the reasons]{.underline} **[[European
states]{.underline}]{.mark}** may **[[want to work with the US on
AI,]{.mark} and]{.underline}** [why [the US may want to reach out to
Europe on the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also identifies the points
of disagreement that may stop the allies from fully fleshing out
transatlantic AI cooperation. The paper shows that, [[while both sides
are interested]{.mark} in working together, their [rationales]{.mark}
for doing so [differ]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[economic and
political factors may stand in the way]{.mark} of cooperation, [even
though such cooperation could have a positive impact on the way AI
develops]{.mark}.]{.underline} The paper also argues that
**[[transatlantic cooperation in]{.mark} the area of [military AI could
be a good first step]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- **[here, [Europe and the
US should build on existing collaboration within
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The paper concludes with a brief discussion
of the different forums that have been created or proposed for
transatlantic and broader Western cooperation on AI.

Allies Can Deliver a Democratic Way of AI\" //pipk

[[How can the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[collaborate with allies]{.mark}]{.underline} and partners [[to shape
the trajectory of]{.mark} **[a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence [in ways that]{.mark} will **[promote]{.mark}
liberal [democratic values]{.mark}** [and **protect against**]{.mark}
**efforts to wield AI for [authoritarian ends]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

[This question [is]{.mark} both [important and
urgent]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is important because [America's broad
network of [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline} and security partnerships
[[is a singular asset in defending liberal values]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[It is urgent because China, Russia, and other [authoritarian powers
seek]{.mark} to achieve [strategic advantage through AI]{.mark} and the
export of [censorship and surveillance]{.mark} technologies to countries
across the globe]{.underline}.1 By one estimate, [more than 100
countries purchase surveillance and censorship gear from China and
Russia, receive training on these technologies, or simply imitate
methods of surveillance and censorship that are designed to control
public opinion and stifle dissent]{.underline}.2

[As the digital and physical environments become intertwined,
**[authoritarian practices]{.mark} in one domain [will increasingly
encroach]{.mark} upon the other**]{.underline}. **[[At stake are the
core values of liberty, equality, and justice that underpin free and
open societies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [All [democratic nations must
work together to]{.mark} uphold basic principles, [set]{.mark}
international [rules]{.mark} of the road, and articulate a positive
vision for the future in the age of AI]{.underline}.

Within the United States, and certainly within allied countries, [debate
persists over the threat of digital authoritarianism and how to counter
it.]{.underline} [While U.S. allies will likely vary in their strategic
orientations toward China and Russia, **[there is]{.mark} a [growing
consensus on the need to showcase a democratic way of
AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[These]{.mark} debates [will take
shape in a world of globalized markets for AI talent and integrated
supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context, [[the right U.S.
approach would leverage]{.mark} its network of [allies]{.mark} and
partners [to safeguard democracy]{.mark} and liberal values**. [An
alliance-centric strategy provides a competitive advantage over any
single country that attempts to develop a robust AI ecosystem on its
own]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its
[allies should play to their strengths]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
positive agenda [[begin]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[with shaping the
ecosystems for]{.mark} the [development and deployment of safe and
reliable AI]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most effective approach would
capitalize on advances in AI and machine learning to foster sustainable
and inclusive economic growth, improve service delivery, and promote
transparent and accountable governance. The United States and its allies
should pursue a vision of the future in which AI enables strengthened
data privacy standards and respect for civil liberties; economic
empowerment of citizens within rules-based market economies; cleaner,
safer, and more efficient transportation; precision medical diagnosis;
greater access to education; and more effective disaster response.

#### Democracy solves extinction

Carla Zoe **Cremer &** Luke **Kemp 21**, The Future of Humanity
Institute, Oxford. Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Cambridge.
\"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential
Risk\" <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2201/2201.11214.pdf> //pipk

[[There is a]{.mark}n intimate]{.underline} and neglected [[relationship
between existential risk and democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Democracy must be central to]{.mark} efforts [to prevent]{.mark} and
mitigate [catastrophic risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is also an
antidote to many of the problems manifest in the TUA. Do those who study
the future of humanity have good grounds to ignore the visions, desires,
and values of the very people whose future they are trying to protect?
[Choosing which risks to take must be a democratic
endeavour]{.underline}.

We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in accordance with Landemore
[as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively [diverse many who are
entitled to equal decision-making power and partake in a democratic
procedure that includes both a deliberative element and one of
preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority voting)45,115.
Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or non- democratic,
but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less democratic,
inclusive, and diverse.

We posit [three reasons]{.underline} for why we should democratise
research and decision-making in existential risk: [the nature of
collective decision-making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or crafting a desirable
long-term future, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**. Scholars of
existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo sapiens are
choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain views are
excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

**[[Democracy will improve]{.mark} our [judgments]{.mark} in both the
governance and the study of existential risks]{.underline}**. [Asking
how our actions today influence [the long-term]{.mark} future [is one of
the most difficult intellectual tasks]{.mark} to unravel, and if there
is a right path, **[democratic procedures]{.mark}** will **[have the
best shot]{.mark} at finding it**]{.underline}. Hong and Page116,117
demonstrate **[[both theoretically and computationally]{.mark} that [a
diverse group]{.mark} of problem-solving agents [will show greater
accuracy]{.mark} than a less diverse group, even if the individual
members of the diverse group were each less accurate.]{.underline}**
**[Accuracy gains from diversity trump gains from improving individual
accuracy]{.underline}**. Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a
probabilistic argument that **[inclusive democracies will, in
expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies or even
the wise few]{.underline}**. This is [supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the
world]{.underline} 118. [In the long run, democracies should commit
fewer mistakes than alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}.
If this is true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decision-making. We are more likely to make accurate predictions about
the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if
the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional
structures, and avoids conflicts of interest.

Thereare many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects. To get close to replicating the cognitive diversity found among
humans, we must begin by inviting different thinkers with different
values and beliefs into the field.

**[[Democracies]{.mark} can [limit harms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any
approach to [mitigating]{.mark} existential threats [could create
response risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the TUA seems particularly
vulnerable to this. [Despite good intentions and curiosity-driven
research, it could justify violence, dangerous technological
developments, or drastically constrain freedom in favour of (perceived)
security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore ideas but minimise harms,
[democracies can]{.underline} be used to [moderate]{.underline} the
[measures taken in response to harmful ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for
example, vanishingly unlikely that a diverse group of thinkers or even
ordinary citizens would entertain the idea of sacrificing 1 billion
living, breathing beings for an infinitesimal improvement in reaching an
intergalactic techno-utopia. In contrast, the TUA could recommend this
trade-off.

[The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [[democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}, this fail-safe mechanism [seems to
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even deeply imperfect democracies, like the
ones we inhabit now, often avert detrimental outcomes.]{.underline}
[[Democracies prevent famines]{.underline}]{.mark} 119 (although not
malnutrition)120. They [make [war]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a significant
driver of GCRs --- [less likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of
diverse preferences in democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved
through women's suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that [the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.mark}]{.underline}** 123--125,
**[[but]{.mark} strong [support]{.mark} for [action against
climate]{.mark} catastrophe]{.underline}** 126--128. We can further show
that **[[when citizens]{.mark} deliberately [engage]{.mark} with the
subject at hand, their [concern and readiness]{.mark} for action often
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies
on climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes.

**[[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought.]{.mark} Navigating
humanity through [crises will involve]{.mark} many value-laden decisions
under deep [uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Democratic procedures
can deal with such hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be
represented amongst scholars of ERS. Recommendations on [[policies that
would reduce risk should]{.mark} be passed through deliberative
assemblies and [await]{.mark} the [approval of]{.mark} a wider pool of
ordinary [citizens]{.mark}, as they will be the ones who will bear this
risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts attempting to directly
influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

Governance Capacity\" February 14.
<https://www.cigionline.org/articles/existential-gap-digitalai-acceleration-and-the-missing-global-governance-capacity/>
//pipk

[We are facing [a]{.mark}n ever-[growing gap between]{.mark} the
phenomenal acceleration of technology and of connectivity, and the human
capacity to manage these trends]{.underline}. The gap is well-documented
in the fields of finance, climate change, pandemics and nuclear risks.
But [the contrast between the exponential growth of disruptive
[tech]{.mark}nology [and]{.mark} the lacklustre supply of
[governance]{.mark} mechanisms is starkest [in]{.mark} the fields of
digital governance and artificial intelligence
([AI]{.mark}).]{.underline}

**[That gap [becomes existential]{.mark} when we consider the likely
future development of]{.underline}** artificial general intelligence
(**[[AGI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) (Ord 2020) or superintelligence
(Bostrom 2015) **[that [can be misaligned with]{.mark} human values or
even the goal of ensuring the continuity of [human
existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This question of [the governance
of]{.mark} life with [AI may be the most essential question of our
time]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Tegmark 2017), but you would not know it
from the current output of global governance in this field. Summarizing
the judgement of many scientists in the field, Toby Ord argues that
[unaligned AGI is actually [the number-one global existential risk for
humanity, with a 10 percent chance of human extinction within 100
years]{.mark}. The prophesized [existential threats]{.mark} posed by
extreme and accelerated technological advancement and expansion [have
never been as close to reality as they are
now]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As noted by Yuval Noah Harari and
Daniel Kahneman (2021) in a recent conversation, **[the task of taming
and [governing]{.mark} the digital/[AI]{.mark} revolution is [daunting.
Humanity may have no slack]{.mark} for a mistake this time around,
[given]{.mark} the [existential consequences]{.mark} of such a
mistake.]{.underline}**

Today, we already benefit from tremendous digital or AI innovations in
e-commerce, social media and communication, home management, work,
health care, education, transportation, and entertainment (West and
Allen 2020). We can foresee that AI-driven algorithms may soon be able
to correct human judgement flaws (or noise) caused by fatigue,
irregularity, emotions and other weaknesses, afflictions that can
generate variation in decisions by up to 50 percent (Kahneman, Sibony
and Sunstein 2021). [[Within two decades, we]{.mark} can
[envisage]{.mark} a world with generalized deep learning and virtual
reality, computer vision, contactless love, fully autonomous vehicles in
most advanced and emerging economies, [autonomous weapons]{.mark} in
militaries [and]{.mark} a dream of plenitude]{.underline} (Lee and Chen
2021).

[Yet, today, we witness tremendous havoc created by the explosion of
social [anger, exacerbated by]{.mark} sophisticated social media
[algorithms]{.mark}, deep polarization, the return of tribal politics,
the loss of agreed truths and the spread of misinformation and dangerous
conspiracies, the loss of privacy, the rise of massive and uber-powerful
tech companies, and massive job displacement and inequality]{.underline}
(Bartlett 2018). [Influence operations by foreign [states]{.mark} have
also [amplified]{.mark} such social anger and [polarization]{.mark} in
many democracies, adding a degree of external threat and urgency. We
also live with a world of security-driven digital decoupling between the
United States and China]{.underline} (Ma 2021). In other words, [[the
digital revolution is moving faster than]{.mark} the human [capacity
to]{.mark} cope with it, embed it within a public good-oriented
framework and [steer]{.mark} its disruptive power [toward a
non-destructive direction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The problem is]{.underline} visible at the national level but
**[particularly salient at the global level]{.underline}**.
[Digital/[data governance is fragmenting]{.mark} among]{.underline} at
least four poles: [a [US]{.mark} model]{.underline} with maximum
innovation and limited regulation; [an [EU]{.mark} model]{.underline}
with a strong regulatory balance; [an [India]{.mark} model]{.underline}
with an emphasis on digital sovereignty and infant industry protection
(applicable to other developing countries); [[and]{.mark} a [Chinese
model]{.mark}]{.underline} with both rapid innovation, strong state
control and surveillance. [Our [global governance capacity is affected
by multiple splits]{.mark}]{.underline}: a US-EU split over privacy, tax
and anti-monopoly regulations; an India-West split over data ownership
and first-mover advantage; and, worst of all, a potential digital cold
war between the United States (and its allies) and China. In response to
this dire need for governance, Rohinton P. Medhora and Taylor Owen
(2020) have proposed a need for a new fundamental effort at coordinated
governance --- or a "digital Bretton Woods." While fundamental
international conditions and global distribution of power today differ
drastically from the Bretton Woods era, a high-stake and fragmented
digital world is in dire need of such renewed cooperative spirit.

Recognizing the gap in digital governance, we ask the following
questions: What is the scale of the gap in governance relative to
requirements needed to keep the digital economy afloat? And what could
be a pathway forward in the context of the growing securitization and
increasing divides?

[[It is urgent to]{.mark} raise a sense of awareness, mobilize all
social and public actors around this urgent dilemma and [catalyze a
multi-level effort to address this conundrum]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
argue that no global, regional or national institution alone will be
able to deliver the right governance capacity. Instead, we recommend a
highly reactive, innovative and competitive model of networked
governance that operates at multiple levels with key nodes and
catalysts.

**[[Governance innovation must keep pace]{.mark} with technological
innovation]{.underline}**. [Given how far the digital cold war has
already proceeded and the currently low capacity to cooperate between
the United States and China, part of [the solution will need to
involve]{.mark} clubs and [alliances]{.mark} of countries and non-state
actors]{.underline}. At the same time, some level of global coordination
and basic rules for global co-existence are crucial for success in
managing this existential threat. The Group of Twenty (G20) is one
critical venue for such work, even though it has not delivered so far.

Key Indicators on the Exponential Rise of the Digital Economy

Over the last few years, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic
period, the digital economy has experienced an exponential rise and
begun to transform human interactions, production and trade (Suominen
2019). In Table 1, we offer a review of selected indicators on
cross-border data flows and digitalization. It is clear that digital
trade and cross-border data flows, along with other digital innovations,
are rising faster than physical trade flows.

Economy

with an asterisk are projected data.

Table 1 shows that key components of the digital economy, including
e-commerce, AI economy and cross-border mobile payments, have
experienced steady growth since 2017, and are projected to continue
growing. 2020 saw the sharpest growth in several components, likely due
to mobility constraints and increased reliance on digital tools
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. While current data illustrates
useful trends, it is important to note that the volume of digital trade
--- a key component of data on the digital economy --- is very hard to
measure.1 This is in part due to the lack of a shared definition of what
constitutes digital trade, highlighting a need for technocratic
standardization as a basis for high-level digital governance.

Why Addressing the Digital Governance Gap Matters

We offer here a typology of risks involved in the digital governance
gap:

Under-institutionalized markets (North 1990; Williamson 1985): [All
markets require basic rules and governance to ensure trust,
accountability and resilience, and to prevent abuse by potential
oligopolistic players]{.underline}. Global markets require global
institutions. [Digital governance is a new domain, where innovators and
disruptors have been able to run ahead of rule making. We are emerging
from more than two decades of an under-institutionalized digital
economy, in which many large imbalances and market deficiencies are
appearing in every society around the world]{.underline}.

[Unprecedented power of digital companies]{.underline}: The current
moment may be the first time in human history that a private company
such as Facebook (Meta) has the ability on its own to screen messages of
leaders and politicians from every country in the world, except China,
North Korea, Cuba, and maybe Iran. And this global function is only
peripheral to Facebook's core business, with just hundreds of assigned
staff. In other words, Facebook, along with Twitter and a couple more
giant for-profit digital companies, has acquired in less than 15 years
the power to control information, emotions, narratives and
political/social mobilization in the majority of countries of the world,
including the United States. And they are generating disproportionate
profits from this dominant position. All this [is taking place in a near
complete vacuum of digital governance.]{.underline} Most countries
outside the United States and China have limited power to regulate and
control these US-based and China-based global digital companies. The US
government retains residual power to do so, but has been unable to act
due to constitutional constraints and great polarization in Congress.
China (behind its internet firewall) has already started wrestling with
this power and cracking down on its own giants. India has started to
pass restricting measures on the power and freedom of social media
companies on its territory. The European Union is taking its own
regulatory path through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
and its successor currently under negotiations, as well as tough
competition rules, within the constraints of its relative weak position
in the space (no EU-based digital giants). But the governance gap
remains enormous in the United States and many other countries, as well
as at the global level.

[Risk of [explosive]{.mark} social [disruptions]{.mark} and
inequality]{.underline}: The scale of disruption [[induced
by]{.underline}]{.mark} digital and [[AI innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}
under current intellectual property protection and lack of
redistribution accrues immense winner-take-all benefits to first movers.
We are witnessing [at the same time a historic concentration of capital
and wealth and growing numbers of displaced or laid-off workers in
declining industries]{.underline}. We can soon expect to have digital
entrepreneurs with a net worth of US\$1 trillion (from a quarter of a
trillion so far with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos), alongside massive job
displacement. [Such fast-paced social dislocation and inequality could
prove politically explosive and very hard to manage]{.underline} (Lee
2018). [No social system is ready --- and the global governance is not
ready either. **[The viability of modern states is]{.mark} also [at
stake]{.mark},**]{.underline} as their revenue base keeps eroding. In
the late nineteenth century, when the oil and railroad revolutions
generated a similar concentration of wealth, it took all the power and
energy of a Teddy Roosevelt to tame these forces. We don't have such
capacity today.

[Global systemic risks]{.underline}: [The global digital economy is
extraordinarily interconnected and fast-paced]{.underline}. It
encompasses data flows, e-commerce, mobile payments, digital currency
(with increasing future prevalence), AI algorithms, fully automated cars
and weapons. [[Is the current system resilient against]{.mark} contagion
effects or [collapse]{.mark}? What is the safety net in case of a
crisis]{.underline}?

[[Loss of privacy]{.mark} and potential loss of human
freedom]{.underline}: [The rise of the surveillance state [is an extreme
reality]{.mark} in China]{.underline}, including in repression
operations. [But]{.underline} it is [also]{.underline} a reality [[all
over the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. Companies such as Google and
Facebook not only have more data about each individual than they can
imagine, but also the capacity to couple this data with future AI
algorithms for all kinds of usage. For the first time in human history,
most humans have handed over fundamentally private information to either
giant private actors, states or both. Even worse, regulatory breaches
(cf. Cambridge Analytica) give political or criminal actors access to
important and strategic data, with which they can manipulate human
psychology.

**[Democratic existential crisis]{.underline}**: [The explosion and
equalization of information, and the intensification of complexity, have
eroded any sense of agreed truth and reality within most nations. Social
media has unexpectedly accelerated polarization, amplified echo chambers
and closed loops among like-minded individuals, greatly contributing to
extreme polarization in many societies across the planet]{.underline}.
[Absurd conspiracies]{.underline} can [spread virally and inspire
violent actions by large spontaneous groups]{.underline}, as shown by
the January 6 insurrection in the United States (with a large number of
people mobilized by QAnon beliefs). At a deeper level, [new
understandings about the concept of extended mind in psychology show
that [humans are]{.mark} increasingly [delegating]{.mark} part of their
[thinking]{.mark} processes [to]{.mark} smart phones and their
[algorithm]{.mark}-driven suggestions devised to serve profit-seeking
companies]{.underline} (cf. work by Peter Reiner).2 [Human behaviour may
be profoundly changing in ways never seen before, which our democratic
institutions are not ready for]{.underline}. Facebook's move to a
[metaverse world]{.underline} that can attract humans to spend time and
to be transformed [in a totally unregulated environment has the
potential to further increase this risk.]{.underline}

**[External cyberthreats to democracy]{.underline}**: [[The]{.mark}
current [digitalized world is]{.mark} also increasingly [used as a tool
to undermine democracy from the outside]{.mark}. Russia's
interference]{.underline} in the 2016 American presidential election
through social media campaigns highlights the extent to which an
unregulated digital sphere could undermine democratic institutions.
[China's propaganda efforts]{.underline} on platforms such as Twitter
and YouTube during the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election are yet
another example that an unregulated cyberspace could warrant injudicious
digital campaigns. More recently, the sale of [Israeli
spyware]{.underline} Pegasus to various governments --- who in turn used
it for malicious efforts against other states, and individuals such as
journalists, reporters and human rights activists.

[Rise of [cybercrimes]{.mark}, cyberpiracy and cyberattacks]{.underline}
(Deibert 2013, 2020; Sanger 2018). The open structure of the internet
has left great space [for hackers and organized gangs]{.underline}.
Worse, [the existence of an illegal black market [incentivize]{.mark}s
smart young digital talents in many places around the world to look for
[zero-day loopholes]{.mark} in operating systems and sell those to the
highest bidders, including the national security agencies of many
countries]{.underline} (Perlroth 2020). [[This]{.mark} quickly
[escalates into]{.mark} a growing cyberspying competition and even
[cyberwar]{.mark}]{.underline} (Segal 2016).

[Fragmentation of the internet and of the digital economy into rival
spheres (splinternet), and weaponization of interdependence]{.underline}
(Drezner, Farrell and Newman 2021; Farrell and Newman 2019; Ma 2021;
Suominen 2019). [The raising of stakes in the digital economy, the
sudden acceleration of the digital transformation in China, the
intensification of security competition and the high prevalence of
[dual-use tech]{.mark}nologies [in]{.mark} the digital/[AI]{.mark} space
have led to an [increas]{.mark}ing [potential for]{.mark} a digital cold
war, as well as other [fractures among]{.mark} various [regional
poles]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Winston Ma (2021, 42) writes: "all in
all, [U.S.-China tech decoupling is real and accelerating.]{.underline}
Hence, [the digital economy is in a vital conflict and
crisis]{.underline}: the global tech world, together with at least part
of the world economy, is now fractured into two-and potential
more...spheres of influence, whereas tech entrepreneurs are driving the
prospect of a technological singularity, hyper-connected society, and
internet of everything." [This decoupling is extremely risky, because it
is abrupt, driven by fears and not negotiated. It leads to highly
explosive tit-for-tat measures that are hard to contain. This process
massively interferes with the human effort to generate a global
governance framework]{.underline}.

Measuring the Digital Global Governance Gap

In Table 2 (and, in greater detail, in Annex 1), we offer a summary of
existing digital governance at the global, regional, club or national
levels. Overall, we evaluate that the governance of basic internet
functions remains surprisingly resilient (8/10), but other dimensions of
digital and AI governance are extremely weak (2/10 in most cases).

One powerful indicator that highlights the gap between the risks
outlined above and the current state of global governance is found in
the recent G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration. The focus remains on sharing
the gains of digital innovation for the green economy, education and
economic growth. However, the digital economy gets only brief mentions
toward the latter part of the declaration with generic and toothless
statements such as the following:

"In cooperation with social partners, we will adopt human-centered
policy approaches to promote social dialogue and to ensure greater
social justice; safe and healthy working conditions; and decent work for
all, including within global supply chains. To reduce inequalities,
eradicate poverty, support worker transitions and reintegration in
labour markets and promote inclusive and sustainable growth, we will
strengthen our social protection systems" (G20 Leaders 2021, para. 35).

"We recognize the role of technology and innovation as key enablers for
the global recovery and sustainable development....With this in mind, we
will work to strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation to secure
our ICT, address shared vulnerabilities and threats, and combat
cybercrime" (ibid., para 46).

"Well aware of the benefits stemming from the responsible use and
development of trustworthy human-centered Artificial Intelligence (AI),
we will advance the implementation of the G20 AI Principles" (ibid.,
para 47).

"We will also continue to further common understanding and to work
towards identifying commonalities, complementarities and elements of
convergence between existing regulatory approaches and instruments
enabling data to flow with trust, in order to foster future
interoperability. Recognizing the responsibility of digital service
providers, we will work in 2022 towards enhancing confidence in the
digital environment by improving internet safety and countering online
abuse, hate speech, online violence and terrorism while protecting human
rights and fundamental freedoms" (ibid., para. 48).

This summary of current global digital governance reveals the extent of
the gap with what is at stake!

From Table 2, we can draw several important lessons. First, the
well-established nature of internet governance shows that
[**[governance]{.mark}** in the digital domain **[is]{.mark}** indeed
**[possible]{.mark}**. Internet governance was established several
decades ago and is operated by largely independent and apolitical
entities.]{.underline} However, times have changed. [It is important to
recognize the current geopolitical stakes and inherent international
context that now constitutes multi-polarities of interest]{.underline}.
Second, despite the absence of a centralized governance mechanism for
digital trade, [the language and framing of rules on digital trade as
expressed in recent free-trade and digital partnership agreements are
increasingly similar, and indicate some degree of convergence in the
governance of digital trade]{.underline}. Finally, the domain that fairs
most poorly in terms of governance is also the domain that is most
politicized. The primary motivation behind limited alignment on accepted
5G or semiconductor providers is driven by the US geopolitical push
against Chinese 5G giant Huawei and semiconductor giant SMIC, risking
bifurcation in global standards and encouraging autarkic behaviours such
as the EU idea of "chips self-sufficiency."

As a reference, Table 3 offers a comparative summary of different
approaches used by the United States, European Union, China and India.

Conclusion and Global Digital Governance Proposals

**[[There is a]{.mark} huge [disconnect between]{.mark} the [speed of
tech]{.mark}nological development, the scale of [existential
risks]{.mark} involved, [and]{.mark} the acceleration of [securitization
on the one hand and the supply of]{.mark} national/[global governance
and increase in human capacity on the other
hand]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[Political leaders are not yet incentivized to deal with this
existential set of issues. They are distracted by short-term political
urgencies and the acceleration of tit-for-tat rivalry.]{.underline}

[A digital Bretton Woods captures the spirit of global digital
governance we should strive for.]{.underline} However, it is essential
to recognize the radically different context of today compared to 1944.
[The lack of "global yearning for peace and stability"]{.underline}
highlighted by Medhora and Owen (2020), [is]{.underline} further
[aggravated by a new environment of multi-polarity and diffused
interests]{.underline}. **[Thus, [we may only be able to reach a thin
global framework under current]{.mark} geopolitical [conditions]{.mark},
and it can only be [part of a]{.mark} larger multi-level and partly
[competitive effort to generate governance
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[The human solutions to the predicament cannot come from a single locus
or look like responses to past governance issues]{.underline}. **[There
will need to be multiple entry points with a networking and competitive
dynamic among them]{.underline}** --- some from the G20, World Trade
Organization (WTO), United Nations, some from club governance (Group of
Seven \[G7\], Quad, China-based solutions, along with bilateral forums
such as the US-EU dialogue), and some from private actors, civil society
networks, think tanks and academic actors.

[[For]{.mark} any [critical]{.mark} mass process of [capacity
development to occur]{.mark} in such a way, both [catalyzing focal
points and elements of coordination will be required]{.mark}. [The
global level may]{.mark} yet [play a key signalling role or allow
minimum convergence on dimensions of common
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. The G20 urgently needs an upgraded
high-level working group on all digital governance questions.

[[Focus]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[on AI-enabled Military
Logistics]{.mark} and Sustainment]{.underline} In military affairs,
[logistics is tasked with [managing]{.mark} the global supply chain for
the armed services, including "the [transfer of personnel and
materiel]{.mark} from one location to another, [as well as]{.mark} the
[maintenance]{.mark} of that materiel]{.underline}."27 [[Sustainment
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[broader]{.underline}]{.mark} term,
[[encompassing]{.underline}]{.mark} logistics as well as
[[financial]{.underline}]{.mark} management,
[[personnel]{.underline}]{.mark} services, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[health services]{.mark} which]{.underline} together
[provide]{.underline} the [support [necessary]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
maintain operations]{.mark}]{.underline} until the mission is
accomplished.28 The two functions are closely intertwined. [NATO's
Allied Joint Doctrine for Logistics, for instance, offers a
comprehensive definition of logistics that also entails elements of
sustainment]{.underline}, encompassing the aspects of military
operations that deal with "design and development, acquisition, storage,
movement, distribution, maintenance, evacuation and disposition of
materiel; transport of personnel; acquisition, construction,
maintenance, operation and disposition of facilities; acquisition or
furnishing of services; and medical and health service support."29

[**[Logistics]{.mark}** and sustainment **[are essential to military
effectiveness]{.mark}**, readiness, survivability, and endurance, and in
many ways, **constitute [the lifeblood of military
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.30 [[The]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**]{.mark}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense, in turn, [[sees great promise
in]{.mark} leveraging [AI]{.mark}]{.underline}/machine learning (ML)
technologies [for military [logistics]{.mark} and sustainment
[to]{.mark} better maintain equipment, [reduce]{.mark} operational
[costs, and improve]{.mark} [readiness]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Department of Defense's AI strategy, for example, includes efforts
related to AI-enabled logistics and sustainment, such as "implementing
predictive maintenance and supply, and streamlining business processes,"
as part of its strategic approach to "delivering AI-enabled capabilities
that address key missions."31 Joint Logistics, in turn, is one of the
JAIC's key mission initiatives, dedicated to "improving fleet readiness
through AI-driven diagnostics, training, process improvements, demand
forecasting, and supply chain optimization."32

[The discussion below outlines the technological, political, and
strategic imperatives and opportunities for multinational collaboration
on AI-enabled military logistics and sustainment]{.underline}.
Naturally, [the principal mission of militaries is national defense and
the force (including logistics and sustainment functions) must be
prepared for combat at any time]{.underline}. Modern militaries,
however, are massive organizations that employ hundreds of thousands of
people, if not more. The Department of Defense, for example, employs
2.91 million people, and less than half of them, or 1.3 million, are
active duty personnel.33 And [unlike military functions such as fires or
movement and maneuver of forces and equipment, many of the
[tasks]{.mark} related to military logistics and other financial,
personnel, and health services are administered in noncombat
settings]{.underline}.

While we discuss how the United States and its allies can work together
on AI for military logistics and sustainment in both combat and
noncombat settings, there is no doubt that the environment in question
matters a great deal. From data to computational power to available
talent, as well as considerations like privacy, safety, and security,
implementing AI for military logistics and sustainment functions
performed in controlled environments similar to commercial settings is a
different endeavor from deploying AIenabled logistics and sustainment
functions in contested and hostile environments. We take these
differences into account where relevant, and acknowledge that even under
the best of circumstances, there are still significant challenges for
both the adoption of AI applications and multinational collaboration in
this area.

Technologically attainable While not without its challenges, [military
[logistics]{.mark}]{.underline} and sustainment tasks,
[especially]{.underline} those performed [in noncombat settings,
[present a technologically attainable area for multinational
collaboration in AI]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Although much of
the innovation in AI is occurring in the commercial sector, adopting and
[adapting commercial AI]{.mark} applications [for military purposes
is]{.mark} often [impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Current
[AI]{.mark} tech]{.underline}nologies, and especially ML-based systems,
[tend to [perform well in stable environments but struggle with
uncertain]{.mark} and novel [situations, and remain]{.mark} particularly
[vulnerable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} adversarial
[attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[These]{.mark} vulnerabilities [present an unacceptable]{.mark} level
of [risk in]{.mark} highstakes [military settings]{.mark}, where the
environment is uncertain and adversarial by definition. The consequences
of [mistakes]{.mark} and even system failure, [however, are less severe
when it comes to some]{.mark} military [logistics]{.mark} and
sustainment [tasks]{.mark} which are administered and managed in
noncombat settings, and constitute what some have called enterprise AI
applications]{.underline}.

[Advances in AI for logistics in commercial aviation, maritime shipping,
and transportation sectors are therefore more applicable to certain
military logistics and sustainment tasks performed in noncombat settings
than for specialized military equipment like autonomous ground combat
vehicles or armed drones. In particular, there may be opportunities to
adopt and adapt commercial applications for the intelligent automation
of tasks such as scheduling equipment maintenance and repairs, updating
and issuing licenses, supply tracking and forecasting, and other
processes that control the flow of logistics throughout the military
organization.34 To reiterate, these are much more than cost cutting and
efficiency increasing measures; [improvements]{.mark} in these areas
[enable military]{.mark} [readiness]{.mark} and effectiveness in
combat.35]{.underline}

[[In]{.mark} addition to these opportunities to leverage
[AI]{.mark}-enabled technologies and tools available in the commercial
sector in support of military [logistics]{.mark}, [there are]{.mark}
also [fewer barriers to]{.mark} inhouse [innovation]{.mark} [within
defense organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Many of the [AI]{.mark}
applications relevant to [logistics]{.mark} and sustainment [can be
developed and used in relatively well-controlled]{.mark} and benign
[environments]{.mark} in settings akin to commercial civilian
enterprises.]{.underline} Under such conditions, [[resources like
data]{.mark} and [infrastructure]{.mark}, including [storage]{.mark},
ETL [pipelines]{.mark}, [communication]{.mark} bandwidth, [and compute
can be made available to train ML models for various AI
applications]{.mark}]{.underline}.36 Notably, the 2016 Defense Science
Board Summer Study on Autonomy raised a similar point regarding
**[[logistics]{.mark} planning and execution [as "a particularly good
candidate for testing]{.mark} and experimentation]{.underline}** (T&E)
... **[[because]{.mark} the behavior of [logistic software can be
evaluated against crisply known metrics]{.mark}]{.underline}**."37

Considering both the potential for leveraging developments from the
private sector and lower barriers to in-house innovation,
[[collaboration on AI]{.mark} for [logistics]{.mark} and sustainment
[could]{.mark} also [involve allies with]{.mark} more [limited]{.mark}
military-industrial [capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Based on its
fact-finding mission to Singapore, [[NATO's]{.mark} Science and
Technology Committee observed that "[small]{.mark} and medium-sized
[Allies]{.mark} with smart scientists and engineers [can play an
outsized role in AI]{.mark} development and adoption]{.underline}."38
**[This is [a significant advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**, arguably
**[[unique to AI]{.mark} technologies, [and]{.mark} especially [timely
considering]{.mark}]{.underline}** that even the relatively wealthy U.S.
**[allies are facing [cuts to]{.mark} their defense [budgets]{.mark} due
to]{.underline}** the economic fallout from the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic. Moreover, **[[collaboration that
includes]{.mark} input from [small]{.mark} and medium-sized [allies can
strengthen interoperability, contribute to]{.mark} allied [burden
sharing, and buttress the long-term viability of U.S.-led defense
partnerships]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[This is [not to say]{.mark} that]{.underline} adopting and developing,
let alone [[collaborating]{.mark} on AI-enabled logistics [will
be]{.mark} an [easy]{.mark} task for the U.S. military and allied
defense organizations]{.underline}. The [ML and deep learning
[algorithms]{.mark} behind commercial AI-enabled logistics [are]{.mark}
generally [not optimized for military needs]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 And
if the experience of the Department of Defense is any indication, [there
are multiple challenges with regards to the data needed to power AI
applications---from lack of data to problems with traceability, access,
and interoperability of data collected by different
systems]{.underline}.40 Moreover, [data security and privacy concerns as
well as different legal frameworks for how personal data is collected,
handled, processed, and stored remain a critical barrier to
international collaboration]{.underline}. Lack of clarity surrounding
how to implement the exemptions for research incorporated into the
General Data Protection Regulation, for example, has stalled
collaboration between the U.S. National Institutes of Health and some
European counterparts.41

These and other [technical barriers and privacy-related concerns are
indeed significant]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} [developments in
privacy-preserving ML techniques, including homomorphic encryption,
secure multi-party computation, and federated learning offer
opportunities for allies to share and pool data without compromising the
privacy of individual users and organizations whose data is being
used]{.underline}.42 [[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[work with allies to develop]{.mark}
technical [standards]{.mark} and protocols [for]{.mark} harmonizing
[data]{.mark} collection, formatting, storage, and archiving to ensure
data security and integrity]{.underline}.43

Overall, the [U.S.]{.underline} military [and allied defense
organizations will face nonnegligible technical barriers]{.underline}
whether adapting commercial AI technologies or building AI-enabled
systems and tools in-house. [**[From a comparative standpoint]{.mark}**,
however, [military logistics]{.mark}]{.underline} and sustainment
applications that fall [under]{.underline} the broader category of
enterprise [AI]{.underline} applications **[[present "low hanging
fruit]{.mark}"]{.underline}** for the U.S. military (and presumably for
other technologically advanced militaries).44 Moreover,
**[[international collaboration on AI-]{.mark}enabled military
[logistics]{.mark}]{.underline}** and sustainment
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely **[[more within reach than]{.mark}
collaboration on AI]{.underline}** integrated into **[[weapons]{.mark}
systems [or]{.mark}]{.underline}** applications that feed on
**[sensitive data collected by proprietary weapons and [sensor]{.mark}
system[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.45

Politically feasible [[With key]{.mark} U.S.
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline} like the United Kingdom, Germany, France,
South Korea and Japan [[already pursuing]{.mark} efforts to leverage
[AI]{.mark} for military **[logistics]{.mark}** and
sustainment]{.underline}, [[collaboration]{.mark} in this area [seems
**politically feasible**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} The integration of AI
into weapons systems has raised ethical concerns and opposition in some
communities across the United States and in allied countries. Yet **[by
[focusing]{.mark} collaboration [on AI]{.mark} applications for military
[logistics]{.mark} and sustainment functions, the United States and its
allies [could]{.mark} potentially [sidestep the contentious "killer
robots" debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[Collaborative efforts
to]{.mark} develop and [apply AI]{.mark} tools to areas such as defense
supply chain management, personnel management, and equipment maintenance
[can improve existing processes]{.mark} and functions, [save costs and
increase efficiencies in defense organizations]{.mark}. [Multinational
collaboration around this]{.mark} set of goals and applications [is less
likely to galvanize]{.mark} widespread grassroots [opposition]{.mark}
than programs on AI-enabled drones or autonomous ground combat
vehicles]{.underline}**.

Moreover, some of the United States' closest [allies are already
investing in AI]{.underline} and ML [technologies for logistics and
sustainment]{.underline}. The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense's
(MOD) Autonomy Programme, for example, identifies defense resupply and
logistics challenges through the Defense and Security Accelerator as one
of its key activities.46 In 2019, MOD also allocated £66 million (about
\$83 million) to accelerate robotic projects for the British Army,
including autonomous logistics vehicles supporting resupply missions in
conflict zones.47 Notably, the UK's Defense Science and Technology
Laboratory and the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command's
Ground Vehicle Systems Center have been working together since 2016 on
the Coalition Assured Autonomous Resupply project, prototyping
semiautonomous logistics convoys, along with ground and aerial
autonomous resupply systems, and demonstrating the interoperability of
the two nations' armies with autonomous driving technology.48

France's military AI strategy also views "logistics and operational
readiness" as one of the priority areas for the defense ministry,
including a focus on predictive maintenance. 49 Notably, the strategy
states that "mission performance and assisted maintenance applications,
especially for cooperation with countries that have the same systems" as
France pose no significant problems in terms of sharing classified data.
And in addition to its key European partners, France is also open to
collaboration with the United States given the similar approach to AI
development. 50 Along similar lines, the German Army identifies AI for
personnel and material management, including predictive maintenance, as
one of the main areas for action on AI development.51

Japan and South Korea are also increasingly investing in military
applications of AI, including for logistics and sustainment. South
Korea's National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence lists national
defense as a key area for AI applications, including using AI to
"quickly analyze and process large-scale defense data and develop and
support common services such as medical care, logistics, and
administration."52 Meanwhile, Japan's Acquisition, Technology and
Logistics Agency (ATLA) has identified "logistical support technologies"
in its medium- to long-term defense technology outlook back in 2016.
More recently, ATLA has been working with private sector partners on
research and development projects applying AI for defense logistics and
"streamlining system maintenance work."53

[[Efforts]{.mark} to advance collaboration on AI-enabled military
logistics]{.underline} and sustainment [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[face some resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The aforementioned
challenges related to data privacy are not merely technical in nature,
but deeply political as well. Some European policymakers are pushing
toward data sovereignty and less dependency on U.S. technology. Others
are doubting whether the United States is willing to advance meaningful
regulations over digital technologies and safeguards for data privacy.54
**[[The question of a forum]{.mark} for collaboration [remains]{.mark} a
[politically sensitive]{.mark} topic]{.underline}** as well, even more
so now in the aftermath of Brexit. 55

These challenges notwithstanding, the United States and its allies have
shared interests and common policy objectives in ensuring the safe and
responsible use of AI in alignment with democratic norms and principles.
And with allies like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, South Korea,
and Japan already promoting initiatives to leverage AI for military
logistics and sustainment, this seems like a politically pragmatic area
for collaboration.

Strategically critical [[The strategic environment]{.underline}]{.mark}
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region [[heightens the importance of
coordinating]{.mark} national and multinational logistics, while
collaboration on [AI-]{.mark}enabled [logistics can provide an
operational advantage in multinational operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The U.S. military is a global force that must remain ahead of
competitors and adversaries and be prepared for a broad range of
contingencies and missions. Yet [in multinational operations, [the gap
in]{.mark} military and technological [capabilities]{.mark} between the
United States and its allies and partners, and more specifically,
significant discrepancies [in allies' logistic capabilities, can
negatively impact survivability, interoperability, cohesion, and
ultimately, mission success]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, for the United
States and its allies, [[collaboration]{.mark} on logistics and
sustainment in general, and [on AI-enabled logistics]{.mark} and
sustainment in particular, [is important for]{.mark} several
[operational and strategic reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Operationally speaking, [[logistic support during]{.mark}
[multinational]{.mark} military [operations differs from unilateral
operations]{.mark}. [Nations have different]{.mark} national and
military objectives, cultures, capabilities, and [approaches to
logistic]{.mark} support and functions.]{.underline} [These]{.underline}
differences [impact how the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates military organizes, prepares, and eventually
[executes logistic support]{.underline} during multinational
operations.56 Moreover, [in multinational operations, nations share a
collective responsibility for logistics in support of the
mission]{.underline}. **[Thus, [the logistic capabilities of
each]{.mark} allied [nation affect]{.mark} not only their ability to
support their own forces but [the]{.mark} operational-level support
[capabilities of the coalition as a whole]{.mark}]{.underline}**.57

[On a strategic level, [the global threat landscape and U.S. security
posture in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} and the Asia-Pacific region
[[elevate the significance of joint]{.mark}, streamlined
[logistics]{.mark} and comparable military endurance [capabilities
between]{.mark} the United States and its [allies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In Europe, on [[NATO's eastern flank]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Baltic
states of Estonia and Latvia, (as well as potentially Lithuania) [[could
be overrun by Russia]{.mark}'s superior military forces in a matter of
days]{.underline}.58 Thus, in the event of a major conflict in the
Baltic states, [[NATO would have to move]{.mark} thousands of [troops
and]{.mark} heavy military [equipment]{.mark} from across Europe as well
as from the United States [very rapidly]{.mark} and efficiently to
counter Russian aggression]{.underline}. **[[Sound
logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}**---from the coordination and transfer of
military cargo ships and private merchant vessels to the surge and
movement of military equipment and supplies along Europe's roads,
rivers, and incompatible rail infrastructure---**[[would prove
essential]{.mark} to success]{.underline}**. 59

Preventing China from becoming a regional hegemon in East Asia and
strengthening the U.S.-led security architecture in the western Pacific
is high on the list of U.S. strategic interests. Yet the U.S. military
has no local shore bases from which to project power in the region, and
its dependence on more distant bases in Guam, Japan, and South Korea,
presents significant operational limitations. Moreover, U.S. air bases,
aircraft carriers, surface vessels, ports, airfields, and logistics
systems---those already in the region and those surge forces moving into
the theater in the event of a crisis or a conflict---are currently
vulnerable to Chinese air and missile attacks and cyberattacks.60 U.S.
national security experts are well aware of these challenges and
recognize the need [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} work with allies to protect
shared security interests in these strategically important regions. For
instance, the NSCAI's interim report recommends
[[assist]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[NATO in]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[adoption of AI]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [[negotiating]{.mark}
**[formal AI cooperation agreements]{.mark}**]{.underline} with allies
and partners like Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and
Vietnam.61 Moreover, **[the report explicitly recommends
that]{.underline}** U.S. alliances, primarily **[NATO, "[explore pilot
projects in low-risk areas such as]{.mark}]{.underline}** for enterprise
**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** applications
(**[[logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}** and sustainment) **[[to derive
lessons that would support broader application of AI systems for
alliance efforts]{.mark}."62]{.underline}**

Along similar lines, in their assessment of U.S. competitiveness in the
Indo-Pacific region, the Center for a New American Security recommends
integrating logistics and sustainment considerations into the U.S.
military strategy and operational concept development for China in order
to ensure that the United States is able to project and sustain combat
power in the Indo-Pacific region. 63 These efforts, however, could be
strengthened by paying closer attention to the role AI/ML technologies
could have in enabling more responsive logistics systems as well as in
building the capacity of key partners in the region.

[Certainly, when it comes to]{.underline} international collaboration in
general, or [collaborative AI projects related to military logistics and
sustainment]{.underline} more specifically, [disagreements and
complications are inevitable]{.underline}. The past four years have seen
more friction between NATO member states as well as between the United
States and NATO. [Rebuilding U.S. alliances is high on the Biden
administration's agenda]{.underline}. But **[[restoring trust and good
collaborative relationships takes time, effort, and
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, [[NATO]{.mark} member
[states have]{.mark} very [different]{.mark} military and technological
[capabilities which makes it difficult to implement alliance-wide
initiatives]{.mark}.]{.underline} And while confronting China's
assertiveness is a top priority for the United States, many of the
United States' European and Asia-Pacific allies have economic and
technological relationships with China. Their objectives vis-à-vis China
on questions of geopolitics and technology are not necessarily aligned
with those of the United States.

[[Nevertheless]{.mark}, the strategic and operational [arguments in
favor of working together on AI]{.mark}-enabled [logistics]{.mark} and
sustainment [are]{.mark} quite [powerful]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[AI can enable applications in]{.mark} fields as diverse as
**[health]{.mark}**, **[robotics]{.mark}**, **[defence]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} **[ag]{.mark}**riculture]{.underline}. Where should the
focus of potential transatlantic cooperation lie?

If Europe and the US agree to focus on AI ethics, then they should seek
to develop common rules and guidelines that both sides can enforce in
their jurisdictions. However, if they agree that their shared goal is to
slow down other actors' -- particularly China's -- AI advances, they
will need to engage in more targeted forms of cooperation. US
researchers have proposed several specific initiatives for international
cooperation, such as coordinating investment screening procedures, and
establishing common export controls on supply chain components, to
ensure China remains dependent on imports of AI chips. This would be in
addition to the long line of measures already introduced by the US
Department of Commerce. These include requirements for Chinese company
Huawei to apply for licences to purchase semiconductors, a measure that
aims to exert economic pressure and disrupt Chinese technology supply
chains.

As noted, [[agreeing on]{.mark} shared [goals and]{.mark} supporting
[measures will present]{.mark} some [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Beyond the specific themes of ethical AI and slowing Chinese progress
in AI, however, there are other areas for transatlantic AI
cooperation]{.underline}. [[Investing in]{.mark} these potentially [less
controversial areas may]{.mark} help create new platforms and **[lay
important groundwork for greater cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, the transatlantic allies should facilitate the exchange of
knowledge and best practices on AI, and invest in mutually beneficial
research, such as privacy-preserving machine learning.

**[[Defence might]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[be a promising area
for transatlantic cooperation, given]{.mark} the [close military
ties]{.mark} between the US and Europe [through
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Military experts are raising
concerns]{.mark} [over]{.mark} how the introduction of AI onto the
battlefield may hinder [interoperability]{.mark} between allied forces,
[so defence could be a good realm]{.mark} in which [to strengthen
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Militaries]{.mark} on both sides of the Atlantic [are already
investing in AI]{.mark}-enabled capabilities. In military affairs, as in
the civilian realm, AI has a variety of uses. Military AI applications
include autonomous vehicles and weapons; intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance; logistics]{.underline} (for example, the predictive
maintenance of military systems such as vehicles and weapons);
[forecasting; and training]{.underline} (such as that in virtual reality
simulations).

Some of these military capabilities -- namely, lethal autonomous weapon
systems, or "killer robots" -- are among the most controversial uses of
AI. The US and its European allies have adopted different positions on
this issue in international debates such as those at the United Nations
in Geneva, where lethal autonomous weapons have been under discussion
since 2014. Transatlantic cooperation on lethal autonomous weapons, or
other combat-related capabilities, does not, therefore, look promising.

However, **[[military AI includes many non-controversial
uses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[such as]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[sustainment']{.underline}, which encompasses
**[[logistics]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well as support activities such
as financial management, personnel services, and health care. [AI helps
make these services more efficient and cost-effective;]{.underline} for
example, predictive maintenance helps in monitoring a system, such as an
aircraft, and can do things such as use various sensory inputs and data
analysis to predict when parts of a system will need to be replaced.
Equally[, AI can help improve logistics' efficiency]{.underline} by, for
instance, ensuring that supplies are delivered in appropriate quantities
and at the right time. **[[Transatlantic cooperation in this]{.mark}
field [is uncontroversial, but extremely useful]{.mark}]{.underline}**
-- **[especially [when carried out within NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
as **[[this could]{.mark} help [bring allies closer together, establish
joint procedures, and]{.mark} thereby [ensure
interoperability]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Which forum is [best for fostering transatlantic AI
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**? [The [US and]{.mark} most of its
European [allies already work together]{.mark} in a multitude of
settings, **[with NATO foremost]{.mark}** among them]{.underline}.
[[Other]{.mark} international [organisations]{.mark} and
meetings]{.underline} -- such as the G7, the G20, and the Five Eyes --
[[bring together]{.mark} the US and **[some]{.mark}**
Europeans]{.underline}, as well as other actors. In addition, several
new alliances and partnerships focused on technology or AI have been
proposed or were already established over the last year: [Europe and the
US will need to choose the appropriate forum for AI
cooperation]{.underline} based on its area of focus. **[[Transatlantic
cooperation on military AI might be best located within
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Members]{.mark} of the alliance [have a
long history of working together, and NATO already has dedicated units
whose task is to ensure]{.mark} that all [allies can cooperate and
transform together]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Given that military
interoperability is vital to its functioning, NATO has **no
alternative** but to address this issue]{.underline}, [independent of
other forums']{.underline}]{.mark} [work]{.underline}. It would be
advisable for NATO, and possibly the EU and its member states, to join
the newly established, US-led AI partnership for defence. [[The]{.mark}
current [situation]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} the partnership [[includes **only**
]{.mark}**a few European countries**]{.underline} and
[[some]{.underline}]{.mark} of the United States' other like-minded
[[partners]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[[is not
constructive]{.underline}]{.mark}** from a European viewpoint:
**[Europeans should [strive for Europe-wide harmonisation, not the
creation of further differences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For cooperation
on other areas of AI, such as sharing data or supporting research, other
forums, including ad hoc alliances aimed at specific outcomes, may be
the way forward. From a European standpoint, however, it would be
advisable to try to include the EU as much as possible, so that European
positions are not watered down or member states divided among
themselves.

Introduction

One does not have to look far to see how [Artificial Intelligence
([AI]{.mark}]{.underline}) -- the ability of machines to perform tasks
that typically require human intelligence -- [[is transforming the
international]{.mark} [security environment in which NATO
operates]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Due to its cross-cutting nature, [AI
will pose a broad set of]{.mark} international security
[challenges]{.mark}, [affecting both **traditional military
capabilities** and the realm of **hybrid threats**, and]{.mark} will
likewise provide new opportunities to respond to them]{.underline}. [[AI
will]{.mark} have an [impact]{.mark} on **[all of NATO's core
tasks]{.mark}** of collective defence, crisis management, and
cooperative security]{.underline}.

[With new [opportunities]{.mark}, risks, [and threats]{.mark} to
prosperity and security at stake, the promise and peril associated with
this foundational technology [are too vast for any single actor]{.mark}
to manage alone]{.underline}. [As a result]{.underline}, **[[cooperation
is inherently needed to]{.mark} equally [mitigate]{.mark} international
security risks, [as well as]{.mark} to [capitalise]{.mark} on the
technology's potential to transform enterprise functions, mission
support, and operations]{.underline}**.

[[The]{.mark} continued [ability of the Alliance to deter]{.mark} and
[defend]{.mark} against any potential adversary [and]{.mark} to [respond
effectively to]{.mark} emerging [crises]{.mark} [will hinge on
its]{.mark} ability to maintain its [tech]{.mark}nological
[edge]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Militarily, [futureproofing the comparative
advantage of Allied forces will depend on]{.mark} a **[common
policy]{.mark}** basis **[and digital backbone to ensure
interoperability and accordance with international
law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[With the fusion of human, information, and
physical elements]{.mark} increasingly determining decisive advantage in
the battlespace, [interoperability becomes]{.mark} all the more
[essential]{.mark}.]{.underline} Further, [[as]{.mark} competitors and
potential [adversaries invest in AI for military purposes,
ensuring]{.mark} that Allies develop [common responses]{.mark} to ensure
their collective security [will]{.mark} only [be]{.mark}come more
[urgent]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[With the formal adoption of the NATO AI Strategy]{.mark}, **[Allies
have committed to the necessary cooperation]{.mark}** and collaboration
to meet these very challenges in both defence and security, **[naming
NATO as the primary transatlantic forum]{.mark}**. [The aim]{.mark} of
NATO's AI Strategy [is to accelerate AI adoption]{.mark} by enhancing
key AI enablers and adapting policy, [including]{.mark} by adopting
[Principles of Responsible Use]{.mark} for AI and by safeguarding
against threats from malicious use of AI by state and non-state
actors]{.underline}.

[By [acting]{.mark} collectively [through NATO]{.mark}, Allied
governments]{.underline} also [[ensure]{.mark} a continued focus on
[**interoperability** and]{.mark} the development of **[common
standards]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Overall, with innovation ecosystems
implicating different actors and faster technology lifecycles than
typically included in traditional capability development systems, [the
NATO AI Strategy is]{.mark} also [a recognition that]{.mark}
exploitation of AI [will require]{.mark} new efforts to foster and
leverage the Alliance's [innovation]{.mark} potential, including
[through new partnerships and mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Taken
together, [these]{.mark} efforts will in turn [strengthen]{.mark} [the
Alliance's ability to]{.mark} pursue cooperative security efforts and to
[engage with international partners and **other international
organisations**]{.mark} on matters of international
security]{.underline}.

Principles of Responsible Use

[Adopting [AI]{.mark} in the defence and security context]{.underline}
also [[calls for effective and responsible
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}, in line with the common values and
international commitments of Allied nations. To that end, [[Allied
governments have committed to Principles of Responsible Use as a key
component]{.mark} of NATO's AI Strategy]{.underline}.

Allies and NATO commit to ensuring that the AI applications they develop
and consider for deployment will be in accordance with the following six
principles:

Lawfulness: AI applications will be developed and used in accordance
with national and international law, including international
humanitarian law and human rights law, as applicable.

Responsibility and Accountability: AI applications will be developed and
used with appropriate levels of judgment and care; clear human
responsibility shall apply in order to ensure accountability.

Explainability and Traceability: AI applications will be appropriately
understandable and transparent, including through the use of review
methodologies, sources, and procedures. This includes verification,
assessment and validation mechanisms at either a NATO and/or national
level.

Reliability: AI applications will have explicit, well-defined use cases.
The safety, security, and robustness of such capabilities will be
subject to testing and assurance within those use cases across their
entire life cycle, including through established NATO and/or national
certification procedures.

Governability: AI applications will be developed and used according to
their intended functions and will allow for: appropriate human-machine
interaction; the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences;
and the ability to take steps, such as disengagement or deactivation of
systems, when such systems demonstrate unintended behaviour.

Bias Mitigation: Proactive steps will be taken to minimise any
unintended bias in the development and use of AI applications and in
data sets.

[[Having agreed to]{.mark}]{.underline} adopt these [mutually
reinforcing **[principles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[the task now turns
to]{.mark} translating them into principled
**[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such, NATO's role in
operationalising these principles will involve efforts that similarly
tackle different aspects of the technology's lifecycle. [[Building the
principles]{.mark} of responsible use **[into the front end of AI
development is important because, the later they are considered, the
harder it may be to ensure they are upheld.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[Ensuring a full life-cycle approach]{.mark} also [depends on
multi-stakeholder engagement because responsibility is diffused
amongst]{.mark} the [policymakers, designers, developers, and
testers]{.mark}, as well as operational end users that engage in AI
development and use]{.underline}. [For NATO, this is relevant because
various entities play an active role in AI integration, and because [the
Alliance can encourage coherence with national AI
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For NATO, the [common commitment to these principles has practical
advantages as well, [providing a coherent common basis for]{.mark} both
[NATO and Allies to]{.mark} design and [develop AI applications]{.mark}
while also [supporting interoperability]{.mark} goals.]{.underline} As
such, **[[NATO can foster the necessary interlinkages between safety,
security, responsible use, and interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This can be seen across the principles. [For instance, it is important
to ensure that AI systems are adequately robust and reliable for their
intended use, not only so that they can be expected to function in
accordance with legal obligations, but also to mitigate the risks of the
system's defects or limitations being exploited by nefarious
actors]{.underline}.

Putting Principles into Practice

[These enduring principles are]{.underline} also [foundational to the
discussion and adoption of more detailed best practices and
standards]{.underline}. [[Allies and NATO can leverage NATO's
consultative mechanisms]{.mark} [and NATO's specialised staff and
facilities to work]{.mark} actively [towards that
goal]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[NATO's]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[own
[standardisation and certification efforts can]{.mark} also [be
bolstered by coherence with relevant international standard-setting
bodies, including for civilian AI standards]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[In addition to best practices and standards, these]{.underline}
[principles]{.underline} [can]{.underline} also [be operationalised via
other mechanisms including review methodologies, risk and impact
assessments, and security certification requirements like threat
analysis frameworks and audits, among others]{.underline}. Further,
**[[NATO's cooperative activities provide the basis to test, evaluate,
validate, and verify]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[TEVV) [AI-enabled
capabilities in various]{.mark} different
[contexts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** More specifically, **[NATO's
experience not only in operations, but also in [trials, exercises, and
experimentation]{.mark} provide several avenues [in]{.mark} which Allies
and [NATO can test principles against intended use
cases]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This is further [reinforced by NATO's
scientific and technical communities, which have worked on]{.mark}
issues such as [trust, human-machine and machine-machine interactions,
and human-systems integration]{.mark}, among many others]{.underline}.

[In addition to these existing activities, the implementation of the AI
Strategy will also benefit from connections with NATO's forthcoming
Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic]{.underline}
(DIANA). [[Allied Test Centres]{.mark} affiliated with DIANA
[could]{.mark} be used to [fulfil the aims set out in the definitions of
the principles]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the future, [use of
these [Test Centres]{.mark} can]{.underline} help
[[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[AI]{.mark} [adoption]{.mark} and
integration [are tested for robustness and
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example]{.underline}, to ensure
that AI is Traceable, Reliable and Bias-mitigating, [[Test Centres could
synthesise how AI systems]{.mark} [perform in different simulated
environments]{.mark} and on different testing data, or provide
independent validation and verification [to assess compliance with
standards that focus on responsible engineering
practices.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Through the adoption of principles of responsible use, [[**NATO and
Allies are sending a deliberately public message** to their]{.mark}
domestic [populations]{.mark}, to Allied [forces, and]{.mark} to [other
states]{.mark}, reiterating the Alliance's enduring values and
commitments under international law]{.underline}. More than just an
obligation, **[[this democratic commitment is]{.mark} also [a
pre-condition for common policy bases among Allies -- and for
partnership with non-traditional innovator]{.mark}s across the
Alliance.]{.underline}**

Accelerating principled and interoperable adoption

**[[With the ethical aspects of adoption that the principles underscore,
NATO has the chance to signal -- and follow through on -- responsibility
at the core of its outreach efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This
includes engagement with start-ups, innovative small and medium
enterprises, and academic researchers that either have not considered
working on defence and security solutions, or simply find the adoption
pathways too slow or restrictive for their business models]{.underline}.
In contrast to the development of traditional military platforms, [AI
integration entails fast refresh cycles and requires constant
upgrading.]{.underline} [This requires a change of mind-set for
iterative, adaptive capability development, in contrast to sequential
development cycles that take years to deliver small numbers of highly
sophisticated platforms]{.underline}. [With hostile]{.underline} state
and non-state [actors increasing]{.underline} their [investments
in]{.underline} Emerging and Disruptive Technologies including
[AI]{.underline}, [this more flexible approach to adoption is all the
more urgent]{.underline}. **[In this context, [with its focus on TEVV
and collaborative activities, the AI Strategy sets the framework for
technological enablers to out-adapt competitors and
adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [With more of a focus on
agility and adaptation]{.underline}, [NATO can make defence and security
a more attractive sector for civilian innovators to partner with, while
also allowing them to maintain other commercial
opportunities]{.underline}. In doing so, [efforts to bolster the
transatlantic innovation ecosystem can also serve as a bulwark against
undesirable foreign investment and technology transfers]{.underline}.

[This work requires coordination across the NATO
Enterprise]{.underline}. Indeed, [several stakeholders across the NATO
Enterprise are already involved in the development of AI-related use
cases, concepts, and programmes]{.underline}. [With the AI Strategy,
these activities can gain coherence to ensure the proper connections
exist between all innovation stakeholders, including operational
end-users]{.underline}.

Moving Ahead

To be sure, the implementation of accelerated, principled, and
interoperable AI adoption depends not just on technology, but equally on
the talented and empowered people who drive the technological
state-of-the-art and integration forward. NATO has also dedicated
attention to other AI inputs, notably through the development of a NATO
Data Exploitation Framework Policy. With actions to treat data as a
strategic asset, develop analytical tools, and store and manage data in
the appropriate infrastructure, the Data Exploitation Framework Policy
sets the conditions for the AI Strategy's success.

In addition to the interrelationships between data and AI, ensuring
coherence between NATO's efforts on AI and other Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies such as autonomy, biotechnology, and quantum computing will
be vital. [As Allies and NATO seek to fulfil the aim of this AI
Strategy, the linkages between responsible use, accelerated adoption,
interoperability, and safeguarding against threats are
critical]{.underline}. Indeed, [these]{.underline} linkages [will also
apply to NATO's follow-on work on other Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies, including the development of principles of responsible
use]{.underline}. More broadly, [this entails further coherence between
the work strands on these technologies, understanding that NATO's future
technological edge -- and threats the Alliance will face -- may depend
on their convergence]{.underline}.

[As such, not only does the NATO AI Strategy apply to this foundational
technology, but it also sets the stage for NATO's and Allies' ambitions
with regards to other Emerging and Disruptive Technologies]{.underline}.
[For each of them, the future strategic advantage that comes with NATO
innovation efforts will derive from the connections between ethical
leadership, iterative adoption, and integration that prizes flexibility,
interoperability, and trust]{.underline}.

#### US-NATO cooperation is key to AI leadership\-\--the US and Europe each have strengths, they just need a forum to effectively coordinate strategies to maximize return\-\--diffusion and development of AI is inevitable, it's only a question of maintaining the relative lead\-\--no counterplan can solve all the internal links\-\--process is either normal means, causes delays, or discourages necessary private investment

[This article provides a brief overview of]{.underline} European and
[transatlantic defence cooperation in the area of]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence. [[As states
race]{.mark} forward [to]{.mark} achieve [superiority
in]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, including its military
applications, [[NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and partner nations [on
both sides of the Atlantic [have a strong incentive to cooperate]{.mark}
closely [and ]{.mark}]{.underline}ensure the collective West can
[[maintain its tech]{.mark}nological [edge]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[large gaps remain between the US
and]{.mark} the [EU on]{.mark} [certain key
indicators]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [To ensure greater European
performance and relevance]{.underline}, it is desirable to [[focus
on]{.underline}]{.mark} two strategic priorities: [investment volumes,
both public and private, which need to be significantly
[increased]{.mark}; and the **full [use of collaborative mechanisms
involving the US.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence ([[AI]{.mark}) is the ability of machines to
perform tasks that typically require human
intelligence]{.underline}---for example, [recognising patterns, learning
from experience, drawing conclusions, making predictions or taking
action]{.underline}---[whether digitally or as the smart software behind
autonomous physical systems (]{.underline}Reding and Eaton 2020, 14).

[The range of [potential military applications is]{.mark} at least as
**[vast]{.mark}** as the range of tasks that require human
cognition]{.underline}, for example [analysing and classifying visual
data, organising logistics, operating support vehicles, or tracking and
engaging hostile targets]{.underline} (Christie 2021b, 84). [[States are
racing to achieve superiority]{.mark} in the AI domain]{.underline}
(Lin-Greenberg 2020). [Furthermore, like other digital technologies, [AI
diffuses rapidly and cheaply]{.mark} across areas of human activity and
across borders]{.underline}. [[Nevertheless]{.mark}, as with other
technological transformations, **[states with]{.mark}** greater
resources and levels of effort, and **[better policies, will
reap]{.mark} the [benefits]{.mark}** of technology adoption **[more
rapidly]{.mark}** than others]{.underline}.

[In an alliance context, matters pertaining to
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} and interoperability [take centre
stage]{.underline}. [The [good news is]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[Europeans are [not starting from scratch]{.mark}]{.underline}. European
states that are members of [[NATO can rely on decades of experience
with]{.mark} the Alliance's mechanisms of [**consultation** and
collaboration]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition, European states that
are members of the EU can pursue collaborative activities through the
European Defence Agency (EDA). Furthermore, EU funding is available
through the European Defence Fund for defence research and
capability-development activities.

[At [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[key processes
address]{.mark},]{.underline} most notably, the areas of [[defence
research, military transformation, capability
development]{.underline}]{.mark}, military--technical [[standardisation,
and defence planning]{.underline}]{.mark} and capability targets. [For
these areas of work, [formal consultative
mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}---[committees in which each Ally has a
voice]{.underline}---[[include]{.underline}]{.mark} the Science and
Technology Board, the Military Committee, the Conference of National
Armaments Directors, the NATO Standardisation Board, and the Defence
Policy and Planning Committee. Each of these
[[committees]{.underline}]{.mark} relies on [[support staffs and
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Of particular interest when
considering AI are the Science and Technology Organisation]{.underline},
which has several facilities and is led by the Office of the Chief
Scientist at NATO Headquarters; [and, Allied Command
Transformation]{.underline}. [The latter]{.underline}, including its
Innovation Hub, [plays a particularly central role in driving innovation
and force transformation for the Alliance]{.underline}. In addition,
[two staff units created in 2019 are of particular importance, namely
the Innovation Unit and the Data Policy Unit, both of which are within
the Emerging Security Challenges Division]{.underline} of the NATO
International Staff. [The Innovation Unit provides thought leadership
and initiatives to accelerate technology adoption, while the Data Policy
Unit provides policy thought leadership on how to treat data as a
strategic resource. The Innovation Unit designs new initiatives for the
promotion and financing of defence-related innovation. A notable
achievement in this area was the creation of the NATO Innovation
Fund]{.underline} (NATO 2021).

In the EU context, the EDA plays a central role in several areas of
work. Among other activities, the EDA supports defence research
cooperation, defence standardisation and pooled procurement programmes,
while also contributing to the EU's Capability Development Plan and
Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (Fiott 2018, 287). Most of the
EDA's functions are broadly analogous to ones that exist at NATO. Of
particular interest is the intention to create a new Defence Innovation
Hub within the EDA, as announced in the EU's November 2021 draft
Strategic Compass (European External Action Service 2021, 23).

Before proceeding, [it is worth spelling out the extent to which
[European security is dependent on NATO and in particular]{.mark} on
[the US]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Of]{.underline} the EU's [27]{.underline}
member [states, 21 are members of NATO]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
countries [account for about 93% of the population1 of the
EU.]{.underline} [Within NATO, those Allies that are also EU members
only account for about 20% of total defence expenditure across the
Alliance, while the US alone accounts for about 70% of the same
total]{.underline}.2 Beyond these aggregate indicators, it is
furthermore the case that **[[the US is considerably ahead]{.mark} of
the EU [in]{.mark} terms of practical adoption of
[AI]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For illustration, in 2020 [US private-sector
investment]{.underline} in AI [was]{.underline} around \$23.6 billion,
but was only \$2 billion in the EU, [implying a ratio of 12 to 1 in
favour of the US]{.underline} (Zhang et al. 2021, 96). [Scientific
output indicators offer a more nuanced picture.]{.underline} In 2019,
[the EU accounted for 16.4% of the world's peer-reviewed AI
publications, ahead of the US with 14.6%, while China occupied the top
spot with 22.4%]{.underline} (Zhang et al. 2021, 20). On the other hand,
[if one measures research output in terms of publications on the Arxiv
database, the US is ahead of the EU (]{.underline}Zhang et al. 2021, 33)
[by a ratio of almost two to one, which is nonetheless much less than
the large gap in private investment mentioned above]{.underline}. [That
[the EU performs similarly]{.mark} to the US [in]{.mark} terms of
scientific [research, but far less]{.mark} well [in]{.mark} terms of
[investment and commercialisation]{.mark} of new digital technologies,
is **[an old problem which has proven very difficult to
address]{.mark}**, whether at national or EU level]{.underline} (Baroudy
et al. 2020).

In the following sections, I offer reflections on [[three
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline} area[[s]{.mark} for European and Allied
defence institutions]{.underline}:
**[[interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}** challenges,
**[[international security]{.underline}]{.mark}** challenges **[[and
investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** challenges. [These]{.underline} three
challenges [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively
**[[interdependent]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While [[interoperability
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a permanent goal in an alliance context, be it
NATO or the EU, it is **[[particularly salient in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
cases of [[rapid tech]{.mark}nological [change]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[such as with AI]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[as there is a need for a
**higher tempo** across areas of activity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Heightened [international security challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}
likewise **[[increase the need for urgency]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} ensure that Western nations do [[not fall
behind]{.mark} potential [adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Investment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in turn**[, [is the engine for
rapid change]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[enabling]{.mark} the [dynamic
adoption]{.mark} of new technologies, relevant
[capability-development]{.mark} activities [and]{.mark} other
[adaptations]{.mark} along the value chain of military
activities]{.underline}. Overall, my central argument is that **[[the
confluence of rapid tech]{.mark}nological [change and heightened
international security challenges requires a higher pace of change and
adaptation that can only succeed if serious investments are made on both
sides of the Atlantic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[Interoperability challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Interoperability can be defined as 'the ability of systems, units or
forces to provide services to, and accept services from other systems,
units or forces and the use the services so exchanged to enable them to
operate effectively together' (Dufour 2018, 1).

[The [first]{.mark} general challenge to interoperability is the overall
gap between the US and Europe in terms of total defence investment, as
well as in terms of civilian technological attainment with respect to AI
and related technologies]{.underline}. **[[There is no single
solution]{.mark} to this problem]{.underline}**, [[which is much broader
in scope than]{.mark} traditional military--technical
[standards]{.mark}, such as those pursued in the NATO context through
existing mechanisms]{.underline}. [[For this]{.underline}]{.mark} broad
challenge, [**[overall]{.mark}** policy decisions relating to national
investment choices and technology **[policy coordination between the two
sides]{.mark}** of the Atlantic **[are of particular
importance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Further discussion of this follows in
the sections on investment challenges and international security
challenges.

[A [second]{.mark} challenge to interoperability is]{.underline} that,
as far as digital technologies are concerned[, [the civilian
sector]{.mark} of the economy, on both sides]{.underline} of the
Atlantic[, [is more advanced]{.underline}]{.mark}, more [[dynamic
and]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} especially
[[oriented towards]{.underline}]{.mark} meeting [[military
needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For decades, the military sector has
represented only a very small share of the total sales volume of the
computing and semiconductor industries]{.underline}. [The same pattern
is repeating itself currently with AI.]{.underline} This stands in great
contrast to narrower dual-use technologies, for example aerospace, where
the military sector remains inherently important. [With digital
technologies, defence institutions are under much more pressure to
either adapt to civilian industry products and standards or to pay a
significant premium to suppliers to secure military-grade equipment and
software]{.underline}.

A [[third]{.underline}]{.mark} challenge to interoperability [lies in
[how AI is implemented in practice]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To set up a
bespoke machine-learning algorithm in a given data environment, [best
practice]{.mark} in the software industry [is]{.mark} to pursue some
variant of '[agile' development]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This involves a
very different product-development cycle]{.underline}, essentially
[proceeding with multiple rapid iterations of an imperfect product that
is released in preliminary versions and later revised---like software
products released in various 'beta versions'---with upgrades developed
over time]{.underline}. [[This contrasts greatly with]{.mark} the
[traditional]{.mark} production of major [military
platforms]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which puts a premium on strict quality
control and compliance with requirements at every development step---an
approach referred to in the software industry as 'waterfall'
development]{.underline} (Christie 2021b, 87). [[Agile product
development may pose challenges to interoperability]{.mark}. [Unless
very tight standards are applied,]{.mark} [there is a considerable risk
of divergences]{.mark} in how different national institutions go about
solving a particular AI or data analytics problem]{.underline}.

[[With]{.mark} large [traditional military platforms there are long time
frames during which states can take coordination
steps]{.mark}]{.underline}, either by purchasing the same platforms, or
by building consensus in terms of requirements and standards.
[[However]{.mark}, when a comparatively small team works dynamically to
generate an algorithmic solution to a particular problem in a matter of
weeks or months, **[traditional coordination through existing
consultation mechanisms may pose risks to the speed advantage inherent
to agile development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Conversely, once a
solution has been developed, its adoption in somewhat different
environments may be challenging for a range of technical reasons.
[No]{.mark}ne of these]{.underline} [[issue]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[is
insurmountable, but they]{.mark} do [pose]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a new
light, [classical trade-offs between the benefits of inventiveness and
dynamism, on the one hand, and those of imposing constraints through
standards and other harmonising measures to ensure that new products can
be broadly used and shared on the other]{.underline}. [In the case of
AI,]{.underline} a typical observation is that [there are many excellent
prototypes and pilot projects]{.underline} in numerous defence
institutions, [but]{.underline} there are also [serious]{.underline}
outstanding [[challenges in]{.mark} terms of [scaling up
to]{.mark}]{.underline} enterprise-wide solutions, let alone
[[Alliance-wide solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, the question of [[ethical
AI]{.underline}]{.mark}---or responsible AI---[[generates considerable
attention]{.mark} on the part of governments and civil society. In
response, [NATO]{.mark} sought to establish a consensus on certain
[essential principles,]{.mark}]{.underline} referred to as [Principles
of Responsible Use]{.underline}, [which build on emerging national
commitments. These]{.underline} principles [[were endorsed by Allied
governments]{.mark} in October]{.underline} 2021 (Stanley-Lockman and
Christie 2021).

**[[International security challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Both [EU]{.underline} nations [and the US are exposed to the same
[global environment and]{.mark} to similar [strategic concerns, at the
confluence of rapid technological change and global power
shifts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Starting from around 2018, policy discourse
in the US became [[particularly]{.underline}]{.mark} focused on fears of
[[being overtaken by China]{.mark} technologically and
militarily]{.underline}. A good illustration of these fears is a 2020
statement by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who
accused the Chinese government of 'fighting a generational fight to
surpass our country in economic and technological leadership' and of
'taking an all-tools and all-sectors approach . . . that demands our own
all-tools and all-sectors approach in response' (Wray 2020).

[[For military AI, China poses the greatest challenge]{.mark} to Western
nations]{.underline} (Kania 2019). [However, [Russia is also actively
pursuing]{.mark} such [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zysk 2021;
Engvall 2021), [including [through espionage]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example against the Netherlands (AIVD 2020) and France (Follorou 2021).

[Nations on [both sides]{.mark} of the Atlantic have [recognise]{.mark}d
[the rising challenge of Chinese and Russian]{.mark}
government-sponsored industrial espionage aimed at the illegitimate
[acquisition of cutting-edge Western]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies. And
[both]{.mark} the US and the EU [have adopted strengthened legislation
in]{.mark} several [key areas]{.mark}, including on the protection of
trade secrets, on export controls for dual-use items and on the
screening of foreign direct investment]{.underline} (Christie 2021a).
[Another relevant area of work is measures to better protect the
university and research sector from espionage. A new toolkit of
recommendations now exists at EU level]{.underline} (European Commission
2022).

**[[Investment challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**

As noted in the introduction, [there is a significant gap between
overall US and European defence spending levels]{.underline}. This
general pattern also holds for defence research and development
spending. In 2020, EU spending in this area amounted to €8 billion (EDA
2021). For the US, with caveats as to comparability, expenditure for
'research, development, test and evaluation' totalled approximately €90
billion3 in the 2021 fiscal year (from October 2020 to September 2021),
or about 10 times more.

[Investment challenges [go beyond]{.mark} issues of [scale]{.mark}.
**[The US]{.mark} also [has greater experience in]{.mark}** the
**[setting up and operation of structures to promote both military and
dual-use innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the best-known
institution is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, other US
government structures are also [relevant in discussions on fostering
innovation in AI for military applications]{.underline}. A
much-discussed example is In-Q-Tel, which was originally set up as the
state venture-capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency. To
illustrate the influence of the In-Q-Tel example, one may note that both
its current Chief Executive Officer, Chris Darby, and one of its former
Chief Executive Officers, Gilman Louie, served among the 15
commissioners of the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence.4 This was a temporarily created expert commission mandated
by the US Congress to provide policy recommendations for a
whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach for US AI policy.5

[With In-Q-Tel, the idea is to learn from private-sector practices in
the area of venture-capital investment and repurpose them for state
needs and more patient time horizons]{.underline}. A supported company
should pursue product development strategies aimed at serving both
civilian markets and government needs. In this way, rather than
effectively taking over a commercial company and limiting its growth
potential to future government contracts alone, [the
government]{.underline} body [encourages an intermediate trajectory made
up of mixed revenue streams, in the hope that this will generate greater
returns to scale and higher efficiency thanks to the disciplining effect
of private-sector competition.]{.underline} [Conversely, the advantage
of this approach as compared to not intervening at all is that the
commercial company will integrate current and likely future government
needs into its product and business-development strategy, rather than
ignoring them and finding itself, at a later date, unable to supply the
government sector according to the latter's requirements.]{.underline}

[A related issue]{.underline} which falls between what can be achieved
with new investment instruments and new protections that can be assured
through the screening of foreign direct investment [is the provision of
investment from trusted private investors to the technology sector.
Certain technology companies that are not part of the traditional
defence industry may be developing dual-use products that are of
potential interest to the defence sector while having limited awareness
of national security concerns]{.underline}. [This may make them
vulnerable targets for both licit and illicit attempts to acquire their
technologies on the part of foreign state actors]{.underline}. At the
same time, [their business development needs may lead them to seek
investment from any potential source, thus exposing them to potential
risks]{.underline}. To [respond to this challenge, the US Department of
Defense has launched a scheme called the Trusted Capital
Marketplace]{.underline} (US Department of Defense 2021a).

[Building on these considerations, the [NATO]{.mark} Innovation Unit has
developed two new instruments for Allied use which were announced to the
public in October 2021]{.underline} (NATO 2021a; 2021b). [Both
[instruments]{.mark} aim to [foster]{.mark} technological [innovation
with a deliberate focus on dual-use applications]{.mark} and on
enterprises with mixed (potential) revenue streams]{.underline}. The
[first]{.underline} instrument is the [Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which is a NATO instrument, that is, it
involves the participation of all 30 NATO Allies]{.underline}. [The
second instrument is the NATO Innovation Fund, which in NATO terminology
is a 'multinational' instrument, namely one that Allies freely opt
into]{.underline}.

[DIANA will]{.underline} aim to [accelerate]{.underline} the [adoption
of dual-use technological solutions through several interlocking
components]{.underline}.6 [First, it will develop a network of national
organisations, in particular test centres and innovation
accelerators]{.underline}. Second, it will [competitively select
private-sector innovators and allow them to use national organisations
in the network to interface with military end users and military
capability-development specialists.]{.underline} Third, it is envisaged
that DIANA will [provide mentorship and education services for private
innovators to familiarise them with the opportunities and
responsibilities inherent to the defence and security
sector.]{.underline} Fourth, DIANA will [develop a database of trusted
financial investors from Allied nations and support matchmaking between
investors and innovators]{.underline}. Fifth [and finally]{.underline},
DIANA will also [provide expert advice on defence and security
innovation to all relevant stakeholders, including private-sector and
academic entities]{.underline}.

[Regarding the NATO Innovation Fund, 17]{.underline} Allies had [opted
into the Fund]{.underline} as of the date of its announcement in October
2021. The [participating Allies will inject up to €1 billion into Allied
innovation ecosystems over the next 15 years.]{.underline} The Fund aims
[to attract additional private investments due to the de-risking effect,
both financial and technological, thanks to state co-funding and
diligence and screening efforts.]{.underline} The funds are [intended to
be used for long-term support of 'deep tech' innovative companies, that
is, for advanced research into AI, quantum and related technologies that
may have both military and civilian applications. Due diligence and
security screening practices will aim to ensure that both private
investors and fund recipients are trusted entities]{.underline}.

Conclusions

[[Much has already been achieved in]{.mark} terms of [new
structures,]{.mark} new [initiatives and]{.mark} new [policy
developments to support]{.mark} the [collaborative adoption of AI among
NATO Allies]{.mark}]{.underline} and EU member states. [[In addition to
pre-existing structures]{.mark} and mechanisms at both the NATO and EU
levels, [which]{.mark} have **[ensure]{.mark}d that nations are [not
starting from scratch]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[national]{.mark} defence
[institutions]{.mark} are [already]{.mark} able to [refer to
common]{.mark} [policy commitments and]{.mark} to
[options]{.mark},]{.underline} whether through NATO or the EDA, [[for
research or capability-development activities]{.underline}]{.mark}. At
the same time, [[ensuring a competitive edge in AI is a]{.mark} truly
[whole-of-government effort]{.mark} which requires considerable
cross-over between the military and civilian realms]{.underline}.

**[[Large gaps remain between the US and the EU on certain key
indicators]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [At the same time, the gaps
pertaining to research are far smaller]{.underline}. [[To ensure]{.mark}
greater European [performance and relevance in AI in general,
and]{.mark} its [defence applications in particular]{.mark}, it seems
desirable to [focus on]{.mark} two strategic priorities]{.underline}:
investment volumes, both public and private, which need to be
significantly increased; and **[[the full use of collaborative
mechanisms involving the US]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[To that end, [it would be beneficial for]{.mark} nations on [both
sides]{.mark} of the Atlantic [to ensure]{.mark} [that a clear and
common vision]{.mark} is set out [in]{.mark} forthcoming [strategic
documents]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [most notably]{.underline} the EU's
Strategic Compass and **[NATO's new Strategic Concept.]{.underline}**
**[[This should include clear political commitments to
increasing]{.mark} investment]{.underline}**, both in general and **[in
instruments for promoting [collaborative
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[There are opportunities for 'more
Europe']{.underline}]{.mark} through the EDA and the European Defence
Fund. **[[But while pursuing those]{.mark} avenues, European capitals
should [prioritise efforts that complement and enhance transatlantic
approaches, in recognition of the reality that the US remains the
indispensable ally for Europe's security]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

## NATO Advantage

Second, [incorporating AI-enabled capabilities into alliance planning
exercises and wargames will help prepare policymakers and commanders to
better employ AI]{.underline}.132 [Wargames, for instance, might ask
leaders to employ AI-enabled capabilities or respond to a rival's use of
AI-enabled weapons]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} events [allow
leaders to test and refine institutional processes in a low-risk
environment, while also socializing practitioners to the potential uses,
limitations, and risks of AI-enabled warfare]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[As additional funding and research drive increases in the effectiveness
and reliability of AI, the military use of AI technologies will likely
expand. And as more states integrate AI into their armed forces, the
United States will find itself working with allies to build and exercise
AI capabilities that are interoperable and support alliance
decision-making processes]{.underline}. **[Failure to cooperate early
and often on the development and use of AI may leave allies ill-prepared
for operations in an era in which AI is an increasingly common fixture
in the arsenals of both friends and foes.133]{.underline}**

[Alliances face two broad sets of challenges when integrating AI into
operations.]{.underline} [First, AI complicates alliance
operations]{.underline}. [The resource and data requirements needed to
build and maintain AI systems pose obstacles to burden-sharing and
interoperability]{.underline}. Adversaries can also use AI to launch
military deception campaigns that complicate operational coordination.
Second, [AI can significantly strain alliance
decision-making.]{.underline} New AI technologies promise to increase
the speed with which allies and adversaries conduct operations,
decreasing the time partners have to debate potential courses of action.
Decision-making can also be disrupted if adversaries use AI to generate
misinformation that can degrade trust among allies. [To overcome these
challenges, allies will need to establish multinational agreements and
standardization guidelines that help ensure data is structured in ways
that promote interoperability, while technical measures will help
preserve data privacy, allow for data sharing, and minimize the
consequences of AI use on the part of adversaries.]{.underline}

**[Whether and how states grapple with these challenges will shape the
conduct of multinational operations and has implications for alliance
politics and the global balance of power]{.underline}**. [Alliances that
effectively integrate AI technology will be better positioned to counter
threats, while those that allow AI to stymie decision-making and
operations may find themselves disadvantaged on the
battlefield.]{.underline} Within alliances, member states that quickly
master the integration of AI into their militaries may gain significant
influence, even if they are less powerful than other alliance partners
in conventional terms. Because of their AI know-how, these states may
play a dominant role in developing the norms, standards, and doctrine
for AI use and help set an alliance's AI strategy. In a similar vein,
Estonia leveraged its cyber warfare expertise to bolster its position in
NATO. Despite being territorially small and weak in conventional
military terms, Estonia's specialized expertise allowed it to play a
leading role in shaping NATO's cyber doctrine.134 A state's successful
development of AI can therefore increase its voice and sway within
complex multinational institutions.

This article represents a first step in understanding how the burgeoning
development of AI technologies will affect alliances, and offers a
framework for future hypothesis testing. Future work might more
systematically explore the ways in which AI-enabled systems influence
multinational military decision-making and operations. For instance, do
national security decision-makers trust information provided by AI
technologies more or less than information delivered by non-AI enabled
sources? Under what conditions are decision-makers more or less likely
to believe this information? Are military leaders from certain states
more willing than those from other states to rely on AI technologies? If
so, what drives this variation? Scholars might also try to identify the
types of technical or institutional solutions that best promote AI
interoperability. Do alliance decision-makers see formal agreements or
technical solutions as a more effective means of ensuring data sharing?
Scholars can explore these questions using a variety of methodological
approaches including experimental research involving alliance
decision-makers or in-depth case studies informed by interviews of
senior policymakers.

Researchers might also consider the effects of AI on alliances in areas
beyond decision-making and interoperability. For example, how does the
use of AI affect strategic stability, nuclear deterrence, and alliance
reassurance? Does the increased tempo of AI-enabled warfare make it
harder or easier for states to deter rivals and reassure allies? Studies
that address these questions would not only expand our scholarly
understanding of the relationship between emerging technology and
international security, but would help policymakers design better
processes and institutions for a security environment in which AI use is
becoming widespread.

As AI becomes increasingly common in military arsenals around the world,
it is crucial for states to understand the potential challenges AI poses
to multinational operations and work to overcome them. To prepare for
warfare at machine speed, alliances should develop policies and
practices that streamline data sharing and decision-making, and take
procedural and technical measures to bolster their defenses against
AI-equipped rivals.

Pursuing Collaborative Innovation

[Not all allies have the defense funding, technological capacity,
skills, and military infrastructure to facilitate rapid defense
innovation, including the adoption and scaling of emerging technologies.
And not all that have such resources and knowledge are willing to share
them in collaborative innovation processes]{.underline}. Leading
allies---the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the
Netherlands---already have national-focused approaches to the adoption
of EDTs. By contrast, for most Central and Eastern countries EDTs in
defense are mainly a long-term prospect. Previous challenges in
integrating cyber capabilities into NATO operations, persistent
capability gaps among the allies, and slow standardization procedures
are a good indication of the magnitude of the challenge, which is
acknowledged at the highest levels of NATO decision-making.

As Secretary-General Stoltenberg has stated, **[a technological gap
between the allies would undermine interoperability and weaken alliance
cohesion.]{.underline}** [In the context of the NATO AI and big data
strategies]{.underline} and the Defense Innovation Accelerator, [allies
should reflect on how to improve and facilitate technological transfers
among themselves. This could enable smaller allies to specialize in
niche EDTs capabilities, as has been the case with cyber, for example,
and could prevent the emergence of new technological and capability gaps
between the allies. The Biden administration's focus on shared
democratic values and the digital agenda, and its willingness to
strengthen NATO and technology partnerships, constitute a window of
opportunity for the alliance. It should be fully capitalized on to
accelerate transatlantic collaborative defense innovation]{.underline}.

[The existence of "AI haves" and "have-nots" within an alliance can
complicate burden-sharing]{.underline} --- [a central tenet of military
alliances]{.underline}. [On one hand, states with robust AI capabilities
can specialize their contributions to alliance operations and focus on
providing AI-related capabilities]{.underline}. If, however, AI
applications become a necessity for warfighting in the future, [states
that lack AI capabilities may be less able to contribute to alliance
operations.]{.underline} [States better equipped with AI capabilities
may subsequently be forced to take on a greater share of work,
generating both political and operational challenges. Politically, "AI
haves" may complain that "AI have-nots" are not adequately contributing
to a mission, straining relations between allies. Operationally,
capability gaps can hamper an alliance's ability to deploy forces or
achieve military objectives]{.underline}. During the NATO-led air war
over Kosovo in 1999, for instance, many NATO members possessed limited
numbers of precision-guided munitions in their arsenals and often lacked
the training to employ them, curtailing their ability to contribute to
operations.65 As a result, responsibility for carrying out the air
campaign fell to a small number of allies. In a larger conflict,
[burden-sharing might be critical to sustaining operations or securing
battlefield victories]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--AI key to NATO\-\--Interoperability

#### Interoperability collapsing\-\--AI integration is key

Martin **Dufour 18**, Colonel in the Canadian Army, working with NATO.
This Policy Brief is a revised version of a paper that was awarded the
Eisenhower Prize for the best Individual Paper of NDC Senior Course 132.
NATO Defense College, Research Division. NDC Policy Brief, No. 6.
December. \"Will artificial intelligence challenge NATO
interoperability?\" //pipk

[At the operational and strategic levels, the adoption of artificial
intelligence-enabled autonomous systems connecting sensors, battle
management, command and control systems, as well as defensive and
offensive assets in a network of learning, adaptive systems will enable
"a form of algorithmic warfare and machine learning approach to
targeting"10 which will compress the decision-action cycle to such an
extent that countries not connected to the system will be unable to keep
up.]{.underline}

The 2017 report Future War NATO argues that the "[technologically-driven
US military strategy is advancing so fast compared to European allies
that, sooner rather than later, all-important NATO military
interoperability might well become a thing of the past".]{.underline}11
This echoed a 2016 report from the Armament Industry European Research
Group, which concluded that "[a further boost in US defence technology
could promote a wider US-Europe gap and the emergence of a two-tier
alliance".]{.underline}12 It was furthermore observed that the USD3.6
billion invested in Third Offset Strategy technologies in 2017, while
representing only 5 percent of the overall US military research and
development budget corresponded "to more than 40 percent of the overall
EU-European R&D budgets".13

[Beyond interoperability, a profound technological mismatch between
allies could also erode the political and military cohesion of the
Alliance by creating resentment between countries that bear a greater
share of the burden as a result, and those that do not]{.underline}.

[While challenges exist]{.underline}, **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence **[need not erode NATO
cohesion]{.underline}**. [It is however imperative that countries begin
to think seriously about the future impact of artificial
intelligence,]{.underline} [and how to effectively start adopting the
technology]{.underline}. An exploratory look at the development
landscape for artifi cial intelligence and autonomous technologies
reveals that most of the innovations in the fi eld occur outside the
military-industrial complex. The GAFAs (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple)
have steadily invested over the years to develop commercial applications
for artifi cial intelligence, and one can fi nd many other startup
companies throughout the world. The data company CB Insights' second
annual AI 100 list identifi ed the 100 most promising artifi cial
intelligence startups, noting that they came from nine different
countries, including many from smaller nations which "in aggregate\...
have raised USD11.7 billion in equity funding across 367 deals".14 NATO
states should therefore strive to develop partnerships with such
companies, identify promising applications, and start implementing them
at once in their defence framework to act as agent of change.

It is also interesting to note that when it comes to successfully
leveraging emerging technologies, the business model is often more
important than the capability. One only needs consider the success of
companies such as Uber and AirBnB, giants in their respective fi elds,
but which do not actually own any physical assets. Smaller NATO nations
should therefore reconsider their business model and identify niche
domains such as cyberwarfare, early threat detection or predictive
analysis. They could then leverage partnerships with promising companies
to develop those capabilities to obtain a competitive advantage allowing
them to remain relevant in times of confl ict. These capabilities could
offset complex hardware solutions and allow smaller nations to continue
sharing the burden of military opera tions. This is the point made in a
2017 study titled Artifi cial Intelligence and the Future of Defence,
according to which given its "algorithmic and non-defence specifi c
essence...\[artifi cial intelligence\] is easier to jump in than is the
case for many industrial-kinetic technologies \[such as\] building a
sixth-generation jet fi ghter".15 As such [smaller, nimble nations have
an opportunity to redefi ne how they do military development, and
harness this key disruptive technology to start fi lling the growing
capability gap between NATO countries]{.underline}.

[Overcoming the interoperability gap It is evident that of the emerging
disruptive technologies, none is likely to have as signifi cant an
impact on warfare as that of artifi cial intelligence. The effect of
artifi cial intelligence is already being felt in numerous fi elds, and
its further development and combination with other technologies will
compound this, allowing the development of advanced autonomous
systems.]{.underline} [While the latter holds the promise of creating
new classes of weapons with great military potential, disproportional
growth among the various NATO allies could lead to complex
interoperability problems, further widening the existing
interoperability gap between member nations]{.underline}.

[Over the next two decades Alliance members will be increasingly
challenged by the rapid evolution of artifi cial intelligence and risk
becoming unable to operate together should the asymmetric adoption of
emerging technologies not be carefully managed. It is therefore
paramount that countries begin preparing for the future impact of artifi
cial intelligence in the military realm, and start adopting the

behind]{.underline}.

#### Interoperability key to NATO\-\--successful integration of AI is key

interoperability?\" //pipk

[NATO]{.underline} has arguably been the most successful alliance of its
kind, and much of this [success can be attributed to its cohesion in the
face of various threats]{.underline}. [At the heart of this cohesion lie
two important notions: burden sharing between members; and
interoperability]{.underline}. [The Alliance's cohesion however has
increasingly come under pressure over the last two decades, and there
are growing challenges with the level of interoperability between member
countries.]{.underline} While numerous technical and political factors
influence interoperability, [the emergence of disruptive
technologies]{.underline} such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology,
additive manufacturing and robotics, [are likely to make this challenge
more acute in the next two decades]{.underline}.

Of the many technologies rapidly emerging, [none is likely to have as
significant an impact as that of **a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline}, [which combines with other
tech]{.underline}nologies [and multiply their effect by allowing the
development of advanced autonomous systems]{.underline}. And while the
latter holds the promise of developing new classes of weapons with great
military potential, its [asymmetrical adoption]{.underline} among the
various NATO allies [could]{.underline} also [lead to significant
interoperability problems]{.underline}.

What interoperability means [Cohesion]{.underline}, often mentioned as
the Alliance's center of gravity, [lies at the heart of NATO's
success]{.underline}. Underwriting this cohesion is [the ability of
member states to share the burden of producing military capabilities to
service the whole, and the burden of conducting operational
missions]{.underline}. To do this successfully, [members have to be able
to undertake military actions in concert with each other in a fully
coordinated, and as much as possible integrated manner]{.underline}.
[This is]{.underline} referred to as [interoperability]{.underline},
defined as "the ability of systems, units or forces to provide services
to, and accept services from other systems, units or forces and to the
use the services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively
together".1

This definition implies that [there are several layers to
interoperability which need to be addressed to ensure forces are able to
operate together effectively in a military context]{.underline}. [These
include technical features]{.underline} permitting systems [to
physically connect]{.underline} to one another [and exchange
information]{.underline}; and the [alignment of procedures and
processes]{.underline} to allow military personnel to function within
the same space and achieve common goals without fratricide. It also
implies that this takes place [at various levels of operation, from
tactical to strategic]{.underline}. [A high level of interoperability
allows allies to effectively exchange intelligence and information,
cooperatively plan complex military operations, and conduct integrated
missions with fully exchangeable force packages]{.underline}.

NATO interoperability challenges [Historically NATO has had the tendency
to focus on procedural and technical interoperability between
systems.]{.underline} To do so, [it has employed a standards-based
approach and developed hundreds of Standardization Agreements (STANAGs)
which provide member states agreed-upon processes, procedures and
platform compliance specifications rather than stipulating what to build
and how]{.underline}. While this approach has allowed member states to
equip themselves but still successfully train and operate together for
decades, [the last 25 years has witnessed a growing rift in the military
capabilities of different nations.]{.underline}

[Rapid technological evolution and the increasing cost and complexity of
contemporary military systems have made it progressively more difficult
for several countries to keep pace with the systems of the bigger
allies.]{.underline} For instance, [some countries have invested heavily
in advanced systems allowing them to collect and process intelligence,
designate targets and strike them at will with standoff,
precision-guided weapons, day and night in any weather
conditions.]{.underline} The level of investment necessary to acquire
such capabilities, as well as various politico-strategic concerns such
as the protection of a country's military-industrial base and resultant
unwillingness to sell or transfer advanced technologies, have prevented
other allies from remaining current with some of these innovations.
These allies therefore lack the ability to gainfully partake in certain
military operations and equally share the burden with other members of
the Alliance.

The growing capability gap between NATO member nations was explored in a
2000 RAND Corporation study titled Interoperability: a continuing
challenge in coalition air operations, which considered 40 contemporary
coalition operations and concluded that there was a "growing divergence
between US and NATO allies' air forces in all-weather precision-strike
capabilities to minimize collateral damage and employment of standoff
weapons".2 Using a specific example to highlight this point, the authors
stated that "Allied contributions to recent strike operations in the
Balkans have been limited because the allies lack sufficient
precision-guided weapons that can be delivered day or night in any
weather conditions".3 While numerous countries have since taken steps to
acquire precision-guided weapons, the US has continued to improve its
capabilities, moving even further away from most allies during that same
period. The 14 April 2018 strikes on Syrian chemical weapons sites is a
recent example of this situation where, setting political considerations
aside, only three countries (US, UK and France) were realistically in
possession of the required standoff attack missiles capable of reaching
targets deep inside Syria with precision, without putting the pilots and
aircraft at undue risk from Syrian air defence systems. The same study
also found that this growing interoperability gap also exists with other
capabilities such as command and control systems, battle management
systems, as well as information exchange and security. Most importantly,
[this problem has not gone away]{.underline}.4 [The ability to gather,
process and disseminate accurate intelligence to support effective
decisions-making faster than the enemy's ability to do so (the so called
decision-action cycle) has always been the **hallmark of effective
military operations**.]{.underline} [In an age when most systems are
interconnected, with proliferation of sensors and data repositories,
information superiority is rapidly becoming a decisive factor for
mission success. Therefore the ability of allies to rapidly share
intelligence in a secure manner at the operational and strategic levels,
and leverage this intelligence to make sound, common decisions is bound
to become a determinant factor in who can participate in a mission in
the future]{.underline}.

#### Intra NATO AI gap decks interoperability\-\--cooperation through NATO is key

63\. Second, [[the defence tech]{.mark}nology [gap between Allies must
remain small enough to be bridged by
interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The large diversity of Allies is
ultimately a primary source of NATO's strength, but it also means that
large differences exist in defence capabilities]{.underline}. [[There is
a danger]{.mark} that the significant [investment in AI in leading
Allied nations could lead to substantial interoperability problems and a
loss of NATO's overall military effectiveness in the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, the good
news is that [[AI efforts do not need to be capital
intensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Committee witnessed during its
fact-finding visit to Singapore in May 2019.
[[Small]{.underline}]{.mark}- and medium-sized
[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} with smart scientists and engineers [[can
play an outsized role in AI development]{.underline}]{.mark} and
adoption if they so choose. [This could]{.underline} indeed [be a very
effective contribution to Allied burden sharing from the smaller Allied
nations]{.underline}. **[[To increase interoperability, cooperation
through NATO' structures has a large role to
play.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Interoperability should be at the heart of
AI efforts carried out by the STO, ACT, the NCI Agency, NIAG, and
others. Allies leading in the S&T sector should encourage open
architecture standards and regulations for technology sharing and
transfer among Allies in order to narrow the technology gap, in line
with all national obligations and the sensitive nature of technologies

64\. [Allied armed forces alone will not be able to solve the
AI-specific challenges laid out in this report, including the ethical
and legal questions]{.underline}. [This will need a much broader push
across the entire AI ecosystem.]{.underline} However, governments,
[NATO]{.underline}, and the EU can and [must play a critical role in
overcoming the]{.underline} investment, innovation, and workforce
[challenges of adopting AI.]{.underline} Just as national governments
across the Alliance are rising to the challenge of AI, so should their
armed forces. [They should move beyond scanning the horizon
and]{.underline}, instead, [invest in real]{.underline} research,
[experimentation]{.underline}, development, and adoption efforts. It
should be underlined that all dual-use and military AI efforts should,
however, tackle all ethical, legal, and social questions right from the
beginning, including privacy considerations and the definition of
appropriate human involvement in decisions about the use of force.
Allies should consider examining whether an ethics code of conduct could
put the adoption of AI in the armed forces on a more stable foundation.
At a strategic level, Allies must also address the geopolitical
challenges, including the ones arising from Chinese and Russian
investments in military AI systems. As this report has shown, Russia and
China see AI as critical to future military power and invest heavily
into AI-enabled military systems. For its part, the NATO PA Science and
Technology Committee will continue to monitor AI developments in the
defence sector through fact-finding visits and expert testimony.

[Throughout NATO's history, defense innovation has been critical to its
technological edge and its deterrence and defense posture against
multiple threats]{.underline}. [The unprecedented progress in emerging
and disruptive technologies (EDTs) offers the prospect and challenge of
transformative defense innovation for allied armed forces and societies
at large]{.underline}. Technological progress in artificial intelligence
(**[AI) and machine learning]{.underline}**, advanced robotics,
biotechnologies and human enhancement, quantum technologies, big-data
analytics, and fifth-generation telecommunication systems, as well as
growing autonomy in the critical functions of military systems, [promise
to change how wars are fought, how fast, where, and by
whom]{.underline}. [These technologies enable new forms of military
presence, coercive action, and power projection in and across old and
new domains (for example, cyberspace and outer space) and below and
above the conventional threshold of armed conflict]{.underline}.

However, [NATO]{.underline} and the transatlantic allies [are neither
the only nor the most agile actors investing in emerging and disruptive
technologies. China and Russia already invest substantially in and have
accelerated their adoption of these technologies in military
applications.]{.underline} [To maintain its strategic advantage against
China and Russia, NATO needs to become an agent of innovation and be
more agile and strategic in supporting allies to jointly exploit new
technologies for deterrence, defense, and resilience
purposes]{.underline}. [NATO has]{.underline} prioritized EDTs and
[signaled it has joined "the technological adoption race" against China
and Russia]{.underline}.1 **[Much work remains to be
done]{.underline}**. [Allies remain divided on the ethical and legal
specifics of the military use of EDTs and by their national-industrial
preferences]{.underline}. [Technological capacity across the alliance
also varies significantly]{.underline} and, as always, funding is in
short supply. Concrete decisions on how to consolidate innovation in
EDTs, a critical task for NATO's mission and future adaptation, are
expected at this month's Brussels summit. Specifically, allies will
respond to calls for a "strategic surge" in EDTs2 innovation by
establishing a Defense Innovation Accelerator, an opt-in instrument
funded through dedicated national contributions, which NATO hopes will
incentivize innovation and transatlantic cooperation on emerging
technologies.3

Conclusion

[Long-term great-power competition has returned and it has a strong
technological dimension. The time when NATO had the luxury to adapt at
its own pace to a changing strategic environment is over. To survive and
remain relevant in a multipolar world of rapidly evolving security risks
and threats, and to compete successfully against Russia and China, NATO
needs a new framework centered on innovation as adaptation]{.underline}.
[The alliance's ongoing efforts in EDTs and the new NATO Strategic
Concept are timely opportunities to start on this new path. A focus on
inclusive innovation in NATO could increase adaptability and
competitiveness in the long-term, help to disrupt, deter or defeat
adversarial subversive actions, mitigate transnational threats and, more
importantly, maintain solidarity and the principle of indivisible
security among the allies.]{.underline}

Innovation Unit and the Commission's staff. \"Economics and Technology:

**[[We live in a world of Great Power
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Long gone are the days of simple]{.underline}, US- and EU-led
[globalisation, in which we could behave as if power politics didn't
exist.]{.underline}

The global strategic picture is probably well known to you all but let
me lay it out briefly.

[[Two major]{.mark} security [challenges]{.mark} take up a lot of
bandwidth today]{.underline}, notably in the United States but also
**[[at NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, across Europe, and really across the
Western world. And I will address both. They [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
the following:

**[1/ The Rise of [China]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[2/ [and]{.mark} the rise of New Technologies, notably
**[A]{.mark}**]{.underline}rtificial
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence

These two major transformative trends are already affecting everything
we do, in the private sector, in public policy generally, and in
national security and defence policy.

[[China's economy,]{.mark} if one measures it at Purchasing Power
Parities, is already 15% larger than that of the United States. And we
should expect China to overtake America also in terms of current
exchange rates, perhaps by 2035.]{.underline}

[A world in which neither the United States nor the European Union are
the biggest economy, or the biggest market, that is very new. It is
radically new]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the Western Alliance
faced a formidable enemy in the shape of the Soviet Union. But [the
Soviet Union never came close to overtaking America
economically]{.underline}. At the very highest point and using the same
type of conversion I used earlier, it may be that the USSR was two
thirds of the US economy in equivalent material terms, and that was in
the mid 1960s, and it didn't last. By the end of the Cold War, it was
more like one third of the US economy. For reference, today, the Russian
economy is about 20% of the US economy at Purchasing Power Parities.

[China]{.underline} today is not 20%, or one third, or two thirds of the
US level, but as mentioned, 115%. It [[is already larger. And it]{.mark}
is still [growing, faster]{.mark} than the United States or
Europe]{.underline}.

[[The world is changing. **Now**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This decade.

[But that]{.underline} shift, large as it is, [doesn't mean the old
problems are gone]{.underline}. For Europe, Russia and Islamist
terrorism are the most direct potential security threats. China and
dynamics in the Indo-Pacific come in addition to the other two -- they
do not replace them.

[We do not get to choose between facing up to Russia versus China versus
Islamist threats]{.underline}.

[We also do not get to choose what relationships these threat actors may
have with each other]{.underline}.

[Those choices are theirs, not ours]{.underline}.

[It is irrelevant whether someone in the West believes that Russia
really ought to]{.underline} see sense and fear China and [embrace the
West]{.underline}. Maybe that would be sensible, but [unless and until
Russia actually behaves that way, then we cannot responsibly assume that
that is the direction of travel]{.underline}.

[In fact, the evidence of the last few years rather suggests the
opposite -- namely a rapprochement between Russia and
China]{.underline}.

We may not like it, **[but [it is not in our gift to choose the policies
of other Great Powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[We can only]{.mark} deal with what they do, and [manage]{.mark} our
own policies [responsibly, by ensuring]{.mark} that we have [a **highly
credible deterrence and defence posture**]{.mark}**, by
[protecting]{.mark} our [vital interests]{.mark}, by [remaining united
and well-coordinated]{.mark} in our policy choices, [and]{.mark} by
[applying]{.mark} a healthy dose of [alertness and self-control]{.mark}
in our dealings with foreign powers**]{.underline}.

[[The general power shift]{.underline}]{.mark} I described [[is
happening at the same time as]{.underline}]{.mark} we're experiencing [a
[major]{.mark} wave of new [tech]{.mark}nological
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}.

And [[the biggest]{.underline}]{.mark} transformative technology
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, [particularly in its
contemporary form, meaning Machine Learning, which includes Deep
Learning]{.underline}.

[It is relevant to remember how world history changed in light of the
steam engine, or in light of electrification, or in light of the
internal combustion engine. And in more recent decades, through
computing and the Internet.]{.underline}

[All]{.underline} of these examples are what are called [General Purpose
Technologies]{.underline}. That is a key concept. [We're [not]{.mark}
talking about [limited military technologies,]{.mark} or [narrow
civilian ones, or]{.mark} what I would call "[narrow dual-use]{.mark}
technologies" such as laser or thermal imaging]{.underline}.

**[[General Purpose Technologies are far broader]{.mark}, they span a
far greater range in terms of areas of application]{.underline}**.
**[[They transform many areas of life and]{.mark} of [economic activity
-- as well as]{.mark} the world of [security and
defence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

So, AI is a General Purpose Technology. And **[[AI is going around the
planet, and every]{.mark} state, every major [organisation]{.mark},
private and public, [knows it must invest, adapt, adopt, and move
forward]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

What does that mean for our security? And what is the connection with
China, and indeed with other threat actors?

Well, [[tech]{.mark}nology [diffuses]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is its
wonder, and also its challenge. Humanity doesn't get to move forward
without spreading the best technologies around the world. But then no
area of life is left untouched. [Matters of [war]{.mark} and
[peace]{.mark}, of the [strategic balance]{.mark}, of military means, of
[coercive relations]{.mark} between states, and even non-state actors,
that [all moves along too]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.mark}, for example, [is working on AI for military
applications]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Of course they are.

[[China is too]{.underline}.]{.mark}

So, what does it mean for us across the Western World?

**[It means [the race is on]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The race is on
[between the West and China in particular, in very visible
ways.]{.underline} [That's what the conversation is about --
[transformation]{.mark}, new capabilities, next-generation capabilities,
which [will leverage AI]{.mark} and other new technologies]{.underline}.

[It is important to [understand the magnitude of potential future
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[AI can improve all types of information processing, pattern
recognition, prediction, for any type of data]{.mark} -- sets of
numbers, text, voice, images, video.]{.underline}

It has been a long time coming but now it is here. [[Machine Learning
outperforms humans]{.mark} in terms of accuracy over a significant range
of pattern recognition and prediction tasks]{.underline}.

And [with appropriate "eyes and ears" on robotic systems, meaning with
good sensors, and with communication technologies, we are looking at a
world of intelligent connected devices, capable of determining their own
courses of action to solve particular objectives]{.underline}.

[With the ability to work effectively]{.underline}:

1/ [In]{.underline} teams of machines -- [swarm robotics]{.underline} is
a key expression here

2/ In mixed human-machine teams -- a key expression here is
[human-machine teaming]{.underline}

3/ [And alone]{.underline} if they become isolated from their teams and
unable to communicate

All of that, [in both the cyber]{.underline} realm [and]{.underline} in
the [physical realm]{.underline}. [[With]{.mark} the [potential of
higher accuracy, and]{.mark} of course [faster information processing
and]{.mark} faster [decision-making]{.mark} cycles]{.underline}.

[This can be true for a range of civilian applications, and for military
ones too]{.underline}. [Whether it's collaborative robotics on the
factory floor -- or swarms of autonomous drones in a military operation.
That is the general direction of travel, with many new achievements in
recent years, and with more to come]{.underline}.

[[States will necessarily invest in this space]{.mark}. The power
implications are too great to ignore, especially once one assumes that
potential adversaries will do the same. Which they will.]{.underline}

[And [with rival powers that have substantial resources and]{.mark}
levels of [ambition, we must ourselves aim at maintaining our
technological edge]{.mark}, as much as possible, [for as long as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The policy question then becomes: how do states win technology
races]{.underline}, or at least stay ahead or not fall back, within such
races?

In short, we need to:

1/ get better at what we're doing at home, and

2/ reduce the ability of foreign powers to have access to what we're
doing

This splits naturally between two dimensions: Domestic Innovation
Systems, and the External Dimension.

For each dimension, I will now list 9 essential areas of work.

For domestic innovation systems:

R&D subsidies; Tertiary STEM education; Research universities; Private
venture capital; Government venture capital; Government procurement;
Innovation networks; Innovation clusters; Domestic industrial capacity.

For the external dimension:

IP protection (as contested); Standardization (as contested); Trade
openness with non-rivals; Trade & investment restrictions on rivals;
Export controls; Foreign investment screening; Counterintelligence;
Espionage-related sanctions; Espionage vulnerability mitigation.

I will focus mainly on the External Dimension and develop a few
examples:

1/ trade and investment restrictions on rivals

An example here is Executive Order 14032 of 3 June 2021 by the President
of the United States -- essentially banning US financial investments
into Chinese companies involved in either the military-industrial
complex of China, or that are developing surveillance technology to
facilitate repression or serious human rights abuses.

You may recall that Huawei, among others, was listed. It is relevant to
realise that the key companies of China's aerospace and defence sector
are there too. This is much broader than just 5G, or surveillance. We're
talking about shipbuilding, aerospace, missile technologies -- and
surveillance too.

The first version of that order was under President Trump, in November
2020. The one we have now, from June 2021, is slightly amended but
really very similar. So, it's important to remark that, on the US side,
this is a bipartisan issue.

The rationale is simple, and in my view not controversial at all.

Why should our financial resources be invested in companies that are
developing military or intelligence or surveillance technologies at the
behest of foreign powers that pursue ambitions and methods that are
contrary to both our interests and our values?

In the European context, we already pursue that path towards Russia. We
have restrictions in place on financial investments in key Russian
defence industry companies, ever since the 2014 sanctions were adopted
by the European Council.

2/ foreign investment screening

Screening of Foreign Direct Investment, that is, of strategic
investments in corporations in our countries, is an area of policy that
has developed further in recent years.

In the United States, strengthened legislation came in 2018 -- that's
the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA),
which modernized and strengthened the key US structure in this case,
which is called CFIUS, The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States.

In the European Union, we have new EU law, namely Regulation 2019/452 of
19 March 2019 "establishing a framework for the screening of foreign
direct investments into the Union".

The regulation establishes a framework for the screening of investments
from outside the Union:

1/ for Member States to each carry out (the main work happens
nationally)

2/ for Member States to cooperate, with each other and with the European
Commission

The regulation is a framework, it leaves a lot of leeway to Member
States, but conversely this has allowed for the principles expressed in
it to be very sensible and to be stated in clear language.

Article 4 of the Regulation in particular:

Member States and the Commission may consider the following areas, among
others -- I will just list two of them:

Critical infrastructure

Critical technologies and dual use items, including artificial
intelligence, robotics, semiconductors, cybersecurity, aerospace,
defence, energy storage, quantum and nuclear technologies as well as
nanotechnologies and biotechnologies

If you wanted an official confirmation of what key technology areas are
considered critical, this is as good a list as any. Similar lists emerge
from work in the NATO context and in national strategy documents.

And Member States and the Commission may also take into account certain
factors, I will just list the first one:

"whether the foreign investor is directly or indirectly controlled by
the government, including state bodies or armed forces, of a third
country, including through ownership structure or significant funding"

So, this is just common sense.

The recent Czech law on Foreign Investment screening seems very much to
follow this common-sense spirit.

From what I've understood, it ensures there is mandatory notification to
the government and an ability to block investments if they would result
in providing effective control, by the foreign investor, over a domestic
entity, and that the latter engages in manufacturing, R&D, or innovation
of military equipment, or it engages in critical infrastructure, or in
critical information infrastructure or essential information services,
or in manufacturing or developing dual-use items.

3/ Measures against foreign state subsidies that distort competition

Another interesting development on the EU side is the proposed
regulation "on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market" of 5
May 2021.

Here we're talking about essential abilities to scrutinize and then take
redressive actions in case a company on the EU market benefits from
foreign state subsidies. Redressive actions could include orders to
carry out divestments, for example, and the regulation would allow for
the use of fines in case the company does not take appropriate remedial
action.

This approach is broader-based and well within the logic of the Single
Market, in which state aid by EU member states is strictly regulated. It
was high time that this be applied to what is de facto state aid from
foreign states.

4/ Protection of Intellectual Property: Trade Secrets

Under both US and EU law, a trade secret is information that is not
generally known or discoverable by others, is maintained in secrecy by
its owner (meaning a company), and it gives its owner a competitive
advantage because it is secret.

Trade Secrets is one of two main approaches for companies to protect
innovative ideas -- the other main approach is patents, which relies on
the opposite approach, namely publishing the information, but giving a
legal monopoly to the patent owner to allow the patent owner to gather
income from royalty fees.

Trade Secrets is an area that underwent legislative changes, in both the
US and the EU, in 2016, and partly for the same reasons. In both the US
and EU context, the combination of the rise of digital technologies and
of the rise of China were clearly referenced reasons for strengthening
legislation.

And in the case of China, we have clear evidence of cases of
state-sponsored economic espionage.

In the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been very
outspoken about this problem, and about its place within the broader
challenge of the rise of China. To quote the Director of the FBI,
Christopher Wray: "The Chinese government is fighting a generational
fight to surpass our country in economic and technological leadership."

And Wray goes on to say that the Chinese, quote, "have shown that
they're willing to steal their way up the economic ladder at our
expense".

So, we already have updated legislation for Trade Secrets, and that is a
good thing. That's just one part. There are many non-legislative
measures, including programmes, training, and events to raise awareness
about information security in the corporate world and in scientific
research institutions for example. And this really concerns both cyber
means of intrusion and human intrusions.

These four classes of policy instruments are all different, but they
have a few things in common in terms of the general strategic challenge
they address.

China seeks an advancement of its technological and economic power.

[[Distorting]{.mark} competition in its external [trade and investments,
while]{.mark} also aggressively [acquiring technologies]{.mark}, whether
through licit means or illicit means, [and]{.mark} while also using
[state subsidies]{.mark} -- all of these measures are tantamount to
[using]{.mark} our Western [market principles against us,]{.mark} as a
slingshot [to propel China ahead]{.mark} of us, by making money from us,
and getting our best technologies, and using the former to accelerate
the latter, and the latter to enhance the former.]{.underline}

And so, once this is understood, the actions of China's State-Owned
Enterprises and other Chinese entities with close links to the Chinese
Communist Party should be seen in a different light.

[[We are talking about a single-party dictatorship with major power
potential and major power ambitions]{.mark} -- [in]{.mark} the
[economic]{.mark} and [industrial]{.mark} realm, as well as in the
[military and foreign policy]{.mark} realm]{.underline}.

**[[This does not mean]{.mark} that [all Chinese corporations are that
way, let alone all Chinese people. But it is possible to clearly
identify key corporations that we should]{.mark} generally [not be doing
business with]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

So, what next?

We need to start documenting in further detail who these key
corporations are, their areas of activity, their linkages with key
Chinese state or party institutions. Then there is the question of how
they are financed and by whom, in China, in Europe, in America, and
elsewhere. For instance, is it the case that European or North American
capital markets are used to raise funds for these companies? Of
particular interest, of course, are those companies that are engaged in
supplying military, security, surveillance, or intelligence products or
capabilities to the Chinese state or to the Russian state.

The more we know, the better we can target justified protective
measures.

Protective measures, as mentioned, can include prohibitions on financial
investments into certain key entities.

Relatedly, governments on both sides of the Atlantic may wish to block
Foreign Direct Investments from those same entities, and entities
associated with them.

In parallel, and this now addresses the first set of policy tools I
mentioned earlier, [Western nations need to provide for [dynamic and
competitive home-grown innovation ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The latter [require sources of capital investment they can trust --
and]{.mark} they need [more of it]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is with that
intention that the US Department of Defense launched an initiative for a
Trusted Capital Marketplace. Recent NATO decisions on the Defence
Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and the NATO
Defence Innovation Fund follow a similar spirit.

[[Innovating more and better in crucial technologies]{.mark} -- in
Emerging and Disruptive Technologies -- [is now a high priority for
decision makers on both sides]{.mark} of the Atlantic]{.underline}.

[And [the challenges related to doing so securely]{.mark}, bearing in
mind the challenges posed by foreign powers such as Russia and China,
[are a major area for ongoing public policy analysis, adjustment,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[maturation]{.underline}.]{.mark}

For example, are our Export Control regimes fit for purpose for the age
of AI, autonomy and robotics, quantum technologies?

[And [do we have a proper whole-of-government approach to
ensure,]{.mark}]{.underline} for example, [that justified [warnings
from]{.mark} our [counter-intelligence services are]{.mark} listened to
and understood -- and [acted upon]{.mark} -- across the machinery of
each national government among our nations]{.underline}? [And [with
coordination between our nations]{.mark}]{.underline}?

Do our corporate sectors and higher education sectors have the
awareness, expertise, and inclination to detect and respond to espionage
attempts, whether by cyber intrusions, or human intrusions?

And are our business and finance communities ready to work
constructively on justified matters of national security and
international security?

These are important considerations to have in mind as policies continue
to develop and mature in the direction of better security awareness and
better strategic awareness across Western democracies.

And [[the only way to get there is together]{.mark} and [with a clear
sense of shared responsibility]{.mark} for our future prosperity and for
our future security]{.underline}.

part of a broader nexus of emerging disruptive technologies, alongside
big data, quantum computing and autonomous systems.]{.underline} While
its exact impact remains unclear, [there was consensus that AI-enabled
systems would inevitably transform defence across the
board]{.underline}. [AI could enhance data management and situational
awareness capacities, leading to costsavings, improved feedback control
systems and decision-making, new operational concepts and greater
freedom of action]{.underline}. [On the battlefield, AI could function
as an enabler across all future platforms and capabilities, with main

it would become a key factor in interoperability]{.underline}. AI could
also change the organisational structure of military institutions in

10\. [AI is already becoming a reality in armed forces around the
world]{.underline}. [All modern armed forces are, at a minimum, thinking
through AI's implications, including the ethical and legal implications,
and many are introducing concrete AI solutions]{.underline} (see also
Section IV). [AI holds enormous potential for the defence sector but
also presents a set of technical and non-technical challenges. Moreover,
the strategic implications of AI remain unclear]{.underline}.

11\. Tackling all opportunities, challenges, and uncertainties in depth
would go beyond the scope of this report (see also Box 4). Therefore,
this section delves into two key areas of opportunity (information and
decision support as well as robotic autonomous systems), crucial
technical and non-technical challenges, including the debate about
lethal autonomous weapons systems, and some potential strategic
implications.

A. INFORMATION AND DECISION SUPPORT 12. Humans generally act in an
environment of incomplete information. Sometimes, plenty of information
is available. In military and strategic affairs, this is decidedly not
the case. Political and military leaders must act in the well-known 'fog
of war'. Information and decision support by AI systems is thus of high
interest to military and strategic decision makers. Such systems can
substantially increase both the pace and the quality of the processing,
exploiting, and disseminating of information, as well as of human and
machine decision-making.

13\. In military terms, AI can considerably boost the speed of analysis
and action of humans and machines. AI-enabled information and decision
support systems can, for example: - vastly improve the reaction times of
defensive systems against fast-acting weapon systems, such as hypersonic
missiles, cyberattacks, or directed-energy weapons; - deliver actionable
information faster to decision makers, which could potentially deliver a
decisive edge on adversaries; - quickly discover cyber intrusions by
detecting evasive malicious codes or by scanning for suspicious patterns
of behaviour rather than for specific code; and - help identify attempts
to manipulate citizens through disinformation campaigns.

14\. AI can improve the quality of the decision making of machines, but
also, and perhaps most importantly, of humans. AI's ability to sift
through today's data-rich environment and communicate findings in a
compelling manner is crucial in this respect and will become ever-more
important. While human resources currently allow for the processing of,
at best, 20% of the information produced today, this percentage could go
down to a mere 2% (Villani, 2018). To put it in the words of an
exasperated British officer, armed forces are already "swimming in
sensors, drowning in data, \[and\] starving for insight" (White, 2019).
AI solutions can help by, for example: - providing better visualisation
and interpretation of data (Killion, 2018); - automatically extracting
objects of interest from data feeds for follow-up actions, for example
from surveillance video or satellite imagery (CRS, 2018); - establishing
'common operating pictures' from information which emanates from very
diverse sources, arrives in very different formats, and is often
redundant or incomplete (Killion, 2018); - highlighting abnormalities
for follow-up investigations by comparing data points with previously
developed normality models; - extracting 'weak signals' which do not
seem alarming by themselves but may be highly significant if linked with
other data (Mercier, 2018); - suggesting a menu of appropriate options
and describing each option's likely effects (Van den Bosch and
Bronkhorst, 2018); and - provide insights into adversarial behaviour
through foreknowledge (Demchack, 2018).

[Recent digital and [tech]{.mark}nological developments have
[enabled]{.mark} many completely [new tools]{.mark}, which have given
rise to new virtual platforms that fall outside current norms and
rules]{.underline}. [[These]{.underline}]{.mark} new tools have also
[[brought **unprecedented speed to all kinds of
action**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Interconnectivity and
[globalization]{.mark} have [created]{.mark} new [possibilities for
network-based action, lowered borders, changed geopolitics and
made]{.mark} sure that there is [more data]{.mark} around us than ever
before]{.underline}. [New actors]{.underline} have emerged in
international politics, who [are looking to enhance their
status]{.underline}. **[Authoritarian and democratic states appear to be
entering into a new form of ideological battle.]{.underline}** In this
situation one can ask: what are the rules of the game? [An important
weapon in this new battle is hybrid threats]{.underline}. **[[Hybrid
threats constitute a shadow policy for authoritarian states that
supports their strategic aims]{.mark} and is based on their strategic
culture traditions]{.underline}**. The clear dividing lines, unwritten
rules, players and goals of the Cold War are history. [This situation is
challenging for planners, decision-makers and foresight
building]{.underline}.

The concept of hybrid threats has entered into political normality by
[appearing in]{.underline} the [discourses and documents of]{.underline}
the EU, [NATO]{.underline} and their member states. The concept has been
examined through many different disciplinary lenses: international
relations, strategic studies, security studies, military studies,
history and political science -- to name a few. This multidisciplinary
analytical mosaic also blurs the picture of what [hybrid
threats]{.underline} [really]{.underline} are. The Report "The Landscape
of Hybrid Threats: A Conceptual Model", issued by the European Centre of
Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE) together with the
European Union (EU) Commission's Joint Research Center, uses hybrid
threats as an umbrella concept, under which different types of activity
occur: [interference, influence, operations, campaigns and even
warfare]{.underline} (Giannopoulos, Smith and Theocharidou, 2020). [The
approach adopted would enable a comprehensive analysis including
civilian, political, military and academic thinking]{.underline}. This
chapter will take the report's conceptual model as its starting point
for hybrid threat analysis.

[[Hybrid threats]{.mark} are]{.underline} still [difficult to define,
which]{.underline} on the one hand [[complicate]{.mark}s]{.underline}
the adoption of [[strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} to counter them,
common [positions and a holistic approach, but]{.underline} on the other
hand [gives flexibility, greater freedom to be creative and possibility
to combine different disciplines and backgrounds]{.underline}.
Consequently, the [[characterization]{.mark} of hybrid threats [will
help]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[identify real threats, potential threats
and]{.mark} also]{.underline} those **[[aspects that might look like
threats but are not]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Too tight definition
might]{.underline}, in the worst case, point in the [wrong direction and
also tie one's hands when it comes to responding.]{.underline}

There is still an ongoing debate regarding the usefulness of the concept
of hybrid threats. Those saying that hybrid threats are mostly "old wine
in new bottles" mean that perhaps we do not need a new concept, and we
could just adjust the old ones to current circumstances. To this Frank
Hoffman, who is often seen as the man behind the 'hybrid warfare'
concept, answered in the following way: "New language and new terms aid
us in thinking differently and characterizing what is truly new,
hopefully without overlooking what is enduring in war. A new lexicon
captures the changes better than hanging on to old terms with new
meanings" (Hoffmann, 2010).

The 'old' in the concept of hybrid threats lies in the fact that
interference and influence have always been part of international
politics. Also, the technique of combining different domains like
social, political, informational, military and legal ones has been part
of the strategic thinking behind influence, interference and military
operations. This thinking is also present in today's activities that
constitute hybrid threats. [What is new]{.underline}, then -- [although
anchored to]{.underline} traditions in the [authoritarian strategic
thinking]{.underline} -- [is related to today's security environment and
how it is different compared to the Cold War's, for
example]{.underline}. The battle between [democratic and
authoritarian]{.underline} state systems today [is not as clear-cut
as]{.underline} the division between [communist and
capitalist]{.underline} countries was during the Cold War. Furthermore,
[digital and technological developments have provided new
platforms]{.underline} for influencing, new [tools]{.underline} for both
interference and influence, [and]{.underline} have extended the
[domains]{.underline} where action happens -- from the traditional
military domains like land, air and sea, to cyber and space, to more
comprehensive domains like culture and administration. These are all
connected and, [through hybrid threats activities with a targeted
approach]{.underline}, [**[even the best prepared states and alliances
can be challenged]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[The logic of interference found in hybrid threats is substantially
based on authoritarian strategic culture.]{.underline} [Strategic
culture]{.underline} itself as a concept has been contested, but in
recent years it [has found its way back into security
studies]{.underline}. It is worth noting that the Cold War
juxtaposition, the bipolarity of the superpowers, crucially downplayed
the relevance of national aspects relating to cooperation, competition,
conflict, and war. In that way, the 'national character' of the enemy,
which was very important before the Second World War, was downplayed
during the Cold War years (Miklossy & Smith, 2020: xiii). Post-Cold War
studies started to pay attention again to different domestic processes
and their effects. As Glenn observed, "\[t\]he mid-nineties witnessed
the emergence of a new school of realists that sought to move beyond the
basic insights of Waltzian neorealism by investigating the interaction
of systemic pressures and domestic processes in the foreign policy
decision making process, thus providing a much richer explanatory
account of why states choose certain foreign policies over others"
(2009: 523-551). From examining national strategic cultures, the theory
can also be extended to cover strategic cultures of a particular state
system. [Here the concept of authoritarian strategic culture comes from
the studies that produce characterizations of authoritarian and
totalitarian regimes]{.underline} (Linz, 2000; Svolik, 2012; Brooker,
2014). There are national specificities when it comes to behavior, and
there are specificities that are linked to the state system. The
national specificities are more difficult to define due to the fact that
culture as a concept is complex. A state system is relatively easier. A
state system often defines the regime type as well as its relationship
to civil society, opposition and the military.

[This chapter begins by presenting the characteristics of hybrid
threats, as identified in the authoritarian strategic thinking
specifically in relation to Russia and Chinese traditions.
Those]{.underline} [characteristics are then put into the context of
decision-making following]{.underline} David Omand's [Situation
awareness, Explanation, Estimate and Strategic notice]{.underline}
(SEES) model. In the third part, the challenges that the new information
environment presents us are considered, and finally the chapter draws
some conclusions relating to allied decision-making.

Hybrid Threats and Strategic Thinking As mentioned in the introduction,
this chapter takes as its starting point the report "The landscape of
Hybrid Threats: A conceptual model". The report does not claim to be an
exhaustive source for the description of all the characteristics that
hybrid threats might have, and there might be many more that have to do
with the changing nature of the phenomenon. However, the report does
identify five characteristics deemed to be the most important with
respect to the challenges they pose to decision-making: • Usage of
multiple synchronized tools, used to create linear and non-linear
effects; • Ability to create ambiguity with plausible or implausible
deniability and to hide true intent; • Deliberate threshold manipulation
and the use of grey zones like borders between war and peace, friend and
enemy, virtual and real, internal and external, etc; • Exploitation of
the seams of democratic societies and the different jurisdictions
(local, state, international); • Use of decoys. These five challenges
are all related to Russian and Chinese interference and influence
traditions, which will be presented in the following sections. In turn,
they are part of wider strategic culture, which is the product of a
centuries-long dialogue between a people and its history (Gray, 2006:
15). Strategic culture is closely interlinked with the idea of national
interests in a spatial context that is defined by potential threats,
perceptions of friends and foes, traditions of alliances, and
institutional linkages (Miklossy & Smith, 2020: 263).

Traditions of Chinese strategic thinking Since uncovering strategic
culture is beyond the scope of this chapter, the approach is to present
**[some [dominant ideas]{.mark} that are [still present]{.mark} today
[in Chinese thinking relating to interference, influence and winning
conflicts and wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The Chinese thinking
presented here is based on three books]{.mark}; [On Strategy
Studies]{.mark}]{.underline} (2006) [[published by]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} People's Liberation Army
([[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark}), [[Political Work Guidelines of the]{.mark}
**[P]{.mark}**eople's **[L]{.mark}**iberation
**[A]{.mark}**rmy]{.underline} (2003), [[where the "Three Warfares"
concept is introduced, and The seven military classics of Ancient
China]{.underline}]{.mark} (2017), [which presents seven texts from
different times seen as cornerstones of Chinese military
tradition]{.underline}. [This is [particularly relevant since]{.mark}
President [Xi]{.mark} Jingping [has forbidden]{.mark} the use of
[foreign theory books]{.mark} in education [and]{.mark} has
[mandated]{.mark} turning back to their own [classics]{.mark} including
those [on strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nojonen, 2019). [[Therefore,
Chinese practitioners of strategy are actively studying their own
classics]{.mark} in building a professional identity and practices based
on the particular traditional conceptualization of the Chinese strategy
work]{.underline} (Nojonen, 2019).

The book On Strategy Studies, published in Chinese, introduces the
concept of "supraplanning": a dynamic process towards a goal -- and not
a rigid adherence to a sequence of steps that is forever fixed and
precisely worked out in advance. The authors outline three factors that
determine the strategic behavior of the Chinese military: strategic
thinking, strategic environment and military capacity. The book makes a
point that the aim is "to lure the other side into developing
misperceptions...and to \[establish for oneself\] a strategically
advantageous position by producing various kinds of false phenomena in
an organized and planned manner with the smallest cost in manpower and
materials" (Detweiler, 2009: 10).

In analyzing Chinese strategic behavior, the authors argue that [the
tradition, understanding and practice of stratagems is the dominant
pattern of Chinese strategy thinking]{.underline}. Based on the book,
the characteristics of Chinese supraplanning are: a) resourcefulness and
decisiveness; b) deep stratagems and distant deliberations; c)
comprehensive planning and preparations; d) flexibility and ingenuity.
It is important to note that different concepts found in traditional
Chinese strategic thinking are presented in a dialectic way, such as
"weakness and strength", and "clandestine manoeuvres and open
operations". This means that [concepts are not strictly defined, but
rather remain borderless and ambivalent, creating
ambiguity]{.underline}. Also, these concepts can be nouns and verbs at
the same time; in other words, they can be both abstractions of
cognitive processes as well as actual practices. This means that a solid
picture of each given situation might be very difficult to form without
a profound knowledge of Chinese language (Nojonen, 2019).

Also, the more well know Chinese concept of "[[Three
Warfares]{.underline}]{.mark}", in the book Political Work Guidelines,
[comprises three different components: Psychological Warfare, Public
Opinion Warfare and Legal Warfare.]{.underline} The [Three
Warfare]{.underline} concept [was first made official in the revisions
of the PLA's Political Work Regulations in 2003. -]{.underline}
[Psychological Warfare is]{.underline} defined as operations that
achieve political and military aims by influencing a target's psychology
and behavior through the [distribution of specific
information]{.underline}. Situational awareness can be blurred with
[informational manipulation, and different biases can be
supported.]{.underline} In this respect, [the 'targets' are
practitioners and decision-makers]{.underline}. Psychological Warfare
methods include deterrence, coercion, deception, instigation, seduction,
bribery, inducement and confusion. These methods are part of both
theoretical and doctrinal descriptions. - Public Opinion Warfare is
defined as operations aimed at influencing both domestic and
international support with the use of selective information delivered
through different media. This is different from psychological warfare in
the way that it aims to control the masses. [The main channels for this
type of activity are the internet and traditional media sources, such as
broadcasting and newspapers]{.underline}. Towards the public opinion,
warfare concept channels also include international organizations and
academic forums that can be used from within under a tailor-made
approach. - Legal Warfare is used to attain legal superiority by using
domestic and international law to gain a political initiative or
military advantage. Rather than viewing law as a method of rational
order- making, legal warfare looks for ways to use legal advantage to
influence targets by delivering the effects of interference, response,
defeat, deterrence, or defense via legal means, including through
national or international channels.

[The third book, The seven military classics of Ancient China, gives a
comprehensive picture from a historical perspective of how Chinese
rulers and generals have analyzed the best ways to keep power, get
power, conquer land, defeat the enemy and gain control]{.underline}. The
book includes Sun Tzu's famous "Art of War", and Huang Shigong's "Three
Strategies", which discusses the Art of War. In the latter text, for
example, the line "Follow their (enemy) trends in order to break them.
Be wild with your words in order for them to make mistakes. Surround
them with your net in order to catch them", could be applied to today's
security environment, where the manipulation of information is based on
the assumption that decision-makers will make mistakes that favor the
actors providing misinformation. All these texts have psychological
elements, search for weaknesses and look for ways to covertly succeed.

This snapshot of Chinese strategic thinking already shows that it will
be very hard from outside China to identify actions that are seen and
planned by Beijing to be borderless and ambivalent. Furthermore,
different levels of decision-making are the main target. The various
tools are designed to work in the way that situational awareness is
blurred and context is lost, which means that estimates, warnings and
preparedness in the target are incomplete.

This chapter seeks to offer preliminary answers to two questions. First,
[to what degree will]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**)-[enabled information warfare
**exacerbate hybrid threats to NATO decision-making**]{.underline}?
Second, [what can NATO countries do to alleviate the
threat]{.underline}? To narrow the research scope, this chapter
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} principally look at threats posed by Russian
AI-enabled information warfare operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna. The study argues that **[given that AI-enabled
information warfare has the potential to [amplify]{.mark} societal
[polarization]{.mark}, elite [disagreement]{.mark} with[in]{.mark}
domestic [politics, and reshape the perception of]{.mark} the
["Russia]{.mark}n threat" in NATO member countries, it can have [a
direct negative impact on national and NATO
decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such operations, however, only
amplify existing symptoms of polarization and disagreement found within
NATO member states and are not their root causes. The chapter concludes
that [[NATO must]{.mark} better [integrate tech-centric]{.mark}
so-called "whack-a-troll" [tactics]{.mark} [with a **whole-of-nation
strategy**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} better **[safe-guard NATO decision-making
and alliance cohesion]{.mark}**. Renewed discussion of whole-of-society
defense concepts to inform national security strategies may be useful in
this regard]{.underline}.

Introduction [NATO defines [hybrid threats]{.mark} as threats that
"combine military and non-military as well as covert and overt means,
including disinformation, cyber attacks, economic pressure, deployment
of irregular armed groups and use of regular forces]{.underline}"
(2019). [Such hybrid methods are used to [blur the line between war and
peace]{.mark} and "attempt [to sow doubts]{.mark} in the minds of target
populations."]{.underline} [NATO further emphasizes that]{.underline}
["\[t\]he [speed, scale and intensity]{.mark} of hybrid threats [have
increased]{.mark} in recent years]{.underline}." [The latter can
partially be [traced back to]{.mark} various technological
**[advances]{.mark}** including **[in]{.mark}** the fields
of]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence ([**[AI]{.mark}**) and offensive
cyber capabilities, utilized in conjunction with deliberate attempts by
competitor nations to [undermine]{.mark} the political **[cohesion of
NATO]{.mark}** member states from within]{.underline}.

[[Hybrid threats pose]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of [[unique
challenges to]{.mark} political [decision-making]{.mark}
within]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline} member [states
and]{.underline} the Alliance's various deliberative
[bodies]{.underline}, where decisions are based on the principle of
consensus preceded by consultation processes (NATO, 2020). In
particular, [meddling]{.underline} by outside powers [in political
processes]{.underline} by means of influence operations, broadly defined
as "organized attempts to achieve a specific effect among a target
audience," [is one of the top concerns of NATO leadership]{.underline}
(Thomas et al., 2020). [In particular, Russian]{.underline}
tactical-operational influence operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna ('[hybrid warfare']{.underline}) have been
[receiv]{.underline}ing a great deal of [attention]{.underline} since
2014. As Ofer Fridman notes, [such operations target society at large,
seeking to undermine political cohesion in an adversary state
[by]{.mark} employing methods that amplify the divisions and
[polarization]{.mark}s among its citizens]{.underline} (2018).

Definitional confusion has plagued the discussion on hybrid warfare.
Fridman, who sketches the conceptual evolution of the term in both the
West and Russia, points out that at least three different phenomena have
been described as hybrid warfare in past years with no agreed upon
definition. Indeed, the term 'hybrid warfare' itself may at this point
obfuscate rather than clarify modern conflict characteristics. As
Fridman argues: "Despite the political usefulness of the term hybrid
warfare, it would appear that Russian and Western military professionals
now recognize that the term is next to useless for describing the real
nature of contemporary conflicts, leading them to promote more specific
definitions, such as information warfare, cyber warfare, which are now
prevalent in the West, or new-generationwarfare, which is currently
prevalent in Russia" (2018: 157).

Indeed, the Russian Chief of the General Staff, General Valery
Gerasimov, has publicly aimed to draw a distinction between
new-generation warfare and hybrid warfare with the former -- given its
emphasis on military capabilities -- being the main focus of the Russian
Armed Forces (Fridman, 2018).

**[Nonetheless[, it is evident from a review of Russian military
literature that hybrid warfare]{.mark} focused on weakening societal
cohesion of an opponent still [retains a prominent spot in Russian
national security thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, [a 2015
article]{.underline} on future warfare published [in the widely-read
journal of the Russian Ministry of Defence]{.underline} [stated in
strong terms the centrality of information to the Russian understanding
of future war, asserting that "it is precisely the
information-psychological struggle which will, in the main, create the
preconditions for the achievement of victory \[in future
warfare]{.underline}\]". The article, authored by two frequent
contributors on future warfare, continued: "...the achievement of
strategic objectives in future wars will be impossible without the
establishment of information dominance over the enemy. In future wars,
special [disinformation]{.underline} operations [and]{.underline}
\[operations for\] [misleading]{.underline} the military-political
leadership of the other side [will include a system of interconnected
and carefully-agreed upon large-scale measures **according
to**]{.underline} the plan of new-type war ('**[hybrid
war']{.underline}**), including the use of various means of actions upon
the personnel of the armed forces and population of the state [with the
objective of creating internal tension]{.underline} (schism) in society.
[Information-psychological operations in future war will pursue by
non-forceful means the objective of achieving the significant weakening
of the military potential of the enemy by means of affecting his
information processes, misleading \[him\], demoralizing the population
and the personnel of the armed forces"]{.underline} (Bogdanov and
Chekinov, 2015: 45)

**[As part of]{.underline}** such **[[future
Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}** gibridnaya voyna
**[campaigns]{.underline}**, **[the effective [integration of AI]{.mark}
with cyber capabilities [that enable faster and more precise
weaponization of information has]{.mark} the [potential to]{.mark}
compromise and [undermine NATO decision-making at multiple
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This chapter consequently seeks to offer
preliminary answers to two questions in this regard. First, to what
degree will AI-enabled information warfare1 exacerbate hybrid threats to
NATO decision-making? Second, what can NATO countries do to alleviate
the threat?

To narrow the research scope, this chapter will principally look at
threats posed by Russian influence operations under the concept of
gibridnaya voyna.

Factors Influencing NATO Decision-Making In order to answer to the above
questions, it is first necessary to outline the various influences that
impact allied decision-making within NATO. According a recent RAND
study, [member states' decision-making processes on their own
participation in NATO operations can be broadly divided into three
categories: • Domestic politics; • Perception of the Russian threat; •
Alliance dynamics]{.underline} (Binnendijk and Priebe, 2019).

Notably, RAND finds that [domestic politics and perceptions of the
Russian threat have the larger impact in decision-making processes
involving a]{.underline}n unconventional (i.e. [hybrid]{.underline})
[attack]{.underline} on a NATO country. In the future, such an attack
would undoubtedly feature AI-enabled information warfare as part of
gibridnaya voyna embedded within a new-generation warfare campaign.
Consequently, this chapter will primarily focus on domestic politics and
perceptions of the Russian threat to illustrate Russian
tactical-operational AI-enabled information warfare.

According to the RAND study, domestic political considerations that
influence decision-making regarding support or opposition to NATO
military action in an unconventional environment are impacted by a
number of factors, including the proximity of public elections, general
public support for a particular course of action, elite agreement or
disagreement (coalition governments can be particularly vulnerable in
this case), and a centralized or decentralized foreign policy
decision-making structure. Perceptions of the Russian threat in turn are
also subject to a number of factors including perceptions of Moscow's
aims and motivations, escalation risks, vulnerabilities to Russian
economic sanctions as well as military retaliations, and competing
national security demands (Binnendijk and Priebe, 2019).

Most relevant for this chapter is that [in both]{.underline} instances
-- [domestic politics and perceptions of the Russian threat]{.underline}
-- [**[AI]{.mark}**-enabled information operations have the potential to
[influence]{.mark} factors [in favor of Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, such operations could expand the audience reach of
NATO-skeptical parties during election seasons, or in advance of a
parliamentary vote in order to undermine elite consensus on anti-Russian
actions. Alternatively, with the help of a carefully crafted 'what
aboutism' narrative employed part of a wider disinformation operation,
Moscow could amplify disagreement over aggressive Russian actions within
a target country by emphasizing online that Russia, like any other
country, is merely pursuing legitimate selfinterest.

AI-Enabled Information Warfare [**[AI]{.mark}**-enabled information
[warfare entails]{.mark} the use of algorithms capable of processing and
[learning]{.mark} from big data [to]{.mark} execute [attack]{.mark}s
against [specific targets]{.mark} autonomously or semi-autonomously in
order to achieve a desired effect in the information space]{.underline}.
2 The terms 'autonomously' and 'semi-autonomously' describe respectively
the ability of the algorithm without or with (limited) human
intervention to learn from vast amounts of data in order to execute
polymorphic attacks on multiple fronts in the information space (for
example, simultaneous attacks on a microblogging site synchronized with
emails phishing attacks), in which the algorithm is capable of changing
its identifiable features (for example, by creating multiple malicious
online identities fitted with unique malware packages). The most
relevant media for AI-enabled information warfare are audio, text and
video (Giles and Hartmann, 2020). Furthermore, AI-enabled information
operations target all interrelated dimensions of the information
environment -- physical, informational, and cognitive/emotional. Herbert
Lin and Jaclyn Kerr define the information environment as, the
"aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect,
process, disseminate, or act on information" (2019: 4).

[AI]{.underline}-enabled information [warfare methods may plausibly be
deployed in various other ways]{.underline}. For example, [AIenabled
algorithms permit the building of [realistic simulations]{.mark} of
individuals "to [test]{.mark} every [individual's reaction]{.mark} to
events (both virtual and real), advertising, political campaigns, and
psychological operations, and even to guess what might go viral through
person-to-person interactions]{.underline}" (Libicki, 2017: 52). Such
simulations could be created by deploying an algorithm capable of
pattern recognition to study the social media behavior of a select
target group of individuals in a specific country. [This]{.underline} in
turn [could be used [to create personalized]{.mark} phishing emails for
[social engineering attacks,]{.mark} but also]{.underline} to create
so-called '[[deepfakes']{.underline}]{.mark} to gain access to sensitive
systems or to facilitate the spreading of disinformation. Another
example is the use of [[bots]{.underline}]{.mark} in order [to 'hijack'
public perceptions]{.underline}: "[Bots, trolls, and sock puppets can
invent new 'facts' out of thin air leading to a polarized society and a
culture of mistrust]{.underline}" (Wright, 2019: 318). [The main
objective behind creating alternate facts would not be to create a
convincing alternative narrative -- which is an objective of strategic
communications -- but rather to erode the solidarity of groups facing
the same threat by **[playing on]{.mark}** the **[fears and anxieties of
individuals]{.mark} (**]{.underline}Libicki, 2017).

In sum, [AI-enabled information warfare differs from 'regular'
information warfare in four crucial areas]{.underline}: 1.
[Speed]{.underline}: AI can accelerate the pace of operations by, for
example, faster identifying targets due to the expedited
operationalization of cyber intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) data as a result of increased pattern recognition
capabilities of algorithms. 2. [Scope]{.underline}: AI can expand the
scope of information warfare operations by semi-autonomously or
autonomously executing polymorphic attacks on multiple platforms with
the help of bots, trolls, or sock puppets. 3. [Scale]{.underline}: AI
can increase the chances of a particular message or narrative going
'viral' in the information space by, for example, self-learning
algorithms 'wargaming' the potential impact of specific content online,
or AI-enabled facial recognition software that is capable of recognizing
emotional states of individual humans. 4. [Sophistication]{.underline}:
AI can not only increase the sophistication of microtargeting processes,
but also facilitate the creation of ever more convincing synthetic media
products (such as 'deepfakes') with the support of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) where it is increasingly difficult to
separate real from synthetic identities (Rocca, 2019).

**[[Since AI is]{.mark} both [scalable and effective, it is likely to be
of significant utility to those seeking to undermine]{.mark} Western
[democracies]{.mark} because it will permit adversaries to avoid making
tradeoffs between scale and effectiveness]{.underline}**. [In
particular, AI will likely allow adversaries to expand exponentially the
scale and rate of attacks, while also increasing the number of
targets]{.underline} (Rocca, 2019). In addition, [the following factors
are all likely to enhance the utility of AI in information
warfare:]{.underline} [societies' growing dependence on cyberspace as a
news source; citizens' increased reliance on social media; the
difficulties individuals face in distinguishing between fake and genuine
news sources; the unprecedented levels of access to information; and the
speed at which information can be spread between
individuals]{.underline} (Giles and Hartmann, 2020).

AI, however, is no panacea for influence operations. The impact of
AI-enabled information warfare will largely depend on the quality of
input data on the one hand, and continue to be contingent on analogue
factors that may be too difficult for algorithms to effectively process
on the other (for instance, various cultural and historical factors that
may impact a society's reaction to a particular event).

Furthermore, an overreliance on AI-enabled technology, in particular for
conducting information warfare operations in cyberspace, may be
misguided given the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which AI will
favor the offense or defense (Dafoe and Garfinkel, 2019b). Building on
the literature analyzing 'regular' or conventional cyber attack and
defense operations (given that AI-enabled information warfare operations
will mainly be conducted through this domain), broad generalizations on
the subject are misplaced. As one analysis regarding the offense-defense
balance in cyberspace puts it: "Sweeping claims about the offensedefense
balance in cyberspace are misguided because the balance can be assessed
only with respect to specific organizational skills and technologies"
(Slayton, 2016: 72).

Nevertheless, there is some evidence that certain methods appear to
favor the offensive. As a digital forensics expert notes regarding
deepfake technology, "the adversary will always win, you will always be
able to create a compelling fake image, or video, but the ability to do
that if we are successful on the forensics side is going to take more
time, more effort, more skill and more risk" (Giles and Hartmann, 2020:
236). Another analysis notes that scaling effects will likely be an
important factor in determining the offensedefense balance (Dafoe and
Garfinkel, 2019a). Nonetheless, it is unclear whether, for example,
increased automation alone will ultimately favor the attacker or
defender. Given that AI-enabled information warfare will be carried out
principally through cyberspace, the uncertainty surrounding presumed
technical solutions should therefore be kept in mind by policymakers.

If no discernible offensive advantage can be achieved, there is the risk
of an information war of attrition with no clear winner but with
excessive collateral damage sustained by society overall. The series of
Chinesebacked Covid-19 disinformation campaigns executed in 2020 are a
good example of this, having inflicted lasting damage on the information
spaces of a number of Western democracies despite the adoption of
successful countermeasures by governments (Ha & Cho, 2020). As these
campaigns have shown, an information warfare stalemate would likely be
more harmful to democratic societies that assume the presence of free
speech as a norm than to authoritarian societies where the flow of
information is under tighter control, and where consequently a
disruption of the information space will have fewer consequences.

#### War makes everything else harder to manage

could portend the end of the "long peace"\"The war in Ukraine could
portend the end of the "long peace"
<https://www.vox.com/2022/2/26/22951016/russia-ukraine-long-peace-nuclear-weapons-global-development>
//pipk

Those abandoned fallout shelters were on my mind on Wednesday night as I
watched Russia overturn decades of seemingly settled international
policy with an invasion of Ukraine that was as premeditated as it was
shocking. What sets this action apart from the countless conflicts,
large and small, that have unfolded over recent decades, is the specter
of nuclear weapons.

That was implicit in Russia's decision to exercise its strategic nuclear
forces in the leadup to the invasion, in Putin's absurd casus belli
claim that Ukraine was going to develop its own nuclear weapons, in his
threat that countries that interfered with Russian actions would face
"consequences you have never seen." As Roger Cohen pointed out in the
New York Times, Putin's speech "seemed to come closer to threatening
nuclear war than any statement from a major world leader in recent
decades."

The irony is that one of the reasons Ukraine was vulnerable to a Russian
invasion is that it does not possess nuclear weapons. It agreed in 1994
to give up Soviet nukes that had been left in its territory after the
USSR's breakup in exchange for an agreement that the US, the UK, and
Russia would guarantee its security. And one of the reasons that Putin
could invade knowing that international opposition would be largely
limited to diplomatic and financial tools was that Russia still
possesses the world's largest nuclear arsenal.

It has also retained strategic ambiguity about just when and why it
would use those weapons, including the possibility it would threaten a
nuclear strike if it were on the losing side of a conventional conflict
with NATO.

As Vox's Zack Beauchamp writes, what we're seeing is an illustration of
the "stability-instability paradox" of nuclear weapons. As the chance of
nuclear conflict declines, the theory holds, the risk of conventional
war increases, and as the likelihood of nuclear conflict increases, the
risk of conventional war declines. That in turn helps explain another
paradox: why the decades following the introduction of nuclear weapons
--- weapons that, in their most maximalist effect, could conceivably
bring an end to human civilization --- also saw a historic fall in the
number of war-related deaths around the world.

Chart of battle deaths 1945-2016

Our World in Data

These decades go by another name: "the long peace." The name can be a
bit misleading --- for much of the world, these years have been anything
but peaceful, with the number of discrete conflicts beginning to rise in
the 1960s and staying high ever since.

These ranged from large conflicts like America's decade in Vietnam and
the 1980s Iran-Iraq war to countless small skirmishes, often conflicts
within countries, that barely penetrated the international media. But
compared to the blood-stained decades that marked the first half of the
20th century --- which saw more than 100 million deaths in World Wars I
and II combined --- let alone humanity's tremendously violent past,
these years have indeed been a holiday from history.

And if the invasion of Ukraine marks a decisive end to that holiday, as
some experts have suggested, we risk losing far more than peace.

The wages of peace

When Future Perfect was launched in 2018, Vox's Dylan Matthews laid out
a founding question: "What topics would we write about [if our only
instruction was to write about the most important stuff in the
world]{.underline}?"

[The years that followed provided some of the answers: the [battle
against]{.mark} global [poverty]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the common
[diseases]{.mark} that still kill too many of the world's
poorest;]{.underline} the growth of effective altruism and the rigorous
movement to do the most good per dollar; [[the expansion of moral
concern from]{.mark} tribe and [nation to all]{.mark} of [humanity and
even non-human species; and]{.mark} yes, occasionally, **[the
existential threat of]{.mark}** superintelligent
**[AI]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[What these topics have in common is that they [all flourish best in
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The last half-century or more hasn't just seen [a historic reduction in
the casualties of war]{.mark}. It's [also witnessed an unprecedented
expansion in human prosperity]{.mark}, as measured in health, wealth,
and education. It's an expansion that is far from perfect [and]{.mark}
far from complete, but one that has [opened the door]{.mark}, even just
a crack, [to a future that truly could be
perfect]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

**[[That progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I would argue, **[[depends on
peace. Unchecked war is the great destroyer of human
value]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One estimate from 2019 put the economic
impact of violence and conflict at \$14.4 trillion that year, equivalent
to more than 10 percent of gross global GDP.

**[But dollar figures are only one way of counting the destruction. [A
world where borders can]{.mark} once again [be remade with
force]{.mark}, [where countries]{.mark} and their citizens no longer
feel secure from better-armed neighbors, is one where the broader goals
Future Perfect covers (and values) will be harder to achieve, where the
circle of moral concern could shrink rather than grow. It is a return to
barbarity.]{.underline}**

#### Deterrence solves climate change

War: Existential Threats on a "Split Screen"\" October 26.
<https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2021/10/climate-change-nuclear-war-existential-threats-split-screen/>
//pipk

"In international relations today, [we face two truly existential
threats]{.underline}---[in climate change and in nuclear
war]{.underline}," [says Robert Litwak, Senior Vice President for
Scholars and Director of International Security Studies]{.underline}, in
a new episode of Wilson NOW. The interview with Litwak focuses on his
new article, "Geostrategic Competition and Climate Change: Avoiding the
Unmanageable," recently published in 21st Century Diplomacy: Foreign
Policy is Climate Policy.

[Climate catastrophe and nuclear war are often conceptualized as
separate and distinct---as if on a split screen]{.underline}, says
Litwak. **[At this critical juncture---when "the risk of conflict
between the United States and its Great Power rivals, China and Russia,
is at the highest point since the end of the Cold War"---the two crises
must be understood as interconnected]{.underline}**.

**[Curtailing unrestrained geostrategic competition is a precondition
for averting the climate crisis]{.underline}**, says Litwak. "...[if we
don't get a handle on the geostrategic competition, which has its own
dire potential consequences if conflict were to break out, we will be
nowhere on climate. We will not be able to have the collective action
necessary, and we have a narrow window for action on the climate piece.
The geostrategic piece has created such virulent relations that it
precludes the kind of global cooperation among U.S., Russia, and China
that we need to address the climate threat."]{.underline}

[In theory, great powers can compartmentalize climate change
from]{.underline} long standing [geopolitical pressures]{.underline} in
order [to jointly curb global carbon emissions]{.underline}, says
Litwak. [But China and the United States espouse opposing perspectives
on climate diplomacy.]{.underline} **[China views climate change
mitigation through a transactional diplomacy lens---that is,
international collaboration to decarbonize the economy is not dissevered
from traditional geostrategic dynamics but rather a means to
simultaneously pursue parochial state goals]{.underline}**. In contrast,
the U.S. position is that climate change transcends national interests,
and should not be brandished as a "geopolitical weapon" or ideological
tool, says Litwak.

[These]{.underline} conflicting standpoints [play out against the
backdrop of heightened tensions between the United States and its
nuclear-armed adversaries, China and Russia]{.underline}. [A "new
calculus of risk" has emerged in geopolitics]{.underline}, says Litwak.
First, [strategic competition is territorial]{.underline}, not
ideological, in nature: [Superpowers are jockeying for power over border
areas of core national interest, namely Taiwan and the South China Sea
for China and Ukraine for Russia]{.underline}. [Second, the development
of advanced technologies and the extension of competition into new
domains]{.underline} (cyber and outer space) [create new escalatory
risks. "The nuclear states are committed to nuclear modernization with
new types of weapons that may affect strategic stability, and create an
incentive for one side or the other to go first in a crisis. And up
until now, the sine qua non of strategic stability has been essentially
mutual vulnerability]{.underline}," says Litwak. "[That calculus may be
changing with new capabilities]{.underline}."

The [tensions between the United States and Russia and China are not
likely to be eliminated]{.underline}, says Litwak, [but must be managed
for there to be any possibility of opening lines of dialogue around
climate between the two warring factions]{.underline}. Litwak shares
[key pathways **to maintain deterrence**]{.underline}: 1) settle
territorial disputes that serve as major flashpoints for conflict; 2)
revive the arms control architecture of the 1980s and 90s, which
stipulated frameworks for nuclear modernization; and 3) engage in
international summitry in order to establish "rules of the road, guard
rails, basic principles to govern relations" that manage unrestrained
geostrategic competition.

At the 1985 Geneva summit, says Litwak, President Ronald Reagan asked
Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev if the two nations could put aside
their differences and unite together in the event of an alien invasion.
Climate change is analogous to this extraterrestrial attack, says
Litwak. The fundamental question now is whether unconstrained
geostrategic competition will hinder concerted action---or will the
superpowers work together to forestall the worst effects of climate
ruin?

The ongoing technological transformation has not only renewed great
powers' longforgotten competition in areas like technology, with
[the]{.underline} so-called [AI race]{.underline},330 but it [has also
given rise to new instruments for political competition and
influence]{.underline}.331 [The effect of these instruments is
particularly subtle, because they undermine the very principles and
institutions -- such as democracy, freedom of speech and free markets --
on which NATO is built and which, as an Alliance, it tries to
promote]{.underline}.

Propaganda, disinformation, deception and counter-intelligence have
always existed. However, the possibility of applying emerging
technologies with disruptive potential to these domains is relatively
unprecedented.332 For instance, [forensic evidence]{.underline} related
to popular digital platforms like WeChat and TikTok [shows that specific
hashtags, accounts or information have been suppressed by foreign actors
or governments, likely for political reasons]{.underline}.333
[Similarly, in the past few years, autocratic regimes have recurrently
relied on chatbots, troll farms and diffusion of
disinformation]{.underline} through Facebook or Twitter [with a view to
altering political competition within, and outside, NATO]{.underline}.

Second, [key technologies related to AI]{.underline}, ML and BD, [such
as facial and speech recognition software, provide new opportunities for
autocratic rulers to curtail individual freedoms, impose human rights
abuses and implement societal control measures which would be deemed
unacceptable within NATO. However, some countries are exporting those
technologies around the world, thus making undermining democracy and
freedom not only at home but also abroad]{.underline}.334

Last but not least, while economic competition and economic intelligence
have long characterized statecraft and international relations, [in an
age when technology yields accelerating returns, adversaries and
competitors can (and do) exploit free markets and open societies so as
to steer chaos and appropriate foreign technology. This has nefarious
implications for competitiveness as well as national security, given the
dual nature of many technologies at hand]{.underline}.335

[These are issues on which NATO]{.underline} and its Allies [are in a
sense caught unprepared. The dominant consensus has long held that
digital technologies would undermine autocratic rule, and that that
state-sponsored economic activities would struggle to keep pace with
free markets]{.underline}.336 [Recent history has proved both
assumptions wrong. Firewalls can permit autocratic countries to control
their internal flow of information. ML and BD can increase, rather than
undermine, societal control. Free markets and open societies are
vulnerable to uncompetitive and unfair measures and, such as theft of
intellectual property or illicit transfer of technology, as well as to
disinformation and propaganda, which are made more effective by digital
platforms.]{.underline}

Whether these are examples of hybrid threats is an important discussion,
which cannot be addressed here.337 [NATO]{.underline} Allies, however,
[have important issues to discuss. Anti-fake software. We are all
potential victims of disinformation. The evolution of disinformation,
thanks to the development of generative adversian networks and the
emergence of so-called deepfakes -- videos that create artificial
speeches over video clips of notable public individuals -- is
particularly worrying]{.underline}. [For NATO, deepfakes could represent
an existential threat as trust in political and social institutions
could be dramatically undermined.]{.underline} One layer of defence for
NATO could consist in promoting the development and adoption of an
anti-fake software -- i.e., one that can be easily installed on anyone's
phone or desktop as an alert system against seemingly illegitimate
content. This could be funded as a pilot project or through a Grand
Challenge. The goal would be to enable all individuals to be protected
from disinformation attacks. Self-evidently, the software, its code as
well as its parameters must be sufficiently open and transparent to
enable public scrutiny.338

[Algorithmic principles. NATO Allies have a strong interest in agreeing
on, and setting out, a series of principles and actions to stop their
companies supporting, even unintentionally, the rise of digital
authoritarianism]{.underline}. [In particular, it is important to ensure
that their technologies or services be prevented from enabling the use
of AI for purposes which go against NATO values and principles, such as
mass societal control or suppression of free speech]{.underline}.

Cyber security and investments screening. Cyber attacks, theft of
intellectual property as well as well illicit transfer of technology,
including through mergers and acquisitions of foreign companies, have
grown exponentially in recent years. Such tactics undermine economic
competition and are extremely perilous from a security perspective,
given that they make it possible to bypass measures such as technology
export control regimes. NATO and its Allies have a strong interest in
strengthening the cyber defence of their companies. This may imply, for
start-ups and small and medium enterprises, various incentives to build
up their cyber security, as well as direct government support. At the
same time, a NATOwide effort towards the screening of foreign companies'
investments and acquisitions is important to counter illicit transfer of
technology: cooperation with the European Union would be important in
this respect.339

A technological alliance of democracies. As highlighted in previous
sections, [the challenge facing NATO]{.underline} and its Allies [is
massive, sudden, subtle and multidimensional]{.underline}. In some
areas, intra-Alliance cooperation and coordination combined with
powerful initiatives will not suffice, as close work with the private
sector and with external partners will be necessary. This is why a group
of prominent researchers have proposed a technological alliance of
democracies, to better address the threats and challenges we are
facing.340 [The role of NATO outside its borders]{.underline} -- and the
Euro-Atlantic area more generally -- [is]{.underline} admittedly [a
sensitive issue, on which multiple perspectives and sensitivities
co-exist]{.underline}. [However, there is room for the Alliance to play
a more proactive role around the world in upholding, mostly through
diplomacy, the very principles on which it is based: democracy, free
markets, rule of law and human rights]{.underline}.

Disinformation: not exactly new

False information and misleading narratives have been tools of conflict
and statecraft since the fabled city of Troy fell to the ancient Greeks,
and probably before. In the distant past, there were fabricated wooden
horses, false witnesses, and faked plans. Today, we have fake news,
false social media profiles, and fabricated narratives created to
mislead---sometimes as part of coordinated cognitive warfare campaigns.

radically expanded reach, scale, and impact. And the concern is that

actors, but to non-state actors, private individuals, and everyone in
between]{.underline}.

Disinformation in the Western Balkans

False messages and inflammatory narratives have made headlines in
extreme cases, notably in the Western Balkans and in some Allied
countries. Their more insidious danger is the damage they can do to
citizens' faith in the institutions of democratic governance and
resources of public information and discussion. And recent years have
seen growing political polarisation, historically low levels of trust in
governing institutions, and instances of unrest and violence, aided in
part by false information.

disinformation

NATO member countries maintain open civil communications systems, some
with very high rates of social media and social messaging use. The
pluralistic characters of their societies, while an advantage and source
of strength, can at the same time provide opportunities for divisive or
incendiary narratives to take hold. For many of these countries,
resilient and protective regulatory structures are still in their
infancy. The combination of these conditions makes the threat of
disinformation of particular concern for the Alliance.

The focus on false facts

Global social media companies have taken up the challenge to mitigate
false information on their platforms. Most employ in-house human fact
checkers to monitor the dissemination of false information. Some rely on
third-party human fact checking or moderating tools. Several popular
platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter provide their users
with the option to report other users suspected of spreading false
information, either knowingly or unknowingly. And in an effort to
retroactively correct for the damage caused by false information, the
vast majority of social media platforms have used the mass removal of
content identified as harmful or misleading via these methods.

At best, this has proved to be too little, too late. At worst, it has
led to accusations of censorship, and to the removal of information or
opinions that later turned out to be credible or worthy of public
discussion.

The problem of volume

There are nearly three billion monthly active users on Facebook alone,
each one capable of posting something inflammatory online. Twitter has
over 350 million active users, including prominent individuals, popular
opinion leaders, and clever and resourceful influencers.

The current approach to counter disinformation relies mostly upon manual
fact-checking, content removal, and damage-control. While human
interventions may be useful in cases requiring nuanced understanding or
cultural sensitivity, they are poorly matched to the large volumes of
information created every day. It is unlikely that adding more personnel
is a realistic option to proactively identify false or damaging content
before it has the chance to spread widely. Human fact checking is, in
itself, subject to error, misinterpretation, and bias.

Billions of monthly active users of social media are capable of posting
something inflammatory online. This is an overwhelming amount of
information for manual fact-checkers.

What goes viral?

"Falsehood flies and truth comes limping after it" wrote the satirist
Jonathan Swift in the 17th Century. A recent MIT study found that on
Twitter, false news items are much more likely to go viral, and regular
users, not automated 'bots,' are responsible for re-sharing them. People
also 'retweet' these false news items with sentiments of surprise and
disgust. By contrast, true stories produce sentiments of sadness,
anticipation, and trust (and are much less frequently shared).

This raises a potential opportunity: Should we focus not on facts, but
on emotions instead? And could computers, not humans, be trained do so?

Don't check facts, check emotions

Artificial intelligence-based sentiment analysis represents an entirely
different approach to mitigating disinformation by training computers to
identify messages and posts containing elements of surprise, disgust,
and other emotional predictors. These are more likely to be associated
with false information and to inflame the passions of social media
users.

Natural language processing algorithms make it possible to identify
linguistic indicators of the emotions in question. They avoid human fact
checking altogether, reducing bias and cost, and increasing processing
speeds. A student team at Johns Hopkins University has created a
promising working prototype, and their teammates at the Georgia
Institute of Technology and Imperial College London have developed
feasibility assessments and potential regulatory approaches.

Don't stop disinformation, slow it down

But once a highly viral (and likely false) message or post is
identified, what to do? An analogy from the financial markets suggests a
solution: an automated 'circuit-breaker' that temporarily suspends or
slows the dissemination of emotionally charged content.

Stock markets avoid panic selling by temporarily suspending the trading
of stocks that have declined by certain percentage thresholds. On the
New York Stock Exchange, stocks that decline in price by over 7% are
halted for 15 minutes in the first instance. The idea is to slow things
down and let cooler heads prevail. Subsequent price declines can trigger
additional trading suspensions.

The cooling effect of slowing things down can be significant. On a
social messaging site, a message that doubles every 15 minutes can
hypothetically reach one million views in five hours, and 16 million
views in six hours. But if slowed to doubling every 30 minutes, it would
reach only one thousand views in five hours and four thousand in six
hours. Small differences in virality yield huge differences in exposure.

Such a mechanism would operate, not by preventing sharing, but by
slowing engagement; for example, by imposing cool down periods between
comments, or prompting users to consider possible consequences before
resending a message. It builds on the central thesis in the Nobel Prize
winner Daniel Kahneman's book Thinking Fast and Slow. Slow thinking is
rational and avoids the emotionality of fast reactions to surprising and
shocking news or events.

This could reduce concerns of censorship or arbitrary limits upon the
free flow of ideas. Messages and posts are not taken down or eliminated.
They remain available for review and discussion, only at a slower pace.
This mitigates the problem of who adjudicates 'permissible speech' and
protects valuable freedoms of expression and public discourse. Such an
approach could be implemented, via incentives or regulation, at various
layers of the communication infrastructure: the source companies
themselves, mediating gateways (or 'middle-ware' platforms), the message
transport level (the communications 'pipes'), or even at the device
level (smartphone or tablet).

Considerations for the Alliance

Disinformation is one of several digital threats facing the Alliance.
Recent information campaigns and cyberattacks have revealed that even
technologically advanced member states must do more to prepare for
current and emerging digital challenges. More progress is needed in
establishing successful resilience mechanisms and regulatory frameworks.

Cyberattacks threaten even the most technologically advanced NATO
members. More progress is needed in establishing successful resilience
mechanisms and regulatory frameworks.

Cyberattacks threaten even the most technologically advanced NATO
members. More progress is needed in establishing successful resilience
mechanisms and regulatory frameworks.

Yet these threats appear to be increasing daily, leaving the Alliance
with little time. Taking advantage of existing technologies (such as
those mentioned above) and applying them in innovative ways should save
both time and resources. Minimally invasive mitigation concepts, such as
slowing---but not permanently deleting---potentially harmful social
media messages and posts, may be the most promising first step to
address the threat of disinformation. The Alliance can then spend more
time on additional technology development and more comprehensive
regulatory approaches in the future.

Historically, the resilience and strength of open and pluralistic
societies has been in their ability to adapt innovatively to emerging
challenges and circumstances. A foundational mechanism for this is the
free flow of ideas and information, as well as the open and public
discussion and examination of options, policies, and plans. Any solution
to disinformation must protect this mechanism if we wish to keep this
advantage. Moreover, the adoption of solutions by member states will
rely upon the acceptance of their societies at large and is unlikely to
succeed if internal constituencies consider themselves marginalised or
excluded from the public dialogue.

NATO could endeavor to promote the adoption of such technology- and
principles-based approaches while leaving member states to decide their
own national digital security strategies. This would provide member
state governments with the flexibility to implement mechanisms as they
see fit, congruent with their local levels of social media adoption,
popular expectations of free expression, and the realities of their
civil communications infrastructures.

//pipk

[In 2021, [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} the
nations of **[Eu]{.mark}**rope will [face challenges that
threaten]{.mark} their way of [life:]{.mark} a catastrophic
[pandemic]{.mark}, a deep economic [recession]{.mark}, accelerating
[climate]{.mark} change, a rising [China]{.mark}, growing
[tech]{.mark}nological [competition, and]{.mark} emerging [security
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[These challenges test our ability to deliver on our promise to
safeguard and enhance the lives of our people. They confront the
transatlantic community at a time when many citizens on both sides of
the Atlantic continue to question whether their governments are able to
deliver for them. [These]{.mark} are issues that [transcend]{.mark}
national [borders. They **cannot be** ]{.mark}**successfully [dealt with
alone]{.mark}**. They can only be resolved through concerted,
cooperative international action]{.underline}.

This Transatlantic Task Force report recommends concrete policy
initiatives the United States and Europe can take together to manage our
pressing shared problems. We make these recommendations, not because
they will be easy to implement, but because they represent practical
options to help address the key challenges we face.

Political change is underway on both sides of the Atlantic. In 2021, the
United States may have a new president. The United Kingdom will formally
leave the European single market, complicating transatlantic relations.
And Germany will hold a national election and have new leadership by the
fall.

[But the ability of Europe and the United States to work together in the
face of shared challenges faces an even more daunting test:]{.underline}
public disenchantment with each other. Many Europeans, disillusioned
with the United States and its leadership, desire greater economic,
technological, and military autonomy. In the United States, supporters
of President Donald Trump share his view that the United States has long
been taken advantage of by its European allies.

[[The]{.mark} transatlantic [relationship has weathered storms]{.mark}
in the past]{.underline}. For more than seven decades, Europe and the
United States have stood side by side in the face of threats to their
wellbeing: during the Cold War, following 9/11, and once more in the
aftermath of the 2009-2010 financial crisis. Our successful cooperation
has been based on common interests and a shared set of democratic values
that have led to greater security and prosperity for our people. [[But
past performance is no assurance of future success]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[[In the face of existential challenges,]{.mark} such as climate
change, pandemics, and competition from China, [neither the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [nor]{.mark} its [Eu]{.mark}ropean
partners [can]{.mark} effectively [act alone]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Rather, [these problems offer us an opportunity to find new ways to work
together to build a better future for our people and the
world.]{.underline} Our publics support such cooperative effort. Roughly
six-in-ten Americans and Europeans believe that when dealing with major
international issues their nation should take into account other
countries' interests, even if it means making compromises. **[In so
doing, [we can set an example for the world, laying the foundation
for]{.mark} much [broader cooperation]{.mark} among like-minded
democracies that ultimately will be necessary [to cope with]{.mark} what
today are truly [global challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the
process, we can transform the transatlantic relationship, assert
U.S.-European leadership, affirm our citizens' faith in our democratic
values and each other, and demonstrate the ability of our democratic
institutions to solve their people's problems.

We understand that some of the initiatives we propose lack bipartisan
support in the United States and may not be embraced by the next
administration. Nor will they appeal to all Europeans. But several of
them build on ideas and efforts already proposed by U.S. President
Donald Trump, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and some European
leaders. None of them are a one-year exercise. Meeting these new
challenges will take an effort on the scale and duration of past
alliance solidarity. The problems are clear, and their shared nature is
self-evident. Now is not the time for more reflection and muddling
through. [Both sides of the Atlantic are facing very real threats to our
way of life and concrete action is required to deal with these issues
and preserve the democratic order that Americans and Europeans built
together over the past seven decades]{.underline}.

The following recommendations reflect the deliberations of the co-chairs
and the 14 American and European task force members, supplemented by
interviews by the executive director with more than 150 European and
American experts from diverse fields and countries. They are the sole
responsibility of the executive director and the co-chairs; individual
recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of all task force

A prolonged [global democratic recession has]{.underline}, in recent
years, [morphed into something even more troubling: [the]{.mark} "third
reverse [wave" of democratic breakdowns]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
political scientist Samuel Huntington warned could follow the remarkable
burst of "third wave" democratic progress in the 1980s and the 1990s.
[Every year for the past 15 years]{.underline}, according to Freedom
House, [significantly more countries have seen declines in political
rights and civil liberties than have seen gains]{.underline}. [But since
2015, that already ominous trend [has turned]{.mark} sharply
[worse]{.mark}: 2015--19 was the first five-year period since the
beginning of the third wave in 1974 when [more countries abandoned
democracy]{.mark}---twelve---[than transitioned]{.mark} to
it---seven]{.underline}.

And [the trend continues]{.underline}. [Illiberal populist leaders are
degrading democracy]{.underline} in countries including Brazil, India,
Mexico, and Poland, and creeping authoritarianism has already moved
Hungary, the Philippines, Turkey, and Venezuela out of the category of
democracies altogether. In Georgia, the dominance of the Georgian Dream
Party has led to the steady decline of electoral processes and a
breakdown in the rule of law. In Myanmar, the military overthrew the
elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, ending an experiment in partial
democracy. In El Salvador, president Nayib Bukele staged an executive
coup by removing the attorney general and Supreme Court justices who
were obstacles to his consolidation of power. In Peru, democracy hangs
from a thread as the right-wing autocrat Keiko Fujimori advances vague
claims of election fraud in a bid to overturn her narrow electoral
defeat to left-wing opponent Pedro Castillo.

What is especially striking about this last case is that [Fujimori's
gambit bears a grim resemblance to the lie perpetuated by]{.underline}
former U.S. President Donald [Trump and his followers]{.underline} about
the 2020 presidential election. [This is no coincidence.]{.underline} As
the journalist and historian Anne Applebaum has observed, [fictitious
claims of fraud and "stop the steal" tactics are becoming a common means
by which autocratic populists try to obstruct democracy]{.underline}.
[Such tactics have long been a source of instability in countries
struggling to develop democracy]{.underline}. **[But the fact that the
most recent iteration of [the antidemocrat's playbook draws heavily on
precedents in the world's most important]{.mark} [and powerful
democracy]{.mark} marks the start of [a dangerous new
era]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Today, [the United States confronts a growing antidemocratic
movement]{.underline}, [not just from the ranks of fringe extremists but
also from a substantial group of officeholders---a movement that is
challenging the very foundations of electoral democracy]{.underline}.
[Should this effort succeed, the United States could become the first
ever advanced industrial democracy to fail---that is, to no longer meet
the minimum conditions for free and fair elections as political
scientists and other scholars of democracy define them]{.underline}.

**[The [failure of American democracy would be catastrophic]{.mark} not
only [for]{.mark} the United States; it would also have profound
[global]{.mark} consequences at a time when freedom and
[democracy]{.mark} are already under siege.]{.underline}** As Huntington
noted, **[the [diffusion]{.mark} [of democratic]{.mark} movements and
[ideas]{.mark} from one country to another has helped [drive positive
democratic change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Antidemocratic]{.mark} norms
and [practices]{.mark} can [spread]{.mark} in a similar
fashion---especially when they emanate from powerful
countries.]{.underline} [That is why the acceleration of a democratic
recession into a democratic depression happened largely on Trump's
watch]{.underline}. **[And it is why [no development would more gravely
damage]{.mark} the [global democratic cause]{.mark} than the democratic
backsliding of its most important champion]{.underline}**.

THE DEMOCRATIC TRIAD

A [[democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} system of [[government stands
on]{.mark} three legs]{.underline}. The [[first]{.underline}]{.mark} leg
[is popular sovereignty]{.underline}---[[rule by the
people]{.underline}]{.mark}. Democracy demands that people are able to
choose and replace their leaders in regular, free, and fair elections;
that all adult citizens are able to vote free from intimidation and
obstruction; and that candidates and parties are free to compete and
campaign. Crucially, elections must be administered impartially, so that
valid ballots are counted accurately and power is granted to those who
win.

[Liberty is]{.underline} the [[second]{.underline}]{.mark} leg of
liberal democracy. [A fully democratic system provides [strong
protections for]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[freedom
of]{.underline}**]{.mark} speech, the press,
**[[association]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and assembly. [It ensures that
these rights are **equally protected** for all social
groups]{.underline}. [And it promotes a culture of mutual tolerance and
respect for the rights of political opponents]{.underline}.

The [[third]{.underline}]{.mark} leg---[the rule of
law]{.underline}---defends and strengthens the other two. It
[ensures]{.underline} that **[[democratic procedures are]{.mark}
impartially [enforced]{.mark}]{.underline}** by an independent judiciary
and other regulatory bodies that check the abuse of power. In most
advanced democracies, excluding the United States, these instruments of
accountability include national bodies to administer elections and to
monitor corruption.

Trump was the first U.S. president to demonstrate contempt for all three
legs of the triad of liberal democracy. He attacked the media as "fake
news" and "absolute scum" and called for his election opponent to be
"locked up." He invited his followers to commit acts of violence against
protesting opponents. Upon his defeat, he insisted that the election
results were fraudulent and had to be overturned. Throughout his
presidency, he waged war on an independent judiciary, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, his own attorney general, the Office of Government
Ethics, the civil service, and a host of other actors who refused to
bend to his political will or sought to enforce the rule of law.

**[The United States' outsize importance will influence struggling
democracies and embattled autocracies alike]{.underline}**.

Many scholars of democracy perceived an unprecedented threat to U.S.
democracy when Trump entered office in 2017 and feared grave assaults on
the second and third legs of the democratic triad, in particular. This
assessment was partially correct. Not since President Richard Nixon and
[rarely in U.S. history has there been such a determined effort to
misuse and subvert administrative and rule-of-law institutions for
nakedly political ends]{.underline}---[but these attempts achieved only
limited effect. The bulk of the press and the judiciary remained
independent]{.underline}. The FBI avoided political capture. Outside the
Republican Party and Trump's own administration, freedom of speech
thrived. From 2017 [through 2020, liberty and the rule of law more or
less held.]{.underline}

[In three respects, however, most scholars misjudged the nature of the
peril---and underestimated its gravity]{.underline}. First, [many
assumed that Trump himself constituted the biggest threat to U.S.
democracy and that his defeat would lance the poisonous boil on the body
politic. Second, with notable exceptions]{.underline}, including the
Yale historian Timothy Snyder and the Carnegie Endowment scholar Rachel
Kleinfeld, [many underestimated the potential for violence]{.underline}
on the part of Trump's true-believing followers. [And third, most
underestimated the extent to which Trump would remake the Republican
Party as an institution not only slavishly loyal to him but also hostile
to democracy]{.underline}.

[Fortunately]{.underline}, leading up to the 2020 election, democracy
scholars and **[[civic organizations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [correctly
[anticipated]{.mark} the [threats]{.mark} to electoral integrity posed
by zealous Trump partisans, as well as the staggering logistical
challenges presented by the pandemic]{.underline}. [As a result, they
launched one of the most energetic civic campaigns in U.S. history to
register an unprecedented number of voters, to give them safe and early
access to the ballot, to ensure that local electoral administrations had
the resources necessary to administer the vote, and to prepare to combat
any potential efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the
presidential election.]{.underline} The election was not a nightmare
scenario, as some had feared. In fact, it proved to be one of the
best-administered elections in U.S. history, leading election experts
Nathaniel Persily and Charles Stewart III to call it a "miracle."

IT COULD STILL HAPPEN HERE

Yet what followed was, in the words of Persily and Stewart, a "tragedy,"
with "lies about vote fraud and the performance of the system
\[cementing\] a perception among tens of millions of Americans that the
election was 'rigged.'" Such "manufactured distrust" has extended past
the January 6 insurrection in Washington. Although President Joe Biden's
inauguration has deescalated imminent threats to civil liberties and the
rule of law, the core element of electoral democracy---free and fair
elections---is now under relentless partisan assault. Republican state
legislatures are accelerating efforts to make it more difficult for
African Americans, Latinos, and other Democratic-leaning constituencies
to vote by passing laws that make it more difficult to vote by mail and
to vote early, and that make it easier to purge voters from voting
rolls. These changes are driven not by documented evidence of
malfeasance associated with these practices but by deliberately false
narratives about election fraud.

Now, the greatest threat to American democracy is posed by legislative
initiatives seeking to subvert the independence of electoral
administration, including the counting and certification of the vote. As
the election law expert Richard Hasen has observed, "At stake is
something I never expected to worry about in the United States: the
integrity of the vote count." A recent law passed in Georgia, for
example, removes the secretary of state (currently Brad Raffensperger,
who refused to manufacture the 11,780 votes Trump needed to win the
state) as chair of the state Election Board and gives the state
legislature---a highly partisan institution---the ability to name the
new chair. Representatives in Michigan have politicized the Board of
State Canvassers, which certifies election results, by replacing a
Republican who voted to certify Biden's election victory with a movement
conservative. In Michigan and in Nevada, Trump loyalists are seeking to
consolidate control over election supervision by running candidates for
secretary of state---giving them the authority to preside over election
administration and the tools to try to block Democratic votes. And at
the federal level, Republicans could take back control of the House of
Representatives (helped by their unilateral ability to redraw 187
congressional districts following the most recent census) and use their
majority to manipulate the 2024 presidential results in their
favor---especially if the 2024 election resembles 2020, when Democrats
won a decisive popular vote victory but relied on narrow margins in a
handful of states for an Electoral College majority.

Once a political system loses bipartisan consensus respecting the rules
of the democratic game, it can be a short slide to autocracy. The world
has watched this happen in Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela. It is not
inconceivable that it could happen in the United States.

THE GATHERING STORM

To warn of the failure of American democracy is not hyperbole or simply
a slogan meant to motivate action. Political scientists may differ on
the minimum conditions for democracy, but they agree on this: a country
cannot be considered a democracy if it does not broadly ensure the
neutral and fair administration of elections. If the outcome of a major
national election in the United States were to be determined by
fraudulent exclusion or the manipulation of votes, the country would
cease to be a democracy, no matter how much freedom of expression might
survive (for a time).

More than 100 prominent democracy scholars recently warned in a
collective statement that Republican assaults on electoral integrity
could bring about the demise of U.S. democracy. They appealed to
Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and to adopt other
measures to "ensure the sanctity and independence of election
administration." But with broad national legislation to ban partisan
gerrymandering and strengthen voting standards unlikely in the near
term, it will also be up to civil society to defend American democracy.

[That defense is made more urgent by the gathering storm of democratic
backsliding around the world]{.underline}. [The United States' outsize
importance as a source of political diffusion, for good or ill, makes it
an example that will influence struggling democracies and embattled
autocracies alike]{.underline}. Both in backsliding democracies such as
the Philippines and Poland and in deepening autocracies such as Turkey
and Venezuela, Trump's mantra of "fake news" emboldened strongman
leaders in their assaults on the media. If the United States winds up
disfiguring its democracy by politicizing electoral administration and
suppressing minority votes, autocrats will gleefully seize upon the
American precedent as justification for their methods of blocking
democratic change. And in declining democracies, politically vulnerable
incumbents will embrace similar methods of violating electoral integrity
in order to hang on to power.

In short, **[[what happens]{.mark} to democracy [in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is likely to determine]{.mark} the fate of [democracy
around the world]{.mark}: whether this third wave of democratic
reversals is turned back or gains horrific new momentum]{.underline}**.

the Democratic Peace: A Nonparametric Sensitivity Analysis,\"
International Organization, Vol 75, Issue 3\]

How [should we resolve this empirical debate regarding the democratic
peace?]{.underline}Footnote9 Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized
experiments, we can never completely rule out the possible existence of
confounding biases that arise from omitted variables. While scholars in
this literature have exclusively relied on parametric regression models,
this approach requires strong assumptions, namely that the model
accurately characterizes the true data-generating process (correct set
of variables, right functional form, valid distributional assumption,
etc.). Given that these assumptions may not be verifiable from observed
data, it is no surprise that various scholars advocate different
regression models with diverging sets of variables, resulting in
contradictory findings. The difficulty of adjudicating between these
alternative modeling approaches has led to the ongoing controversy in
the empirical democratic peace literature.

[We propose an alternative approach based on nonparametric sensitivity
analysis]{.underline} to formally assess the robustness of the empirical
evidence.Footnote10 Specifically, [we quantify the strength of
confounding relationships that could explain away the observed
association between democracy and peace]{.underline}. That is, [we
compute the precise level of **unobserved confounding needed** to render
the observed association between **democracy and conflict
spurious**]{.underline}. The idea is that although not all correlations
imply causation, a very strong correlation suggests it. [Unlike the
parametric regression modeling approach prevalent in the literature, the
proposed nonparametric sensitivity approach directly addresses the
existence of unobserved confounders]{.underline} [without assuming a
particular regression model]{.underline}.Footnote11 Although one can
never know with certainty from observational data whether democracy
causes peace, this [nonparametric sensitivity analysis can formally
assess the robustness of empirical evidence for the democratic
peace]{.underline}.

Our analysis applies the nonparametric sensitivity analysis method
originally developed by Cornfield and colleagues, who were concerned
with the robustness of the positive association between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer in the potential presence of unobserved
confounders.Footnote12 The study of the causal relationship between
smoking and lung cancer closely parallels the dispute on the democratic
peace. In both cases, randomized experiments cannot be conducted for
ethical and logistical reasons, and critics contend that the observed
association suffers from confounding biases. While no definitive
conclusion can be drawn from observational data, Cornfield and
colleagues argue that no existing confounder can explain the strong
association between smoking and cancer and therefore this relationship
is likely to be causal. Their conclusion is worth quoting here:

Cigarette smokers have a ninefold greater risk of developing lung cancer
than nonsmokers, while over-two-pack-a-day smokers have at least a
60-fold greater risk. Any characteristic proposed as a measure of the
postulated cause common to both smoking status and lung-cancer risk must
therefore be at least nine-fold more prevalent among cigarette smokers
than among nonsmokers and at least 60-fold more prevalent among
two-pack-a-day smokers. No such characteristic has yet been produced
despite diligent search.Footnote13

[Our application of nonparametric sensitivity analysis to the democratic
peace yields striking results.]{.underline} Depending on the definition
of democracy, [we find that a confounder must be at least forty-seven
times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in other types of
dyads]{.underline}. Thus, [any potential confounder that could explain
the democratic peace would have to be at least five times as prevalent
as a similar confounder for smoking and lung cancer.]{.underline} In
other words, according to our analysis, [the positive association
between democracy and peace is **much more robust** than that between
smoking and lung cancer]{.underline}.

#### Democratic peace is true

Havard **Hegre et al 19**, Department of Peace and Conflict Research,
Uppsala University. Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol 64, Issue 1,
2020. \"Civil Society and the Democratic Peace\"
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002719850620> //pipk

We theorize that three distinct structures of democratic constraint
explain why [more [democratic dyads do not engage in]{.mark} military
[conflict]{.mark} with each other.]{.underline} We build on earlier
theories that focused on electoral and horizontal accountability. We add
a new dimension---the [social accountability provided by an **[active
civil society]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Using several new
measures]{.underline} from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data set,
[we stringently test these explanations.]{.underline} **[[We
find]{.mark} social accountability [to be the strongest and most
consistent predictor of nonbelligerence]{.mark} in dyads,]{.underline}**
that horizontal accountability is still important, but that the
independent role of electoral accountability has been somewhat
overstated. However, we do find that social and electoral accountability
work strongly together, to make for an even greater effect. **[The
finding [is robust]{.mark} to a range of specifications and [in]{.mark}
[the face of controls for]{.mark} contending [theories that
challenge]{.mark} the democratic peace]{.underline}** (e.g., the
capitalist and territorial peace theories).

The [[democratic peace has proved to]{.mark} be one of the
most]{.underline} influential and **[[durable]{.mark}
findings]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the history of international
relations, if not [political science as a whole]{.underline}. As with
all influential findings, [alternatives have been posed, for example,
the "capitalist peace"]{.underline} (Gartzke 2007; Mousseau 2000, 2009,
2013), the "territorial peace" (Gibler 2012), [or "political
similarity]{.underline}" (Bennett 2006; Raknerud and Hegre 1997; Peceny,
Beer, and Sanchez-Terry 2002; Werner 2000). Beyond such empirical
challenges, [the finding has also been criticized for not providing a
fully convincing causal logic that explains the empirical
finding]{.underline} (Rosato 2003). [This puzzle of what makes
democracies less likely to engage in conflict with other democracies
still remains subject to a lively and inconclusive debate]{.underline}
(Hegre 2014). [Our purpose here is to use [the new]{.mark} Varieties of
Democracy]{.underline} (V-Dem) [[data, with]{.mark} its [ability
to]{.mark} more [precisely disaggregate]{.mark} the components of
democracy, [to reconsider]{.mark} its **[causal logic]{.mark} in a more
precise fashion** and with a fresh perspective]{.underline}.

We advance the debate by arguing that [different forms of constraint on
power holders help to explain why democratic dyads are less likely to
engage in conflict.]{.underline} To date, the greatest attention has
been focused on what we term electoral and horizontal accountability.
Electoral accountability (sometimes referred to as vertical
accountability) functions because elected politicians try to avoid
alienating voters in anticipation of the next round of elections.
Horizontal accountability operates through the ability of other branches
of government and state institutions to check the power of the
executive. We build on previous work that showed that greater electoral
participation (Reiter and Tillman 2002; Clark and Nordstrom 2005; Bueno
de Mesquita et al. 1999) and greater horizontal constraints on the
executive (Reiter and Tillman 2002; Clark and Nordstrom 2005; Choi 2010)
work to reduce conflict. An important part of [our contribution is to
add a new dimension---social accountability]{.underline}. [It is
provided by organized actors in civil society that have the ability to
inflict audience costs on the executive in-between elections and to
mobilize in support of opponents during elections]{.underline}.

[We also highlight a new measurement tool for capturing democracy as an
aggregate and in its component parts in new and potentially fruitful
ways.]{.underline} Whereas [the vast majority of studies have relied on
Polity to capture the degree of democracy among states, we use the V-Dem
data, which have both better concept-measurement consistency and also
allow us, because of the ability to disaggregate components of
democracy, to directly test the different forms of constraint we
discussed above]{.underline}. **[[Our sample includes]{.mark}
observations from [173 countries]{.mark} across the globe [from 1900 to
2010]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [We test]{.underline} [whether]{.underline}
these [three different forms of accountability]{.underline}---(1)
horizontal, (2) electoral, and (3) social---[restrain democracies from
fighting with each other]{.underline}. When pitting the three mechanisms
of accountability directly against each other, we find the weakest
support for the form that has received the greatest attention in the
literature---electoral. However, its effect becomes salient when it is
combined with social accountability between elections. The [[democratic
peace]{.mark} effect]{.underline} thus [[seems]{.underline}]{.mark} less
[[a product of]{.underline}]{.mark} simple electoral constraint than on
[the ability of **[civil society]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as
other state actors, [to constrain the incumbent]{.underline}. To our
knowledge, **[[this is the first time]{.mark} that [anyone has tested
the impact of civil society engagement on conflict]{.mark}
behavior]{.underline}**. In an Online Supplementary File (henceforth
SF),1 we demonstrate that **[[our]{.mark} main [findings are robust in
the face of contending theories and alternate specifications]{.mark} of
our tests]{.underline}**.

The [democratic peace]{.underline}---the idea that democracies rarely
fight one another---[has been called "the closest thing we have to an
empirical law in the study of international relations]{.underline}."
Yet, [some contend]{.underline} that [this relationship is spurious and
suggest alternative explanations]{.underline}. Unfortunately, in the
absence of randomized experiments, we can never rule out the possible
existence of such confounding biases. [Rather than commonly used
regression-based approaches, we apply a **[nonparametric sensitivity
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We [[show]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[overturning the negative association between democracy and conflict
would require a confounder that is forty-seven times more prevalent in
democratic dyads than in other dyads]{.underline}**. [To put this number
in context, **[the relationship between democracy and peace is]{.mark}
at least [five times as robust as]{.mark} that between [smoking
and]{.mark} lung [cancer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [To explain away the
democratic peace]{.underline}, therefore, [scholars would have to find
far more powerful confounders than those already identified in the
literature.]{.underline}

The proposition that democratic states do not fight interstate wars
against each other is one of the most enduring and influential ideas in
international relations. The idea is theoretically rooted in the work of
Immanuel Kant, who argued that interactions between states with a
republican form of government give "a favorable prospect for the desired
consequence, i.e., perpetual peace."1 This has led to a large literature
empirically documenting a negative association between democracy and
conflict,2 leading one scholar to comment that the democratic peace is
"the closest thing we have to an empirical law in the study of
international relations."3

Despite the law-like nature of this association, no scholarly consensus
has emerged on whether the observed association reflects a causal
relationship or a spurious correlation. According to a recent survey,
more than 30 percent of international relations scholars disagree with
the democratic peace theory.4 In particular, skeptics have challenged
the democratic peace by arguing that alliance structures from the Cold
War,5 capitalism,6 and contract-intensive economies7 confound the
observed association. These [authors find that adding certain
confounding variables to regression models eliminates the statistical
significance of the estimated coefficient for the joint democracy
variable]{.underline}.8

[How should we resolve this]{.underline} empirical debate regarding the
democratic peace?9 Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized
experiments, we can never completely rule out the possible existence of
confounding biases that arise from omitted variables. [While
[scholars]{.mark} in this literature [have **exclusively** relied on
parametric regression]{.mark} models, [this]{.mark} approach [requires

robustness of the empirical evidence]{.underline}**.10 [Specifically, we
quantify the strength of confounding relationships that could explain

That is, [we [compute the **precise level** of]{.mark} unobserved
[confounding]{.mark} needed to render the observed association between

[this]{.underline} nonparametric sensitivity analysis [[can formally
assess]{.mark} the [robustness of empirical evidence for]{.mark} the
[democratic peace]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Our analysis applies the nonparametric sensitivity analysis
method]{.underline} originally developed by Cornfield and colleagues,
who were [concerned with the robustness of the positive association
between cigarette smoking and lung cancer in the potential presence of
unobserved confounders]{.underline}.12 [The study of the causal

experiments cannot be conducted]{.underline} for ethical and logistical
reasons, [and critics contend]{.underline} that the observed
[association suffers from confounding biases]{.underline}. While no
definitive conclusion can be drawn from observational data, Cornfield
and colleagues argue that [no existing confounder can explain the strong
association between smoking and cancer and therefore this relationship
is likely to be causal. Their conclusion is worth quoting
here]{.underline}: Cigarette smokers have a ninefold greater risk of
developing lung cancer than nonsmokers, while over-two-pack-a-day
smokers have at least a 60-fold greater risk. Any characteristic
proposed as a measure of the postulated cause common to both smoking
status and lung-cancer risk must therefore be at least nine-fold more
prevalent among cigarette smokers than among nonsmokers and at least
60-fold more prevalent among two-pack-a-day smokers. No such
characteristic has yet been produced despite diligent search.13

Our [application of nonparametric sensitivity analysis [to]{.mark} the
democratic peace yields **[striking results]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Depending on the definition of democracy, we find that a confounder must
be at least forty-seven times more prevalent in democratic dyads than in
other types of dyads. Thus, any potential confounder that could explain
the democratic peace would have to be at least five times as prevalent
as a similar confounder for smoking and lung cancer. In other words,
according to our analysis, **[the positive association between democracy
and peace is much more robust than that between smoking and lung
cancer.]{.underline}**

While no such confounder has yet been found for the relationship between
smoking and lung cancer, [[we examine]{.mark} whether the
[confounders]{.mark} identified in the democratic peace literature meet
the conditions of nonparametric sensitivity analysis.]{.underline} For
example, [we consider]{.underline} a set of [economic
confounders]{.underline} proposed by Gartzke who argues that the
democratic peace can be explained by capitalism.14 We also consider
[other confounders]{.underline}, such as [military
alliances.]{.underline}15 [Overall, our findings imply that for [a
potential confounder]{.mark} to explain away the democratic peace, it
[must be much more strong]{.mark}ly associated with regime types and
conflicts [than]{.mark} the confounders that have been [proposed to
date]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This finding again demonstrates the
robustness of empirical evidence for the democratic peace]{.underline}.

Finally, we believe that a [nonparametric sensitivity
analysis]{.underline}, such as the one we use here, can [play an
important role in international relations research, where the threat of
omitted variable bias is almost always present.]{.underline} Although
sensitivity analysis has been applied in international relations, almost
all such applications have been based on parametric regression models.
In the democratic peace literature, Kadera and Mitchell conduct a
parametric sensitivity analysis in the spirit of Leamer.16 In addition,
Chaudoin, Hays, and Hicks apply a parametric sensitivity analysis of
Altonji, Elder, and Taber to the effects of the GATT/WTO, whereas Hegre
and Sambanis use the method of Sala-i-Martin to examine the sensitivity
of empirical results on civil war onset.17 The only exception we found
is Davis and Shirato, who use a nonparametric sensitivity analysis to
assess the robustness of their findings to possible sample selection
bias.18 [Unlike parametric approaches, nonparametric sensitivity
analyses avoid modeling assumptions and hence offer a **robust method to
examine** the strength of **empirical conclusions**]{.underline}.

Effect of Ukraine war on Africa

Now, in his current role as the president of the African Development
Bank, the continent's largest multilateral lender, Adesina is trying to
avert a food crisis on a larger scale. As the war between Russia and
Ukraine draws into its second month, natural gas, wheat and fertiliser
prices have skyrocketed.

Together [Russia and Ukraine produce more than a quarter of global wheat
exports, and Africa is heavily dependent on both countries]{.underline}.
[Wheat imports make up 90 percent of Africa's \$4bn trade with Russia
and almost half of the continent's \$4.5bn trade with
Ukraine]{.underline}, according to AfDB.

"[One-third of the cereal supply of East Africa comes from those two
countries, and Egypt is badly affecte]{.underline}d. So is Algeria and
Morocco, Somalia and several other countries. So, if we don't manage
this very quickly, it will actually destabilise the continent," Adesina
said.

He said the war would affect Africa's economy in a few major ways.
Already, it has roiled financial markets, causing sky-high interest
rates. "You begin to see what has happened also in terms of the yields
for euro bonds that are posted by African countries. The spreads are
very, very high as a result of this," he said.

But perhaps just as important, commodity prices are on the increase,
including that of wheat which has "gone up by 64 percent globally", the
same price around the 2008 global food crisis, he said.

Fertilisers, a key component of the agribusiness sector, have also been
affected, and the bank chief knows that that could spell disaster.

"The price of urea has gone up by 300 percent. All of that is saying,
that it's \[the war\] driving inflation in Africa, and it could --- if
not quickly well-managed --- trigger a food crisis in Africa," Adesina
said.

But perhaps just as important, commodity prices are on the increase,

same price around the 2008 global food crisis, he said.

Fertilisers, a key component of the agribusiness sector, have also been
affected, and the bank chief knows that that could spell disaster.

"[The price of urea has gone up by 300 percent]{.underline}. All of that

Some [7,000 members of]{.underline} the Islamic State West Africa
Province (ISWAP) and [Boko Haram have surrendered in northeast

On Wednesday, the News Agency of Nigeria quoted Major General
Christopher Musa, a top commander in the region, as saying that an
onslaught targeting ISWAP and Boko Haram fighters has continued to
record significant success.

Musa said at least 7,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP members surrendered in the
last week during the operations.

"This is evident as thousands of the insurgents comprising combatants,
non-combatants, foot soldiers, alongside their families, continued to
lay down their arms in different parts of Borno to accept peace," he
said.

[The surrendering fighters and their families are expected to be
profiled by the Nigerian army]{.underline} and other stakeholders before
they undergo rehabilitation processes, the general added.

### 2AC\-\--Warming 

#### They are reading propaganda and utterly wrong about authoritarianism.

\"Authoritarianism Can't Beat Climate Change,\"
https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/authoritarianism-cant-beat-climate-change/\]

In some commentaries[, authoritarianism]{.underline} and one-party rule,
particularly China's model of governance, [is often portrayed as a magic
bullet]{.underline} solution [to]{.underline} the ostensible impending
doom of [climate change]{.underline}. In lieu of impotent governance,
electoral cycles, short term policies, and hot-air promises of economic
and environmental solutions, top-down authoritarian governance is touted
as possessing the ability to implement the prudent and long-term policy
capable of mitigating the worst effects of climate change.

[This type of rhetoric is especially salient in authoritarian
state-owned media]{.underline} around the world. Liberal
[democracies]{.underline} and the West, in particular, [are portrayed
as]{.underline} decadent, inefficient, [dysfunctional]{.underline}, and
archaic. Western governance models are seen as unable to meet the needs
of the 21st century; they [are ill-equipped to meet the social and
economic needs of a growing population while mitigating the worst
effects of climate change]{.underline}. Chinese state news agency Xinhua
recently wrote of the United States' "four deficits in climate action,"
detailing the way in which inconsistency and "flip-flopping" has been
the hallmark of U.S. climate policy. This view was further reaffirmed
with the dramatic reversal of the Biden administration in re-joining the
2015 Paris Agreement after Donald Trump's tumultuous exit in 2016. How
are we to rely on capricious democracies when dealing with such a
time-sensitive issue? Instead, China's leadership is supposed to offer a
decisive system of governance that is committed to "harmony between man
and nature" and "green development."

Indeed, these ideals are now enshrined in China's Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). As Xi Jinping stated at the Leaders Climate Summit:
"China has made ecological cooperation a key part of Belt and Road
cooperation." [However, authoritarian state planning and top-down
policies such as the BRI are not as omnipotent as often perceived. There
is ample evidence to suggest the BRI is a fragmented,]{.underline}
poorly planned, [and ill-received initiative]{.underline}. In fact, [the
policy suffers from what some scholars have termed "fragmented
authoritarianism."]{.underline} BRI planning documents lack definition,
are extremely "loose," and BRI implementation is incredibly
uncoordinated, with competing state agencies interpreting the vague
rhetoric of the BRI for their own interests, often undermining the
Party's diplomatic objectives. Thus, if the BRI is to be understood as
the ne plus ultra of authoritarian governments' technocratic capability
to implement policy decisively and successfully, it is not a very
convincing one.

[Overzealous enthusiasm for authoritarianism's ostensible capacity to
mitigate]{.underline} anthropogenic [climate change]{.underline} also
[overlooks the importance of bottom-up and grassroots campaigns in
stimulating public discussion and achieving climate justice and
protection]{.underline}. Indeed, without the cumulative
checks-and-balances of investigative journalism, activists, public
figures, and NGOs, authoritarian governments do not face the same
pressures or incentives familiar to democratic governments.

**[Civil society]{.underline}** [provides the impetus for climate
policy]{.underline}. For example, the landmark 2013 Urgenda Foundation
v. State of the Netherlands case was a legal battle between a climate
activist group and their respective government. The activists
successfully sued the Dutch state on the grounds of violating the
European Convention on Human Rights for failing to implement policy that
would ensure sufficient reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Their
success galvanized global civil society, and similar cases were heard in
countries such as New Zealand, Ireland, Norway, Belgium, the United
Kingdom, Germany, France, and Switzerland.

[Advocates of the authoritarian model also overlook the agency that
various sub-state and non-state actors possess in the mitigation of
climate change.]{.underline} As perturbing as Trump's exit from the 2015
Paris Agreement was, [we also witnessed the collective agency of
relatively autonomous cities in reaffirming their
commitments]{.underline} to the Paris Agreement. [Mayors from Los
Angeles to New York City were animated in their objective of realizing
the goals of the Paris Agreement,]{.underline} no matter what choices
Washington made.

[Without freedom of expression or freedom of the press, an active civil
society cannot flourish]{.underline}, [and meaningful debate regarding
climate change remains stagnant]{.underline} and controlled by
censorship. That was the case with the Chinese schoolgirl who was
inspired by the global "Fridays for Future" campaign: Ou Hongyi's
protests were swiftly suppressed when told she could not return to
school unless she "ditched" her climate activism.

If indeed there does exist a pathway out of global climate governance
gridlock, [the answer does not lie at the feet of authoritarian
monoliths. Regardless of the inertia of authoritarian policy and the
lack of civil society, an unwavering confidence in
authoritarianism]{.underline} also [overlooks how integral greenhouse
gas-intensive industry is to performance legitimacy.]{.underline}
**[Without electoral legitimacy]{.underline}**, [a sudden and decisive
break away from this model of economic growth could jeopardize the
credibility of one-party rule]{.underline}. This is a prospect most
authoritarian leaders would wish to avoid.

Instead, we must look elsewhere for solutions. Most importantly, in
addition to effective [policy, the encouragement of transparent policy
decisions, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are all
absolutely fundamental to mitigating the worst effects of climate
change.]{.underline}

Where democracy remains trapped in its neoliberalized form---"more

[Embracing authoritarianism]{.underline}, however[, does not yield a
different result]{.underline} for reasons that Passmore, Paehlke,
Dryzek, and Stehr have explained. [The only options left]{.underline},
therefore, [are to sort out how democracy became
neoliberalized]{.underline}, the mechanisms through which it took place,
and to devise ways to bypass neoliberal controls in practicing democracy
so that effective climate mitigation becomes possible and survival
becomes attainable, even for the non-rich and non-powerful. The next
chapter traces the neoliberalization of democracy to the Keynes-Hayek
"debate," demonstrating that the decadence of democracy was the intended
consequence of a painstakingly designed economic-political order rather
than the mere sum of mindlessness and sloppiness scattered here and
there.

#### Voting negative is a vote for Putinism.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putin-kremlin-imperialism-ukraine-american-power/624180/\]

If there was any doubt before, the answer is now clear. Vladimir [[Putin
is showing that a world without American
power]{.underline}]{.mark}---or, for that matter, Western power---[[is
not]{.mark} a [better]{.mark} world]{.underline}.

[[For the generation of Americans]{.mark} who came of age in the shadow
of the September 11]{.underline} attacks, [the world America had made
came with a question mark.]{.underline} [Their formative experiences
were the ones in which American power had been used for
ill]{.underline}, in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the Middle East more
broadly, and for much longer, the United States had built a security
architecture around some of the world's most repressive regimes. [For
those on the left]{.underline}, this was nothing new, [and it was all
too obvious]{.underline}. I spent my college years reading Noam Chomsky
and other leftist critics of U.S. foreign policy, and they weren't
entirely wrong. On balance, the U.S. may have been a force for good, but
in particular regions and at particular times, it had been anything but.

[[Blaming America]{.mark} first [became all too
easy]{.mark}]{.underline}. After September 11, [U.S. power was as
overwhelming as it was uncontested. That it was squandered on two
endless wars]{.underline} made it convenient to focus on America's sins,
while underplaying Russia's and China's growing ambitions.

For his part, Putin understood well that the balance of power was
shifting. Knowing what he knew, the Russian president wasn't necessarily
"irrational" in deciding to invade Ukraine. He had good reason to think
that he could get away with it. After all, he had gotten away with quite
a lot for nearly 15 years, ever since the Russian war against Georgia in
2008, when George W. Bush was still president. Then he annexed Crimea in
2014 and intervened brutally in Syria in 2015. Each time, in an
understandable desire to avoid an escalatory spiral with Russia, the
United States held back and tried not to do anything that might provoke
Putin. Meanwhile, Europe became more and more dependent on Russian
energy; Germany, for example, was importing 55 percent of its natural
gas from Russia. Just three weeks ago, it was possible for Der Spiegel
to declare that most Germans thought "peace with Russia is the only
thing that matters."

[The narrative of a feckless and divided West solidified for
years]{.underline}. We, as Americans, were feeling unsure of ourselves,
so it was only reasonable that Putin would feel it too. In such a
context, and [after four years of Donald Trump and the domestic turmoil
that he wrought, it was tempting to valorize "restraint" and limited
engagements abroad]{.underline}. [Worried about imperial
overreach,]{.underline} most of [the American left opposed direct U.S.
military action against]{.underline} Bashar al-[Assad']{.underline}s
regime in the early 2010s, even though it was Russian and Iranian
intervention on behalf of Syria's dictator that bore the marks of a real
imperial enterprise, not just an imagined one.

[Russia's unprovoked attack on a sovereign nation]{.underline}, in
Europe no less, has [put matters back in their proper
framing]{.underline}. The question of whether the United States is a
uniquely malevolent force in global politics has been resolved. In the
span of a few days, [skeptics of American power have gotten a taste of
what a world where America grows weak and Russia grows strong looks
like]{.underline}. Of course, [there are still holdouts who insist on
seeing the United States as the provocateur.]{.underline} In its only
public statement on Ukraine, the Democratic Socialists of America
condemned Russia's invasion but also called for "the U.S. to withdraw
from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set the stage for
this conflict." This is an odd statement considering that
[[Russia,]{.mark} rather than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [[has been the world's most unabashedly
imperialist force for the past three decades]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
[many on [the anti-imperialist left aren't really anti-imperialist; they
just have an]{.mark} instinctive [aversion to America]{.mark}n
power.]{.underline}

America's low opinion of its own capacity for good---and the resulting
desire to retreat or disengage---hasn't just been a preoccupation of the
far left. The crisis of confidence has been pervasive, spreading to the
halls of power and even President Barack Obama, whose memorable mantra
was "Don't do stupid shit." Instead of thinking about what we could do,
or what we could do better, Obama was more interested in a self-limiting
principle. For their part, European powers---content to bask under their
U.S. security umbrella---could afford to believe in fantasies of
perpetual peace. Europe's gentleness and lethargy---coaxing Germany to
commit even 2 percent of its GDP to defense seemed impossible---became
something of a joke. One popular Twitter account, \@ISEUConcerned,
devoted itself to mocking the European Union's propensity to express
"concern," but do little else, whenever something bad happened.

Suddenly, [the EU has been aroused from its slumber,]{.underline} and
the parody account was rendered temporarily speechless. [This is no
longer tepid concern, but righteous fury. Member states announced that
they would send anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. Germany]{.underline}, for
the first time, [said that it would ramp up its military
budget]{.underline} to 100 billion euros. On the economic front, the EU
announced some of the toughest sanctions in history. My podcast co-host,
Damir Marusic, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, likened it to a "holy
war," European-style.

Sometimes, unusual and extreme events mark the separation between old
and new ways of thinking and being. This week, the Berlin-based
journalist Elizabeth Zerofsky remarked that [the current moment reminded
her of the memoir The World of Yesterday]{.underline}, written by the
Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig as World War II loomed. In it, he
[recalls the twilight of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with an almost
naive fondness]{.underline}. On the first day of the Ukraine invasion, I
happened to be speaking to a group of college students who had no memory
of September 11. I told them that they may be living in history. Those
students, like all of us, are bearing witness to one of those rare
events that recast how individuals and nations alike view the world they
inhabit.

The coming weeks, months, and years are likely to be as fascinating as
they are terrifying. In a sense, [we knew that a great confrontation was
coming, even if we hadn't quite envisioned its precise
contours]{.underline}. At the start of his presidency, Joe Biden
declared that the battle between democracies and autocracies would be
the defining struggle of our time. This was grandiose rhetoric, but was
it more than that? What does it actually mean to fight such a battle?

In any number of ways, [[Russia's aggression has underscored]{.mark} why
Biden was right and [why authoritarians]{.mark}]{.underline}---[and the
authoritarian idea itself---[are such a threat to peace]{.mark} and
stability]{.underline}. [Russia invaded Ukraine, a democracy, because of
the recklessness and domination of one man]{.underline}, Vladimir Putin.
[[The countries that have rallied most enthusiastically behind Ukraine
have]{.mark} almost [uniformly been democracies]{.mark}, chief among
them the United States**. [America is lousy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
disappointing, [[and]{.mark} maddeningly
h[ypocritical]{.mark}]{.underline} in its conduct abroad, [[but the
notion of any moral equivalence between the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} Putin's [Russia has **been rendered
laughable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[if there is such a thing as a
better world, then anti-imperialists may find themselves in the odd
position of hoping]{.mark} and praying [for the health]{.mark} and
longevity [of]{.mark} not just the West but of [Western
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No statistical relationship between democracy and the environment. 

**Midlarsky 2018 -** Rutgers University Moses and Annuta Back Professor

Manus, \"Democracy and the Environment\" in Environmental Conflict, p.
175

The first and most obvious conclusion is that [th[ere is no uniform
relationship between democracy and the
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Three of our indicators,
deforestation, C02 emissions, and soil erosion by water, demonstrated
significant negative relationships between democracy and environmental
preservation. [[Protected land area showed a positive
relationship,]{.mark} and [freshwater]{.mark} availability [and soil
erosion]{.mark} by chemicals [demonstrated no significant
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of even greater interest, perhaps, is
the fact that these relationships ran counter to expectation (Gleditsch
and Sverdrup, 1996; Payne, 1995a). Instead of positive relationships
between the extent of democracy and environmental protection, as much
popular and recent scholarly writings have suggested, the associations
found here are principally negative or nonexistent. This should give
pause to political leaders such as President Clinton and Vice President
Gore who have trumpeted the virtues of democracy in protecting the
environment.

politics,\" The Lanet, VOLUME 5, ISSUE 3, E135-E136, MARCH 01, 2020\]

For Amartya Sen, [authoritarian states face serious challenges in
information and accountability]{.underline}.6 [Governments in closed
political systems, without open media and opposition parties, struggle
to receive accurate information]{.underline} in a timely manner and to
convey urgent information to the public. [Governments can be the victims
of their own propaganda, because]{.underline} the country\'s political
institutions provide incentives to local [officials]{.underline} to
[avoid sharing bad news]{.underline} with their central bosses and await
instructions before acting.

[Information politics in China undermined a rapid response
to]{.underline} the [2019-nCoV]{.underline} outbreak. Health-care
workers suspected an outbreak in early December, 2019,7 but [information
with which the public might have taken preventive measures was
suppressed, and communication channels that might have alerted senior
officials to the growing threat were shut down]{.underline}.8 Police
detained a clinician and seven other people posting reports on
2019-nCoV, threatening punishment for spreading so-called rumors.
[Social media was censored;]{.underline} a preliminary analysis of Weibo
and WeChat published on China\'s biggest online platform9 showed
outbreak discussions were nearly non-existent through much of January,
2020, until the Chinese Government changed its official stance on Jan
20, 2020.

Through much of January, 2020, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission
reported no evidence of human-to-human transmission, no infection among
health workers, that severe cases of disease caused by 2019-nCoV
infection were confined to those with underlying conditions and older
people, and that the Huanan seafood market was the source.11 Reports in
The Lancet7 and New England Journal of Medicine,12 however, show that
half of patients admitted to intensive-care units were aged 25--49
years, and two-thirds had no underlying illnesses. Human-to-human
transmission and health-worker infection were evident before the Chinese
Government made an announcement.12 This information either did not make
it to authorities or the public were misinformed. The Mayor of Wuhan has
said publicly that not only was information not revealed in a timely
manner but also they did not use information effectively.10 [By the time
quarantine went into effect on Jan 23, 2020, five million people had
left the city of Wuhan for holiday travel.10 Outbreaks were subsequently
reported throughout China.]{.underline}

[Without open media and an opposition to check on bureaucratic
hierarchy, knowledge from the front lines of the 2019]{.underline}-nCoV
[outbreak did not reach Beijing]{.underline}. Weeks into the outbreak[,
leaders were forced to publicly threaten that officials withholding
information]{.underline} "will be nailed on the pillar of shame for
eternity".4

Is there an authoritarian advantage in disease response? It seems that
[authoritarian information politics inhibited a rapid response to
the]{.underline} 2019-nCoV [outbreak in China, which could have limited
the crisis.]{.underline} [It is not yet clear if the extraordinary
cordons]{.underline} and influx of resources enabled [by autocratic rule
will prove a successful public health strategy.]{.underline} Yet, in
building capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks,
democratic openness and competitive politics seem more asset than
inadequacy.

NEW YORK -- U.S. President Joe [Biden's recent Summit for Democracy was
an important global event, but it slipped by almost
unnoticed]{.underline}.

[With democratic norms fraying]{.underline} from Southeast Asia to
Central Europe, [Biden was right to warn of "the sustained and alarming
**[challenges to democracy]{.mark}** and universal human
rights."]{.underline} But too few acknowledge that **[rising
authoritarianism around the world, like climate change and the evolution
of lethal viruses, can [pose an existential risk to
humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Most people do not appreciate the extent to which [[civilizations depend
on]{.mark} pillars of [norms]{.mark} and conventions. [Some]{.mark} of
these have [evolve]{.mark}d [organically]{.mark} over time, [while
others required deliberation and collective action. If one]{.mark} of
the [pillar]{.mark}s [buckles]{.mark}, a [civilization could]{.mark}
well [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Efforts to counter the current threats to democracy should start with
the fact that every economy is embedded in culture and institutions. As
Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson have argued, long-run
growth may depend more on institutions than on anything else. But
[[institutions are not]{.mark} always [exogenous]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As the growing field of cultural evolution shows, [human beings are
[adaptive learners]{.mark} who [rely]{.mark}, often unwittingly, [on
social learning to entrench norms]{.mark} that are [necessary
for]{.mark} a [society]{.mark} to flourish]{.underline}.

Likewise, Avinash Dixit and Simon Levin argue that, in some contexts,
**[we]{.underline}** may **[need to take [deliberate steps to instill
pro-social preferences]{.mark} that can [help us adapt to our changing
world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[We can do this
[through]{.mark}]{.underline}** education, and by **[[deliberating and
deciding as citizens to promote certain kinds of collective
behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That is what happened when delegates
from American states convened in Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the
existing Articles of Confederation and ended up drafting the U.S.
Constitution, which became the cornerstone of the new country's
long-term growth and prosperity.

[[We are in a]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly [[challenging
situation]{.mark} today, [as]{.mark} cross-border [flows]{.mark} of
goods, services, and capital [flatten the world economically]{.mark}.
The rapid advance of digital technology, accelerated over the last two
years by the COVID-19 pandemic, is [causing huge strains]{.mark}.
Increased [outsourcing]{.mark} of [production]{.mark} has [contributed
to hypernationalism]{.mark}, which in turn is [fueling]{.mark} the rise
of anti[-democratic leaders]{.mark} who exploit people's
desperation]{.underline}.

These changes have come so swiftly that **[[deliberate collective action
is needed to defend democracy. We do not have the luxury of
waiting]{.mark} for our norms and institutions to evolve.]{.underline}**

#### Democracy solves climate change

//pipk

The world seems to be following a pattern in which [the more we learn
about the rate and effects of climate change, the more there is to worry
about]{.underline}. [With every new scientific assessment, it appears
that sea levels are rising more than anticipated, more species are being
lost, glaciers are melting at surprising rates, droughts and floods are
more severe, and extreme weather is on the rise]{.underline}. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that limiting
average global temperatures to 1.5°C, as governments agreed to aim for
in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, "would require rapid, far-reaching
and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" (IPCC 2018). The
[expert consensus]{.underline} in these reports [is]{.underline} that
[emissions must fall dramatically by 2030 and the world should achieve a
version of carbon neutrality by 2050]{.underline}.

[**[The existential magnitude]{.mark}** of the effects [of]{.mark} a
changing [climate]{.mark} and modest progress in dealing with the
causes]{.underline} (largely related to energy, transportation,
agriculture, and forestry) so far [leads critics to call for dramatic
changes in governance]{.underline}. James Lovelock, prominent scientist
and founder of the Gaia theory, [[argues]{.underline}]{.mark}, "Even the
best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must
be put on hold [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the time being. I have a
feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may
be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while" (Hickman 2010). Other
critics go even further, arguing that "humanity will have to trade its
liberty to live as it wishes in favor of a system where survival is
paramount" (Shearman and Smith 2007). Even restrained critics have
concluded "it is not entirely clear that democracy is up to the
challenge of climate change" (Jamieson 2014, 100).

Is democracy a barrier to acting on the causes and eventually the
consequences of climate change? Is it time to toss the practical and
normative benefits of democratic institutions, rights, and processes to
meet an existential challenge? Is there any merit to the case against
democracy? These are the issues I consider in my recent book, [Can
[Democracy]{.mark} Handle Climate Change]{.underline} (Polity 2018).

The Cases for and against Democracy

The case made by critics of democracy goes something like this:
Democracies exist to serve the needs and preferences of their citizens.
They are built on notions of individual freedom and private property
rights. Voters lack the needed scientific literacy to be able to
understand the causes and consequences of climate change, and they are
too focused on enjoying and expanding their affluence. Handling climate
change calls for drastic action, perhaps a suspension of individual
rights, hard controls on population and economic growth, and more modest
lifestyles.

Given these flaws, [critics argue that what is needed is top-down,
centralized, and authoritarian governance by scientific]{.underline} (or
at least scientifically enlightened) [elites]{.underline}. With the
appropriate concentrations of authority and ability to set aside
constraints like private property rights and economic freedoms,
enlightened autocrats can make hard choices and overcome vested
interests. Only more authoritarian systems can take long view and force
needed changes in societies and economics, a view that goes back to the
early days of the modern environmental movement (e.g. Ophuls 1977).

**[There are many problems with this conception. The first is that
[no]{.mark} such benign [ecological autocracy has ever
existed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although many critics hold out hope that
an authoritarian China will lead the way, there are many reasons to
doubt that scenario. Another is that the [[research does not
support]{.mark} the view that [democracies are less suited]{.mark} to
handling climate change than authoritarian regimes.]{.underline}
Although democracies appear to be better at devising policies than
actually carrying them out, [there is no evidence that they are
inherently less capable of handling climate change than their
authoritarian counterparts]{.underline}. Indeed, **[[the reverse
is]{.mark} more [likely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It also is hard to
imagine how these enlightened ecological autocrats will establish
legitimacy and be able to make and carry out the tough decisions that
have to be made. Why should we assume that political systems that cannot
agree on a carbon tax will magically transform themselves into
climate-action-above-all regimes?]{.underline}

Finally, [the emergence of authoritarian populism in]{.underline}
countries like Hungary, Poland, Venezuela, and even [the **U**nited
**S**tates do not bode well for a climate action agenda]{.underline}

Comparing Democratic and Authoritarian Systems

[Climate change is a complex challenge, the largest collective action
problem in history, and a classic illustration of the concept of a
wicked problem]{.underline}. It is distinctive in many ways: unlike most
forms of air or water pollution, the [effects are not immediately
obvious]{.underline}; [harms occur mostly in the future, with a
perceived temporal mismatch of costs and benefits]{.underline}.
[Scientific uncertainty allows opponents of action at least to raise
doubt. Further, acting on the causes of the problem require basic
changes in economic and social systems, not just incremental
fine-tuning]{.underline}.

There is good reason to believe, however, that [[democracies]{.mark}
overall [are more suited to handling climate]{.mark} change than their
authoritarian counterparts]{.underline}. Among [[the reasons]{.mark}
studied in the literature]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} the
relatively [[free flows of information]{.mark} on problems and solutions
in democracies]{.underline}; their [[administrative]{.mark}
[capacities]{.mark} and lower]{.underline} levels of
[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}; their more [active
[engagement]{.mark} in global problem-solving]{.underline}; [multiple
points of [access in policy making]{.mark}]{.underline} (pluralism);
[superior [scientific]{.mark} and technical [capacity; and
dynamic]{.mark}, innovative [economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Overall
better governance capacities, such as less corruption, are part of their
advantage]{.underline} (Dasgupta and De Cian 2018; Povitkina 2018).

The [[research]{.mark} on the climate capacities of
democracies]{.underline} (almost all on mitigation) [[strongly suggests
they are]{.underline}]{.mark} no less and probably [[more
capable]{.mark} then authoritarian regimes]{.underline} (Fiorino 2018a).
A 2013 study of national policies found that a history of and experience
with democracy mattered; [countries with "]{.underline}accumulated stock
of [[civic and social assets built by]{.mark} experience with
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}" generally [[have better climate]{.mark}
mitigation laws and [policies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fredriksson and
Neumayer 2013, 11). In another study of climate policy, authoritarian
regimes did not perform better than established democracies: "countries
representing the capitalistic autocratic model like Russia, China, and
in some measure Singapore lag far behind the democracies" (Kneuer 2012,
871).

#### Trump doesn't disprove\-\--US democracy still allowed a role for the states, improving solves federal action

Policy at American University in Washington DC. Former Associate

for the Future: Why Democracy Can Handle Climate Change\" June 24.
<https://www.e-ir.info/2019/06/24/improving-democracy-for-the-future-why-democracy-can-handle-climate-change/>

[Democracy [critics]{.mark} often [point to]{.mark} recent experience in
the United States, where the [Trump]{.mark} administration has reversed
nearly every climate initiative of the Obama administration and
announced its intent to withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement. Here is
a long-standing, highly consolidated democracy moving, at least
nationally, in an entirely wrong direction]{.underline}. To be sure,
these policy reversals do not bode well for democratic arguments about
climate change. [[Yet]{.mark} the United States]{.underline} also
illustrates the [strengths of [democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}:
pluralism, innovation, open flows of information, and political
accountability. In particular, federalism [[enable]{.mark}s
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}---California, New York, Washington, and
Hawaii, among them---[[to act as innovative]{.mark} clean energy and
[climate leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} (Roberts 2019).

Why the Democracy Issue Matters

Lovelock has said that surviving climate change "may require, as in a
war, the suspension of democratic government for the duration of the
survival emergency" (2009, 95). The problem is that this will be a
perpetual war. **[[Climate]{.mark} change [is not something one just
solves.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Mitigating its causes and adapting to
its effects is a constant struggle]{.underline}. [And democracy is not
something we can put on the shelf and revive when a crisis
passes]{.underline}, if it does. Politics does not work in that way.
[The heart of sustainability is that the current generation should not
close off options for future generations]{.underline}. [A manageable
climate is only part of what is left to future generations. Also handed
down are systems of governance and such values as dignity, equity, and
rights]{.underline} (Beckman 2008).

In practical terms, calls for a transition to an ecological
authoritarianism imply three goals. One is to convert existing
democracies into something very different for the duration of the
climate emergency. The second is to abandon support for emerging
democracies. The third is to anoint existing authoritarians as climate
leaders and expand their influence in global action. The first is a
high-risk strategy that sacrifices the practical and normative benefits
of democracy for unknown and unpredictable alternatives. The second will
undermine democratic transitions in countries whose political
development will better equip them for effective action. The third
legitimizes the very regimes whose commitment to climate mitigation is
highly uncertain. All of these involve risks not only to the climate but
to global stability and sustainable development.

[Of course, we can hope that authoritarian as well as democratic
political systems make the transition to zero-carbon, climate-friendly
economies and societies. Indeed, it is essential; authoritarian and
hybrid systems in the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index
account for about one-half of global greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (Fiorino 2018a, 22). But to argue they are
inherently superior or we should transform political systems to pursue
an idealized ecological autocracy is dangerous, not only for the climate
but for human well-being more generally.

[[The path lies not in suspending democracy but **improving
it**]{.mark}:]{.underline} [create better democracies [with]{.mark} the
[capacity for collective action]{.mark} and a commitment to ecological
values. [The most effective strategy lies in fostering]{.mark} the
[political, social, and economic conditions in which democracies will
flourish]{.mark}, not only [for the sake of the planet]{.mark} but for
the dignity and welfare of future generations]{.underline}.

[[Preventing]{.mark} the risk of societies coming under the control of a
single group/leader, who hold exclusive political power]{.underline}. At
its extreme, this [could include totalitarianism. Taking preventative
measures to stop [democratic backsliding may help]{.mark} to prevent
authoritarianism]{.underline}.

What are some ways [authoritarianism might affect]{.underline} the
long-term future?

[[Existential risk reduction]{.underline}]{.mark}: [Malevolent
actors]{.underline} (Althaus and Baumann, 2020) [who become
[authoritarian leaders]{.mark} may potentially inflict astronomical
levels of suffering, perhaps [lock]{.mark}ing [humanity into]{.mark} an
undesired or enforced [dystopia]{.mark}, and potentially
[leading]{.mark} humanity in**[to a fate worse than]{.mark}** mere
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An alternative existential risk
may be that [[authoritarian leaders are less competent at]{.mark}
dealing with [other x-risks, such]{.mark} as the development of new
[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. [Thus [authoritarianism]{.mark} may
increase existential risk indirectly]{.underline}. A further worry is
that [humanity may never achieve its full potential]{.underline} -
**[for instance, a stable authoritarian leader [could prevent space
colonization]{.mark} from occurring]{.underline}**, leaving vast amounts
of the galaxy without value. [This would]{.underline} also [constitute
**an existential risk**]{.underline} via a failed continuation.

Trajectory change: A less extreme worry may be that authoritarian
leaders fail to address certain sources of disvalue, even if humanity
still enjoys a flourishing future. For example, they may not prevent
wild animal suffering on Earth even if most of the universe is filled
with value.

What are some ways democracy might affect authoritarianism?

Competitive democracy: [Efforts to improve [competitive democracy make
it easier to remove leaders from power]{.mark} in elections, which can
reduce the risk of authoritarianism arising.]{.underline}

Responsiveness & accuracy: The extent to which increasing these features
makes authoritarianism more or less likely depends on the preferences of
voters. For example, if voters tend to prefer non-authoritarian leaders,
then increasing how well the political system responds and reflects
voters' preferences makes authoritarianism less likely. Conversely, if
voters prefer more authoritarian leaders, then adjusting the political
system to accommodate for this makes higher responsiveness/accuracy more
likely to bring about authoritarianism. It seems likely that, on
average, most [democratic citizens]{.underline} would [prefer less
rather than more authoritarianism in their political system]{.underline}
(however, this is very context-dependent).

Participation: [Countries with high levels of participation seem more
likely and better able to challenge an authoritarian leader, compared to
where apathy is high or participation is curtailed]{.underline}.
Additionally, because authoritarian regimes may try to limit
participation, means of keeping participation high once an authoritarian
first gains power could be an especially important way to prevent
authoritarianism from being locked in.

Liberalism: Authoritarianism and liberalism are almost polar opposites
-- societies high in liberalism are far less likely to see an
authoritarian rise to power. For example, because liberalism safeguards
pluralism, multiple value systems and beliefs are allowed to co-exist,
whereas authoritarian regimes tend to exclude values that deviate from
orthodoxy.

Voter competence: [Democracies with low levels of well-informed voters
may be more susceptible to polarisation and populism, which can in turn
be a driver of electing authoritarian leaders. Thus, **[efforts to
increase voter competence may reduce]{.mark} the likelihood of
[authoritarianism]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Cause Growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" //pipk

We provide evidence that [democracy has a positive effect on GDP per
capita]{.underline}. **[[Our dynamic panel strategy controls for]{.mark}
country fixed [effects and]{.mark} the rich dynamics of GDP, [which
otherwise confound]{.mark} the effect of democracy]{.underline}**. [[To
reduce]{.mark} measurement [error, we introduce a new indicator]{.mark}
of democracy that consolidates previous measures]{.underline}. Our
baseline [results show that [democratizations increase GDP]{.mark} per
capita [by]{.mark} about **[20 percent]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
long run. [We find similar effects using a propensity score reweighting
strategy as well as an instrumental-variables strategy using regional
waves of democratization]{.underline}. [The effects are similar across
different levels of development and appear to be driven by greater
investments in capital, schooling, and health.]{.underline}

I. Introduction [With the spectacular economic growth under nondemocracy
in China, the eclipse of the Arab Spring, and the recent rise of
populist politics in Europe and the United States, the view that
democratic institutions are at best irrelevant and at worst a hindrance
for economic growth has become increasingly popular in both academia and
policy discourse.]{.underline} For example, the prominent New York Times
columnist Tom Friedman (2009) argues that "one-party nondemocracy
certainly has its drawbacks. But when it is led by a reasonably
enlightened group of people, as China is today, it can also have great
advantages. That one party can just impose the politically difficult but
critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the
21st century." Robert Barro (1997, 1) states this view even more boldly:
"More political rights do not have an effect on growth."

Although some recent contributions estimate a positive effect of
democracy on growth, [the pessimistic view of the economic implications
of democracy is still widely shared]{.underline}. From their review of
the academic literature until the mid-2000s, Gerring et al. (2005, 323)
conclude that "the net effect of democracy on growth performance
cross-nationally over the last five decades is negative or null."

In this paper, **[we challenge this view]{.underline}**. [[Using a
panel]{.mark} of countries [from]{.mark} 1960 to 2010, we estimate the
impact on economic growth of the unprecedented spread of democracy
around the world that took place in [the past 50
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} The evidence [[suggests]{.mark} that
democracy does cause growth and that [its effect is]{.mark} significant
and [sizable]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 Our estimates imply that a [country
that transitions from nondemocracy to democracy achieves about 20
percent higher GDP per capita]{.underline} in the next 25 years than a
country that remains a nondemocracy. [The effect of democracy does not
depend on the initial level of economic development]{.underline},
although we find some evidence that democracy is more conducive to
growth in countries with greater levels of secondary education.

[The [estimation of the causal effect]{.mark} of democracy]{.underline}
(or a democratization) [on GDP [faces]{.mark} several
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [existing democracy [indices
are subject]{.mark} [to]{.mark} considerable measurement [error]{.mark},
leading to spurious changes in democracy scores that do not correspond
to real changes in democratic institutions.]{.underline}

Second, [democracies differ from nondemocracies in [unobserved
characteristics]{.mark}, such as institutional, historical, and cultural
aspects, that also have an impact on their GDP.]{.underline} As a
result, [cross-country regressions]{.underline}, as those in Barro
(1996, 1999), [could be biased and are unlikely to reveal the causal
effect of democracy on growth. Recent studies tackle this problem by
using difference-in-differences or panel data estimates with country
fixed effects.]{.underline}

[Third]{.underline}, as shown in figure 1, as well as in Acemoglu et al.
(2005) and Brückner and Ciccone (2011), [[democratizations are]{.mark},
on average, [preceded by a temporary dip in GDP]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[This figure depicts GDP dynamics in countries that democratized at year
0 relative to other countries that remained nondemocratic at the
time]{.underline}. The pattern in this figure implies that [failure to
properly model GDP dynamics, or the propensity to democratize based on
past GDP, will lead to biased estimates of democracy on
GDP]{.underline}. [Though largely overlooked in previous work, the dip
in GDP that precedes a democratization constitutes a clear violation of
the paralleltrends assumption that underlies the
difference-in-differences or panel data estimates used in the
literature. Modeling GDP dynamics would also enable an investigation of
whether the impact of democratization on GDP is short-lived or
gradual.]{.underline}

Last but not least, [even if we control for country fixed effects and
GDP dynamics, [changes in democracy could be driven by]{.mark}
time-varying [unobservables]{.mark}]{.underline} [[related to future
economic conditions]{.mark}, potentially leading to biased
estimates]{.underline}.

In this paper, **[[we address these challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[We]{.underline} build on the important work by Papaioannou and
Siourounis (2008) to [develop a dichotomous measure of democracy, which
combines several indices to purge spurious changes in each]{.underline}.
[We]{.underline} rely on this measure for most of our analysis but [also
document the robustness of our results to other measures of democracy in
the online appendix]{.underline}.

There is no perfect strategy for tackling the remaining challenges and
estimating the causal effect of democracy on GDP. **[Our approach is to
use a number of [different strategies,]{.mark} which reassuringly all
[give similar results.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Our [first]{.underline}
approach uses [a dynamic (linear) panel model for GDP]{.underline},
which includes both country fixed effects and autoregressive dynamics.
The underlying economic assumption here is that, conditional on the lags
of GDP and country fixed effects, countries that change their democratic
status are not on a differential GDP trend (and thus these lags
successfully model the dip in GDP that precedes democratizations shown
in fig. 1). [This strategy leads to robust and precise estimates that
indicate that in the 25 years following a permanent democratization, GDP
per capita is about 20 percent higher than it would be
otherwise]{.underline}.

Our [second]{.underline} strategy adopts [a semiparametric treatment
effects framework in which democratization]{.underline}---the
treatment---[influences the distribution of potential GDP in all
subsequent years.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} strategy [requires us
to model the process of selection into democracy as a function of
observables]{.underline}, in particular, lags of GDP (e.g., Jordà 2005;
Angrist and Kuersteiner 2011; Kline 2011), but it does not rely on a
parametric model for the dynamics of GDP, which affords us greater
flexibility in estimating the time path of the impact of democracy on
GDP. Related to our first approach, the economic assumption in this case
is that, conditional on the lags of GDP, countries that democratize are
not on a differential GDP trend relative to other nondemocracies. We
show that [this approach successfully controls for the influence of the
dip in GDP preceding democratizations]{.underline} shown in figure 1
[and estimates that after a democratization, GDP increases]{.underline}
gradually until it reaches a level 20--25 percent higher than what it
would reach otherwise.

[These two strategies model the selection of countries into different
regimes and control for the dip in GDP]{.underline} in figure 1 as a
function of their re cent GDP per capita and time-invariant unobserved
heterogeneity. However, they do not tackle [the possibility that both
democracy and GDP might be affected by time-varying omitted
variables]{.underline}. [Our third strategy confronts]{.underline} this
challenge [by using an instrumental-variables]{.underline} (IV)
[approach]{.underline}. The political science literature emphasizes that
[transitions to democracy often take place in regional
waves]{.underline} (e.g., Huntington 1991; Markoff 1996). On the basis
of this observation, [we use regional waves in transitions to and away
from democracy as an instrument for country-level
democracy]{.underline}. [Our IV strategy exploits the diffusion of
political regimes across countries in the same region and with common
political histories]{.underline}. [We pay special attention to
distinguishing the diffusion of democracy from the role of regional
economic shocks or the spread of economic conditions to nearby countries
through trade and other mechanisms.]{.underline} By [focusing on the
variation created by regional waves of democratizations]{.underline},
our IV strategy [ensures]{.underline} that [idiosyncratic changes in a
country's political regime that may be endogenous to its growth do not
bias our estimates]{.underline}. [The resulting estimates of the impact
of democracy on GDP are similar to those from our other two
strategies]{.underline}: in our preferred specification, a
democratization increases GDP per capita by about 25 percent in the
first 25 years---although in some specifications the estimated effects
are larger. **[This similarity bolsters our confidence that all three of
our strategies are estimating the causal effect of democracy on
GDP]{.underline}**.

[We]{.underline} further [investigate the channels through which
democracy increases GDP]{.underline}. Although our findings here are
less clear-cut than our baseline results, they suggest that
**[[democracy contributes to growth by]{.mark} increasing
[investment]{.mark}, encouraging economic [reforms]{.mark}, improving
the provision of [schooling]{.mark} and [health care, and
reducing]{.mark} social [unrest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These results
are [consistent with]{.underline}, though of course do not prove, [the
hypothesis that democracies invest more in broad-based public goods and
are more likely to enact economic reforms that would otherwise be
resisted by politically powerful actors]{.underline} (e.g., Acemoglu
2008). Although [nondemocracies]{.underline} could also invest in public
goods or enact far-ranging economic reforms, our results indicate that,
at least in our sample, these countries [are less likely to do
so]{.underline} than democracies.

At the end of the paper, [we turn to the common claim that democracy
constrains economic growth for countries with low levels of
development]{.underline} (e.g., Aghion, Alesina, and Trebbi 2008; Posner
2010; Brooks 2013). [Our results do not support this view]{.underline},
but we do find that democracy has a larger impact on growth in countries
where a greater fraction of the population has secondary schooling.

There is a substantial literature in political science that
investigates, but does not reach a firm conclusion on, the empirical
linkages between democracy and economic outcomes, summarized in part in
Przeworski and Limongi (1993) and in Doucouliagos and Ulubaşoğlu's
(2008) meta-analysis.

Cross-country regression analyses, such as Helliwell (1994), Barro
(1996, 1999), and Tavares and Wacziarg (2001), have produced negative,
though generally inconsistent, results.2 More recent work, including
Rodrik and Wacziarg (2005), Persson and Tabellini (2006), Papaioannou
and Siourounis (2008), and Bates, Fayad, and Hoeffler (2012), estimate
positive effects using panel data techniques, although Murtin and
Wacziarg (2014), Burkhart and Lewis-Beck (1994), and Giavazzi and
Tabellini (2005) estimate insignificant effects on growth using similar
strategies.3 These and other [[papers]{.mark} in this literature [differ
in]{.mark} their [measure of democracy]{.mark} and [choice of
specifications and neither]{.mark} systematically [control for]{.mark}
the [dynamics of GDP nor]{.mark} address the [endogeneity of
democratizations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although some of the papers in
this literature control for lags of GDP in some of their specifications
(e.g., Persson and Tabellini 2006; Papaioannou and Siourounis 2008;
Murtin and Wacziarg 2014), [[they do not]{.mark} emphasize the
importance of GDP dynamics and the bias that results from not
appropriately [control]{.mark}ling [for the dip]{.mark} in
GDP]{.underline} shown in figure 1. [The failure to recognize
[this]{.mark} point [may]{.mark}, in fact, [explain]{.mark} the
[divergent results]{.mark} in the literature: because growth rates are
less serially correlated than GDP, contributions that focus on growth as
the dependent variable tend to find positive effects, while studies that
estimate models in levels generally find no effects---unless they model
the dynamics of GDP as we do.]{.underline}

What is this potential intermediate goal?

For our purposes, [[intellectual progress includes]{.mark} (but isn't

progress in [philosophy]{.mark} and the [social sciences, and increases
in]{.mark} general levels of [education and reasoning]{.mark}
ability]{.underline}. "Progress" is meant as a value-neutral term; some
advancements could do more harm than good.

What are some ways intellectual progress might affect the long-term
future?

Speeding up development: [If new discoveries in science, technology and
ideas are made quicker, it allows humanity to reach a better state
faster than it otherwise would]{.underline}.

Existential risk (and trajectory changes): There is a need for
differential progress, whereby intellectual progress in risk-reducing
factors (e.g., wisdom) ought to come before risk-increasing factors
(e.g., knowledge of bioweapon construction). Otherwise, faster
intellectual progress could increase existential risk.

Meta-longtermism: [A better educated population focused on doing
impactful/useful work will be more capable of making progress on other
longtermist areas]{.underline}.

Crucially, intellectual progress may either increase or decrease
existential risk, depending on the particular form of progress being
made. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether such progress is
all-things-considered good or bad. Further research is required to
delineate specifically which forms of progress are good or bad for the
long term.

What are some ways [democracy might affect intellectual
progress]{.underline}?

Participation: [[Anti-democratic regimes]{.mark} may [see new ideas as a
threat]{.mark} to their authority, [which]{.mark} would [incentivise
them to restrict]{.mark} the [discovery]{.mark} and proliferation of new
ideas. To do this, [they may]{.mark} seek to exclude or [eliminate
intellectuals]{.mark}]{.underline}\[11\]. [Additionally, some countries
may [make it harder]{.mark} for educated/intellectual groups [to
participate in decision making]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., [[by
shrinking the influence of academics on policy]{.underline}]{.mark}).
Thus, [[democracies low in participation]{.mark} could [create less
intellectual progress]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--AT: Democracy Bad

National-security analysts see China as one of the greatest threats
facing the United States and its allies. [According to an emerging
conventional wisdom, China has the leg up on the U.S. in part because
its authoritarian government can strategically plan for the long term,
unencumbered by competing branches of government, regular elections, and
public opinion]{.underline}. **[Yet this [faith in autocratic ascendance
and democratic decline is contrary to historical fact.]{.mark} China may
be able to put forth big, bold plans]{.underline}**---the kinds of
projects that analysts think of as long term---**[but the [visionary
projects of autocrats don't]{.mark} usually [pan

underbelly of the far-right movement to explore the seductive power of

answer to their citizens]{.mark} on regular intervals and are sensitive
to public opinion---t**hat's actually democracies' greatest source of
strength. Democratic [leaders have a harder time advancing]{.mark} big,
[bold agendas]{.mark}**, but the upside of that difficulty is that the
plans that do make it through the system have been carefully considered
and enjoy domestic support]{.underline}. Historically speaking, once a
democracy comes up with a successful strategy, it sticks with the plan,
even through a succession of leadership. Washington has arguably
followed the same basic, three-step geopolitical plan since 1945. First,
the United States built the current, rules-based international system by
providing security in important geopolitical regions, constructing
international institutions, and promoting free markets and democratic
politics within its sphere of influence. Second, it welcomed into the
club any country that played by the rules, even former adversaries, like
Germany and Japan. And, third, the U.S. worked with its allies to defend
the system from those countries or groups that would challenge it,
including competitors such as Russia and China, rogue states such as
Iran and North Korea, and terrorist networks. America can pursue
long-term strategy in part because it enjoys domestic political
stability. While new politicians seek to improve on their predecessor's
policies, the United States is unlikely to see the drastic shifts in
strategy that come from the fall of one political system and the rise of
another. [[Democratic elections]{.mark} may be messy, but they're [not
as messy as coups or civil wars.]{.mark}]{.underline} Daniel Blumenthal:
The Unpredictable Rise of China **[[Open
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}** have many other advantages as well.
They **[[facilitate innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[trust in
financial markets]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and economic growth. Because
**[democracies]{.underline}** tend to be more reliable partners, they
**[are typically skillful alliance builders]{.underline}**, and they can
accumulate resources without frightening their neighbors. **[They tend
to [make]{.mark} thoughtful, [informed decisions on]{.mark} matters of
[war]{.mark} and peace]{.underline}**, and to focus their security
forces on external enemies, not their own populations. Autocratic
systems simply cannot match this impressive array of economic,
diplomatic, and military attributes. David Leonhardt recently wrote in
The New York Times, "Chinese leaders stretching back to Deng Xiaoping
have often thought in terms of decades." Commonly cited examples of that
long-term thinking include the Belt and Road Initiative, a program that
invests in infrastructure overseas; Made in China 2025, an effort to
subsidize China's giant tech companies to become world leaders in
21st-century technologies, such as artificial intelligence; and
Beijing's promise to be a global superpower by 2049. Since putting in
place sound economic reforms in the 1970s, China has seen its economy
expand at eye-popping rates, to become the world's second largest. Many
economists predict that China could even surpass the United States
within the decade, and some have suggested that China's model of
state-led capitalism will prove more successful, in terms of economic
growth, than the U.S. template of free markets and open politics. I
doubt these predictions. Because autocratic leaders are unconstrained
and do not have to contend with a legislature or courts, they have an
easier time taking their countries in new and radically different
directions. Then, when the dictator changes his mind, he can do it
again. Mao's autocratic China ricocheted from one failed policy to
another: the Great Leap Forward, then the Hundred Flowers Campaign, then
the Cultural Revolution. Mao aligned with the Soviet Union in 1950 only
to nearly fight a nuclear war with Moscow in the next decade. Beginning
in the time of Deng Xiaoping, China pursued a fairly constant strategy
of liberalizing its economy at home and "hiding its capabilities and
biding its time" abroad. But President Xi Jinping abandoned these
dictums when he took over. As the most powerful leader since Mao---he
has changed China's constitution to set himself up as dictator for
life---he could once again jerk China in several new directions,
according to his whims, and back again. According to the Asia Society,
he has stalled or reversed course on eight of 10 categories of economic
reform promised by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) itself. Moreover,
Xi is baring China's teeth militarily, taking contested territory from
neighbors in the South China Sea and conducting military exercises with
Russia in Europe. The problem for Beijing is that stalled reforms will
stymie its economic potential and its confrontational policies are
provoking an international coalition to contain them. The 2017 U.S.
National Security Strategy declared great-power competition with China
the foremost security threat to the U.S.; the European Union labeled
China a "systemic rival"; and Japan, Australia, India, and the United
States have formed a new "quad" of powers to balance China in the
Pacific. Furthermore, the plans often cited as evidence of China's
farsighted vision, the Belt and Road Initiative and Made in China 2025,
were announced by Xi only in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Both are way
too recent to be celebrated as brilliant examples of successful,
long-term strategic planning. [A certain level of domestic political
stability is a prerequisite for charting a steady strategic course in
foreign and domestic affairs.]{.underline} **[But [autocratic regimes
are notoriously brittle.]{.mark} While [institutionalized political
successions in democracies typically lead to changes of policy]{.mark},
political successions in autocracies are likely to result in regime
collapse and war]{.underline}**. China's "5,000 years of history" were
pockmarked by rebellion, revolution, and new dynasties. Fearing internal
threats to domestic political stability---consider the protests this
year in Hong Kong and Xinjiang---the CCP spends more on domestic
security than on its national defense. If you follow the money, the CCP
is demonstrating that the government is more afraid of its own people
than of the Pentagon. This domestic fragility will frustrate China's
efforts to design and execute farsighted plans. If threats to Chinese
domestic stability were to materialize and the CCP were to collapse
tomorrow, for example, Chinese grand strategy could undergo another
seismic shift, including possibly opting out of competition with the
United States altogether. Shadi Hamid: China Is Avoiding Blame by
Trolling the World Autocracies have other vulnerabilities as **[well.
State-led planning has never produced high rates of economic growth over
the long term. [Autocrats are poor alliance
builders]{.mark}]{.underline}** who fight with their supposed allies
more than with their enemies. And the highest priority of autocratic
security forces is repressing their own people, not defending the
country. [The [world has undergone drastic changes]{.mark} in just the
past few years, but these [enduring patterns of international affairs
have not]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some fear that Trump's nationalist
tendencies will erode the U.S. position, but the momentum of America's
successful grand strategy has kept the country on a fairly steady
course. Despite Trump's criticism of NATO, for example, two new
countries have joined the alliance on his watch, including North
Macedonia this week. The coronavirus has upended a sense of security in
the U.S., leading many people into the familiar trap of lauding
autocratic China's firm response in contrast to the halting and
patchwork measures in the United States. But there is good reason to
believe that this assessment will be updated in America's favor with the
benefit of hindsight. Already we are seeing evidence that conditions are
much worse in China than CCP officials are letting on and that China's
attempts at international "disaster diplomacy" are backfiring. It has
been revealed that the CCP has continually misrepresented the numbers of
COVID-19 infections and deaths in China, and European nations have
rejected and returned faulty Chinese coronavirus testing kits.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its Allies [[have strong reasons to
adopt a pragmatic approach]{.mark}, which can be]{.underline}
conveniently [defined as]{.underline} 3S: **[[small + secure =
success]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The rationale is as follows: • Small:
[[small projects are unlikely to generate internal opposition or face
major challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}; • Secure: [[secure projects
are]{.mark} also [at lower risks of technical or organizational
failure]{.mark}]{.underline}; • Success: [[success is thus more readily
within reach]{.underline}]{.mark}.

According to Google Brain's co-founder Andrew Ng, for instance, **[[it
"is important for \[the\] first few AI project to succeed rather than be
the most valuable]{.mark} AI projects]{.underline}**". [This means [they
should be "technically feasible" and have "a clearly defined]{.mark} and
measurable [objective that creates business
value]{.mark}]{.underline}".134 Greg Allen, now at the US Department of
Defense's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, reiterates this message
from a different angle. He considers that [many "[AI projects fail not
because of the tech]{.mark}nology, [but because of a failure to properly
set expectations, integrate with legacy systems, and train operational
personnel".]{.mark}]{.underline}135 [Militaries have learned these
lesson in previous instances of technological change: historically, many
breakthrough technologies generated opposition, they did not deliver on
their promises, and the increases in costs and time requirements further
undermined their acceptance]{.underline}.136 [As such, a pragmatic
approach to [small and feasible projects minimizes the chance that
political or technical failure might slow down the Alliance's adoption
of AI.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A pragmatic approach to "NATO-mation" follows two key assumptions.
First, many discussions about AI currently focus on the tension between
narrow versus general AI. Some believe that the age of "the singularity"
-- where general AI will be superior to human intelligence -- is
near]{.underline}. Others believe that this is a remote dream and that,
for the foreseeable future, intelligent machines will be able only to
conduct limited, specific tasks.137 [For the moment, the Alliance should
just look at "narrow" AI.]{.underline} Second, the approach pursued by
the Alliance should encompass a wide range of uses, and go beyond
discussion limited to lethal autonomous weapons systems. [[The debate on
lethal autonomous weapons]{.mark} systems that has taken place over the
past few years [has]{.mark} in fact [distracted]{.mark} attention [from
the military relevance of AI]{.mark} and its broader implications for
the international system]{.underline}. As David Judge, Vice President of
SAP Leonardo, puts it, [the conversation built around the question "Are
we going to have red-eyed killer robots?" is not useful.138 Indeed, even
insofar as the [lethal debates]{.mark} are important, these [are]{.mark}
largely [regulatory]{.mark} questions [decided at the national level,
rather than at NATO level]{.mark}. [NATO]{.mark} would therefore be
better advised to pursue the lines advanced by Judge: we
"[should]{.mark} instead [focus on pragmatic uses of AI that are already
here]{.mark} and ready]{.underline}".139

While intellectual debates about these two assumptions are relevant to
long-term patterns of adoption, current adoption efforts should focus on
exploiting narrow AI below the tip of the spear. Such exploitation
depends on investments in complementary assets, goods, services, and
changes to business models. The San Francisco-based consultancy
Altimeter contextualizes these investments in its four main phases of AI
adoption: exploration, experimentation, formalization and integration,
depicted in the diagram below.140

[When it comes to defence and AI, [most NATO Allies sit between
exploration]{.mark}]{.underline} (phase 1) [[and
experimentation]{.underline}]{.mark} (phase 2). [Only a few have eyed
formalization]{.underline} (phase 3), [and even fewer have started
looking at integration]{.underline} (phase 4). **[This last phase
coincides with what in business is generally known as enterprise
adoption]{.underline}**: [when a technology becomes pervasive in the
work of an organization]{.underline}. It is important to highlight,
however, that at this stage, in the commercial world, even the most
AI-intensive, ML-savvy and data-hungry companies have hardly made it
properly to phase 3.141 Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Baidu and Facebook
can deploy advanced AI solutions because they have access to an
unparalleled amount of data and top talent, and because they have
invested billions and years in AI. Other actors that lack these
resources and capabilities should initially be more focused.142

[Security analysts and scholars are primarily concerned that [first
movers in the AI race could reap the benefits]{.mark} of this
technological transformation, thus [forcing others to a condition of
technological dependence and military
vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Business scholars advise caution, as
the conditions for first mover's and second mover's advantage to take
place are quite specific.143 What matters for this discussion is that
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its Allies [[neither have to rush into
AI nor have the luxury to wait: they need to prepare]{.mark},
[technologically]{.mark} but also [socially and politically]{.mark}, in
order to avoid potential backlashes or resistance. **[In order to pursue
this goal]{.mark}**, one strategy consists in **[adopt]{.mark}**ing **[a
pragmatic approach based on a set of small and secure pilot-projects
that]{.mark}**, as such, **[are more likely to achieve
success]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Three potential areas are:

**[Logistics]{.underline}**. General Omar Bradley famously said that
amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics. [[Logistics
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, [[a critical element of military
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [although often neglected among the
public, [and]{.mark} even among some experts]{.underline}.144 [Logistic
capabilities [can]{.mark} in fact [give significant combat
advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}.145 [This is a familiar story to
[NATO]{.mark}, whose [forces]{.mark} have, at times, [enjoy]{.mark}ed
[massive logistic advantages]{.mark} vis-à-vis some of their
adversaries.]{.underline}146 [Logistics can be divided into layers:
strategic, operational, in-theatre and on the battlefield. There is
definitely room for employing AI at every level. **[Launching AI pilot
projects in]{.mark} last-mile [logistics]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g.,
on the front line), **[however, [has significant
benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In particular, if Amazon or Domino
Pizza aim to rely on automated drone-based delivery systems, there is no
reason why NATO Allies cannot at least try a similar approach when it
last-mile resupplies.147 [The advantage of last-mile logistics is that,
lying at the end of the tail, [it does not entail major infrastructure
investments.]{.mark} [However, it is complex, difficult and]{.mark}
often also [dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this reason, **[[even
small improvements]{.mark} in this realm [are going to have significant
effects]{.mark}. [NATO]{.mark} and its [Allies could fund a
project]{.mark},]{.underline}** or launch a DARPA-like Grand Challenge,
**[[to develop an autonomous system for]{.mark} last-mile
[logistics]{.mark}]{.underline}**. DARPA's [Grand Challenges are
[open]{.mark} calls [to the public]{.mark} at large [for
participating]{.mark} in a competition [with a
prototype]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Europe, the Joint European Disruptive
Initiative has tried to replicate on a smaller scale DARPA's model, with
remarkable success so far.

[The increasing power of [processors]{.mark}, accuracy of [algorithms,
and]{.mark} availability of digital [data are driving]{.mark} the
dramatic artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark})-centred technological
[transformation **now in progress**.]{.mark}]{.underline} These changes
have already turned companies, industries and markets upside down, and
**[[we are]{.mark} also [starting to see their effects on the
battlefield]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The employment of unmanned
vehicles, reliance on big data for target detection, identification and
acquisition, as well as the potentials of machine learning in other
critical functions such as logistics and maintenance are only some of
the possible examples of how warfare will evolve in the near
future.]{.underline} The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and its Allies **[[cannot be
bystanders during this]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological
[transition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Some [countries and organizations
have already taken]{.mark} important [steps. Others are more
hesitant]{.mark}. **[The Atlantic Alliance has a]{.mark}** moral
**[obligation to act]{.mark}, both [to preserve and extend its military
leadership]{.mark}** -- and thus the wealth and security of its citizens
-- **[and to shape this process in keeping with]{.mark} its [democratic
principles]{.mark}, freedom-inspired values [and]{.mark} commitment to
fundamental [human rights]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As NATO works on its
Artificial Intelligence Strategy, which could be published in 2021, this
Research Paper aims at contributing to both the policy debate and the
public discussion about AI and its implications for the Alliance. The
paper offers a series of analyses, lessons learned, proposals, and
recommendations, that build on best practices and solutions adopted in
the civilian and military fields, on perspectives drawn from the
academic literature as well as on ideas generated in the broader AI
community. The various parts of the paper are all linked to the single
overarching concept of "NATO-mation", or the idea that [[NATO has an
important role to play]{.mark} so as [to prepare for and to shape this
technological transformation]{.mark}. NATO Allies need to be proactive:
[without]{.mark} common, coordinated, [cooperative]{.mark} or joint
[solutions, they will not be able to achieve all their goals effectively
and efficiently]{.mark}. The paper thus elaborates on the concept of
"NATO-mation" in 11 different building blocks, as summarized
below]{.underline}:

Ethical purpose: first and foremost, [NATO's strength comes from its
values,]{.underline} which give meaning to its military capabilities and
represent the bond between the Allies. [As technological progress
demands answers to major ethical questions regarding the development,
employment and purpose of intelligent machines, [NATO]{.mark} and its
Allies [have the opportunity to shape]{.mark} [international
norms]{.mark} and behaviour in this respect while simultaneously
strengthening their commitment to the Alliance's founding
principles]{.underline}. Setting up an ethical board of experts and
adopting some common ethical principles are two starting points.

Championing innovation: innovation is more difficult than generally
accepted, often because of cognitive resistance, bureaucratic inertia or
lack of political appetite. An important step forward would be to
identify a champion within the Alliance, with a view to promoting,
supporting and enabling the adoption of AI. This champion would work
with Allies to connect and coordinate their activities and initiatives,
as well as support them in key areas such as training or reform: a new
structure could also be created, and could be called potentially an
Artificial Intelligence Integration and Implementation-Enabling Centre
(A3IC).

**[[Pilot projects]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[innovation is]{.mark} often
[difficult because]{.mark} individuals and [organizations are]{.mark}
inherently [risk-averse]{.mark}. [NATO]{.mark} and its Allies
[should]{.mark} work on the 3S principle to address this aspect: [start
from small]{.mark} (S) [and secure]{.mark} (S) [pilot projects which
can, through their success]{.mark} (S), readily and simply [demonstrate
the potential of these new technologies]{.mark}. Last-mile
**[logistics]{.mark}**, military medicine and disinformation
**[are]{.mark}** three areas **[where NATO could start
working]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

According to many observers, artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}), [machine learning]{.underline} (ML) [and
big data]{.underline} (BD) [[are going to promote a dramatic
tech]{.mark}nological [transformation affecting every aspect of our
lives]{.mark}, every industry and profession, every layer of our
societies, [with major implications]{.mark} also [for international
politics]{.mark}.]{.underline}5 [[The consequences for military
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark} and international security [are still not
fully appreciated or understood]{.underline}.6 Nonetheless, building on
previous cases, as well as historical experience with other major
technological revolutions, we can reasonably conjecture that [the
fallout [will]{.mark} likely [be massive]{.mark}. Countries -- and
[alliances]{.mark} -- [unable to adapt quickly and thoroughly will be
left by the wayside]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 [Understanding, preparing for
and exploiting this]{.underline} technological [transition is thus of
utmost importance for NATO]{.underline} and for its Allies.8

The Atlantic Alliance as a whole has an obligation to preserve and
extend its military power, maintain its level of prosperity and internal
cohesion, lay the conditions for future wealth creation, and make its
action more efficient and effective, starting from its core tasks:
collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security.9 The
technological transformation triggered by [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}, ML
and BD [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} many of the [assumptions, procedures,
capabilities, skills as well as doctrines and strategies underpinning
[NATO's current activities]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 [[There can be no
substitute for understanding, preparing and exploiting this AI-centred
tech]{.mark}nological [transition, but it will require significant
effort]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 The first Industrial Revolution -- driven
by the combined employment of new mechanical devices -- was ultimately
about increasing the power of natural energy, and it brought about a
dramatically different international system.12 Similarly, the second
Industrial Revolution, which allowed for large production runs and thus
brought economies of scale centre stage, made "mass" a central tenet of
military power, with tragic consequences for international politics due
to the emergence of industrial and total war.13 The third Industrial
Revolution, with its focus on computation, allowed for much higher
levels of precision; and precision came to dominate the battlefield --
through long-range guided munitions, real-time intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance assets and stealth, among others.14 Some
define our new era as the fourth Industrial Revolution.15 Others speak
of the Second Machine Age.16 Regardless of the name, in the age of
intelligent machines, [machine speed will likely prove one of the
defining features of future warfare]{.underline}.17

[[NATO should act so that it can be at the forefront of this transition,
rather than]{.mark} observe it as an onlooker or -- even worse -- [be
subjected to it by others]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to avoid the
risk of lagging behind, [[AI will have to be integrated across the
board]{.underline}]{.mark} -- i.e., in every single aspect and domain,
layer and functional area: from data gathering and processing to
communications and cyber-defence, from logistics and medical diagnosis
to tactical, operational and strategic decision-making.18 Such
[**[enterprise-level adoption]{.mark}** [would allow]{.mark} Allied
forces to run [every single procedure]{.mark} and process [at machine
speed, and thus not find themselves outcompeted]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Admittedly, [[enterprise adoption is challenging]{.mark} -- even [more
so for AI]{.mark}, given that it requires different organizational
solutions and culture, talent and skills, and infrastructure
support]{.underline}.19

[The defence and [military capabilities of NATO]{.mark} countries [are
tightly integrated and coordinated, resulting in combined military
power]{.mark} where the sum is [greater than its parts]{.mark}.
[NATO]{.mark} and its Allies [will have to integrate AI at enterprise
level]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in order [[to
preserve]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[military and technological
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near future -- both at the
national and coalition level.20 The challenge will thus be massive.

Building on existing academic research and policy discussions, including
those related to a NATO Artificial Intelligence Strategy, 21 this
Research Paper has a twofold purpose: to contribute to existing debate
within the Alliance on AI, ML and BD, and key related issues; and to
advance a number of proposals centred on the concept of "NATO-mation" --
i.e., equipping the Alliance with the capabilities, organizational
structures and strategies to compete in the world of AI.22

[**[Given the major changes now under way,]{.mark}** the **[Atlantic
Alliance has a unique opportunity to shape this
transformation]{.mark}**, rather than sit by as an
onlooker.]{.underline} With the concept of "NATO-mation", this Research
Paper aims to promote this goal. The research is based on two guiding
principles. On the one hand, [individual measures will be crucial to
sustain and expand the Alliance's economic, technological and hence
military power, and adapt it to new circumstances and
needs]{.underline}. On the other hand, coordination and **[[cooperation
among]{.mark} the [Allies will be necessary to address]{.mark} the
resulting [challenges and ensure continued integration in the NATO
context]{.mark}]{.underline}**.23 **[[Uncoordinated individual actions
risk creating a major offset in capabilities among Allies, with a number
of negative implications for interoperability, cohesion and
consensus]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[because of the very
nature of the technologies at hand, [the consequences of failure to work
in concert could prove]{.mark} even more
[dramatic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.24 The challenge is therefore not
limited to technology per se, but includes other equally relevant
domains. This is why discussion of the "NATO-mation" concept is divided
into the following 11 building blocks: • Ethical purpose: making sure
that NATO acts in the ethical domain, following and promoting its
founding principles and moral commitments; • Championing innovation:
identifying an innovation champion to lead, support, connect and engage
with all Allies and relevant stakeholders; • **[[Pilot
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[favour]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[[adoption by promoting small, secure projects with greater likelihood
of success]{.underline}]{.mark}; • An innovative workforce:
understanding and addressing the human capital requirements this new
transition entails; • An innovative workplace: changing organizations to
attract and retain talent and thus enable innovation; • Concepts:
running simulations, exercises and wargames to test and devise new
concepts and technologies; • Technological superiority: maintaining and
extending technological leadership and developing new relevant
technologies; • Arms control and technology regimes: supporting
mechanisms to strengthen international stability and prevent diffusion
of critical technologies; • The data pipeline and the AI Network
Trinity: promoting the development of the ecosystem necessary to exploit
AI, including cloud and quantum computing and 5G networks; • Standards
and standardization: enabling interoperability and translating strategic
imperatives and ethical commitments into technological solutions; •
Primacy of democracy: protecting democracy and democratic values against
digital authoritarianism. For each of these building blocks, the paper
will discuss the importance of the issue, the key challenges, potential
solutions and possible recommendations.

[For]{.underline} any country, and in particular for [Great Powers,

represents a key asset for both national security and prosperity. This
is even more acute in an age of accelerating technological

technological base that is extremely demanding to
create]{.underline}.224 [For countries that do not keep up with progress

[particularly]{.underline} the case **[for AI]{.underline}**, [ML and

//pipk

[[Although]{.mark} the proliferation of military [AI]{.mark} technology
[has the potential to frustrate]{.mark} [alliance]{.mark} military
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} and decision-making, these [obstacles are
not insurmountable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Allies have previously worked
together on missions that involved new technology, shared highly
sensitive information, and learned to cope with compressed
decision-making timelines. Drawing lessons from historical exemplar
cases where allies have wrestled with new technology, coupled with
guidance from emerging national AI policies and analysis of new
technologies, I identify ways that alliances can overcome the pitfalls
of AI integration in an environment in which AI is increasingly common.

Increasing AI Interoperability and Data Sharing

[To ensure alliances and coalitions are able to leverage AI technologies
during their operations, **[states will need to remove barriers to data
sharing]{.mark} and access**]{.underline}. **[[One initial step]{.mark}
to enabling this type of interoperability [is to establish formal
agreements that govern the development and use of AI]{.mark}-enabled
[tech]{.mark}nologies [and]{.mark} associated
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[These]{.mark} formal agreements [will
not only prescribe procedures for collaboration, but]{.mark} help
[assuage fears that allies will renege on
commitments]{.mark}.]{.underline}108 [[Agreements that explicitly define
the responsibilities and expectations of member states help eliminate
vagaries that otherwise allow a state to back out of commitments with
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}.109

[[To integrate AI]{.mark} into alliance operations, [policymakers will
need to first establish how they will jointly develop and employ AI
capabilities]{.mark}. [This entails identifying]{.mark} the [types of
operations]{.mark} in which allies [are willing to use
AI]{.mark}-enabled technologies]{.underline}. [Some states may only be
willing to employ AI military systems in limited areas and eschew using
AI for certain tasks.]{.underline} The U.S.-Singapore agreement, for
example, stipulates that the two states will focus their AI efforts on
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.110 [More
[narrowly scoped agreements that focus on noncombat operations may prove
more palatable to policymakers and their domestic
publics]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[These]{.mark} narrow agreements [could
serve as useful first steps to collaboration, but still yield lessons
and best practices applicable across the full range of military
operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[Developing data-sharing policies]{.mark} and technical standards [may
be difficult]{.mark} given the sensitive nature of national security
information and the variation in technical standards across alliance
member states. [Allies, however, have found ways to coordinate
cooperation, even in sensitive areas]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United
States and its Five Eyes partners --- the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand --- have long maintained agreements that
govern intelligence collaboration. The 1946 United Kingdom-United States
Agreement, for example, established formal rules for sharing signals
intelligence --- intercepted electronic emissions and communications.111
The agreement spelled out how the states would cooperate on the
collection, analysis, and dissemination of signals intelligence, while a
technical appendix provided detailed technical and procedural guidance
on communications intercept equipment and decryption and translation
processes.112 Specifically, the agreement called on states to "make
available to the other \[states\] continuously, currently, and without
request, all raw traffic, \[communications intelligence\] end-product
and technical material acquired or produced."113 [Some existing
intelligence sharing agreements might allow for the exchange of the
sensitive data needed to train and operate AI systems. **[When existing
agreements are not in place]{.mark} or do not cover the types of data
required for AI-enabled warfare, [policymakers will need to develop
new]{.mark} bilateral or [multilateral agreements that enable
interoperability and data sharing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These
agreements and the procedures used to implement them will likely vary
depending on the states involved and the degree and purpose of
cooperation. In some cases, [cooperation may be narrowly scoped to
limited data sharing in support of a specific operation. In other cases,
[agreements may]{.mark} be far broader and [cover issues related to
research and development, interoperability, and extensive data
sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Even when formalized agreements]{.mark} establish the processes and
institutions that [enable AI cooperation]{.mark} between states, [many
leaders may remain hesitant to share the sensitive data that underpins
AI development and operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Information-sharing arrangements are plagued by commitment problems as
states can back out of]{.mark} their [agreements]{.mark} to exchange
data if they fear that data will be leaked or their capabilities and
shortcomings will be revealed]{.underline}.114 [[This might be
particularly true in]{.underline}]{.mark} ad hoc coalitions or [[larger
alliances, where relationships between member states may be
weaker]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Recent]{.mark} technological
[advances]{.mark}, however, may help [overcome]{.mark} these [commitment
problems by convincing]{.mark} member [states]{.mark} that their [data
will remain secure even when shared.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In particular, developments in the field of [cryptology allow states to
share data]{.mark} with partners for use in AI systems, [while hiding
the exact content]{.mark} of input data]{.underline}. [Secure
[multiparty computation]{.mark}, for example, [is a privacy-preserving
technique in which AI]{.mark} algorithms perform their computations
[us]{.mark}ing an [input that remains secret, but provide an
output]{.mark} that is public [to all authorized
users]{.mark}]{.underline}.115 [Secure multiparty computation has been
increasingly used in the medical and financial sectors where analysts
seek to assess trends but need to protect individual-level health and
fiscal data to avoid violating privacy regulations]{.underline}.116 This
and other [privacy preserving approaches could be applied to a range of
AI-enabled alliance military tasks, such as the classification of
objects in satellite and reconnaissance imagery. Member states might
feed sensitive intelligence data into a secure multiparty
computation-based system managed by an alliance's intelligence fusion
center, which would then return information about potential targets,
without revealing attributes about each state's intelligence
inputs]{.underline}.

**[[To successfully integrate AI and share data]{.mark}, however,
[partners will]{.mark} also [need to establish technical standards to
ensure data is stored and formatted in ways that make it easily
accessible to and usable by various alliance
members]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [In designing these agreements, alliance
policymakers might draw insights from existing state-level AI guidelines
and alliance standardization protocols]{.underline}. The U.S. National
Institute for Standards, for example, released its AI standards in
February 2019. The guidance calls for defining data specifications that
ensure AI technologies meet "critical objectives for functionality,
interoperability, and trustworthiness."117 [In the alliance military
context, this might mean ensuring that data associated with geospatial
or signals intelligence are formatted and labeled in a common manner and
stored on shared alliance networks. Or, it could mean establishing
alliance-wide protocols for data security and integrity to minimize the
risks of data poisoning. [These]{.mark} specifications [could be
codified in formal arrangements like NATO's standardization
agreements]{.mark}, which provide standards for thousands of systems and
processes ranging from aerial refueling equipment to satellite imagery
products]{.underline}.118 [[These]{.mark} standards [ensure "doctrine,
tactics, and techniques are developed in harmony" to help allies
"operate effectively together while optimizing the use of
resources."]{.mark}]{.underline}119

Allies Can Deliver a Democratic Way of AI\" //pipk

America's broad network of allies and partners is a source of enduring
strength. [[In]{.mark} an era of economic and [tech]{.mark}nological
[competition with China and Russia, the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [benefits from]{.mark} [allies that share]{.mark}
its [values and]{.mark} produce troves of strategic [resources,
including]{.mark} computer and data science [experts]{.mark}; [private
sectors that are innovative]{.mark}, dominant and trend-setting;
[data]{.mark} on which [to train AI algorithms]{.mark}; [advanced
microprocessors]{.mark} and data storage units; governmental research
and development ([R&D]{.mark}) investments; [diplomatic support
for]{.mark} initiatives in [AI]{.mark} safety and [governance]{.mark};
[and]{.mark} the [clout]{.mark} needed [to export norms and]{.mark} best
[practices]{.mark} to the rest of the world]{.underline}.

[[Alliances matter in the AI context because they provide a framework
for cooperation, data sharing, dissemination of best practices, joint
planning, and procurement]{.mark}. [The market adequately]{.mark}
[incentivizes some]{.mark} forms of [cooperation]{.mark}, such as data
labelling and exchanges. [But alliances]{.mark} can help [formalize and
expand these relationships]{.mark}, [correct for market failures]{.mark}
in such areas as AI safety and security, [coordinate development]{.mark}
of use cases and risk assessments, [enhance]{.mark} the [legitimacy of
international action, and validate the deployment of safe and reliable
AI.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[America's alliances and security partnerships will shape the future
trajectory of AI, even as AI reshapes the capabilities and operating
environments for U.S. allies and partners]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[By
investing in]{.mark} **[privacy]{.mark}**-preserving machine learning
and other [**techniques** for improving the interpretability of AI
systems]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its
[allies can promote the development of AI consistent with liberal
democratic values]{.mark}.]{.underline} Far-sighted investments could
yield large dividends. **[[AI has a wide array of]{.mark} [applications
that can benefit democracies, from]{.mark} improving [data protection
and privacy, to]{.mark} promoting [transparency and accountability in
government]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Advances in AI will]{.mark} also [enable new military
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Nations around the world use AI
[to enhance intell]{.mark}igence [collection and analysis]{.mark},
streamline [decision-making]{.mark}, lower operating [costs]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} improve military logistics through [predictive
maintenance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark} China, Russia, and other
[authoritarian powers integrate AI with military capabilities]{.mark},
[U.S. allies]{.mark} and partners [will face a]{.mark} more [complex
operating environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Advances]{.mark} in
software and digital systems [could render it]{.mark} more [difficult to
assess]{.mark} the [balance of power in key
domains]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [As the operational tempo of war
accelerates, [leaders might be tempted to **integrate AI**]{.mark} and
machine learning **[into early warning and command and control
systems]{.mark}**, [creating]{.mark} new risks [and]{.mark}
uncertainties [for strategic stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.8
**[[Competitors may rush to deploy AI]{.mark}-enabled [capabilities
without adequate testing, evaluation, verification, and
validation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Compounding]{.mark} the
[risks]{.mark}, [adversaries will]{.mark} seek to [exploit
vulnerabilities in AI systems and]{.mark} may even use [AI]{.mark} [to
execute]{.mark} novel [cyberattacks]{.mark} and disinformation campaigns
[aimed at undermining democratic institutions and sowing discord]{.mark}
among the public]{.underline}.9

[In meeting]{.underline} these [[challenges and]{.mark}
seizing]{.underline} the [[opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark} that AI
presents, the United States and its allies [[face tough
trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Three]{.mark}, in particular,
[necessitate close coordination and prudent mitigation]{.mark}
strategies]{.underline}.

[First, the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its
[allies face a trade-off between capability and
dependency]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 [[Showcasing]{.mark} a
[democratic]{.mark} way of [AI will require]{.mark} the United States
and its allies to [pool resources]{.mark}, [coordinate policies, and
share best practices and information]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Leveraging
the capabilities of its allies and partners will amplify U.S. power and
influence, but will also create inefficiencies and require
compromise]{.underline}. While the United States can manage these
challenges, [it cannot eliminate them entirely---nor should
it]{.underline}. **[As long as [AI]{.mark}-related [supply chains are
global]{.mark} [and]{.mark} AI [talent]{.mark} both mobile and
[global]{.mark}ly distributed, [innovation in AI requires international
collaboration]{.mark}.]{.underline}**11 [To excel in this new context,
America will need to embrace its role as a "systems integrator" among
like-minded allies and partners.]{.underline}12 [Embedding cooperation
in dense, decentralized networks plays to the United States' strengths
as a democratic power that favors market approaches to technological
cooperation.]{.underline} By combining top-down vision with dynamic,
bottom-up innovation and entrepreneurship, the United States and its
allies can foster a competitive ecosystem that enables the best ideas to
flourish.

These benefits should not obscure the risks. [[International networks
can facilitate cooperation by creating focal points and
enhancing]{.mark} the [transparency and availability]{.mark} of
information]{.underline}.13 As scholars have shown, [however, networks
of interdependence can also become the sites of competitive power plays,
such as the]{.underline} Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication ([SWIFT) financial messaging system]{.underline}.14
The United States has used SWIFT to counter terrorism, monitor illicit
financial activity, and bolster the sanctions regime against Iran.15 At
the same time, **[China is exploring alternatives to this U.S.-dominated
cross-border payments system]{.underline}**.16 **[Emerging competitive
dynamics suggest the need for a strategic approach toward the
development of AI, especially in semiconductors]{.underline}**.

[[To manage]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its [allies should pursue]{.mark} a
range of [mitigation]{.mark} strategies, [including]{.mark} securing and
[enhancing]{.mark} their [defense]{.mark} innovation [bases]{.mark} and
domestic economic competitiveness, [diversifying partnerships]{.mark} in
AI, [investing diplomatic capacity in norms]{.mark} and standards for AI
technologies and mobile telecommunications consistent with democratic
values, [and promoting flexible institutional configurations]{.mark} for
partnership in AI.]{.underline}17

[Second]{.underline}, the United States and its allies face [a trade-off
between competition and cooperation. All nations compete for relative
military and economic advantage. In the age of AI, nations will also
compete over whose vision of the future attracts the broadest
support.]{.underline} [Cooperation among democracies is necessary to
guard against authoritarian uses of AI, but there are other imperatives
for cooperative action]{.underline}. For example, [[democratic nations
must cooperate with strategic competitors to ensure global economic
stability and prevent misperceptions and miscalculations from spiraling
into hostility]{.mark}; [this could be achieved through]{.mark} arms
control or [international action to create norms and standards for
emerging technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the United States competes with China
and Russia in AI and collaborates with allies and partners. While
accurate, it is equally true that the United States competes with its
allies and partners for top talent and resources in AI and must find
ways to cooperate with China and Russia on AI safety and security,
strategic stability, and crisis management to forestall the risks of
accidents and miscalculations.18 When asked about obstacles to
collaboration with the United States, for example, multiple officials
from allied countries highlighted industrial competition as an
impediment.

Cooperative dynamics are typically in pursuit of shared, global
interests, while competitive dynamics tend to follow from a national
calculation of AI's impact on relative power and wealth. [Researchers
and scientists cooperate across national boundaries, but political
leaders face difficult trade-offs between national interests and the
international networks that foster open-source collaboration in
AI]{.underline}.

**[[Navigating these dynamics will require the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} to [pursue a
two-pronged strategy]{.mark}: [expand areas for cooperation and
competition that generate mutual benefits]{.mark}, [while shrinking the
space for competition that generates harmful effects or a race to the
bottom]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, [the United States should
manage competition within a rules-based framework that ensures a level
playing field, protects intellectual property, and disincentivizes
hidden government subsidies]{.underline}. At the same time, it should
work with countries to discourage unfair competition that tilts the
playing field in favor of state-backed enterprises, destabilizes
financial markets, and triggers unforeseen disruptions to global supply
chains.

[[The third trade-off is]{.mark} between [safety and
speed]{.mark}]{.underline}.19 [This trade-off arises from the complex
dynamics between the United States and its allies on the one hand, and
strategic competitors such as China and Russia on the other. Artificial
intelligence presents a range of opportunities and risks for the United
States and its allies]{.underline}. [[AI systems are brittle and can
fail accidently or behave unpredictably in real-world
settings]{.underline}.]{.mark}20 [[American, European, Chinese, and
Russian leaders]{.mark} increasingly [view AI as a core element of
national power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[[In an effort to gain
comparative]{.mark} [advantage,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[countries
could rush to deploy untested]{.underline}**]{.mark} or **[unsafe
[AI]{.mark} systems]{.underline}**. [**[It is in the interest of U.S.
national security to pursue confidence-building measures in AI
safety]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [[It is also a core interest of U.S.
allies**: a majority of officials noted standards to ensure**]{.mark}
**reliable and [responsible AI development as a]{.mark} national AI
[priority and avenue for productive multilateral
collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[By leading an international
effort on safe]{.mark} and reliable [AI, the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its [allies can reduce threats to global
security and promote strategic stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[Policymakers could pursue any number of initiatives in this area, such
as bringing together technical experts from the United States, China,
and Europe to define shared concepts and standards for the robustness of
AI systems; pursuing low-stakes joint projects to summarize the AI
safety literature in different countries and promote transparency into
applications of AI safety research; facilitating Track 1.5 and Track 2
dialogues on specific challenges in AI safety; or developing common
standards and methods of testing, verifying, and validating AI systems,
including AI-enabled safety critical infrastructure.]{.underline}21

[The United States\' global network of alliances and partnerships is a
force multiplier in the strategic competition against China and Russia.
With artificial intelligence as the focal point of this competition,
fostering AI defense and security cooperation is becoming increasingly
important]{.underline}. In fact, in its final report, the National
Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has recommended
strengthening AI interoperability with U.S. allies and partners as a key
element of building an AI-ready force by 2025.1 **[The AI future of the
United States is then inherently intertwined with that of our allies and
partners.]{.underline}**

[Although there are powerful incentives for multinational collaboration
on AI, there are also nonnegligible technical, bureaucratic, and
political barriers that could prevent like-minded nations from realizing
a shared vision for the responsible use of military AI.]{.underline}
This issue brief summarizes these challenges and then makes the argument
that **[multinational collaboration on AI applications for military
logistics and sustainment offers the path of least
resistance]{.underline}**. Our key takeaways are: • [Multinational
collaboration efforts on military applications of AI face an uphill
battle. Public misgivings about the militarization of AI, tensions with
Europe on questions of regulations and data privacy, lack of clarity
regarding the best forum for collaboration, and technical challenges to
ensuring that hardware and digital systems are interoperable and secure
could impede efforts to work together]{.underline}. While no easy task,
[collaboration on AI-enabled technologies and applications related to
military logistics and sustainment is technologically attainable,
politically feasible, and strategically imperative]{.underline}. [There
are multiple pathways for collaboration on this set of technologies and
applications]{.underline}, including joint standards for secure data
sharing; collaborative research and development programs; multinational
public-private partnerships; and joint military exercises that include
AI-enabled logistics and sustainment technologies and capabilities.

**[As the Biden administration moves to implement its foreign policy
agenda of rebuilding U.S. alliances and confronting China's
assertiveness, multinational collaboration on emerging technologies
takes center stage]{.underline}**. While not without challenges, [joint
projects centered on]{.underline} developing, maturing, and adapting
[AI]{.underline} applications for [military logistics]{.underline} and
sustainment [offer both a viable and promising path
forward.]{.underline}

Conclusion [The idea of an international technology alliance grounded in
a shared set of democratic ideals and ethical standards for the
development and use of emerging technologies is gaining ground in the
United States and among its allies and partners]{.underline}.75 [Yet as
the strategic competition between the United States and China
intensifies, the United States may charge ahead in integrating AI into
its military systems while allies trail behind. The growing gap in
military and technological capabilities, in turn, could undermine
interoperability and threaten the long-term viability of multinational
coalitions like NATO and other key U.S. alliances.]{.underline}

[While there are notable]{.underline} technical, bureaucratic, and
political [barriers to multinational cooperation in AI, especially for
military purposes, **AI applications for logistics**]{.underline} and
sustainment **[represent both a promising and critical area for
collaboration between the United States and its allies]{.underline}**.
[There are many ways allies can work together in this space, including
by developing joint standards for data sharing, investing in
collaborative R&D programs, advancing multinational public-private
partnerships, and integrating AIenabled logistics and sustainment
technologies into joint military exercises]{.underline}.

Depending on allies' interests and capabilities, these efforts can take
place within existing alliances, on a bilateral basis, or through a new
and separate consortium dedicated specifically to cooperation on
AI-enabled logistics and sustainment technologies. [Working together
with allies on this set of AI technologies will help advance shared
security interests, promote interoperability, and ultimately, pave the
path toward the ethical and responsible use of AI in military systems
and mission]{.underline}.

[[NATO has an interest]{.underline}]{.mark}, and a moral obligation,
[[to promote]{.mark} the adoption of its [values in]{.mark} the realm of
[AI]{.mark}. [Democratic values inform the Alliance's goals]{.mark},
thus [giving meaning to its material capabilities]{.mark} -- including
its military power]{.underline}. [At the same time, the [integration of
AI]{.mark} into the fields of security and defence [poses unique]{.mark}
moral, ethical, legal, and safety-related
[questions]{.mark}]{.underline}.85 [[It is thus imperative]{.mark} that
[the Alliance]{.mark} [actively considers and operationalizes AI
ethics]{.mark}, regardless of the degree and scope of AI integration
within NATO and its Allies. The common principles and values pronounced
in the Atlantic Treaty represent the foundations on which NATO was
built. Such principles and values -- democracy, freedom, rule of law,
individual rights, free markets -- are the bond underlying the
transatlantic community, which in fact predates the Atlantic
Alliance.]{.underline}86

[[Norms and values]{.mark} can [strongly shape the international
system]{.mark}]{.underline}.87 [[Given]{.mark} the [intense
international competition]{.mark} in the technological, military,
economic, and normative domains, [embedding democratic values into AI is
as much a strategic imperative for the Alliance as it is a functional
one]{.mark}]{.underline}.88 [[In addition to signalling to domestic
populations]{.mark} that NATO and its Allies follow through on their
commitments to uphold values as the basis of the political and military
Alliance, [incorporating AI ethics]{.mark} into the "NATO-mation" agenda
also [serves as a bulwark against]{.mark} the incursion of [unwelcome
illiberal values in the course of future technological
development.]{.mark}]{.underline}89

It is worth noting that [NATO's role in the AI ethics sphere differs
from that of many other organizations, such as national governments and
the European Union, because NATO is not a regulatory body. NATO complies
with existing laws and regulations, including the Laws of War, which
nations and the international community created.]{.underline} This means
that regulatory and normative questions such as the development and
deployment of autonomous weapons systems will not be determined at NATO
level. [Nevertheless, there is still room for NATO to play a clear role.
Indeed, [given doubts and worries about the adoption of AI for military
purposes, NATO can help generate more public support and engagement by
clearly defining ethical boundaries and moral
guidelines]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The uses of AI in military]{.mark} operations]{.underline} -- ranging
[from **[logistics]{.mark}**]{.underline} to maintenance, from
recruitment to retainment, from intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance to medical tests and medical evacuation, and more90 --
[[go beyond]{.mark} the discussions on [lethal autonomous
weapons]{.mark} systems that have dominated European debate about AI in
military affairs]{.underline}. [Accordingly, the range of ethical
questions relevant to NATO extend beyond focusing on the tip of the
spear]{.underline}. **[Seemingly mundane uses of AI]{.underline}**, such
as in human resources or decision support, **[[can]{.mark} still [pose
distinct ethical questions the Alliance should be prepared to
handle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Addressing security risks,91 minimizing
bias in systems,92 developing trust,93 and respecting privacy are
fundamental tasks for the Alliance to ensure the future effectiveness of
AI, whether in battle or in other functions.

The age of [intelligent machines requires the Alliance to reiterate its
commitment to values as new moral and ethical questions emerge, because
algorithms do not have a conscience, personal preferences or moral
agency]{.underline}. These statistical machines have no understanding of
good and bad, or fair and unjust.94 All an algorithm can do is achieve
its human-defined reward function, not provide any context or
information on whether the right question is being asked.95 Instead of
giving moral agency to algorithms, humans and organizations can view AI
as a "moral entity". This means that we humans are dutybound to adhere
to our moral code of conduct when interacting with the systems, rather
than shirking human responsibility to computers.96 At the organizational
level, this means that [the [design, development and deployment of AI
should be "ethically aligned" with the Alliance's values]{.mark} and
goals]{.underline}.97

[This is important because [AI is data-intensive, unpredictable and
brittle]{.mark}]{.underline}.98 [While a system may work well in the
context in which it was trained, [it may break in an unfamiliar
setting]{.mark}. The reliance on BD in the current second wave of ML
also creates fallibilities]{.underline},99 [given that the algorithms
can scale up harm if the data over- or under-represents certain
groups]{.underline}.100 For neural networks in particular, it may be
impossible to explain or interpret results. Some refer to this as the
"black-box" problem, meaning that the outcomes of these complex AI
systems are opaque to humans that either want to reproduce the good, or
prevent the bad from recurring. While traditional software can be
debugged to solve a performance issue, the lack of linear causality
between a programmer's inputs and the AI system's outputs means that it
is difficult to track bias and reliability. Creating organizational
processes to minimize these concerns across the AI lifecycle is critical
to responsible use of the technology.

[An]{.underline}other topical [issue is the [**private-public
partnership**]{.mark} on AI.]{.underline} **[This [is key in the AI race
between the US and China]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [possibly [leading to
disadvantages for Allies]{.mark} vis-à-vis China]{.underline} --
[[and]{.mark} in [the relations between NATO and]{.mark} major [civilian
companies working on AI and Big Data.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[the fundamental need to ensure
interoperability]{.mark} in a fragmented scenario [in]{.mark} terms of
the [Allies' adoption of AI tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**.
**[[NATO has historically been]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} player
[in]{.mark} the processes of [standardization and could be]{.mark} such
also [in this case]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this context, some
creativity may be needed: for instance, should NATO provide cloud
computing services, namely enablers, the same way it provides air-space
management or ground surveillance? Could the Alliance envision an
integration of nationally-owned AI assets as it does for the integrated
air and missile defense? These are important questions which, however,

### 2AC\-\--AT: Securitization

#### Evaluate securitization by weighing the truth claims of our advantages and the ability of our plan to solve\-\--our framework solves the impacts to securitization better than theirs\-\--securitizing objective threats to democracy is good

analysis? Towards a just securitization theory" Security Dialogue

The project of [establishing a list of criteria that can be used to
determine the moral rightness of securitization should be seen as
related to work in just war theory, where a list of criteria is used to
determine the morality of war.]{.underline} Indeed, some of my criteria
are very similar to those proposed by just war theorists. My
appropriateness-of-response criterion, broken down into measured
response and sincerity, for example, can be found in many writings on
just war, while my [requirement for the existence of an objective
existential threat is comparable to the criterion of just
cause]{.underline}. This suggests that certain things that hold true for
just war theory could also apply to a just securitization theory. At the
very least, they can be used to argue the case in favour of such a
theory, while they also suggest what kind of criticisms might be
levelled against what is attempted here.

[The greatest success of just war theory]{.underline} -- at least in the
West -- [is that it has come to inform the practice of war, as decisions
about war and how to fight it are made with reference to that
theory]{.underline}. In Michael Walzer's (2002: 933) words, '**[Moral
theory has been incorporated into war-making as a real constraint on
when and how wars are fought]{.underline}**.' A related positive
consequence has been that [just war theory has helped democratize
war-making]{.underline}, insofar as **[citizens]{.underline}** that are
**[well versed in the ideas of a just war can and repeatedly do hold
decisionmakers accountable for their actions]{.underline}**. [The outcry
of the British public over the 2003 Iraq war serves as a useful
example]{.underline}.

All **[this could hold true for a just securitization
theory]{.underline}**. [Not only does such a theory promise to morally
constrain securitization, making its occurrence less likely, but also
general knowledge of such a theory could help to democratize the process
of securitization itself.]{.underline} [Both results are desirable
because, like war]{.underline} -- [and regardless of what analysts might
wish]{.underline} -- **[securitizations are a recurrent feature of
international relations, and the abnegation of moral reflection on
securitization is simply not an option]{.underline}** (see Rengger,
2002: 363). With this in mind, I will now discuss my three criteria in
detail.

Objective existential threats [Objective existential threats are threats
to the existence of actors and orders regardless of whether anyone has
realized this.]{.underline} To give an example, suppose I am exposed to
lethal levels of radiation in an area where radiation levels are not
normally checked, which leaves my exposure undetected. Given that I can
neither smell nor see radiation, I am unlikely to be aware of it, yet my
**[obliviousness is not going to save my life.]{.underline}**

[Objective existential threats become matters of security, and therefore
'security threats', only when a powerful actor frames and responds to
them as such]{.underline}. Importantly, [not all objective existential
threats become security issues: Some are]{.underline} treated as [health
issues]{.underline}, [others]{.underline} as [police
matters]{.underline}, and [some]{.underline} may well be
[ignored]{.underline}. [The reverse also holds, and not everything that
is securitized necessarily refers to an objective existential threat;
some security threats refer to perceived threats only.]{.underline}

**[Securitization can be justified]{.underline}** as the right thing to
do only **[if it refers to an objective existential
threat]{.underline}**. This is because the killing of innocent persons
(directly or as 'collateral damage') that might well be an extraordinary
measure resulting from securitization cannot be morally justified unless
there is an objective existential threat. Once again, the storm that has
erupted over the [2003 Iraq invasion is a case in point]{.underline}.
Here, **[precisely the fact that lies about the existence of weapons of
mass destruction artificially heightened the acuteness of the threat
renders the whole endeavour and its consequences morally
untenable]{.underline}**.

[How]{.underline}, then, [can we find out whether a securitization
refers to an objective existential threat or merely to a perceived
threat]{.underline}? First, we need to [figure out whether the aggressor
really intends to destroy a given referent object]{.underline}. Second,
we need to [examine whether or not the aggressor has the
means]{.underline} (capability) [to do so]{.underline}.4 It should be
clear that **[both]{.underline}** of these **[conditions will have to be
met at the same time]{.underline}**.5 In the absence of any intention to
harm A, the capabilities of B pose no danger to A. And the absence or
lack of capabilities amounts to the same as insincerity. Insincerity in
turn renders the threat non-objective.

In line with my revision of securitization theory, outlined above, I
propose that just as we can get at the intentions of securitizing
actors, we can get at the intentions of aggressors by comparing what
they say with what they do. And, by 'doing' I mean a relevant
behavioural change made by the aggressor, or by some entity instructed
by the aggressor, in response to the threat. [Discrepancies between what
aggressors say and the actions they]{.underline} subsequently
[take]{.underline} to follow through on [a threat are vital, as they
suggest insincerity]{.underline}.

[Having assessed]{.underline} the [intentions]{.underline} of
aggressors, we need to continue by [assess]{.underline}ing their
[capabilities]{.underline}. Within a state-centric context,
traditionalists have made advances that are instructive for our
purposes. Zeev Moaz (2009), for example, assesses capabilities by
examining the level of manpower an aggressor has available for military
service, along with its weapons capability, military budget, population
size and political capacity to mobilize for national security.
[Capability assessment is easier in the context of the state, where data
are more freely available, including from independent
sources]{.underline}. In a non-state context, however, the analyst will
have to try to figure out things such as the size of the aggressor (how
many people subscribe to the cause), what the aggressor has done in the
past, what kinds of states/organizations it is friendly with, and what
we know about the latter.

To illustrate how we might proceed, let us consider the case of Al-Qaeda
and whether it poses an objective existential threat to civilians in the
West. Like most terrorist organizations, Al-Qaeda's leadership has never
made a secret of its intentions, having called on all Muslims to kill
all Americans and their allies in order to liberate Islamic countries
(Bin Laden, 2006: 296). A series of bombings/attacks provides conclusive
evidence that they are sincere, as their words are matched by actions.
These attacks also leave us with ideas about the organization's
capabilities: not only do they show ingenuity insofar as Al-Qaeda has
transformed conventional means (passenger airplanes) into weapons, they
also show that the organization's biggest capability consists of human
beings prepared to die for the cause. To summarize, as long as
Al-Qaeda's intentions do not change and as long as they are able to
recruit new potential suicide bombers, they constitute an objective
existential threat to at least some civilians in the West.

Objective existential threat analysis is not easy. Importantly,
discourse analysis of publically available texts alone may not suffice
here; instead, researchers might have to conduct interviews with
relevant people and, if possible, analyse documents that are not in the
public domain.6 Given this, it will be much easier to judge the morality
of securitizations with hindsight, when information tends to be more
freely available.

Legitimate referent objects My [second requirement for moral
securitizations is that the referent object of security is morally
legitimate]{.underline} (hereafter legitimate). **[Inspired by
consequentialism]{.underline}**, I hold that a referent object of
security is legitimate only if it is conducive to human well-being.7
[This is based on the humanistic principle that holds 'that the
explanation and justification of the goodness or badness of anything
derives ultimately from its contribution, actual or possible, to human
life and its quality']{.underline} (Raz, 1986: 194).

Note that [rather than subjective levels of 'happiness']{.underline} or
'life satisfaction', I [am interested in objective levels of
well-being]{.underline}. In Amartya Sen's terminology, [my concern is
with a person's freedom (capabilities), which leaves them in a position
'to promote or achieve objectives they value']{.underline}
(functionings) (Alkire, 2002: 4). What matters, in short, is the
capability to flourish.

There is, however, no consensus among the many people who have devised
lists of capabilities/ human needs/human values (see Alkire, 2002:
78--84). But, it seems to me that different human needs (the term I
prefer) are either more or less basic to well-being. Among the most
basic of all human needs is the one that enables us to function as
humans (Doyal and Gough, 1991). But, what is it to be human? James
Griffin (2008: 32) offers a convincing answer when he suggests that what
makes us human, and thus different from other sentient creatures, is the
ability to make autonomous decisions: Human life is different from the
life of other animals. We humans have a conception of ourselves and our
past and future. We reflect and assess. We form pictures of what the
good life would be.... And we try to realise these pictures. \[Our
status as human beings\] centres on our being agents -- deliberating,
assessing, choosing, and acting to make what we see as a good life for
ourselves.

Importantly, however, autonomy is not exclusively internal to the agent.
Rather, [different political regimes and structures are more or less
good at encouraging and fostering autonomous behaviour]{.underline}
(Doyal and Gough, 1991). Joseph Raz (1986: 391) puts it as follows: a
person lives autonomously if he conducts himself in a certain way ...
and lives in a certain environment, an environment which respects the
condition of independence, and furnishes him with an adequate range of
options. In other words, in the absence of the necessary options I
cannot lead an autonomous life, which is why autonomy is not only what
makes us human but simultaneously a basic human need that must be
satisfied if the objective is well-being.

[The two ideas that have contributed most to providing individuals with
options and therefore autonomy are liberal democracy and human rights.
The latter foster autonomy by their very nature: they are based on the
principle of the equality of all people, which entails that everyone is
entitled to live a life of their own choosing, provided of course that
this life does not infringe upon anyone else's life choices]{.underline}
(Donnelly, 1998: 44). It is also widely acknowledged that [liberal
democracy is intimately connected with autonomy, as liberal democracies
are inseparable from certain individual liberties, including the right
to free speech and the right to vote]{.underline} (Waldron, 2002; see
also Dahl, 1998; Raz, 1986).

Such normative arguments are [backed by empirical evidence]{.underline},
as [it has been conclusively shown that liberal democracies]{.underline}
generally [do better than non-democracies in terms of providing people
with the conditions and options that foster autonomy, including
education, physical security, meaningful employment and economic
security]{.underline} (Przeworski et al., 2000; Doyal and Gough, 1991).
It is, hence, possible to argue, for example, that none of the North
African states experiencing popular uprisings in the spring of 2011
qualifies as a legitimate referent object of security, precisely because
those uprisings have been based on demands for democracy, economic
security and respect for human rights.

To summarize, [the moral rightness of securitization is in part a
function of the legitimacy of the referent object, and legitimacy in
turn is a function of the referent object being conducive to human
well-being. Well-being is highest and most sustainably ensured in
liberal democracies and when actors endorse human rights. The presence
of liberal democracy and the honouring of human rights therefore serve
as helpful indicators of human well-being in any given
context]{.underline}.

Appropriateness of response The distinguishing characteristic of
securitization is that it justifies the breaking of established rules
and regulations in an effort to ensure the referent object's survival.
To achieve the desired goal, the emergency measures taken may even be
extraordinary in nature. If our [concern is with the morality of
securitization]{.underline}, however, **[even]{.underline}** the
response **[to objective existential threats is not free from
requirements]{.underline}**. [There are two such
requirements:]{.underline} The **[first]{.underline}** is that [the
degree of response must be measured to the threat in
question]{.underline}. [Not even the existence of objective existential
threats automatically justifies a response that is equal to the action
of the aggressor in both means and degree.]{.underline} A response is
measured if it takes account of the capabilities of the aggressor.
Depending on those capabilities, a measured response could be either
more severe than the initial attack/threat or less so. One example of a
measured response was Operation 'Deny Flight', when the UN Security
Council imposed and NATO enforced a no-fly zone to protect civilians
from aerial bombings during the Bosnian war (1992--5).

[The second requirement is that the response must **genuinely aim at
addressing the threat**]{.underline}. The securitizing actor must
seriously intend to secure the referent object they themselves
identified. Securitization does not necessarily benefit the referent
object but can instead benefit the agent, as when the securitizing actor
uses securitization to further his or her own ends with no intention of
safeguarding the referent object of security (Floyd, 2010). We can [test
for]{.underline} the [intentions]{.underline} of securitizing actors [by
examining whether or not a securitization is consistent in its own
terms.]{.underline} This is [done by comparing and contrasting what a
securitizing actor says about a particular threat (securitizing move)
with what they do in response to that threat (security
practice).]{.underline} [The securitizing actor is sincere only if the
response matches the securitizing move]{.underline}. An example where
this was not the case is provided by US environmental security policy
under the Clinton administrations. The administrations indentified
environmental security threats as acute, yet what was done in the name
of environmental security barely addressed any of the threats. Indeed,
the real beneficiary of such policies was the US national security
establishment, not the American people, which was the stated referent
object of security (Floyd, 2010: 118).

Postulating what we should be worried about is certainly one way of
conducting normative security theory. Yet, there are other forms of
normative analysis, and in this article I am offering a set of
[[criteria]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[permit the analyst to evaluate
whether a particular securitization is]{.underline}]{.mark} or was
morally right/[[justifiable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Inspired by just war
theory, where it is argued that, among other criteria, a just cause and
the right intention determine the morality of war, I argue that [there
are three criteria that determine the moral rightness of
securitization]{.underline}: [**(1)** **there must be [an objective
existential threat]{.mark}**, which is to say a threat that endangers
the survival of a an actor or an order regardless of whether anyone has
realized this]{.underline}; (2) [[the referent object of
security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[must be]{.underline}]{.mark} morally
legitimate, which is the case only when the referent object is
[[**conducive to**]{.mark} human **[well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline}
defined as the satisfaction of human needs; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
(3) [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [security **[response must be
appropriate]{.mark}** to the threat in question]{.underline}, [which is
to say that (a) the security response must be measured in accordance
with the capabilities of the aggressor and (b) the securitizing actor
must be sincere in]{.underline} his or her [intentions]{.underline}. I
argue that a securitization is morally right only if all three of the
above criteria are fulfilled at the same time. I also argue that a
securitization theory complemented by a normative extension of this type
would enable analysts to hold securitizing actors accountable, which
would render the theory more policy relevant than is currently the case.

It is, however, not possible to extend the Copenhagen School's original
version of securitization theory by the aforementioned three criteria,
as that theory precludes objective threat assessment and the School
rejects the theorization of securitizing actors' intentions. In short,
original securitization theory cannot be used in normative analysis in
the exact way suggested in this article; rather, my three criteria
represent a further development of the revised securitization theory
that I have developed elsewhere (Floyd, 2010). Given that it will
feature as part of the argument set forth in this article, it will be
useful to briefly recite my revision here.

[My revised version of securitization theory was informed by the central
insight that a **[securitization cannot simultaneously operate as
a]{.mark}n illocutionary [speech act and be dependent on the speech
act's acceptance]{.mark} by the relevant audience, because the
illocution denies a meaningful role for the audience**]{.underline}
(Balzacq, 2005; Stritzel, 2007). [My solution]{.underline} to this
conundrum [was to **[bracket the audience from]{.mark} the
[securitization]{.mark} process**]{.underline}.1 This can be done
because [[the audience is not]{.mark} an [analytical]{.mark} concept,
[but]{.mark} rather a [normative]{.mark} concept in analytical
disguise,]{.underline} which is to say that [[it does not stem from
actual empirical observation of how politics operates but rather
from]{.underline}]{.mark} Ole Wæver's view of [how politics, including
[security policy, should be done]{.mark}]{.underline} (Floyd, 2010: 50).
Moreover, **[[the idea that securitization operates like a]{.mark}n
illocutionary [speech act]{.mark} also [conflicts with the
distinction]{.mark} often made by members of the School [between a
securitizing move]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a complete
[securitization]{.mark}, [because if]{.mark} it is '[the utterance
itself]{.mark} that [is the act']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Buzan et al.,
1998: 26) **[[then the speech]{.mark} act [is tantamount to]{.mark} the
[complete securitization and any distinction
redundant]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In an effort [to uphold this
distinction]{.underline}, I suggested that [**[it is not securitization
that is an illocution]{.underline}**; **[rather, it is the securitizing
move alone that is the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[illocutionary [speech
act]{.mark} part of securitization.]{.underline}** I argued that [[by
framing an issue in]{.mark} security mode (in [terms of an existential
threat]{.mark} and a point of no return), the securitizing actor does
something insofar as]{.underline} he or she issues [a warning to the
aggressor and/or promises protection to the referent object of
security]{.underline}. A **[[securitization is complete only if the
warning]{.mark}/promise [made in the speech act is followed up by a
change in relevant behaviour by a relevant agent]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(the securitizing actor or someone instructed by the same) **[that is
justified by this agent with reference to the declared
threat]{.underline}**. [I called this]{.underline} second step [security
practice]{.underline}. My revised securitization theory
[thus]{.underline} holds that **[[securitization = securitizing move +
security practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Floyd, 2010: 52--4)

One advantage of this revision is [that]{.underline} it [makes it
possible to examine whether a securitizing actor is
sincere.]{.underline} [That is, do particular actors really intend to
safeguard the referent objects of security they have themselves
identified or did they securitize the given objects for different
reasons altogether]{.underline}? [The key to uncovering sincerity is to
examine whether the rhetoric of the speech act is matched by subsequent
security practice]{.underline}. Otherwise [inexplicable discrepancy
suggests insincerity]{.underline},2 [while continuity suggests
sincerity]{.underline}.

Another advantage is that **[my revised securitization theory
[reject]{.mark}s [the idea that language has securitizing
force]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Consequently]{.underline}, under my
framework, [[the analyst remains]{.mark} functionally [distinct from the
securitizing actor]{.mark} at all times, including when]{.underline} he
or she [performs [a securitizing move,]{.mark} **which [amounts to
nothing more than a warning]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 And, [[while it
is]{.mark} of course [possible]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} security [analyst
can convince decisionmakers]{.mark}]{.underline} of his or her opinion,
**[[even this does not make the analyst]{.mark} synonymous with [the
securitizing actor,]{.mark} [because]{.mark} under my framework
[securitization exists not at the point of the speech]{.mark} act [but
only when a relevant actor changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** his or her own
**[[behaviour in response to the existential threat
justification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [With the analyst [not]{.mark}
involved in [securitization every]{.mark} time]{.underline} he or she
[makes a [normative argument]{.mark}, my revised securitization theory
**[offers a better starting point for normative analysis]{.mark}** than
the original formulation.]{.underline}

[Although [my revised securitization theory]{.mark}]{.underline} [rivals
original securitization theory insofar as it builds on a different
understanding of what securitization means, it too [aims to enable
analysts to examine the process of securitization]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In short, it too is an analytical security theory. The just
securitization theory proposed here, however, is altogether different:
it is a normative theory that aims to enable analysts to judge the moral
rightness of any given securitization.

While the three criteria I propose are incompatible with original
securitization theory, [the idea of developing criteria by which
securitization can be judged is]{.underline} not. This is the case
[because what I propose retains the functional distinction between the
securitizing actor]{.underline} -- [the actor who makes the decision on
what is securitized]{.underline} -- [and the security
analyst]{.underline} -- [who merely sets the criteria for when an issue
is securitized]{.underline}. If the securitization analyst can set
criteria for the existence of securitization and its success, there is
no reason why he or she should not also be able to set criteria that
determine the moral rightness of securitization.

#### Only our framework determines the ballot\-\--their kritik without our criteria is just an FYI\-\--securitization analysis solves better than desecuritization

Rita **Floyd 11**, Department of Politics and International Studies,
University of Warwick. "Can securitization theory be used in normative
analysis? Towards a just securitization theory" Security Dialogue
42(4-5) 427--439 //pipk

Another more general critique that could be advanced against what is
proposed here is that a normative extension of securitization theory
confuses the aim of original securitization theory, which is to enable
analysts to examine how securitization plays out in practice. While the
latter is indeed quite different from what I am trying to achieve here,
it is also the case that [my argument sits neatly within a wider
'securitization studies', the realm wherein the securitization theorist
can move from **merely observing** what is going on to **making
normative recommendations**]{.underline} (Taureck, 2006: 59--60). The
latter is desirable because [it may not always be satisfying to end
one's analysis without a word regarding the moral rightness of the
securitization one has spent (often considerable) time
researching.]{.underline} In any case, **[having an informed opinion on
the rightness of a political decision is better than silence, which
could be mistaken for approval]{.underline}**.

[There are reasons to believe that the Copenhagen School would concur
with such a view]{.underline}. This is most clearly evinced by the fact
that they do not feel obliged to agree with all or any securitization.
Indeed, '**[one of the purposes of \[the securitization\] approach
should be that it becomes possible to evaluate whether one finds it good
or bad to securitize a certain issue']{.underline}** (Buzan et al.,
1998: 34). This suggests that although the School's view of security
politics is considered 'neutral' (Buzan and Hansen, 2009: 38),
**[normative evaluation is]{.underline}** considered **[desirable, even
necessary,]{.underline}** and indeed a normative preference can be found
in most of its members' writings.

A key reason why this is the case is that [under securitization theory
language is believed to have securitizing force, which is to say that
the securitization analyst simply by writing or speaking about security
brings about securitization]{.underline} (Huysmans, 1999). [The latter
is problematic for the analyst, given that securitization can be abused
by ethically undesirable groups]{.underline}. It [is only natural that
the securitization analyst will want to distance]{.underline} him- or
herself from [furthering the causes of such groups, and that can be done
only by making a normative statement about the securitization in
question.]{.underline} [Members]{.underline} of the Copenhagen School
[do this by challenging all securitizations as negative developments,
because in their view securitization leads to de-democratization and
potentially a multiplication of the number of security dilemmas found in
the world]{.underline}. In response to such negative developments, the
securitization analyst is meant to point out that securitization is
always a political choice and that actors should solve their differences
by ordinary political means. In short, the School advocates
desecuritization, the process whereby formerly securitized issues move
back into the sphere of normal politics, where they are dealt with by
ordinary measures once more.

Objection 5: Desecuritization is an appropriate normative strategy The
Copenhagen School's [preference for desecuritization]{.underline},
however, [is]{.underline} somewhat more [nuanced]{.underline} than the
previous section might suggest. [After all, its members hold that
desecuritization is better only 'if all other things are equal', while
they also recognize that this is not often the case and that the
mobilization power inherent in securitization can be used for good
ends]{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998: 29). Nevertheless, these
important qualifications do not change the fact that on a level playing
field desecuritization is the School's preferred option.

[I take issue with the claim that desecuritization is better in
principle for two reasons]{.underline}: first, **[desecuritization does
not necessarily lead to politicization]{.underline}** (Floyd, 2010: 57);
second, from a moral point of view, '**[desecuritization as
politicization' is not necessarily preferable to 'desecuritization as
depoliticization']{.underline}** (Floyd, 2007: 343n56).

Desecuritization as a normative strategy is problematic for yet a third
reason. [Informed by the observation that there are no objective
security threats, desecuritization as a normative strategy works by
depriving securitizing actors of the ability to 'hide behind the claim
that anything in itself constitutes a security issue']{.underline}
(Buzan et al., 1998: 34). Accordingly, [why should actors be allowed to
turn anything into a security issue if it can be shown that there are no
security threats per se, and that all security threats exist in the
securitizing actor's own head (and, later, in the heads of the relevant
audience)?]{.underline} The Copenhagen School's **[preoccupation with
security operating in this way and no other, however, has left its
members blind to the fact that while there may be no objective security
threats, there still exist objective existential threats]{.underline}**
(see Balzacq, 2005: 181). **[Consequently, they cannot see that a
securitization that refers to an objective existential threat is
distinct from one that refers to a perceived threat only, and that some
such threats are best addressed in security mode]{.underline}**.

Conclusion It has been the aim of this article to [develop
securitization theory in such a way that securitization analysts can
normatively evaluate securitizations without assuming the role of the
securitizing actor and without postulating what we should be worried
about]{.underline}. I have argued that [setting criteria that determine
the moral **rightness of securitization** is akin to the Copenhagen
School setting criteria that determine both the **existence of
securitization** and its success]{.underline}.

I have further argued that [the strict]{.underline} confines of the
Copenhagen School's [version of securitization theory necessitate a move
away from this original securitization theory to a revised version that
holds that securitization = securitizing move (existential threat
justification that amounts to no more than a warning or a promise) +
security practice (a change of relevant behaviour by a relevant agent
that is justified by this agent with reference to the declared
threat).]{.underline} The revision was necessary [because, in order to
examine the moral rightness of securitization, the analyst must: (1)
establish whether or not existential threats are objectively present;
(2) examine both the intentions of aggressors and those of securitizing
actors; and (3) identify universal values that determine the referent
object's moral legitimacy]{.underline}. Members of the Copenhagen School
would be deeply uncomfortable with all parts of this analysis, as they
go against some of the fundamental principles and beliefs underlying
original securitization theory, as well as some of the intellectual
ancestors of the theory (see Floyd, 2010: 9--23).

I have also argued that a **[just securitization]{.underline}** theory
**[of the kind proposed here renders securitization theory more policy
relevant, and that such a theory has the potential to democratize the
process of securitization]{.underline}**. But one look at the many
writings and further theorizations of the role and nature of the
audience suggests that such [democratization is deemed desirable by many
scholars working on securitization theory.]{.underline}

Beyond this, I would also suggest that a **[just
securitization]{.underline}** theory [has implications for security
studies more generally]{.underline}. [Securitization theory has
established itself as one of the most influential non-traditional
security theories in existence]{.underline}. [The idea that security
is]{.underline} a [self-referential]{.underline} practice, the related
[rejection of objective threat assessment, and]{.underline} not least
the [preference for desecuritization]{.underline} have
[meant]{.underline} that [securitization theory is often classified as
part of the post-structuralist end of critical security studies, yet in
its original formulation the theory is conceived as a third way between
critical and traditional security studies]{.underline} (Buzan et al.,
1998: 203--12). Notably, at its less extreme end, critical security
studies includes objectivist formulations of security -- for example,
the one proposed by the Welsh School. A [just
securitization]{.underline} theory [invites both traditionalists
(because of the inclusion of objective existential threats) and those at
the moderate end of critical security studies]{.underline} (the Welsh
School's concept of emancipation is similar to my formulation of human
well-being as satisfaction of human needs)11 [back to the table, making
securitization theory attractive to a wider audience]{.underline}.
Whether any of these theorists will become interested in the ideas of
securitization theory remains to be seen; for certain is that just as
just war theory is increasingly complemented by arguments for postwar
justice (jus post bellum), a just securitization theory will have to be
complemented by criteria that determine just desecuritization.

### 1AR\-\--AT: Securitization

#### Solves runaway securitization by the state

University of Warwick. "Can securitization theory be used in normative
analysis? Towards a just securitization theory" Security Dialogue

Just war theory has attracted both endorsement and criticism. One of the
most pertinent criticisms is that it moralizes war, making it easier to
fight. In the light of the 'war on terror', Anthony Burke (2004: 330),
for example, has argued that 'moral discourses \[including just war
theory\] are part of the warrior's political armoury; they are part of
war's machinery, not a rod in its wheels'. A similar objection could
conceivably be advanced against a just securitization theory. It might
be argued that such a theory moralizes securitization, making it easier
to exclude and marginalize minorities and control populations. Some
scholars already hold that securitization is a process of deliberate
'insecuritization'. Didier Bigo (2001: 111), for example, has argued
that security is in no sense a reflection of an increase of threats in
the contemporary epoch -- it is a lowering of the level of acceptability
of the other; it is an attempt at insecuritization of daily life by the
security professionals and an increase in the strengths of police
potential for action.

I hold against this first objection that my criteria are robust enough
to protect against the abuse of securitization. Note that the
insecuritization argument has largely been advanced with a view to
migrants in the European Union (Bigo and Guild, 2005; Huysmans, 2006);
yet, crucially, under my framework even high levels of migration do not
qualify as objective existential threats because the element of
intentionality is missing. In the case of migration, we are not even
dealing with a collective actor, but with lots of different people and
their individual decisions. Intentionality would come into consideration
only in the highly unlikely event that one state, perhaps after failing
to provide for its own people, would urge or perhaps even pay its own
people to emigrate en masse to another state. Under such circumstances,
immigration might then become an objective existential threat to the
receiving state.

#### Securitization framework\-\--evaluate securitization debates using three criteria\-\-\--1. Is the threat real, 2. Do we solve the threat and 3. Is the strategy we endorse non-escalatory

[While securitization studies have paid considerable attention to the
moral value of]{.underline} **[desecuritization]{.underline}**, [they
have paid almost **no attention** to the morality of
**securitization**]{.underline}. In this article, I attempt to [rectify
that]{.underline} situation [by proposing a revision of securitization
theory that specifies **three criteria** that]{.underline} -- [if
fulfilled at the same time]{.underline} -- [would render a
securitization morally right]{.underline}. [The criteria are: (1) that
there is an objective existential threat; (2) that the referent object
of security is morally legitimate; and (3) that the security response is
appropriate to the threat in question.]{.underline} Although what is
suggested here is considerably removed from the Copenhagen School's
original securitization theory, it is akin to **[that
framework]{.underline}** insofar as it **[retains the functional
distinction between the security analyst and the securitizing
actor.]{.underline}** Indeed, the development of criteria that determine
the moral rightness of securitization is analogous to the Copenhagen
School's devising criteria that determine both the existence and the
success of securitization.

[The US defense sector]{.underline} [and the EU]{.underline}340 [have
separately recognized the importance of AI innovation and
adoption]{.underline}. [The D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense'[s]{.underline} 2018 National Defense Strategy
[recognizes the need for the Department to modernize its programs and
address changing threats posed by new technologies like
AI]{.underline}.341 [The accompanying DOD]{.underline}
**[A]{.underline}**rtificial **[I]{.underline}**ntelligence [Strategy
stressed that AI will change "the character of the future battlefield
and the pace of threats" the US will face]{.underline}. Therefore, [the
AI Strategy outlined the need to develop and adopt AI to strengthen the
DOD's capabilities, enhance and streamline businesses processes through
AI and ML applications, cultivate its AI workforce, engage with industry
and allies to enhance capabilities and security, and lead in military
ethics around AI]{.underline}.342 To lead defense-related AI efforts,
[the DOD created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center]{.underline}
(JAIC) in 2018 to: 1) accelerate the operationalization and adoption of
AI across the DOD, 2) establish a "common foundation" to enable the DOD
to scale AI's impact, 3) coordinate the DOD's AI priorities, and 4)
attract and foster leading AI talent.343 The US has undertaken extensive
AI and ML-related R&D and, as mentioned in the United States Government
Funding section, defense-related AI R&D appears344 to be larger than
non-defense AI R&D. For example, DARPA's AI Next Campaign---launched in
2018---focuses on improving the security, robustness, and reliability of
AI and ML while decreasing the required computing resources, while its
Artificial Intelligence Exploration (AIE) funds academia and small
industry for high-risk, high-reward projects.345

**[The EU is less advanced in developing an AI strategy for the defense
sector]{.underline}**. [This broadly stems from its comparatively more
nascent defense industry and differing opinions between EU Member States
on AI's defense applications.]{.underline} In 2017, the EU established
the European Defense Fund (EDF) and the Permanent Structured Cooperation
(PESCO) to bolster its security, defense industry, and strategic
autonomy.346 EDF and PESCO, as Ulrike Franke, Policy Fellow at European
Council on Foreign Relations explains, are vehicles to establish greater
European defense collaboration, but these vehicles are not as developed
or unified as other defense cooperative mechanisms or alliances like
NATO.347 Furthermore, European Member States disagree about the role AI
should play in the defense sector, with some countries extremely averse
to the idea of developing lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) given
the trope of the "killer robot."348

[Joint US-EU defense-related AI efforts appear sparse]{.underline},349
**[however there is a growing push particularly from the US and NATO to
increase transatlantic defense cooperation on AI.]{.underline}** [The
aforementioned DOD]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence [Strategy
stressed the importance the US and allied partners to "maintain its
strategic position to prevail in future battlefields and safeguard a
free and open international order]{.underline}."350 [Growing Chinese and
Russia aggression and weaponization of new technologies like AI is a
central motivation for the US government's push to strengthen the
international AI alliance]{.underline}.351 Acting Director of JAIC Nand
Mulchandani explains that [collaboration with European partners on AI is
necessary for three main reasons]{.underline}. [First, joint AI R&D and
adoption efforts are important for developing strong capabilities and
bolstering transatlantic hard power. Second, leading AI
capabilities\--among the US and its allies\--acts as a deterrent for
conflict. Third, if deterrence fails, AI-related interoperability and
capabilities are necessary if the US and its allies must go to
war]{.underline}. [A military alliance cannot be lopsided and unequal AI
adoption may hinder the tactical aspects of conflic]{.underline}t.352
During the already mentioned recent visit to NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Former Director of the JAIC Lt. Gen. Shanahan had
collaborative engagements with European allies and NATO around the
importance of AI joint efforts, ensuring military interoperability, and
the convergence of Europe's AI ethical principles with the DOD's five
principles of AI ethics.353 The visit appeared to increase NATO's focus
on devising an AI strategy for the Alliance.354 Despite these positive
steps, there are still concerns about potential obstacles to increased
defense collaboration, particularly around IP ownership and funding
restrictions that may exclude US involvement in EDF and PESCO.355, 356

Overall, as noted in the US-EU roadmap for S&T, the volume and intensity
of transatlantic scientific and technology collaboration has increased
since the 1990s. Most notably, it has blossomed in areas where
interests--- whether strategic, societal, or economic---of both sides of
the Atlantic overlap (e.g., in the health, environmental sciences, and
energy sectors). However, [in the case of AI there seems to be a large
imbalance between the level, intensity, and volume of cooperation
relative to the importance of AI. Indeed, both the US and the EU
recognize AI's transformative potential and share interests in its
development and deployment. Yet transatlantic cooperation on AI is still
its infancy---at least compared to other technological sectors. As a
result, it has plenty of room to grow. Deepening this collaboration will
not only require proactive efforts but also strategic endeavors to
overcome the existing underlying challenges to
collaboration]{.underline}.

Rationale: [High-quality, diverse data,]{.underline} as Acting Director
of the JAIC Nand Mulchandani explains, [enables better training and
development of algorithms and reliable AI]{.underline}. The
defense-sector ([NATO) would benefit from diverse data collected by many
countries. It is difficult to reduce the timeline to properly collect,
organize, store, and develop governance mechanisms around data.
Therefore]{.underline}, Acting Director Mulchandani explains, [it is
important for the US, the EU, and NATO to begin data-sharing efforts as
soon as possible to prevent future obstacles]{.underline}.423 [However,
defense data-sharing efforts, as Ulrike Esther Franke explains, are
difficult to initiate because of sensitivities around data, particularly
around military operations. **It may therefore be easier to establish
data-sharing efforts centralized around** solving a discrete question or
**achieving a specific goal**]{.underline}.424

[The US and the EU should remove obstacles to sharing defense and
intelligence-related data where appropriate. They should also fund and
prioritize addressing challenges to data sharing through
NATO.]{.underline} [Efforts should begin immediately as data sharing and
governance projects are often lengthy undertakings. Projects focused on
achieving a specific, concrete goal should lay the groundwork for
larger-scale, general efforts.]{.underline}

Arms control. [There have been various calls to adapt different types of
arms control regime to AI. Reciprocity, monitoring and compliance pose
key challenges here. How can we trust countries that have not complied
with existing arms control regimes to respect new ones? How can we
convince countries that do not want to enter existing arms control
regimes to join new ones? Cooperation,]{.underline} political scientists
note, is [a matter of interest and trust: any control regime not built
on these two pillars is doomed to fail]{.underline}.269 **[At this
stage, it is difficult to find the political conditions conducive to
either]{.underline}**. There is, however, an additional problem.

Weapons or technology control? [Lethal autonomous weapons are a type of
military equipment which is hence subjected to clear and existing rules
and regulations -- both domestic and international -- related to the
sale, export and transfer of military technology]{.underline}. The key
argument for banning lethal autonomous weapons, however, builds on a
different logic: the dual-use nature of the constituent technologies
favors its swift, and to some extent subtle, diffusion. In terms of
inputs, the AI Inputs Triad is based on algorithms, data and
microprocessors -- although human capital should not be
underestimated.270 [Banning the weapons without underlying controlling
the technology risks being ineffective, at best, and counterproductive,
at worst, as it may increase the incentives to countries or actors to
source key component technologies and undertake research on their
integration so as to neutralize the effects of a ban]{.underline}.

Technology control regime. [The above discussion on the dual-use nature
of the AI Input Triad has led some to recommend tight control regimes on
the export of AI-related technologies. While there is an obviously
strong rationale for this line of thinking, its very ease of execution
brings its own risks]{.underline}.271 **[NATO Allies admittedly have a
strong interest in preserving international stability and preventing
malicious actors from possessing capabilities that may be conducive to
destabilizing activities. However, NATO Allies are in this position
because of their technological prowess: any export control regime should
therefore take into account the possible effects on the Allies'
industrial base and their longerterm implications]{.underline}**. [Were
NATO Allies to lose their technological primacy, their political power
-- including the capacity to restrict the spread of sensitive
technologies -- would be undermined. In this respect, it is useful to
divide the discussion into the component items conceptualized in the AI
Input Triad -- data, algorithms and processors.]{.underline}

Commercial technology and public goods. [A common theme in discussions
about AI is the role of private industry. The story goes that the
commercial sector is leading in innovation on AI, and that the defence
establishment,]{.underline} in contrast to the Cold War, [thus needs to
adapt to the needs and capabilities of the private sector, rather than
the other way around]{.underline}.240 While defence establishments would
certainly do well to shed some bureaucratic deadweight that constrains
them from following the "lean"241 or "agile"242 ways of the commercial
sector, [it is problematic to import private-sector assumptions and
practices as this line of thinking suggests]{.underline}.243 [Namely,
market forces do not always and necessarily lead to the social optimum:
markets sometimes lead to the under-provision of public goods such as
national defence, because of the inherent difficulty of charging all
potential beneficiaries]{.underline}. Similarly, [markets may favour the
overproduction of negative externalities like pollution, because
producers bear only a tiny fraction of the total cost. We observe these
dynamics of market failure when we look at AI-related R&D by private
companies]{.underline}. First, [corporate R&D generally has a narrow,
short-term focus, to the detriment of broader, longerterm issues which
are necessary for ensuring that AI yields positive returns in the
distant future]{.underline}.244 [Second, the computer intensiveness of
ML is technically, economically and environmentally
unsustainable]{.underline}.245 In particular, [nobody has mastered how
to properly size ML models and modern deep-learning algorithms are based
on over-parametrization. This means their performance is inherently
inefficient, in that they need an enormous amount of data and
parameters. The cost comes in terms of computing resources.
Realistically, existing trends are not sustainable]{.underline}.246
**[NATO]{.underline}** and its Allies **[have operational and strategic
incentives to promote leaner and greener AI]{.underline}**.
Operationally, there is a limit to the utility of computationally
intensive AI systems "at the edge" -- i.e., usage by small units in
operations where connectivity is not assured.247 Strategically,
correcting cases of market failure enhances technological prowess
insofar as it means promoting broader, longerterm research on AI and the
development of less computationally intensive solutions not only for ML,
but also for other technological priorities such as quantum248 and
aspects of biotechnology. Moreover, weaning ML models off massive
training data is one measure of AI becoming more robust,249 and thus
potentially less susceptible to data-driven biases.250 Procurement. R&D
will, sooner or later, lead to procurement programmes. Transitioning AI
into prevailing procurement paradigms, however, will not be immediate or
easy. Defence procurement is particularly complex, given the range of
strict requirements and specifications with which contractors have to
comply.251 This is why traditional weapons manufacturers generally have
an advantage when it comes to approaching defence buyers.252 AI,
however, will entail a paradigm shift because the capabilities will
continuously evolve. For AI-enabled autonomous systems in particular, as
mentioned above, decision-making is "non-deterministic" and depends on
the "dynamic environment" in which the system operates.253 This means
that "traditional development and procurement approaches, based on
full-path regression, are unfit".254 This means that R&D also continues
in the product deployment phase, as data and algorithms keep providing
information and feedback that have to be integrated in order to achieve
initial operational capabilities. Current "waterfall" procurement
paradigms are set up so that engineers test prototypes according to
defined specifications, and then subsequently move to production.255
With machine learning, the specifications will keep evolving as
algorithms are fed new data.256 By extension, this means that testing
cannot be treated as a singular phase prior to production and
development. For NATO Allies, a more iterative procurement paradigm that
does not depend on the sequential "waterfall" entails unique challenges.
The integration of enterprise AI requires specific technical, legal, and
organizational capabilities. This is linked to human-capital challenges
in requirements, procurement and operations communities, as
organizations leveraging AI "need their own people who know how to
structure the problem, handle the data, and stay aware of evolving
opportunities".257 The development of AI-centred major weapon systems
similarly calls for reform, or at least a remarkable adaptation, of
defence procurement.258 Significant political, organizational and human
capital will have to be invested. This is an additional reason why a
centre such as the proposed A3IC could support the transition, through
best practices, lessons learned and similar initiatives. Supply chain.
Ben Buchanan has conceptualized AI inputs as a triad: algorithms, data
and processors.259 Processors are the material part of the triad and
they pose a key supply chain vulnerability.260 NATO as an organization
has neither the capabilities nor the authority to strengthen the AI
supply chain. Additionally, the supply chain is heavily skewed towards
some Allies, like the US and Great Britain in semiconductors or the
Netherlands in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and partners, like
Israel, South Korea and Japan -- plus Taiwan, which is a close ally of
several NATO countries.261 A useful exercise for the Alliance could be
to make an assessment of the supply chain related to semiconductors.
This is important for three main reasons. First, several Allies are
conducting their own assessments, but an Alliance-wide picture is so far
lacking.262 Second, as several countries consider semiconductors a
strategic industry and thus aim at achieving a degree of selfsufficiency
and autonomy, there is a real risk that different national strategies
may collide, thus leaving the Alliance as a whole worse off. Last, but
not least, such an assessment could be helpful in determining potential
joint or common solutions, including arms control and export controls,
as discussed in the next chapter, as well as coordination in R&D
investments.

[One of the main tasks of NATO is to facilitate military
collaboration]{.underline} between member states.
[Traditionally]{.underline}, NC3O has focused on [interoperability
and]{.underline} on ways to support headquarters with C2-systemens to
facilitate [cooperation]{.underline}. [The international trend of hyper
connectivity and globalization in combination with the requirement of
collaboration at tactical levels, make a shift towards interoperable
support of tactical commanders paramount]{.underline}. [STO can provide
nations and NC3O with insights in new possibilities of emerging
technologies to support the commanders.]{.underline}

Furthermore, technology for big data and [AI is currently developing at
a fast pace, with major potential impact on both the strategic,
operational and tactical military decision making
processes]{.underline}. [As such, the military operational benefits may
be huge and diverse.]{.underline} Ho[wever, the full potential cannot
(yet) be overseen and will have to be established over time. Moreover,
these new technologies not only have potential benefits, but also
short-comings and risks that need to be assessed, and for which possible
mitigating countermeasures have to be identified.]{.underline}

Notwithstanding these uncertainties, [it is now considered time to act
within the NATO Research and Innovation community, so as to be well
prepared for upcoming developments.]{.underline} Several [advanced civil
applications of AI have emerged over the last few years, and adaptation
of these innovations is growing rapidly]{.underline}. Examples are
autonomous vehicles, personal assistants such as Apple's Siri, software
for "predictive policing" and "cognitive computing" solutions such as
IBM Watson \[1\]. [But invariably these applications have
restrictions]{.underline}. For example, personal assistants mainly act
as voice-activated intermediary between web-based services and the user.
Autonomous vehicles only perform optimally in uncluttered, ordered
environments. Cognitive computing requires access to sufficiently
structured big data and extensive (preparatory) work by experts to train
the system and integrate different modules for e.g. reasoning,
predictive modeling and machine learning.

[For military applications, there are important requirements that may
render civilian technologies unsuitable or demand changes in
implementations]{.underline}. [Systems have to work in a context that is
highly unstructured and unpredictable, and with opponents that
deliberately try to disrupt or deceive them. Ethical and legal issues
will often play a major role. Hence, defense organizations have to make
difficult choices because they must, on the one hand, benefit from the
rapid civil developments while, on the other hand, choose wisely where
to invest to make sure that applications will be fit for military use.
Furthermore, the question is whether they are on the right track in
enabling the trend/evolution towards big data and AI with their current
developments of the data and IT infrastructures.]{.underline}

Ethical AI is Key to Future Interoperability\"
<https://cepa.org/nato-leadership-on-ethical-ai-is-key-to-future-interoperability/>
//pipk

**[Establishing NATO ethical AI principles is the first step toward both
technical and political alignment]{.underline}**.

In October 2020, [Deputy Secretary General of NATO]{.underline} Mircea
Geoană [highlighted the benefits of establishing a "transatlantic
community cooperating on Artificial Intelligence]{.underline} (AI)." The
Deputy Head of [NATO's Innovation Unit followed with a commitment to its
responsible use]{.underline}. The US Department of Defense ([DoD)
adopted Ethical Principles for AI in 2020 and has committed to bringing
together NATO member and partners to operationalize these
principles]{.underline}. **[Despite these statements and developments,
more work is required to tackle the very real challenge that ethical AI
will pose to future interoperability within NATO.]{.underline}**

**[Without a NATO-led initiative focused on aligning these ethical
principles across the Alliance, the interoperability risk of nations
fielding AI-based systems that hinder joint operations is high. As the
foremost security framework for Europe and North America, as well as the
leading defense alliance for promoting and protecting democratic values,
NATO is able to facilitate alignment on this issue.]{.underline}** As
part of a broader strategy on emerging and disruptive technologies,
**[NATO must prioritize ethical AI if it wishes to promote the shared
values upon which it was founded, play a key role in facilitating
innovation across the Atlantic, and ultimately retain the ability of its
members to undertake joint operations]{.underline}**.

[Establishing NATO ethical AI principles is the first step toward both
technical and political alignment, in turn enhancing and fostering
interoperability, which is the foundation for NATO to respond to
emerging threats as an Alliance, in a flexible and timely
manner]{.underline}.

A key challenge for NATO is raising awareness that **[the answers to
ethical questions can no longer be left to later stages of the
development and procurement cycle]{.underline}**. **[Decisions made at
the political and legal level will have a significant impact on the
engineering practices used to develop AI, as well as the technical
characteristics of the AI-based systems.]{.underline}** [The answers to
questions such as respecting human dignity, human control, and
accountability will be the foundation upon which many technical elements
are programed. Systems developers need to make a number of calls
throughout the development cycle informed by the answers to key
questions, including]{.underline}:

[how to label data]{.underline}

[what data to use, and]{.underline}

[what is an acceptable outcome]{.underline}?

**[These answers will also impact how AI systems are evaluated and
ultimately deployed]{.underline}**.

**[If individual nations or groups are left to develop their own ethical
principles without wider alignment to NATO, the result will be a number
of AI-based systems with varying technical specifications based on the
legal and policy decisions made by individual governments when answering
the key questions.]{.underline}** As has been demonstrated in areas such
as facial recognition and policing algorithms, [the assumptions made by
those developing the tools and answering the key questions have a
significant impact on the real-world functioning of the tool and
societal acceptance of its ethics.]{.underline} [The risk of tools
failing to gain acceptance depends on the legal and ethical decisions
made by governments]{.underline}. For the military, this may mean one
state using an AI-based system that is seen as unacceptable by another,
and in a joint operation one state fielding a system that cannot be used
by another. Or worse yet, this could render a joint operation
impossible. Without the ability to interoperate across NATO, the
inability to effectively and efficiently respond to future threats would
undermine the Alliance.

[The role of the private sector is another aspect of ethical AI
development that has proved a challenge to governments and the
transatlantic relationship. Within states, governments have struggled to
adequately regulate Big Tech firms, which has led to these companies
encroaching on government responsibilities to protect and uphold the
public interest]{.underline}. This encroachment permeates all aspects of
government, including defense and security. As Deputy Secretary of
Defense Kathleen Hicks discussed during her confirmation hearings, the
lack of competition is also a challenge to innovation in the private
defense industry. This, along with a lack of regulation, feeds into the
power imbalance between the sectors. Consequently, private sector
companies building the AI and AI systems that are or will be deployed on
the battlefield are deciding the ethics policies for themselves.

[The transatlantic partnership must focus on coordinating these core
principles and systematic governance to ensure AI systems development
aligns with the rule of law and democracy. In particular, this must
ensure answering questions about human dignity, human control, and
accountability. **NATO is the ideal defense and security forum for this
alignment. Given the US lead on adopting ethical principles for the
entire DoD and the EU's drive to assert checks and balances for
private-sector tech companies, NATO remains the organization that can
bring these two together and establishes the ethical bottom
line**]{.underline}. [These will then ensure the diverging legal and
ethical stances towards Big Tech do not lead to an interoperability
barrier in the future]{.underline}. If developments surrounding the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the challenges it brought
for U.S.-based, data-driven companies are any indication, [a strong
transatlantic led initiative is needed in order to ensure the same
challenges do not hinder NATO.]{.underline}

[The solution to the challenge that ethical AI poses for the future of
interoperability within NATO is for the Alliance to establish shared
transatlantic ethical principles, informed by the US DoD, the EU, and
others. Establishing these principles will not only strengthen
transatlantic political relations; more technically, it will allow for
the establishment of standardization agreements and inform training and
education initiatives of the Alliance in the future]{.underline}.

No.15 -- December 2020 //pipk

Over the past 150 years, the complexity of technology -- whether
military or commercial -- has grown exponentially.311 The fact that
increasingly capable technologies developed in different countries, in
different years and by companies operating in different industries can
work together and interact efficiently is, to a significant extent, a
product of standards.312 [Standards are,]{.underline} literally,
[documents defining technical specifications, requirements, guidelines
or characteristics]{.underline}.313 For instance, all USB sticks enter
any USB port and our laptops or smartphones can connect to any WiFi
network: this is the product of standards. By the same token, [standards
are intensively used in the military domain to address similar
compatibility issues, from the measurements of cartridges to
communications. Standards deserve attention because they are also going
to play a key role when it comes to AI, ML and BD]{.underline}.

[There are, fundamentally, two types of standards. Technical standards
refer to specificities, parameters and characteristics. Non-technical
standards define procedures, processes and practices]{.underline}. To
examine this issue in greater detail, it is useful to look more broadly
at what standards do and what their merits are. First, standards not
only connect technologies vertically (in the same field) and
horizontally (across different fields), but also span different times of
development. In this way, [standards enable innovation]{.underline}. A
related point is that [common standards also expand the size of a
market, as they eliminate nontariff barriers and thus contribute to
guaranteeing economic efficiency and technological
effectiveness]{.underline}.314 Second, [standards define and protect
intellectual property and thus make it possible to gather royalties: in
this way, they also incentivize innovation]{.underline}.315 In the
language of social science, [standards are thus an institution that
makes it possible to solve a collective action problem related to
adjudication of rents in complex systems]{.underline}.316 Third,
[standards also make it possible to comply with specific requirements.
For instance, technical standards may require certain levels of safety
and security through the imposition of specific parameters]{.underline}.
By the same token, non-technical standards may call for procedures and
processes that comply with these or other demands -- for instance,
emphasizing transparency or calling for specific verification steps.317

The above discussion highlights how, despite their technical nature,
[standards have an important political, economic and ethical dimension.
Standards, however, also have an important military dimension, as the
case of NATO highlights. Historically, **NATO has played a critical role
in standardization**]{.underline}. As Paul Beckley notes, "with nearly
6,000 documents in its database, [NATO is the most prolific
international military standardization organization in the
world]{.underline}".318 Furthermore, [standards are the backbone of
interoperability -- which, in turn, is the lifeblood of a military
alliance]{.underline}. [NATO collective capacity is, however, more than
the simple sum of its parts]{.underline}, or "having the same missiles
or tanks".319 The emergence of [AI]{.underline}, ML and BD [highlights
this point]{.underline}. [As this new set of technologies are integrated
into the economy as well as in countries' armed forces, standards will
provide a fundamental contribution]{.underline}. **[NATO has a key role
to play here]{.underline}**, **[both in ensuring a swift and risk-free
technological transition through standards and in infusing its ethical
and moral commitments into the new technologies]{.underline}**.320

At least four main issues are important for the Alliance. Standards and
ethics. [NATO cannot lead and shape ethical discussions about AI if is
unable to translate its ethical commitments into technology. The
propagation channel to achieve this goal is constituted by technical and
non-technical standards]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, in recent
years, as Paul Beckley warns, **[NATO's once robust standardization
programme has lost vitality]{.underline}**: [since the early 2000s, NATO
has developed few new standards and, since 2010, most have been
doctrinal rather than technical.]{.underline}321 Additionally, **[while
AI technologies evolve quickly, the standardization process may often be
lengthy, and given its consensus-based nature, it can require
significant time in large organizations]{.underline}**. Key ethical
values such as explainability, traceability or transparency need to be
translated into technical standards, in order to have real meaning and
effects.322 Following previous discussions, given that ML blurs the line
between research and development, [a robust system of
T&E]{.underline}/V&V [is necessary, both at national and at Alliance
level]{.underline}.323 [Working together on these standards is crucial
to ensure that Allies can plug together their capabilities and that the
same parameters are adopted, both for combat effectiveness and for
economic efficiency]{.underline}.

Approach to standards. AI does raise new challenges, but this does not
mean that all new challenges require new solutions. Some standards, for
instance, can be imported horizontally from nearby fields, like that of
cyber security. This issue highlights the importance of the approach to
standards, which NATO Allies may want to discuss: should new standards
be pursued when it comes to AI, or should countries agree to use
existing ones? Should they opt for stable standards, or try to update
them regularly? These are important questions. For instance, the U.S.
National Institute for Standards and Technology provides a list of
features that the US should pursue for standardization -- e.g.,
innovation-oriented, applicable across sectors and applications,
human-centred.324 The Atlantic Alliance would benefit from a similar
discussion as well as, eventually, trying to coordinate each Ally's
preferences, position and approaches towards standard multinational
standard-setting forums, like Standard Development Organizations.

Standards and effectiveness. [One of the main challenges of the
interaction between algorithms and BD is their
brittleness]{.underline}.325 [Algorithms can be (easily)
fooled]{.underline}. In the civilian economy, this may lead to
controversial or even unacceptable outcomes, such as discrimination or
bias.326 For instance, HR algorithms may discard some candidates because
historical underrepresentation of their sex or ethnicity disadvantages
them in the data on which the recommender algorithm is trained. **[In
the military domain, this may lead to errors, like mistaking a military
target for a civilian facility or the other way around, and overall
combat ineffectiveness, or even defeat]{.underline}**. [The use of
generative adversarial networks which intentionally exploit these
vulnerabilities to undermine the opponent's capabilities makes matters
worse]{.underline}.327 To address these problems, [AI]{.underline} and
related technologies [must comply with a set of principles that
standards can translate and consolidate, including safety and
reliability as well as accepted degrees of accuracy. Non-technical
standards can also play an important role in defining procedures,
processes and approaches in developing and fielding those systems,
including about issues related to human control]{.underline}.328
However, standards should be also complemented by tools to enable the
development of effective, reliable, robust and trustworthy AI
technologies, in areas such as accountability and auditing, annotations
and documentation, benchmarks, metrics, AI testbeds, methodologies and
datasets in standardized formats.

There is great convergence and commonality among the recommendations of
the Advisory Group on [Emerging]{.underline} and Disruptive
[Technologies]{.underline} and the NATO 2030 Reflection Group. Both call
for the establishment of [transatlantic digital consultations and
dedicated structures]{.underline}, including a NATO Advanced Technology
Projects Agency and funding instruments such as a NATO Investment Bank.
Building on these recommendations, as well as on NATO-private sector
dialogues, in February Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg proposed the
establishment of a NATO Defense Innovation Initiative "[to promote
interoperability and serve as a catalyst for transatlantic cooperation
on defense innovation]{.underline}."18 After consultations and meeting
political roadblocks, the allies decided to establish the Defense
Innovation Accelerator instead as a more flexible, opt-in, and
off-budget instrument.

The NATO 2030 agenda thus incorporates innovation and EDTs under the
broader mantra of an "ambitious program for the continued adaptation of
the alliance."19 However, NATO's history of adaptation also [underlines
important limitations and challenges]{.underline}.20 [These include
challenges in speed of adoption, spending levels, technological
compartmentalization, fragmented and incomplete information and skills,
stovepiped innovation practices, fragmented national innovation
initiatives, lagging NATO-EU cooperation, allied technology and
digitalization gaps, and a general underuse of NATO instruments to
pursue collaborative defense innovation in EDTs]{.underline}.21 Faced
with the prospect of long-term competition with technically capable
China and Russia, **[NATO's history of incremental adaptation may be too
slow, prescriptive, or inflexible for successful
innovation]{.underline}**.

In this context, **[speed is crucial]{.underline}**. [NATO's efforts
must break the cycle of incremental adaptation and lay the foundation
for a more dynamic and strategic innovation process]{.underline}.
Defense innovation in EDTs cannot be tied to NATO's decade-long policy
and adaptation cycles because this may not be enough to innovate at the
pace of relevance. The new Defense Innovation Accelerator and AI
Strategy should become long-term, staple tools for the alliance [to
build a culture of rapid **experimentation** and innovation uptake and a
resilient innovation ecosystem within it]{.underline}.

Innovation as Adaptation

In the context of the rapid pace of progress in several technologies
driven by the private sector and market forces, NATO's approach to
innovation and EDTs stands out in comparison to previous adaptation
efforts in the 1990s and 2000s. The ongoing reflection in the Emerging
and Disruptive Technologies Roadmap and the NATO 2030 process is perhaps
one of the most systematic efforts to develop a strategic and
coordinated approach to several technology priority areas, backed
simultaneously by institutional change and procedural innovation.
[Today's iteration of defense innovation seems an order of magnitude and
speed above what the alliance has experienced before. It builds on
substantial changes in NATO processes, structures, authorities, and
skills to reward risk taking and **experimentation**]{.underline}.
NATO's innovation efforts also go beyond the traditional focus on
technical and operational standardization, and they include a prominent
ethical and normative dimension. As the NATO secretary-general recently
underlined, allies "should also look into how NATO can be the platform
to address ethical aspects of these technologies," including by
developing "guideline standards."22

global posture, it must]{.mark}]{.underline}** snap out of a Cold
War-style mindset, [[cut down on bureaucracy]{.mark}, [and **refrain
from expanding processes that hamstring security
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Trump administration made some notable advances to promote
innovation and protect US technological advantage through its 2017
National Security Strategy; 2020 National Strategy for Critical and
Emerging Technologies, designed to actively promote innovation; and its
commitment to revise the US export policy for Unmanned Aerial Systems
(UAS). These policies were a good start, but not enough. Now President
Joe Biden has an opportunity to bring them to fruition.

To understand the rapid emergence of UAS threats, look no further than
the growth of Iran's military drone program in recent years, which also
extends to Iran-backed groups across various regional conflicts. This
includes Houthi rebels in Yemen using drones against Saudi Arabia, Hamas
deploying them against Israel in the Gaza Strip, and Iraq-based Shia
militia using them to attack US troops---likely including the recent
drone attack on Al Tanf, a remote US outpost on the Syrian-Jordanian
border. Iran's increasing use of this technology, specifically "suicide"
or "kamikaze" drones that fly into their targets and explode, requires
integrated air defenses and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS)
technology. Regional US partners in the Middle East, which have
increasing requirements to deter Iranian aggression, will seek every
opportunity to acquire it from the US government.

[The US security establishment has long acknowledged that adversaries
like China and Iran are pursuing commercial, off-the-shelf technologies
that can threaten US personnel, penetrate allies' and partners' air
defenses, and generally challenge regional stability. But the US
approach still has room for improvement]{.underline}.

As part of its new CAT policy, the Biden administration is considering
expanding bureaucratic processes for arms sales to better safeguard US
interests---but this inadvertently chips away at the prime placement of
American aerospace and defense industries in the global marketplace.
Extending the processes for military arms sales and transfers risks
ceding the security cooperation space to US adversaries. [The United
States has a unique role in the world, and its national-security
interests---including its defense industrial base---shouldn't be
compromised]{.underline} (certainly not by the government) in pursuit of
a "level playing field," as recently advocated by Assistant Secretary of
State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis. For the US
government to suggest putting US industry on par with competitors is
counterintuitive; it is a national- and economic- security imperative
for the government to bolster US industry to excel with every possible
advantage.

**[US security cooperation]{.underline}** historically
[encompasses]{.underline} facilitating arms sales, staging military
[[training and exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}, developing
interoperability [[among allies and partners]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
bolstering the sovereign defense capabilities of security partners. All
these efforts **[[need to continue at a deliberate
pace]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[but]{.underline} in a post-Cold War
world, [the United States no longer has a monopoly on]{.underline} arms
sales with [an overt technological advantage in all areas]{.underline}.

In recent years, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities became the focus of Chinese UAS production, and as then
Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford noted in 2018,
"**[[Whoever has the]{.mark} competitive [advantage in]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [and can field systems]{.mark}
informed by artificial intelligence, [could]{.mark} very well [have an
overall competitive advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Many of us in the
national-security enterprise at the time were also concerned with how AI
innovation would shape the development of drones and integrated
air-defense systems. [With that technological competition heating up,
allies and partners matter more than ever.]{.underline}

**[[To remain the "partner of choice" for]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}
and partners, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs to work
closer]{.mark} with them [in collaborative
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the trilateral AUKUS
defense pact among the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
[[It]{.underline}]{.mark} [[can]{.mark} also [develop]{.mark} other
[proactive collaborative schemes]{.mark} in emerging technologies to
enhance shared capabilities and interoperability, help security partners
successfully meet updated UAS export policy, and aggressively advocate
for and develop integrated air-defense capabilities]{.underline}.

For the sake of American interests, the US government must carefully
foster its partnerships and spark a level of defense innovation to keep
the United States and its partners truly secure.

//pipk

Since World War II, US presidents have understood [the tremendous value
of security cooperation, prompt]{.underline}ing [them to invest in
alliances and partnerships]{.underline}. These are, after all,
[significant components of US national security, and]{.underline} as
President Joe Biden recently noted, "America's [alliances are our
greatest asset]{.underline}."

Yet successful [security cooperation]{.underline}---[which
includes]{.underline} arms transfers, **[training]{.underline}**,
security assistance, treaties, or agreements---[is built around two key
principles: trust and integrity of commitment, both of which are at risk
today thanks to the haphazard US withdrawal from
Afghanistan]{.underline}.

In the US military, the term "integrity check" refers to a concern about
an individual's or unit's capability or trustworthiness. Following the
debacle in Kabul, the United States and its global security cooperation
posture is in dire need of one.

[Just look at the anger expressed by stalwart NATO allies such as the
United Kingdom]{.underline}, which in the aftermath of 9/11
unquestionably joined in to invoke the Washington Treaty's Article 5 for
collective self-defense (the first time the Alliance ever did so). [That
NATO launched its first operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area and
began a far-reaching transformation of capabilities **signaled** its
**trust** in the **U**nited **S**tates' reliability when it came to
**security cooperation**]{.underline}.

[Now, treaty allies and partner nations are reassessing their bilateral
security relationships with the United States]{.underline}. [It's not
just the NATO states caught off-guard]{.underline} by the haphazard
departure from Afghanistan [that will think twice before embarking upon
future military campaigns with the United States.]{.underline} [Resolute
defense partners in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific---including
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan---likely
also need overt reassurance, such as a clear national-security strategy
and declared recommitments]{.underline}.

Additionally, [these partners are increasingly feeling the need to
proactively raise their own defense capabilities by boosting their
budgets or coordinating with allies to ensure regional security along
with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.

Besides stress-testing [the integrity of American security
cooperation]{.underline}, the Afghanistan withdrawal also [highlights
the necessity of staying the course on long-term investment in mutually
beneficial security partnerships with countries with which the United
States has shared interests---or shared threats]{.underline}. Well
before the fall of Afghanistan, [foreign partners were already
questioning the reliability of the United States at a time when the
debate in Washington about our global posture was becoming increasingly
politicized]{.underline}.

[The case for partnering with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [needs to be clearly articulated through the
presence, performance, and processes of American **security
cooperation**]{.underline}. [The quality of US]{.underline} aerospace
and defense [equipment, the commitment to build capabilities, and the
reassurance that comes from partnering with the US military must include
further transparency, accountability, and **predictability of
policies**]{.underline}.

**[If not]{.underline}**, [American allies and partners will be hesitant
to collaborate with us on future shared security requirements---or
simply seek cooperation elsewhere.]{.underline}

We owe it to our fellow Americans, as well as to allies and partners, to
be candid about the costs of security and what it takes to support our
shared values of the rule of law, civil society, and human rights. As we
await the outcome of the Global Posture Review, or a revised
Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, [anti-democratic adversaries in
Beijing and Moscow are aggressively exploiting each
disruption]{.underline} associated with the Taliban takeover in Kabul.

[If alliances are indeed our "greatest asset]{.underline}"---whether in
the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, Africa, or Europe---[it is crucial for US
officials to actively affirm their values through clear recommitments
and presence in **security cooperation**]{.underline}, such as the
recent pledges made to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

[We would be naïve to believe that countries around the world have no
choice but to partner with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [Washington must be deliberate in its efforts
to prove why choosing the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [as a security partner remains the best
option.]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence

Meanwhile, [the allies also agreed on NATO's first-ever artificial
intelligence strategy, which has been in the works since early 2021. "It
will set standards for responsible use of artificial intelligence, in
accordance with international law, outline how we will accelerate the
adoption of artificial intelligence in what we do, set out how we will
protect this technology, and address the threats posed by the use of
artificial intelligence by adversaries]{.underline}," Stoltenberg said.

[NATO released a summary of the strategy on Oct. 22, and it includes
four sections: Principles of responsible use of artificial intelligence
in defense; ensuring the safe and responsible use of allied AI;
minimizing interference in allied AI; and standards.]{.underline}

[It also lays out the six principles of AI use that member-nations
should follow]{.underline}. They include: lawfulness; responsibility and
accountability; explainability and traceability; reliability;
governability; and bias mitigation.

[The nascent DIANA outfit will host specialized AI test centers that
will help NATO ensure standards are being kept as member-nations develop
new platforms and systems and encourage interoperability]{.underline},
van Weel noted. That way, NATO creates "a common ecosystem where all
allies have access to the same levels of AI," he said.

[NATO will also form a data and artificial intelligence review board
with representatives from all member-nations, to ensure the
"operationalization" of the AI strategy, he added. "The principles are
all great, but they only mean something if we're able to actually
translate that into how the technology is being developed, and then
used."]{.underline}

Operations and Decision-Making\"

//pipk

Broadly defined, [AI is the ability of computers and machines to perform
tasks that traditionally require human intelligence]{.underline}.22 AI
has been applied to control self-driving cars and swarms of unmanned
aircraft, to assist physicians in making medical diagnoses, and at the
more quotidian level, to screen spam emails and act as virtual personal
assistants.23 Underlying AI technologies are a variety of approaches
including mathematical optimization, statistical methods, and artificial
neural networks --- computer systems that attempt to perform specific
tasks in a similar way to the human brain.24 Regardless of approach, AI
typically uses large amounts of data to train and feed algorithms to
accomplish tasks and processes that are normally associated with human
cognition. Most current AI is considered to be "narrow," designed to
achieve a specific task --- like identifying objects in images.
Researchers, however, are working to develop artificial general
intelligence that can accomplish any task the human brain can.25

[Narrow AI technology has increasingly been applied in the national
security domain]{.underline}. Although much policy and scholarly writing
focuses on lethal autonomous weapon systems --- "killer robots" that can
identify and engage targets without human intervention --- [AI is far
more commonly employed in a range of more mundane military and national
security tasks]{.underline}.26 [In some cases, AI is part of analytical
processes, like the use of machine learning to classify targets in
satellite imagery]{.underline}.27 [In other instances, it is part of the
software used to operate physical systems, like autonomous planes or
ships]{.underline}.28 In both cases, [AI is not a military capability in
itself, but an enabler that can enhance the efficiency of military tasks
and systems]{.underline}.29

**[Many regional and global military powers have already fielded
AI-enabled military systems]{.underline}**.30 [Israel]{.underline} and
[Russia]{.underline}, for instance, have reportedly tested self-driving
tanks and armored vehicles capable of identifying targets without human
direction.31 [The United States]{.underline} is making headway on
Project Maven, the Defense Department's effort to use machine learning
--- an application of AI --- to streamline the analysis of video
gathered by drones.32 Similarly, [Japan]{.underline}'s Self-Defense
Force announced that it will equip its P-1 maritime patrol aircraft with
AI technology that will more effectively identify vessels and other
potential targets.33 States have also begun incorporating AI into
autonomous systems that can navigate without direction by human
operators, often in swarms intended to overwhelm an enemy's defenses. In
2017, for instance, the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency hosted a large-scale experiment where
swarms of autonomous drones flew simulated combat missions against each
other.34

[The development of these systems should not come as a surprise.
Military and political decision-makers seek to enhance the efficiency
and accuracy of their state's military and to reduce risk and costs
during operations. AI can help accomplish these objectives.]{.underline}
In many contexts, AI can make assessments and judgements with greater
speed and accuracy than humans, and with less manpower. For example, AI
can help quickly dig through vast quantities of imagery and video data
to pinpoint objects of interest, like military vehicles, with little
human involvement.35 In contrast, geospatial intelligence exploitation
that is not assisted by AI is a time-intensive and manpower-intensive
process.36 AI can also be used to operate autonomous weapon systems that
allow states to launch military operations without putting friendly
personnel in harm's way. These systems can decrease the risk of friendly
casualties and reduce the political barriers to launching military
operations.37 [The efficiency-enhancing and risk-reducing
characteristics of AI-enabled systems will likely appeal to
casualty-averse and cost-conscious leaders]{.underline}. Indeed, AI
technologies might allow these leaders to launch operations not
previously possible because of efficiency concerns or high degrees of
risk to friendly forces.

[All surveyed officials indicated that they engage with international
partners on AI-related issues]{.underline}. [Bilateral efforts were the
most cited avenue of international collaboration on AI, in four
cases]{.underline} (EU, Australia, Czech Republic, and Italy) [involving
the United States]{.underline}. [Multilateral fora were another common
and increasingly relevant avenue for collaboration]{.underline}. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was the
most cited multilateral forum, while multiple officials indicated
engagement through the EU, Group of Seven (G7), Group of Twenty, or the
newly created Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). Current international
efforts focus on developing shared ethical standards, in part following
the lead of the OECD and EU on defining AI standards. Other officials
noted collaboration around workforce challenges, data policies, climate
change, and lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS).

**[Partners' active engagement and interest in international
collaboration around AI is matched with positive perceptions of the
United States' role as an AI partner]{.underline}**. [Eighty
percent]{.underline} of officials said their country
[consider]{.underline}s [the United States to be a reliable partner on
AI issues]{.underline}. The remaining three officials, representing the
EU, Germany, and France, suggested that while they consider the United
States a like-minded ally and continue to value U.S. partnership, recent
exchanges have been less fruitful and current approaches raise general
concerns regarding U.S. reliability as an AI partner. [Officials also
rated the United States highly in terms of commitment to responsible use
of AI with an average rating similar to the average rating of their own
countries, or institutions, in the case of the EU, and a significantly
higher rating than they assigned to China's commitment to responsible
AI]{.underline} (7.3, 7.9, and 3.8 out of 10, respectively).

In citing obstacles to collaboration with the United States, officials
were split between placing blame on the United States and on their own
country. Multiple officials noted threats to industry and industrial
competition, trade issues, different domestic priorities, or a lack of
agreed upon strategy or common structures as obstacles to collaboration.
Others specified that the U.S. desire to "win" relative to China, lack
of data privacy protection, or unwillingness to engage inhibited
collaboration. They also noted a lack of confidence in current U.S.
goals or appropriate U.S. points of contact. Obstacles stemming from
their own government included a lack of regulatory framework or set
policies, alternative political priorities, a preference for
multilateral fora, or insufficient resources.

The [survey results indicate that there is space for the United States
to engage with international partners and, despite some specific but not
insurmountable points of difference, a high degree of alignment on AI
interests and priorities]{.underline}.

[The U.S. military has already started to develop this type of
capability. As part of a series of exercises, the Defense Department
demonstrated a command-and-control network that uses AI to automatically
detect enemy activity and pass targeting information between multiple
intelligence and military assets. During one of these exercises, a space
asset detected a simulated enemy ship, but was unable to identify it.
The network automatically cued an intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance platform to collect additional information on the
adversary vessel, which it then sent to a command-and-control asset. The
command-and-control platform used AI to select the best platform
available to strike the enemy ship and passed targeting data to the
nearby U.S. naval destroyer that would engage the adversary vessel. AI
significantly shortened the targeting process relative to efforts
without AI technology. When describing the AI-enabled network in
November 2019, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein
announced, "This is no longer PowerPoint. It's real]{.underline}."90

A. THE UNITED STATES 45. As the global leader in AI, the United States
has actively sought to integrate AI into its military capabilities.
Defence-related AI continues to be a big part of the efforts started
under the Obama administration's Third Offset Strategy, aimed at the
preservation of the US military advantage. In 2018, the US Department of
Defense (DoD) published its own AI strategy, which will certainly be
reinforced by the national American AI Initiative launched by the Trump
administration in February 2019.

46\. The DoD continues to invest significant resources in AI-related
programmes and initiatives. A 2017 report estimated that, between 2013
and 2017, approximately USD 1.76 billion were devoted to three
categories of relevant DoD spending (learning and intelligence; advanced
computing; and AI systems) (Govini, 2017). In 2018, the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced an additional USD 2 billion
between 2018 and 2023. In 2016, the DoD created the Defense Innovation
Unit (DIU) to facilitate the integration of commercial technology into
the military. As the STC learned when meeting with DIU officials in
October 2018, AI is a key area of the DIU's activities. In 2018, the DoD
also established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), whose
Chief Architect laid out JAIC's aims during the October 2018 STC visit.
JAIC has been allocated a budget of USD 1.75 billion for six years to
oversee and coordinate DoD AI efforts.

47\. The US military is engaged in numerous AI-related projects and
programmes. A few examples illustrate the breadth of these activities: -
DARPA's Target Recognition and Adaptation in Contested Environments
(TRACE) programme has delivered promising technologies, such as an
automatic target-recognition system to assist pilots. - The US Air Force
is currently developing such a system, called Multi-Domain Command and
Control, to better integrate the extensive data collected from its wide
range of sources. - Project Maven is an important information,
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) programme, developed together with
US tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. It helps human
analysts, through computer-vision technologies, to process up to two to
three times as much data in the same time period (CRS, 2018). The system
is already in use in counter-Daesh operations. - The US Army is testing
Uptake's Asset Performance Management application to employ predictive
maintenance in its M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The STC
delegation heard more about this topic from Uptake's leadership during
the 2018 Silicon Valley visit. - The Army is working on optionally
manned Next-Generation Combat Vehicles. - The Air Force Research Lab has
initiated the Skyborg programme that seeks to train US Air Force pilots
through an AI system, possibly hosted on an unmanned aircraft (Insinna,
2018). - DARPA held a Cyber Grand Challenge pitting autonomous machines
against one another. Each of these machines was designed with
vulnerabilities, and contestants had to create AI algorithms capable of
identifying and fixing these weaknesses while attacking their opponents
(Hoadley and Lucas, 2018). - The US Army is developing a tool called
Macroscope which uses data produced by social networks to better
understand social environments.

B. EUROPE 48. European states and the EU have increasingly recognised
the growing importance of AI technologies and applications. Indeed, all
EU member states and the European Commission have now adopted AI
strategies. Many countries and the EU itself have substantially
increased AI funding and set up organisational structures and entities
to deal with the opportunities and challenges of AI. However, Europe is
confronting a number of structural challenges. In terms of hardware,
European actors still rely heavily on US chipmakers. Moreover, it faces
intense competition from the United States where salaries are more
attractive to European researchers. Europe is also comparatively less
successful at translating research into commercial products. Finally,
Europe's comparatively stricter data security rules, which most
Europeans value very highly, restrains its access to data pools (Franke,
2019). To deal with privacy and other ethical concerns, an EU HighLevel
Expert Group on AI presented Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy
Artificial Intelligence in April 2019.

49\. As the EU builds up its defence initiatives, notably the European
Defence Fund and the Permanent Structured Cooperation, defence-related
AI R&D could certainly play an important role. For now, however, most
efforts are designed and implemented at the national or bilateral
levels, with the United Kingdom and France taking the leading role
within Europe.

C. CHINA 53. AI has become a top priority for Chinese leaders, both for
commercial and military applications. As articulated in the 2017 New
Generation AI Development Plan, China is aiming to become the global AI
leader and develop a domestic AI market worth USD 150 billion by 2030.
Already today, the government and industry have begun to believe that
China has "largely closed the gap with the United States in both AI R&D
and commercial AI products" (Allen, 2019). However, significant gaps
remain in a number of areas, for example AI talent, technical standards,
software frameworks and platforms, and semiconductors (Allen, 2019).
China-based companies already play a significant role in the global
development of AI technologies. Not only is China investing at home, but
the country has also been investing abroad, which draws increased
scrutiny by Allies.

54\. As two Committee speakers outlined at the 2019 Spring Session, the
entanglement of the private sector with public institutions, such as the
party-state and the armed forces, significantly facilitates the
incorporation of AI technologies into the defence sector, since top-down
coordination clearly guides companies' development priorities. The
emphasis put by President Xi Jinping on "military-civil fusion" is
likely to sustain this trend (Sheppard et al., 2018). Moreover, China
has been an early adopter of AI technologies for domestic surveillance
applications. This lowers the barriers to adoption of AI-enabled systems
by the military (Allen, 2019). Lower privacy standards compared to North
America and Europe, combined with the sheer numerical advantage of the
private data collected, provide a key advantage for developing new AI
algorithms, too.

55\. Analysts believe China's efforts to integrate AI into its military
spectrum are informed by AI developments in other countries, notably the
United States. China believes in a "military revolution of
intelligentisation" (De Spiegeleire, Maas, and Sweijs, 2017). The
Chinese government views the disruptive potential of AI as an
opportunity to "leapfrog" the United States by investing heavily in
novel disruptive systems, rather than only sustaining legacy systems
(Allen, 2019). For example, Beijing has focused on the potential of AI
for enhanced battlefield decision-making, cyber capabilities, cruise
missiles, and autonomous vehicles in all military domains -- all
technologies which could present great difficulties for the United
States in a conflict.

D. RUSSIA 56. President Vladimir Putin has declared that "AI is the
future \[...\]. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become
the ruler of the world". Although Russia still lags behind the United
States and China, it has demonstrated its commitment to catching up with
its competitors -- at least in certain areas. Nevertheless, while
Chinese and US companies spend billions of US dollars in AI, the Russian
private sector only invested an estimated RUB 700 million annually (less
than USD 11 million at the time of writing) (Horowitz et al., 2018). New
reports indicate, however, that the Russian Direct Investment Fund has
recently raised USD 2 billion from foreign investors to support the
domestic AI sector (bne IntelliNews, 2019).

57\. The Ministry of Defence, along with elements of the defence
industry, has assumed a leading role on AI. For one, the Russian
Military Industrial Committee seeks to make 30% of its military
equipment remotely controllable by 2025 (Allen and Chan, 2017). As part
of this push, the Russian government created the Advanced Research
Foundation, Russia's response to DARPA, whose annual budget stands at
approximately RUB 4 billion (about USD 62 million at the time of
writing). The agency has so far focused on technologies imitating human
thinking, data analysis, and assimilation of new knowledge. It has also
singled out four main lines of effort that AI developments should
follow: image recognition; speech recognition; control of autonomous
military systems; and life-cycle support for weapon systems (Bendett,
2018). Russia's AI national strategy is expected to be published in June
2019. In May 2019, President Putin outlined some of the strategy's
priorities: training programmes, public-private partnerships, new
legislation, and building on the country's strengths in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (Bendett, 2019). He and several
ministers also hinted that up to USD 1.4 billion could be invested into
domestic AI efforts to develop "technological sovereignty" in AI
(Bendett, 2019).

58\. Russian industries are integrating AI into weapons systems,
especially robotic autonomous systems (Hoadley and Lucas, 2018). The
Kalashnikov Group has reportedly developed an AI-controlled ground
vehicle with neural network AI technology (IISS, 2018). The
radio-electronic company KRET has reportedly been working on "unmanned
systems with swarming and independent decision-making capabilities"
(IISS, 2018). Moreover, the Russian Air Force has announced the
development of AI-guided missiles. Analysts also argue that Russia's
robust development of civilian technologies on image and speech
recognition will likely be incorporated into Russian information
operations (Bendett, 2018). It must be noted that Russia's ambitious AI
plans may be hindered by structural challenges such as the weakness of
Russia's technology industry and falling defence budgets (Hoadley and
Lucas, 2018).

However, [the conference also addressed specific challenges to
cooperation. It was pointed out that the two organisations occasionally
held diverging perspectives on particular issues,]{.underline} such as
Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS) or the appropriate balance
between laissez-faire and dirigiste approaches to defence industrial and
technological matters. The fact that not every EU member state had
published their positions on AI yet, while the US AI military strategy
does not even mention NATO, did little to bridge these divergent
viewpoints. It was also highlighted that despite any possible need for
cooperation on AI, the respective mandates and autonomy of each
organisation should be respected.

NEXT STEPS FOR EU-NATO COOPERATION [A shared view at the event was that
moving EU-NATO cooperation forward was essential]{.underline}. As in the
cyber domain, [the two organisations could play complementary roles,
drawing on their respective strengths and instruments, with the EU
leading in dual-use and NATO in military standards]{.underline}. [The
importance of shared values and outlooks was also highlighted on several
occasions. The two organisations held similar perspectives on
fundamental issues, including the unknown qualities of AI in defence,
the need for technological partnership between democracies, an AI arms
control regime and strong links between government and industry. In
addition, cooperation required a shared understanding of
AI.]{.underline} Creating a common vocabulary was key in this respect,
an area that the European Defence Agency (EDA) was already working. It
was also noted that inter-institutional cooperation would not be fully
effective until each organisation developed an internally coherent
outlook, with clearly defined goals, threat perceptions and a
goal-driven approach to AI.

#### NATO AI testing and standards solves integration with the EU

On this basis, a number of [specific areas for increased EU-NATO
cooperation were discussed during the discussion]{.underline}. It was
proposed that further steps were taken to implement the Joint
Declarations, including possibly by establishing an 'AI Centre of
Excellence'. Another proposal concerned adding an AI research dimension
to the Declarations, although a different view contended that AI would
nonetheless automatically and incrementally feature in EU-NATO
cooperation given its crosscutting nature. The need for a common EU-NATO
data-management and data-sharing framework was also proposed, in light
of the importance of data pools for the performance of AI algorithms.
Although much remained to be done in that area, data labelling was
identified as a good starting point.

[Another point raised on several occasions was the importance of
interoperability. Here, it was argued, AI had the potential to either
increase or decrease existing gaps. Militaries could mitigate AI
interoperability gaps through exercises and common
training]{.underline}, such as through the Cyber Education Platform, or
by developing niche capabilities, especially by utilising EU initiatives
such as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European
Defence Fund (EDF). [Some participants argued that divergences were
nevertheless inevitable and that, consequently, countries with low or no
AI capabilities should be able to trust the technologies of those with
more advanced technologies. This, in turn, required a common framework
for certification and evaluation procedures, as well as standardised
interfaces and modular system architectures that would combine
closed/'national' and open/'shared' components]{.underline}.

#### Security cooperation doesn't trade off with other countries

Research Report. <http://www.rand.org/t/RRA650-1> //pipk

There is not necessarily a competition in security cooperation per se,
and security cooperation activities among major rivals are not
necessarily mutually exclusive. Our analysis in this study suggests that
U.S. security cooperation activities seldom directly compete with those
of U.S. rivals, other than through those activities' contribution to
overall influence. Many of the case studies reveal that the United
States engages in significant levels and types of security cooperation
with countries that are pursuing similar activities with Russia, China,
or both. There are few cases in which Russian or Chinese security
cooperation prevented or obstructed parallel U.S. activities (although
arms sales could be seen as an exception). Security cooperation is best
viewed as one piece of a much larger competition for influence; security
cooperation activities themselves are usually not zero-sum.

[The global competition for AI talent is nominally zero-sum, but talent
development efforts such as education and training could expand it. The
United States should cultivate international networks of researchers
through exchange programs.]{.underline} [One potential model is the U.S.
Telecommunication Training Institute, which brings officials from
developing countries to the United States for tuition-free training in
information and communications technologies]{.underline}. [Such programs
would enable U.S. and allied policymakers to identify comparative
advantages in AI, share best practices, and promote linkages and the
free flow of ideas between government, industry, and
academia]{.underline}.

[The right approach would facilitate the exchange of knowledge and best
practices among allied and partner countries.]{.underline} The NSF, for
example, has awarded grants to researchers who seek to promote
international collaboration and benefit from the expertise and
specialized skill sets of international partners.84 Additional programs,
joint scholarships, and conference support could synchronize efforts to
grow the pool of AI talent. [Survey results suggest that partners
already engage in various efforts to leverage international ties to
encourage STEM education, provide AI-relevant fellowships, and offer
AI-specific advanced and technical degrees]{.underline}.

[Exchanges and fellowship programs could also mitigate zero-sum
dynamics, such that when a country "loses" AI talent to an ally or
partner, it nevertheless gains from the capabilities and networks of
which its researchers are a part]{.underline}. [To further this effort,
the U.S. government should commit resources to hosting and convening
workshops among AI researchers, fostering international networks of AI
researchers, and deepening partnerships with existing
networks,]{.underline} such as the Confederation of Laboratories for
Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe (CLAIRE). [The United States
and its allies should coordinate with the private sector from the outset
on job placement and training programs, including hosting recruiting
sessions that bring together representatives from government, industry,
and academia]{.underline}. [Surveyed officials]{.underline} from the
United Kingdom, Chile, Colombia, and Japan [noted]{.underline} ongoing
**[public-private partnerships]{.underline}** to **[foster AI
talent,]{.underline}** including providing subsidized training courses,
promoting women in STEM, and talent development programs.

Building [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the previous discussion of
[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} as a GPT, it appears that [[the challenge for
NATO is subtle, multifaceted and significant]{.underline}]{.mark}.
First, [in an age of accelerating technological change and growing
domain applicability, catching up with industry leaders and innovators
becomes more and more difficult for those that lag
behind]{.underline}.73 [This means that waiting is not a solution --
even though acting prematurely, in a realm of great uncertainty, is
inherently difficult and risky]{.underline}.74 Second, [governments
cannot expect that individuals, firms and organizations will be able to
embrace and successfully exploit the new wave of technological
transformation alone, without advice, support, direction, vision or
investments in infrastructure]{.underline}. Third, while some countries
will have an advantage, others will find the transition more difficult.
Regardless of this, [technological transitions do not occur in a vacuum,
as they require the alignment of incentives among a multiplicity of
actors, organizations and institutions, as well as the provision of
complementary services and goods for the new technologies to flourish
and be adopted]{.underline}.75 Fourth, and **[more important for
NATO,]{.underline}** **[without]{.underline}** coordinating and
**[cooperating]{.underline}** on their investments in the necessary
complementary assets, goods and services, [[Allies could find themselves
having to face]{.underline}]{.mark} additional hurdles.

[What types of problem could emerge? Technology-generated efficiency
gains in production lead to lower prices. However, lower prices lead to
[increases in demand]{.mark} -- [because the relative price of
substitute goods (rivals) increases]{.mark}]{.underline}[.7]{.mark}6
Over the past decade, AI -- and, in particular, ML -- has made a
particular activity, prediction, cheaper: it is reasonable to forecast
that this trend will continue in the future.77 As AI becomes cheaper,
however, [[the demand for AI-related services will increase, thus
leading to more demand for related necessities like AI specialists, AI
infrastructure (and 5G networks) and AI components
(processors]{.underline}). **[This in turn might well lead to scarcity
and higher prices, thus pitching actors against one
another]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- not unlike the early stages of the
COVID-19 crisis, when individual self-interested actions led to
collectively bad outcomes.78 [[In the context of a military alliance,
the problem goes much deeper, as it can generate a beggar-thy-neighbour
effect with allies competing for the same scarce
resources.]{.underline}]{.mark}79 [Moreover, [without]{.mark}
consultation and [cooperation, Allies could end up developing different
technological solutions, with the risk of undermining compatibility and
interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, they could end up
prioritizing some problems over others, with the risk of developing
multiple, different and redundant solutions while neglecting other
points in need of attention.80 [[However, through intra-alliance]{.mark}
coordination and [cooperation]{.mark}, as well as dialogue and
consultation, [secondary market mechanisms and other approaches, NATO
could provide an important contribution to identify and address this
type of problems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}81
