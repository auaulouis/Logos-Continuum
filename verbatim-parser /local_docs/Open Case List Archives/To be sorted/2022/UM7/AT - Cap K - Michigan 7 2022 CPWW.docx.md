### Peace

#### Cap sustains peace -- economic cost, resource drain, and market checks and balances dissuade conflict 

**Friedman, 10 \-\--** Uri Friedman is the managing editor at the
Atlantic Council and a contributing writer at The Atlantic. He was
previously a staff writer and the Global editor at The Atlantic, and the

In discussing capitalism\'s attributes,
[[argues]{.underline}](http://spectator.org/archives/2010/12/15/capitalisms-gift-of-peace)
J.T. Young at The American Spectator, we too often forget about peace:
[Virtually all conflicts of the last century have been initiated by
fettered market, authoritarian states.]{.underline} Often the world\'s
armed conflicts have been between two such regimes. Contrastingly,
[military conflicts have almost never pitted two capitalist, democratic
nations against one another. Socialist, communist]{.underline}, fascist,
or simply non-ideological dictator-[governed nations have almost always
been the world\'s aggressors.]{.underline} When [capitalist democracies
are drawn into armed conflict, it is almost always against such
economically-fettered nations]{.underline}. To prove his point, Young,
who\'s worked in the federal government and on Capitol Hill, points to
the Korean Peninsula: [\"In South Korea, a capitalist market, open
society, and democracy exist. In North Korea, a closed market, closed
society, and totalitarian regime exist. You also have a stark
distinction between peace and war.\"]{.underline} For capitalist
countries, Young says, [war is a **terrible economic investment**, since
**resources** are **deployed for unproductive** rather than productive
**ends**.]{.underline} [War only becomes an option when the long-term
costs of an enemy\'s continued aggression outweigh the short-term costs
of resisting it.]{.underline} The [economic calculation for
non-capitalist nations is reversed]{.underline}, he continues. [Since,
by definition, their economies are not allocating resources optimally,
conflict is actually the best economic investment.]{.underline} Young
adds that [free markets are also likely to create free political systems
whose **checks and balances make it difficult for the government to go
to war** or remain at war for a protracted period of time, whereas the
opposite is true in societies with \"fettered markets.\"]{.underline}
After citing the economists Milton Friedman and Frederick Hayek to
support his claims, Young concludes: \"[capitalism is frequently
credited with only the most prosaic of goals and ends in society. In
fact, it is really the **protector of society\'s most sublime
goals**.\"]{.underline}

### AT: Ukraine proves cap X= peace

#### Ukraine proves high economic impacts of war limit combat capabilities and doom countries -- sends a signal

**Alden, 4/11** \-\-- Edward Alden is a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations, a visiting professor at Western Washington
University, and the author of, \"Failure to Adjust: How Americans Got
Left Behind in the Global Economy."(Edward Alden, \"Perspective\",

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/11/russia-china-peace-capitalism/)//EG

Despite these dispiriting developments, though[, it is too soon to
declare that the heirs of Kant have failed.]{.underline} Russian arms
have proved deficient in Ukraine, but the power of money has never been
more on display. [Sanctions against Russia have cut off access to
hundreds of billions of dollars of its central bank reserves, crashing
the value of the ruble]{.underline} (it has recovered only because of
[capital
controls](https://www.reuters.com/business/russias-rouble-rebound-is-not-real-it-seems-2022-04-01/)
that make the currency all but worthless outside Russia). [Russia's
manufacturing industries, from steel to cars, have ground to a halt
since the flows of Western parts and technology have ceased and foreign
markets have been blocked. Its citizens have lost access to most Western
goods and services]{.underline} --- companies including McDonald's, H&M,
Visa and Mastercard [have
left](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/russia-moscow-western-business/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8).
[Thousands of Russians have already [fled the
country](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60697763) in what is
looking like a massive brain drain of the nation's best and
brightest]{.underline}. [The Institute of International Finance
forecasts that Russia's economy will contract nearly 18 percent by the
end of 2023, wiping out the [last 15
years](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/putin-s-war-seen-wiping-out-15-years-of-russian-economic-growth-1.1742386)
of economic growth.]{.underline} China, which only months ago declared
its friendship with Russia to be "without limits," is watching closely.
While it appears to have adhered to Western sanctions against Russia,
capital has nonetheless [been flowing out of
China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/china-sees-unprecedented-capital-outflow-since-war-iif-says).
Investors, seeing massive losses in Russia, are recalculating the risks
they face in authoritarian countries. If China were hit with similar
sanctions, it would have many more economic weapons to fight back than
Russia does. China's economy is more diversified; its trade with the
ASEAN nations is now larger than with either the United States or
Europe. It has invested heavily in developing countries through its
[Belt and Road
Initiative](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/2019/05/30/d6870958-8223-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9),
and those countries might be reluctant to enforce Western sanctions. And
China has a near monopoly in some critical sectors, such as the
processing of [rare-earth
metals](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-rareearth-explainer/explainer-chinas-rare-earth-supplies-could-be-vital-bargaining-chip-in-u-s-trade-war-idUSKCN1T00EK),
a vital component of many consumer products including electric and
hybrid vehicles, and for military applications such as jet engines and
satellites. But [China still relies on the West for the most advanced
technologies, especially [semiconductor
equipment](https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/lagging-but-motivated-the-state-of-chinas-semiconductor-industry/)
and fabrication capabilities. In an economic conflict, its
vulnerabilities exceed its strengths.]{.underline} [*Russia's military
losses give diplomacy a fighting
chance*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/01/negotiations-russia-ukraine/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_10)
The West's economic embrace of China and Russia, of course, was not all
about peace. Businesses have profited handsomely. Former German
chancellor Gerhard Schröder became board chairman of the Russian oil
giant Rosneft, and he used his close relationship with Putin to champion
the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Germany halted just before
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. U.S. companies lobbied furiously to bring
China into the WTO, lured by cheap labor and the huge Chinese consumer
market. It is easy to see how Putin would miscalculate, believing
corporate interests to be so strong in the West that governments would
be dissuaded from truly damaging sanctions. But those profits are
exactly the point. [Economic interdependence breeds peace]{.underline}
only [if the costs of breaking those ties are high enough --- and just
as important, if all sides *recognize* that the costs are high
enough.]{.underline} If the West can remain united on sanctions in
response to the invasion of Ukraine --- a big if as energy prices soar
and inflation hurts consumers --- [Russia will pay high and sustained
costs]{.underline}. That cooperation is already being tested as pressure
is growing in Europe to cut off gas and oil imports from Russia in the
wake of the Bucha massacre, which Germany fears would throw its economy
into recession. But a demonstration of unity may discourage Xi from
following Putin's example. [*We can do more to help Ukraine without
provoking World War
III*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/11/ukraine-no-fly-escalation-humanitarian/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_14)
To prevent wavering, the United States and its allies should be working
to ensure that economic vulnerabilities are as one-sided as possible.
The Biden administration is properly seeking to bring home production in
strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric-vehicle
batteries, while denying the most advanced U.S. technologies to China
and Russia. It is cooperating with Europe to find alternatives to
Russian oil and gas as quickly as possible. The administration should
also put aside its affinity for narrow "Buy American" approaches and
pursue
"[friendshoring](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/government-trends/2022/reshoring-global-supply-chains.html)"
--- working with allies to build up critical supply chains and limit
Chinese and Russian economic leverage. And it should work with partners
to minimize the harm from sanctions in the developing world. The Kantian
ideal has certainly been damaged; the line between economic
interdependence and peace is at best a crooked one. [But the power of
money has also been reinforced by the robust Western response.
Demonstrating **the high economic price that countries will face for
choosing war remains one of the best ways of sustaining
peace**]{.underline}

### Environment

#### Yale and CoC study shows Capitalist countries have higher scores in environmental performance 

Zitelmann, 21 \-\-- Zitelmann studied history and political science,
graduating with a doctorate "summa cum laude" in 1986. In 2016,
Zitelmann was awarded his second doctorate, this time in sociology.
(Rainer Zitelmann, \"Capitalism is good, not bad, for the environment\",
8/21/21, Washington Examiner,
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/capitalism-is-good-not-bad-for-the-environment)//EG

Every year, the Heritage Foundation ranks countries around the world on
their economic freedom. It\'s a kind of capitalism
[index](https://www.heritage.org/index/). But [analysis shows that the
most economically \"free\" countries also register the highest scores on
Yale University's EPI environmental [index](https://epi.yale.edu/),
averaging 76.1, while \"mostly free\" countries averaged 70.2. These two
groups have a significant lead over the \"moderately free\" countries,
which received much lower ratings (59.6 points) for their environmental
performance.]{.underline} The countries rated by the Heritage Foundation
as either [\"mostly unfree\" or \"repressed\" received by far the worst
Environmental Performance Index scores (46.7 and 50.3,
respectively).]{.underline} Researchers at Yale University found that
there is not only a correlation between the Heritage Foundation's index
and their own EPI but also between the EPI and the \"Ease of Doing
Business Index.\" That latter
[index](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data) is published each year as
part of the World Bank's \"Doing Business Report\" and is generally
regarded as the world's most comprehensive and reliable gauge of the
ease of doing business. [In 2016, researchers published [a
study](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/7/601) in the journal
*Sustainability* that included an evaluation of the correlation between
the EPI and the \"Open Market Index\" compiled by the International
Chamber of Commerce.]{.underline} The [OMI measures a country's openness
to free trade and is thus an important indicator of economic
freedom]{.underline}. The researchers found a high degree of overlap
between the OMI index and the EPI:19 of the OMI's 27 highest-scoring
countries also appear in the top 27 of the EPI. The survey covered a
total of 75 countries, including all G20 and European Union members.
Together, these countries account for more than 90% of international
trade and investment. The [researchers found evidence for their
\"hypothesis that countries with an open economy score higher in
environmental performance.\"]{.underline} There are two real-world
observations that also disprove the argument that stronger economic
growth automatically leads to greater environmental pollution. First,
[in noncapitalist countries, environmental degradation has been a far
more serious problem than in capitalist countries]{.underline}. Second,
the [correlation between economic growth and increasing resource
consumption is becoming ever weaker in the age of
dematerialization.]{.underline} Put simply, these studies point in the
same direction: **[Capitalism is not the problem. It is the solution ---
both economically and environmentally.]{.underline}**

#### **Yale's EPI index proves capitalist countries have the best environmental performance** 

**Zitelmann, 20** \-\-- Contributor to Forbes (Rainer Zitelmann,
\"'System Change Not Climate Change': Capitalism And Environmental
Destruction\", 7-13-2020, Forbes,

But isn't there a price for this growth: environment devastation? Of
course, nobody would deny that industrialization causes environmental
problems. But [the **assertion that growth automatically leads to ever
accelerating environmental degradation is simply false**. Yale
University's [Environmental Performance
Index](https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2020/component/epi) (EPI) uses
16 indicators to rank countries on environmental health, air quality,
water, biodiversity, natural resources and pollution]{.underline}.
[These indicators have been selected to reflect both the current
baseline and the dynamics of national ecosystems]{.underline}. One of
the [Index's most striking findings is that there is a strong
correlation between a state's wealth and its environmental performance.
Most developed capitalist countries achieve high environmental
standards.]{.underline} Those [countries with the worst EPI
scores]{.underline}, such as Ethiopia, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger,
are all poor. They [have both low investment capacity for
infrastructure, including water and sanitation, and tend to have weak
environmental regulatory authorities.]{.underline} Contrary to
prevailing perceptions, [industrial development and technological
advances have contributed significantly to relieving the burden on the
environment.]{.underline} Both Indur Goklany in his book The Improving
State of the World and Steven Pinker in chapter ten ("The Environment")
of his book Enlightenment Now demonstrate that [we are not only living
longer, healthier lives in unprecedented prosperity, but we are also
doing so on a comparatively clean planet.]{.underline} [Researchers have
confirmed that economic
freedom](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/pubs/ftc/stroup.pdf)---in
**other words, [more capitalism]{.underline}**[---**leads to higher, not
lower, environmental quality**.]{.underline} Every year, the Heritage
Foundation compiles its [Index of Economic
Freedom](https://www.heritage.org/index/book/chapter-4), which analyzes
individual levels of economic freedom, and thus capitalism, in countries
around the world. The Heritage Foundation's researchers also measure the
correlation between each country's environmental performance and its
economic freedom. The results couldn't be clearer: [the world's most
economically free countries achieve the highest environmental
performance rankings with an average score of 76.1, followed by the
countries that are "mostly free," which score an average of 69.5. In
stark contrast, the economically "repressed" and "mostly unfree"
countries all score less than 50 for environmental
performance.]{.underline}

### AT: Structural violence

#### Capitalism sustains life by reducing hunger and poverty -- Socialism doesn't Zitelmann, 20 \-\-- Contributor to Forbes (Rainer Zitelmann, \"'System Change Not Climate Change': Capitalism And Environmental Destruction\", 7-13-2020, Forbes, https://www.forbes.com/sites/rainerzitelmann/2020/07/13/system-change-not-climate-change-capitalism-and-environmental-destruction/?sh=413d7ba16d72)//EG

As one argument would have it, capitalism is responsible for the
destruction of the environment because capitalism is based on growth.
And yes, [capitalism has led to tremendous economic growth. But without
this growth, an ever-expanding world population would not have been able
to provide even the most basic necessities.]{.underline} After all, in
1800, there were just one billion people on the planet; today there are
more than seven billion. **Economic Growth Helps To Combat Hunger And
Poverty** [It is all the more astonishing that, despite this rapid
population growth, the world has not been overcome by rampant
poverty]{.underline}. Looking back to 1800, most people in the world
were extremely poor---average incomes were the same as they are in the
poorest countries in Africa today and more than 90% of the global
population was living in extreme poverty. [The development of capitalism
and economic growth reduced the proportion of extremely poor people in
the world to less than 10%---despite the sevenfold increase in the
global population during this same period.]{.underline} So growth is not
a bad thing in and of itself. In fact, **[growth has led to a reduction
in hunger and poverty]{.underline}**. [Life expectancy at birth has
increased more than twice as much in the last century as in the previous
200,000 years. The probability of a child born today reaching retirement
age is higher than the probability of previous generations ever
celebrating their fifth birthdays]{.underline}. In 1900, the average
life expectancy worldwide was 31 years; today it stands at 71 years. Of
the roughly 8,000 generations of Homo sapiens since our species emerged
approximately 200,000 years ago, only the last four have experienced
massive declines in mortality rates. In the last 140 years there have
been 106 major famines, each of which has cost more than 100,000 lives.
[The **death toll has been particularly high in socialist countries**
such as the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, Ethiopia and North Korea,
killing tens of millions of people through the forced transfer of
private means of production to public economies and the weaponization of
hunger. On its own, the biggest socialist experiment in history, Mao's
Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s killed more than 45 million
Chinese.]{.underline} The [number of deaths due to major famines fell to
1.4 million per year in the 1990s---not least as a result of the
collapse of socialist systems worldwide and China increasingly embracing
capitalism]{.underline}. In the first two decades of the 21st century
approximately 600,000 people perished of hunger. That is equivalent to
roughly 2% of the death toll from the early 20th century---despite the
fact that the global population is four times larger today than it was
back then.

### Feminism

#### Capitalist tech developments enabled women to join the labor force and opportunities for income allows investment in education -- socialism counters this **Stefano, 19 \-\-- Executive VP & Chief Strategy Officer at Commonwealth Foundation and Fellow at Independent Women's Forum. (Jennifer Stefano, Opinion Contributor, \"Feminists should thank God for capitalism\", 4-25-2019, Hill, https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/440477-feminists-should-thank-god-for-capitalism/)//EG**

When it comes to feminism, "t's the economy, stupid." Pantsuits didn't
liberate women; washing machines did --- and we have American capitalism
to thank for that. So, why are so many self-styled feminists trying to
tear down capitalism? Take, for example, Rep. [Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez](https://thehill.com/people/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-2/)
(D-N.Y.), popularly known as AOC. She calls herself a feminist, even
fronting as a suffragette at national events. But her socialist [Green
New
Deal](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5729033/Green-New-Deal-FINAL.pdf)
won't make American women more independent. As a feminist myself, I know
it will create a whole new category of "kept" women --- this time
dependent upon government instead of a man. {mosads}Big government is a
sugar daddy by another name. Expanding it will set women back 100 years.
AOC's "new deal" would stifle the very thing that got us this far. We'll
never achieve equal opportunity and prosperity for women until we
finally accept that women have what it takes to make it in the free
market --- [where jobs aren't
guaranteed](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cnbc.com_2019_02_08_alexandria-2Docasio-2Dcortez-2Dnew-2Dgreen-2Ddeal-2Djobs-2Dguarantee-2Dwhat-2Dto-2Dexpect.html&d=DwMFAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=AA442jMvbCURPtZiNmMNtJBnripGQYCHw7_DqJFkmec&m=wbVK7wvJj8CQOlZVvNVIYxI5yeIUW595_LnU3ubm_1M&s=c5vrvr-wNAwJfDhQtHfDMn9X0ARNOGk83ru3oJKVSxM&e=).
Instead we need to guarantee that all women are free to utilize their
skills and talents to help each other, and themselves, without
government interference. [Over the past 200 years, the **free market has
driven unprecedented technological advances that benefited women** --- a
fact highlighted in the famous "[kitchen

between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev. In 1959, the United States opened an exhibit in Moscow to
display the innovations our country was producing. It featured
labor-saving devices for the home that more than 450 American companies
built explicitly for women, and which --- as Nixon crowed to Khrushchev
--- nearly any American could afford.]{.underline} That exchange was
about more than one-upping the Russians. [Those appliances were
transformative, enabling our grandmothers and mothers to leave behind
scrub boards, hand wringers and coal ovens and enter the labor force en
masse. Now, U.S. women are free to outwork men in the business
world.]{.underline} Professor [Ann E.
Cudd](https://www.provost.pitt.edu/content/ann-e-cudd), a founding
member of the [Society for Analytical
Feminism](https://sites.google.com/site/analyticalfeminism/) and the
provost and senior vice chancellor at the University of Pittsburgh, adds
[**women's education to the laundry list of capitalism's
benefits**.]{.underline} "[By providing an opportunity for an income
independent of their male relatives, \[capitalism\] provides women with
the ability to advocate for their education or to directly invest in
their own and their daughters' education]{.underline}," she writes in
her book, "[Capitalism, For and Against: A Feminist
Debate](https://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Against-Feminist-Ann-Cudd/dp/0521132118)."
If you look at female accomplishments --- [from high school and college

rates to income growth --- we are crushing it. [Automation, information
technology and other outgrowths of capitalism are allowing women to
compete and win in traditionally male-dominated fields.]{.underline}
Clearly, [America's free-market system is a beacon to the world showing
how to empower women in technology, business, education and other
sectors.]{.underline} AOC's plans would change all that, but why? [In
socialist countries where government regulation and ownership dominate
the economy, we don't see women with opportunities for career success.
There, many women struggle to survive under the thumb of a bureaucracy
that might as well be the patriarchy reincarnate. Socialism breeds
corruption, not female empowerment]{.underline}. Travel to socialist
Venezuela, where the [United Nations reports less than 1 percent of the

You can't pull even with men when you are fighting for your life.
**[Socialism empowers that system, not the women in it. In contrast, the
free market goes hand and hand with a free, just and civil
society.]{.underline}** For years, misogynists have claimed women are
helpless --- that we can't think or provide for ourselves. [The
capitalist system has allowed women to rack up accomplishments that
proved them all wrong]{.underline}. Now, AOC and other progressive
lawmakers [embracing
socialism](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrat-rejects-socialism-calls-herself-a-proud-capitalist)
want to take it all away by having us become "kept" women, dependent on
and under the thumb of an overreaching government. We don't need it.
It's time for the socialists to get out of our way and keep government
out of our business.

#### Cap benefits women - Creation of factories helped women escape rural gender roles, individualism breaks down sexist norms, and markets empower equality and freedom

**Follett, 17** \-\-- Policy Analyst and Managing Editor of
HumanProgress.Org (Chelsea Follett, \"Why Feminists Should Embrace
Capitalism\", 5/15/17, Cato Institute,
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/why-feminists-should-embrace-capitalism)//EG>

- **AT: IT'S THE CATO INSTITUTE** -- yes it is but that isn't a reason
  to ignore the ev -- the card doesn't make baseless claims it has clear
  warrants -- don't discount them, and the author bases her writing on
  data and information from 2 other credible professors in the field and
  even answers competing arguments

Does capitalism help or hurt women is an enduring question. And one that
a fascinating book, [Capitalism, For and Against: a Feminist
Debate](http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/philosophy/political-philosophy/capitalism-and-against-feminist-debate?format=PB&isbn=9780521132114)
(Cambridge University Press), seeks to answer that question. Philosophy
professors Ann Cudd of Boston University and Nancy Holmstrom of Rutgers
University both want more freedom and higher material living standards
for women. But they disagree on how to achieve that goal. One thinks
capitalism is the answer; the other socialism. Their differences boil
down to two points: how capitalism has affected women to date, and the
viability of alternative systems to improve a woman's lot. The
professors may disagree --- yet the data sides overwhelmingly with
capitalism. When it comes to material living standards, Cudd presents
page after page of evidence to demonstrate "that [capitalism has brought
about a massive improvement in life for human beings" by reducing
poverty and spurring technological innovations in, for example,
healthcare. Death in [infancy](http://humanprogress.org/story/2386) or
[childbirth](http://humanprogress.org/story/2391) is much rarer that it
once was. Family sizes are smaller, since children generally survive
into adulthood. And women's options have multiplied as a
result.]{.underline} Holmstrom, however, claims that capitalism has
lessened women's material well‐​being; it has, she says, exacerbated
inequality, which she conflates with poverty. Cudd counters that [those
who care about women's welfare should focus on poverty, which is at a
[historic low](http://humanprogress.org/static/3180).]{.underline} Yet
Holmstrom does not want to count any past socialist system as truly
socialist --- which in turn shows her bias. But giving women the freedom
to flee rural penury in order to work in factories, counters Holmstrom,
has made them worse off. "The lives of subsistence peasants may be
limited, but materially adequate and stable," she writes. She thinks
factory jobs "seldom provide a way out of poverty". Cudd answers that
the world's poorest people are overwhelmingly rural, performing informal
subsistence agricultural labour: "Global capitalism has not changed
their lives very much; they live much as their ancestors did." [As the
data shows, **factory work has, indeed, helped women escape both
[poverty](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/how-t-shirt-saves-world)
and the stricter [gender
roles](http://humanprogress.org/blog/freedom-and-the-factory-girls) of
rural areas**. And while Holmstrom implies that the world's poor prefer
agricultural drudgery to urban work, the ongoing global migration from
rural areas to cities provides evidence to the contrary. Capitalism,
says Cudd, has not just **liberated women from the fields but helped
society to see them as individuals**. It promotes not only material
progress, but also social innovation, which has helped [break
down](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/15280/ACudd_JofBusinessEthics_21May2014.pdf?sequence=1)
those old prejudices such as sexism. "Capitalism derives its primary
justification from the maximisation of individual liberty," she says,
"**and capitalist societies promulgate the ideology of individualism,
which helps to break down ... sexist norms and
practices."**]{.underline} Indeed, [**the capitalist worldview subverts
sexism and other forms of collective prejudice** --- just look at how it
eroded [India's caste
system](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/capitalisms-assault-on-the-indian-caste-system).]{.underline}
"[Capitalism reduces the oppression of traditional societies that impose
hierarchies of gender and caste]{.underline}," writes Cudd, [because
embedded within market exchange itself is the idea that each individual
should be free to pursue her self‐​interest. **Market participation**
also increases women's bargaining power within society, **empowering
them to lobby for legal equality and greater freedom**]{.underline}.
Holmstrom, on the other hand, defines freedom as negative liberty
(freedom from interference) and what some philosophers call positive
liberty (the means to act). To be free, Holmstrom contends, a woman
needs adequate material resources and an environment of social
tolerance. But [capitalism has actually increased freedom as Holmstrom
conceives it --- by [reducing](http://humanprogress.org/static/3469)
poverty and
[encouraging](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3750637.html)
social tolerance]{.underline}. As the philosopher Jason Brennan
[noted](https://books.google.com/books?id=p-Gqy-JAso8C&source=gbs_navlinks_s),
"as a matter of historical fact, protecting negative liberties is the
most important and effective way of promoting positive liberty".
Holmstrom is resistant to this view, observing that some capitalist
states deny their citizens freedom outside the economic realm. But then,
aren't dictatorships that at least allow their citizens economic freedom
(Chile under Pinochet) better than anti‐​capitalist dictatorships (modern
Venezuela)? After all, [capitalism fosters [the
conditions](http://humanprogress.org/blog/chile-is-thriving-so-why-is-socialism-rising)
for people to escape poverty and ultimately [demand
more](http://www.humansandnature.org/culture-how-capitalism-changes-conscience)
personal and political freedoms.]{.underline} The debate is complicated
by the fact that the professors disagree over how to define a capitalist
state. For example, Cudd and Holmstrom both denote Sweden and similar
states with high social spending as capitalist, but Cudd does not count
oligarchic states such as Saudi Arabia as such. And Holmstrom insists
that the exclusion of such states makes for a biased "persuasive
definition" of capitalism. Yet Holmstrom does not want to count any past
socialist system as truly socialist --- which in turn shows her bias.
Cudd notes that [capitalism [compares
favourably](http://humanprogress.org/) on practically every indicator of
human wellbeing to the socialism practised by the Soviet Union, Maoist
China, and Cuba today.]{.underline} [Holmstrom, bizarrely, alleges that
the Soviet and Maoist systems helped women, and praises the Soviet Union
for offering "free" childcare and laundry services.]{.underline} One
might respond that if a woman must resort to
[cannibalising](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4076244/Distressing-photos-1920s-Russian-famine-turned-hopeless-peasants-cannibals-five-million-people-starved-death.html)
her own children to survive a manmade famine (as
[thousands](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/the_spectator/2011/02/stalins_cannibals.html)
did while millions of others died starving), endure
[rape](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/206817/inside-dark-michael-ledeen)
in a gulag ("rape was so common as to be considered routine"), or face
[execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milada_Hor%C3%A1kov%C3%A1) for
political dissent, then laundry services do not meaningfully improve her
situation. While Holmstrom thinks those states helped women, she
believes no society has ever truly given "the people" (rather than a
bureaucracy) control over the means of production. She does admit she is
comparing capitalism to an imagined ideal of socialism. And anticipating
charges of Utopianism, she points out that many major social changes
such as women's suffrage once seemed unreachable. Yet ultimately, she
offers little in the way of evidence that her vision wouldn't fail like
[all of the other](https://www.cato.org/events/socialism-human-nature)
socialist experiments throughout history. There, is after all, ample
data on [where that road
leads](https://capx.co/socialisms-true-legacy-is-immorality/) --- and it
is hardly a paradise for workers, women or anyone else.

#### **Patriarchy is the root cause of war -- pressure to fulfil gender roles and ideas of protection and domination**

**Hasan, 20 \-\--** Graduate in MA Conflict Analysis and Peace building
(Ateka Hasan, \"[Gender Relations as the Root Cause of Militarization
and War]{.underline}\", 10-24-2020, NIICE,
https://niice.org.np/archives/6386)//EG

Analysing the causes of war has been an important area of study in the
International relations for decades. Many agree that it has several
dimensions attached to it, which are all interconnected or in relation
with each other and play out together. According to Brian Fogarty, all
wars have immediate causes, antecedent causes, and root causes. All
these causes work together, through the means of intersectionality. For
him, the immediate causes are mostly around economic needs and
motivations. He believes that countries go to war for increasing their
economic resources and capability. For example, the valuable minerals in
African countries today can be seen to play an important role in its
violent conditions. The second dimension, which is the antecedent cause,
are the ethno-nationalist's issues or foreign-ness. This, here, brings
to focus the most contemporary issue, of nationalism, which is one of
the most prevalent factors in the today's chaotic world. The war may
thus be influenced by the need for recognition or autonomy. The biggest
defining factor of such causes are the propagandas which openly promote
hate speech and othering of other communities. For example, the Rwandan
genocide was a civil war which was heavily motivated by
ethno-nationalistic desires. [The third dimension]{.underline}, which is
probably one of [the most important]{.underline} ones [and yet highly
neglected]{.underline} one, [are the root causes or favourable
conditions]{.underline}. [This dimension refers to the culture of the
society which indirectly promotes violence and violent
behaviour.]{.underline} And [a cultural aspect which is heavily
ignored]{.underline} by scholars [is]{.underline} the [patriarchal
gender relations]{.underline} prevalent in the society. [The
**patriarchal structure of the society gives way to the rise of
militarization**. This culture of masculinity and militarism *makes war
thinkable* and a solution to uphold pride. Majority of the times the
emotions of **frustration and humiliation motivate violent
behaviours**]{.underline} within a society. And while these emotions can
be an outcome of many things, [a major cause is the pressure for men to
fulfil the gender roles]{.underline}. Living [in a patriarchal society,
men are expected to carry out a certain set of responsibilities like
supporting the family, or being a protector to the weaker
sex]{.underline}. However, in contemporary times, women have been taking
the initiatives to improve their family situations after wars affect
their family's livelihood, leading to their displacement. For example,
since 1975 Angola has been divided by conflict. This had led to the
migration of many families. This situation created a difficult task for
men to work because they were not that privy to the concept of
adjustment, whereas women managed to quickly get accustomed to them
(women) becoming the new bread winners. This meant that the men would
have to stay home and live the domesticated life, while women will carry
out the financial burden. This change in the gender role was not
accompanied by change in the ideological structure, and thus led to
aggravating men's sense of failure and frustration. It is important to
note here, that nobody goes to war for gender reasons, but gender is an
antecedent that makes it possible. According to a tentative model of
possible links to gender identities and conflict given by Judy El-
Bushra, [it is these negative emotions and sense of failure which
leads]{.underline} to the secondary impacts of conflict (these include
[depression, suicide, militarization, violent crime, domestic friction,
inter-generational conflict), which eventually lead to breakdown of
social structures -- leading to distorted gender identities, ultimately
leading to conflict]{.underline}. Thus, patriarchy is a very critical
component in relating the culture to the cause of war, because, as Betty
Reardon pointed out, [**Patriarchy invented war and maintains war** to
hold in place the social order it had spawned. It is, thus, imperative
to understand and analyse war as a system (gendered order that makes war
possible), as a cultural thing and as a continuum.]{.underline} All
these dimensions eventually lead to the rise of violent characteristics
in the society, mainly in the perspectives of the males. [The aspect of
violence is inherently linked to the system of power, which is a common
subpoint in patriarchal structures. Power can further be]{.underline}
divided into three dimensions, mainly, [economic power, ethnic or
national power]{.underline} (for e.g. White supremacy), [and gender
power.]{.underline} These dimensions are similar to Fogarty's causes,
however, studying the causes of war through the link of power, provides
with an additional understanding through 'intersectionality' and
'positionality'. These concepts allow for an understanding of an
individual's sense of self, which is derived by where he or she
positions himself or herself in all these dimensions of power[. The
matter of self becomes significant here, because power is practiced by
people when they want to be superior to an inferior and exploit
other]{.underline}. The relations here can be of a rich man and
labourer, a citizen and a foreigner, and a woman as the property of man.
[This **need to dominate over the inferior other eventually leads to
violence**]{.underline} (through coercion, or force). The main issue
here posits [the desire for accumulation of more wealth, which leads to
the condition of being civilized]{.underline}. But as noted by William
Eckhardt, [the more civilized the people became, the more warlike they
became]{.underline}. [This relation of power with patriarchy and
militarization or use of force, goes to show that a war is caused
because of all these dimensions]{.underline}, and neither can be at play
without the other two. This indicates the point which feminist scholars
have been trying to make for many years; which is that gender relations
are an important part of any society and have their roots in its
functioning. They try to bring attention to the fact that analysing a
war without really capturing the gender drama, would be an incomplete
study. However, most theories of sociology and international relations
do ignore this element, and criticize the feminist authors for being
trivial and not paying attention to the big picture. On this point
Cynthia Enloe has raised the question, of considering the real big
picture to include the gender dimension. The ignorance, which the topic
of gender has faced up until now, is one of the major reasons behind the
continued rise in masculinization and patriarchy in the societal
structures. Its absence has led to the major gap in understanding a
major component in war. Thus, [gender relations are one of the root
causes of militarization and war.]{.underline} The societies which we
live in are heavily monopolized by a patriarchal narrative. [This
narrative reinforces the cliched understanding, which is that men need
to protect the women, because they are weaker, and thus need to be
protected. The **notion of protection provides the men with the
justification for enforcing violence and going to war.**]{.underline}
With the continued subjugation of the women in domestic spheres, the
gender narrative after war is also similar to war, sometimes even worse.
Which is why many anti-war women's organisations like *Vimochana*, in
Bangalore, said, "we didn't start as women against war, but as women
against violence against women." Because while the sexualization of war
might be a different violent act taking place during war, but women in
their every-day lives face violence of some kind already. [Additionally,
the claims of men for peace act as a paradox, for they believe that the
path for peace is through war. Even the post-war scenarios are so
disastrous that the type of peace and security achieved is not really
peace, particularly for women]{.underline}. This goes to show that
masculinization of the societal structures inevitably leads to war,
however, as Laurel stone has reviewed, encouraging the participation of
women increases the chances of ending the violence within a year by 24
percent. Even Mary Caprioli, has studied the correlation between gender
equality indicators and a country's propensity for peacefulness. This
can also be brought about by aiming to demilitarize the arms arena
leading to a change in masculinity- which holds as a very strong
component in militarization of the society. Apart from this an important
element which has hardly been touched upon under masculinity is the
topic of homosexuality, which faces a lot of brunt for not matching the
characteristics of true masculinity. R.W. Connell showed the variation
in masculinity. He points out to the refusal of the homosexual men to
conform to patriarchal norms and manhood, and participate in the
militaristic aspect.

#### Patriarchy destroys the environment

**Ahmed, 15 \-\--** Dr. Nafeez Ahmed is an investigative journalist,
bestselling author, and international security scholar. He is a regular
contributor to The Ecologist where he writes about the geopolitics of
interconnected environmental, energy and economic crises (Nafeez Ahmed,
\"Patriarchy is killing our planet\", 13/3/15, Ecologist,
<https://theecologist.org/2015/mar/13/patriarchy-killing-our-planet-women-alone-can-save-her)//EG>

The systemic marginalization and repression of women is not an
accidental feature of our civilizational crisis. It is an integral and
fundamental pillar of the pervasive injustice of the global system. [The
global epidemic of violence toward women is inherently bound up with our
male-dominated system of violence toward the natural world as a
whole.]{.underline} The rapist, the abuser, is no different from an
insatiable tyrant, a slave to his sadistic appetites, unconcerned by the
pain inflicted in the process of satiating them. Just as violence
against women is about power, [self-gratification through dominance and
control, extreme egoism and narcissism, and ultimately a lack of empathy
bordering on psychopathology, so ultimately is our systemic violence
against nature.]{.underline} Throughout [the course of our exploitative
plundering of]{.underline} planetary [resources in the pursuit of
endless material growth, the global system continues its asymmetric war
on women, just as it annihilates species, destroys eco-systems, and
exhausts resources for the profit and power of a tiny minority. The
gender divide is not]{.underline} just [a mirror image of humanity\'s
external dislocation from nature: it is both a symptom and driver of
that dislocation.]{.underline} But it is not working. Contemporary
global capitalism might be making some people richer, but it is making
more people poorer and unhappier, in a context of accelerating
uncertainty and conflict. And by the end of this century at least, we
face the prospect, according to the consensus of our best scientific
minds, of [a largely uninhabitable planet if we continue
business-as-usual. The global system is failing, and the mass murder,
abuse and murder of women by men is central to that failure: *misogyny
is an integral function of planetary destruction*. **If we want to save
the planet, patriarchy must die.**]{.underline} That means recognizing
and taking responsibility for the fact that patriarchy is integral to
the structures of power we take for granted, across East and West.
There\'s no no time to waste. [If misogyny wins, the planet
dies.]{.underline}

## Cap sustainable

#### Cap sustainable -- incentive to stretch recourses and responsibility to consumers allows less consumption than socialism

As Republicans gear up for 2020, [new
polling](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016c-8a3e-d2ec-ad6c-ce7f7eb90001)
from the [American Action
Network](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016c-8a3d-d895-a5ee-bbbd3e5d0002)
suggests that they would do well to hold their capitalist roots. Among
the results, the polling found that in a split sample, highlighting
"socialist" policies like the Green New Deal moved suburban women and 18
to 44-year-old voters toward conservative policies and away from liberal
policies. Republicans have notoriously struggled with the youth vote,
and it's no secret that the millennial generation shares a [deep
concern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephcoughlin/2018/05/05/greener-than-you-boomers-gen-x-millennials-score-themselves-on-the-environment/#20d990354d8b)
for the environment. This information could be key to Republicans as
they head into climate and environmental debates this fall. While AAN's
polling may indicate a simple PR battle, the conservative ideology has
it right on the economics and impact of capitalism versus socialism on
our environment. As pointed out by [Marion
Tuby](https://fee.org/articles/there-is-nothing-green-about-socialism/)
of Human Progress, environmental harm will assuredly always be a factor
in human activity and production. There is no economic system in which
people can thrive and progress with absolutely zero environmental
impact. Because of this, we must stop looking at which economic system
entirely avoids environmental damage, but instead, determine which
system best mitigates that harm. With a simple [compare and
contrast](https://www.perc.org/2019/05/17/socialism-is-bad-for-the-environment/),
the choice is clear: capitalism wins every time. [**In no other economy
do producers have such a responsibility to consumers and to their
resources as they do under capitalism**. Free-market societies require
excellent business practices. If you do not treat your fellow man with
the best of intentions, if you do not follow sustainable business
practices, and if you do not responsibly manage your resources,
consumers have the option to leave for a competitor. You will have a
surplus of goods with no buyers, and your business will fail. It is in
the best interest of everyone to do business well. Believing that
corporations and the market will do well is not an idealist fantasy of
the right --- it happens every day. Delta Airlines works with The Nature
Conservancy to voluntarily [offset carbon
emissions](https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/about-delta/corporate-responsibility/carbon-emissions-calculator.html)]{.underline}.
Madewell gives their customers [[a \$20
discount]{.underline}](https://www.madewell.com/inspo-do-well-denim-recyling-recycle-your-jeans-with-us-a-very-animated-how-to-video-111518.html)
on new jeans when they bring in an old pair. Those old jeans are then
donated to Habitat for Humanity to be upcycled into housing insulation.
[Patagonia recently saved \$10 million dollars through tax cuts and
[planned to
donate](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/28/patagonia-money-saved-trump-tax-cut-environmental-cause/2143733002/)
that sum to conservation and charity organizations. Companies are able
to do this because they make a profit and feel a responsibility to their
consumers, who are a demographic made up widely of hikers, hunters and
others who enjoy outdoor recreation]{.underline}. Patagonia understands
that stewardship and conservation are key components to their business,
and they are willing to invest their own funds to maintain the amenities
their customer base so utilizes. [These corporate sustainability
practices are simply not possible under socialism. Under capitalism,
there is an **incentive to stretch your resources**, and to make more
with less and therefore stretching what you have without creating waste.
Businesses are then able to invest profits back into their product and
scale up as the market demands. **No natural incentives exist under
socialism because the conservation of resources serves no direct benefit
to production**. Additionally, those who consume resources have no
responsibility to those who are most impacted by consumption. As a
result, excessive product is often produced to the point where there is
no longer a demand, which in turn drives up the cost of goods to make up
for lost resources.]{.underline} While capitalism may have a bad
reputation for driving consumerism and always wanting "more, more,
more," the inverse is actually true. [Capitalism does not cause
consumption --- it can only respond to it. Without a market demand to
guide socialist central planners, such a check does not aide socialism
in the same way.]{.underline} A critique provided by Soviet economists
Nikolai Shmelev and Vladimir Popov observed such a model of poor
resource allocation. They noted, "[[to bolster the production of gloves,
the Soviet government more than doubled the price it paid for moleskin.
Warehouses soon filled with mole pelts, but glovemakers were unable to
use them all, so many
rotted.](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/03/socialism-is-bad-for-the-environment/)"]{.underline}
The single illustration of government-influenced excess is not uncommon.
The root of this problem is summed up quite easily: Socialist central
planners are simply unable to administer resources as effectively as a
market of supply and demand. Economic theory and real-world case-studies
prove that capitalism can be clean --- Republicans need only get the
messaging right. While there is no perfect economic system, we ought to
be promoting the one proven to provide the safest, most innovative
environmental solutions. [Capitalism is the only system through which
competition enables both the economy and the environment to
thrive]{.underline}. Environmentally-minded voters would do well to
remember that a socialist economy would be detrimental to the
environment. [We've seen it before: Socialism doesn't work on an
economic level, and it certainly doesn't work on an environmental level,
either.]{.underline} Republicans should use this point in demonstrating
how capitalism benefits the world around us in more ways than one.

## Communism Fails

### Environment

#### Communism dooms the environment due to need for superiority, maximizing employment, consumption, and consumerism -- China proves

**Smith, 20** \-\-- Richard Smith is an economic historian and
commentator on China, capitalism, and the environment.(Richard Smith,

China's bureaucratic rulers are driven by three imperatives that are at
least as powerful, if not more powerful, drivers of hyper-growth than
profit maximization under capitalism . [First, they must maximize
economic growth and self-sufficient industrialization. As a]{.underline}
state-based ruling class and [communist nation in a world dominated
by]{.underline} more advanced and powerful [capitalist nations, Mao and
his successors understood]{.underline}, like the Soviet Union, [that
they must "**catch up and overtake the United States**": build
relatively
[self-sufficient](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/business/china-trade-manufacturing-europe.html)
[high tech superpower
economies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/china-has-a-new-1-4-trillion-plan-to-overtake-the-u-s-in-tech?sref=4KuSK5Q1)
shielded from Western takeover by [barring foreign investment in key
state sectors like energy, rails, telecom,
etc.](https://www.ft.com/content/719b1134-d763-11e4-94b1-00144feab7de),
protecting state industries against foreign competitors, and so
on.]{.underline} The Soviets' failure to win the economic and arms race
with the United States doomed the Soviet Communist Party. Mao's
successor as leader, Deng Xiaoping and those following him, notably Xi
Jinping, have been determined to avoid that error. **[Environmental
concerns come a far second behind the fear of economically induced
collapse.]{.underline}** Secondly, [they must maximize employment. In
capitalist economies, employers have no obligation to the unemployed. If
workers are laid off, it's not the capitalists' problem. It's not even
the government's problem---]{.underline}except in severe downturns like
the Great Depression when they could face unrest or even revolt. But
[because the CCP was once a workers' party, and because it derives its
legitimacy from its status as the self-appointed representative of the
working class, it can't completely ignore the workers.]{.underline} And
it's better to have them producing something than just milling about
producing nothing. That's why [the government seeks to keep them busy:
by generating jobs]{.underline}. Five-year plans regularly include job
creation targets. In November 2013, Premier Li Keqiang underscored this
imperative, saying: "Employment is the biggest thing for well-being. The
government must not slacken on this for one moment. ... For us, [stable
growth is mainly for the sake of maintaining
employment](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/international/chinas-leaders-confront-economic-fissures.html)."
[Yet keeping China's hundreds of millions of workers working often means
producing superfluous steel, needless infrastructure, ghost cities, etc.
**Maximizing employment is a major driver of overproduction,
over-construction, so-called blind growth and blind investment, and
profligate waste of energy and resources across the
economy.**]{.underline} And finally, [they must maximize consumption and
consumerism]{.underline}. In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
Communist Party in 1991 and the Chinese Communists' own near-death
experience with the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, [the party
leadership resolved to create a mass consumer economy and raise incomes,
in order to focus people's attention on consumption and take their minds
off politics]{.underline}. That's why, ever since the early 1990s,
successive [Five-Year Plans have prioritized new consumer industries and
the government has promoted one consumer craze after another: cars;
condos; shopping malls; tourism; golf courses; theme parks; bike
sharing; cruise boats; food delivery; online shopping, and
[more](http://en.people.cn/n3/2020/0721/c90000-9712803.html).]{.underline}
To this end, the government has also partnered with and backed private
capitalists like Jack Ma's e-commerce giant Alibaba to promote shopping,
the movie industry, video gaming, theme parks, tourism, social media,
and more. State banks went into the mortgage business to promote housing
speculation, then created a consumer credit industry to keep consumers
focused on making money to spend on new trinkets. Housing privatization
promoted the growth of furniture, home decoration, and renovation
markets, spurring yet more growth---and all of this, the government
constantly reminds its citizens, is thanks to the glorious Communist
Party. No doubt after centuries of privation and decades of Maoist
austerity, China's masses were overdue for some creature comforts. But
the promotion of mindless consumerism for the sake of consumerism on the
model of Western capitalism is contributing mightily to China's and the
world's
[waste](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1001003/the-mountains-of-takeout-trash-choking-chinas-cities)
and
[pollution](https://www.scmp.com/article/1711744/china-produces-about-third-plastic-waste-polluting-worlds-oceans-says-report)
crises. Less enviable among China's many firsts is this headline, from
the China Daily: "China No. 1 dumper of plastic into ocean." The problem
with all of this is that [to **maximize economic growth, employment, and
consumerism, China's leaders have no choice but to let the polluters
pollute**. There's just no way around that.]{.underline} This tendency
is further exacerbated in China's case because as nationalists concerned
with self-reliance, [the government strives to rely on China's own
energy resources: mostly coal, because it's available nearly everywhere
and 24/7]{.underline}. That's why, rather than rely mainly on
intermittent renewables or the world market for oil and natural gas
(though it imports those, too), Xi's government is firing up more
coal-fired power plants. [In short, in **their race to overtake the
United States, China's leaders find they must prioritize hyper-growth
over the environment, even if this ends in global climate collapse and
eco-suicide.**]{.underline}

#### Communist imperatives are causing China to lead the world in increasing CO2 emissions -- US emissions are declining

Smith, 20 \-\-- Richard Smith is an economic historian and commentator
on China, capitalism, and the environment.(Richard Smith, \"The Chinese
Communist Party Is an Environmental Catastrophe\", 7-27-2020, Foreign

As China struggles to recover economically from the impact of the
pandemic, it is set to deal a painful blow to global efforts to fight
climate change. The [party has often sacrificed environmental
regulations as soon as GDP targets and economic growth have been
threatened, thus industrial or trade decline paradoxically produces
soaring pollution]{.underline}. But even in normal times, China's
soaring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a massive part of the dire
threat to all life on earth posed by climate change. While it's often
reported that [China's CO2 levels lead the world, few appreciate the
scale: how disproportionate they are compared to other large emitters;
the speed of their growth; and the **impossibility of reining them as
long as the CCP remains in power**]{.underline}. In 1990, China's CO2
emissions were just half those of the United States. In the next 15
years they more than doubled, overtaking the United States. Then in just
12 years, from 2005 to 2017, China's emissions nearly doubled again to
[more than twice those of the United
States](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china) (13,110
million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, or mtCO2e, compared with 6,457
million)---although China's GDP was only 63 percent as large as the U.S.
GDP in 2017. It's often said in China's defense that while its emissions
may lead the world, its per capita emissions are a fraction of those of
the United States and that America's historical emissions dwarf those of
China. Yet after three decades of breakneck growth, [China is catching
up fast. The country's per capita CO2 emissions surged past those of the
EU six years ago and are now just under half those of the United States
(7.45 mtCO2e vs. 15.56 mtCO2e in 2018). Yet China's per capita GDP was
just 15 percent that of the United States in 2018 (\$9,627 vs.
\$62,904).]{.underline} Similarly, [China's cumulative emissions between
1965 and 2018 are now more than two-thirds those of the United
States]{.underline}, and according to one assessment in Forbes, based on

atmospheric CO2 concentrations]{.underline}. And unlike elsewhere in the
developed world, [China's numbers are trending upward]{.underline}, not
down. And unlike elsewhere in the developed world, China's numbers are
trending upward, not down. [**Emissions from the United States have
declined** from the peak in 2007]{.underline}, and EU
nations---collectively the world's third largest emitter---have trended
downward for the past three decades. To be sure, those declines are far
from sufficient to reverse global warming. They're not even enough to
meet U.S. and EU commitments to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate
change. But at least they're declines. By contrast, [China's carbon
emissions have relentlessly grown, quadrupling between 1990 and 2017. As
the world's largest emitter, [accounting for 30 percent of total global
emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data)
against 15 percent for the United States]{.underline}, 9 percent for the
EU-28, 7 percent for India, 5 percent for Russia, and 4 percent for
Japan, China is by far the leading driver of global warming. The country
presents a climate crisis paradox. China is the largest producer of
photovoltaic panels and wind turbines; it leads the world in installed
capacity of both, accounting for about 30 percent of global total in
2018. It has invested more money in renewable energy and electric
vehicles than the rest of the world combined. Moreover, President Xi
Jinping stated his aspiration to lead the fight against global warming.
In June 2017, when President Donald Trump announced that the United
States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Xi termed it a "hard-won
achievement" that "all signatories must stick to." "Walking away from
the pact would endanger future generations," he said. Yet that's exactly
what Xi has done. As China's economy has rebounded from the coronavirus,
industrial pollution has surged. "As the world's largest carbon dioxide
emitter and as the first major economy to reopen after the crisis, all
eyes are on China," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst [Center for
Research on Energy and Clean Air
(CREA)](https://energyandcleanair.org/publications/coal-power-projects-accelerate-after-covid-19-lockdown-a-new-coal-boom-in-china/).
"It is essential for policymakers to prioritize clean energy and reduce
the country's economic reliance on highly polluting, energy-intensive
industries. But China's leaders are doing no such thing." Instead of
prioritizing clean energy, Xi's [government is [slashing funding for
wind and solar
power](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/10/134239/clean-energy-investments-are-plummeting-bloomberg-bnef/)
while [ramping up spending on new coal-fired power
plants](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/20/china-appetite-for-coal-power-stations-returns-despite-climate-pledge-capacity)]{.underline}.
That's an inevitable result not only of the post-pandemic economic
crisis but of the general slowing in the Chinese economy in the last few
years. For all of China's investments in renewables to date, solar and
wind produced barely 8 percent of the country's electric generation in
2018 (compared with [9 percent in the United
States](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php)
with [less than a third as much
investment](https://qz.com/1247527/for-every-1-the-us-put-into-renewable-energy-last-year-china-put-in-3/))
while [coal accounted for

percent. In the most optimistic Chinese government scenario, coal and
other fossil fuels will still provide at least two-thirds of China's
electricity until as late as 2050, by which time it will be too late to
matter. Similarly, instead of reducing reliance on highly polluting
energy-intensive industries, Xi's [government is pouring investments
into yet more unnecessary industries and infrastructure---more steel,
aluminum, plate glass, cars, and dozens of other commodities that are
already in oversupply, more unnecessary high-speed trains that run near
empty, more useless subway systems built in small towns, more empty
airports, more empty "ghost cities" even as the population is set to
decline,]{.underline} more gargantuan "blingfrastructure" vanity

world's largest radio telescope (which was finished in 2016 but [remains
unused](https://www.wired.com/story/china-fast-worlds-largest-telescope-tourists/)
because China has no qualified scientists to operate it), the world's
largest and second largest dams, the most skyscrapers, longest bridges,

#### Communist governments suppress resistance to their agenda and hide emissions so eco-responsibility is impossible

True, Western capitalist economies led by the United States are racing
China to the brink of climate collapse, and likewise cannot prioritize
people and planet over profit, as I've argued
[elsewhere](https://www.amazon.com/Green-Capitalism-God-that-Failed/dp/1848902050).
But what's uniquely dangerous about the [Chinese]{.underline} case is
that its [emissions are so huge, nearly a third of total global
emissions, and growing [so
fast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/china-s-carbon-dioxide-emissions-expand-fastest-since-2011?sref=4KuSK5Q1)
that scientists tell us they could eventually [doom the climate on their
own](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20140213/chinas-plan-clean-air-cities-will-doom-climate-scientists-say)
regardless of what the rest of the world does.]{.underline} And [while
citizens in the West (still) have the freedom to mobilize and fight
governments and companies whose emissions threaten our survival, and
their collective actions have in fact restrained---if not enough---the
growth of emissions in the United States and Europe, by contrast, the
Communist Party runs a totalitarian police state that ruthlessly
**suppresses all resistance to the party agenda.**]{.underline} In the

regardless of their environmental consequences. [Given the Great
Firewall, most Chinese people today **have no idea** that their country

**no legal means to organize and resist** the vainglorious but

rejuvenation" and glory for the Communist Party when Shanghai and
Shenzhen are underwater, when China's glaciers melt and its rivers dry
up, and when soaring temperatures and drought collapse farming across
the North China Plain. Even those in the leadership who do care about
the country's outsized emissions can't suppress them because that would
require pulling the emergency brake: **[shutting down and/or retrenching
China's overproducing, overpolluting industries---and that would doom
Xi's "China Dream" of global tech supremacy and Communist Party glory,
if not the party itself.]{.underline}**

### Unsustainable

#### Communism is unsustainable -- eliminates profits and losses which decimates economic guidance

**Carden, 20** \-\-- Art Carden is a Senior Fellow at the American
Institute for Economic Research. He is also an Associate Professor of
Economics at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama and a Research
Fellow at the Independent Institute. (Art Carden, \"What's Wrong With
Communism?\", 11-30-2020, AIER,
https://www.aier.org/article/whats-wrong-with-communism/)//EG

[What's wrong with communism?" It's a question I heard recently, and
while "pretty much everything" is accurate]{.underline}, it deserves a
bit of additional elaboration. Here are a few thoughts on what's wrong
with communism. As Bryan Caplan points out in [his article on
communism](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Communism.html) for the
Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, "Communism" and "socialism" were
basically synonyms until the Bolshevik Revolution. After that,
"communism" came to be more closely associated with the revolutionary
philosophy of Vladimir Lenin. The two terms can be used interchangeably,
and they basically mean "[a centrally planned economy in which the
government controls the means of
production](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Socialism.html)." In
[the Communist
Manifesto](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm),
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels write "the theory of the Communists may
be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property."
Later, Ludwig von Mises would write that "[socialism is the abolition of
rational economy." Means of production that are not privately owned
cannot be exchanged. Therefore, no market prices can emerge. Without
market prices, we don't get profits and losses. **Without profits and
losses, we don't learn whether or not we are using resources
wisel**y]{.underline} (producing things consumers want more urgently and
thereby earning profits) **[or wastefully]{.underline}** (producing
things consumers want less urgently and thereby earning losses).
[Profits and losses are informative, not decisive: there are a lot of
things that might be financially profitable that you might find morally
unacceptable.]{.underline} Maybe you could earn a handsome side income
writing college term papers on behalf of cheaters for an online essay
mill (and note that, as Jason Brennan and Peter Jaworski argue in their
2016 book Markets Without Limits, this would be wrong not because
profits are involved but because cheating is involved). [Furthermore,
there might be a lot of things that aren't profitable that you might
find obligatory.]{.underline} There are very few people who would say
that a market test is an appropriate way for me to determine whether or
not I should feed, clothe, and shelter my family. This, I think, is
where a lot of people get tripped up. Families are little socialist
enterprises governed by the principle "from each according to his
ability, to each according to his needs." The rules and norms that make
families or tribes work well don't map very well onto an extended order
populated by strangers. In a family, tribe, or club, people know one
another intimately and see one another regularly. The farther people get
from one another geographically and genetically, the less well they are
likely to know one another that well or see one another that often. Add
several millennia, widely varying conditions, and a lot of historical
accidents and you have almost eight billion people with different tastes
and talents. [As I explained last
summer](https://www.aier.org/article/why-i-am-not-a-socialist/),
[markets and market prices make rational economic calculation possible
in such a setting.]{.underline} A lot of self-described communists and
socialists are motivated by enthusiasm for communists' and socialists'
stated goals like equality, plenty, and dignity. They ask us to imagine
a brotherhood of man in which everyone has abundant food, clothing,
shelter, education, medical care, and other opportunities for
flourishing. [To oppose communism and socialism is not to question the
desirability of equality, plenty, and dignity]{.underline} However, just
as [opposing subsidies isn't opposing what's
subsidized](https://www.aier.org/article/opposing-subsidies-isnt-opposing-whats-subsidized-bastiats-lesson/),
[opposing communism isn't opposing equality, plenty, and
dignity.]{.underline} To paraphrase Thomas Sowell, we regularly find
ourselves talking past one another, with one group speaking in terms of
hoped-for results and the other group speaking in terms of the
characteristics of social processes. In the view of Sowell and a lot of
his intellectual allies, the social question is not "what specific
policies could we enact that might make the world a better place?"
Rather, it is "which institutions best facilitate cooperation among
strangers?"

#### The communist tenant of a moneyless society is impossible -- no incentive for production and can't quantify how to spend time and capital 

**Hersey and Walker-Werth, 22** \-\-- Jon Hersey is managing editor of
The Objective Standard and holds fellowships at Foundation for Economic
Education. Thomas Walker-Werth is associate editor of The Objective
Standard. He is an Ayn Rand Fellow with Foundation for Economic
Education\'s Hazlitt Project. He holds a master's degree in music from
Oxford Brookes University (Hersey, Jon, and Thomas Walker-Werth, \"Star
Trek, Marx, Maezawa, and the Moneyless Dream: Utopian or Dystopian?\",
spring 2022, *The Objective Standard*,

Although Marx considered himself a social scientist and economist\--and
although his ideas are still some of the most widely taught\--they
aren\'t much taught in social science or economics departments, except
as foils. That\'s because virtually all of [Marx\'s hypotheses have been
debunked]{.underline}. For one, [who\'s going to build the free
Ferraris]{.underline} that Maezawa has dreamed up, [never mind tackle
more mundane tasks, with no incentive]{.underline}? But for those who
don\'t find such commonsense thought experiments convincing\--or who
think, as Marx did, that human nature will somehow mysteriously
change\--the impracticality of Marx\'s moneyless state was demonstrated
by what Austrian economists have come to call the calculation problem.
Ludwig von Mises once explained the problem as follows: [If a
hydroelectric power station is to be built, one must know whether or not
this is the most economical way to produce the energy needed. How can he
know this if he cannot calculate costs and output?]{.underline} We may
admit that in its initial period a socialist regime could to some extent
rely upon the experience of the preceding age of capitalism. But what is
to be done later, as conditions change more and more? Of what use could
the prices of 1900 be for the director in 1949? And what use can the
director in 1980 derive from the knowledge of the prices of 1949? [The
paradox of \"planning\" is that it cannot plan, because of the absence
of economic calculation. What is called a planned economy is no economy
at all.]{.underline} It is just a system of groping about in the dark.
(6) In short[, without prices, people have no relatable, quantifiable
means of comparing and contrasting options about how to spend time and
capital, which is vital for determining how best to use these naturally
scarce resources]{.underline}. \"New Scientist magazine reported that in
the future, cars could be powered by hazelnuts,\" said comedian Jimmy
Fallon, in a skit that captures Mises\'s point hilariously. \"That\'s
encouraging, considering an eight-ounce jar of hazelnuts costs about
nine dollars. Yeah, I\'ve got an idea for a car that runs on bald eagle
heads and Faberge eggs.\" But there\'s more. As has been shown with so
many of Marx\'s ideas, a [moneyless society is not only impractical,
it\'s also deeply immoral.]{.underline} Marx often grumbled about greedy
capitalists alienating workers from their labor. The focus on
efficiency, he said, reduced the worker to a mere extension of a
factory\'s machines, rendering him a brute tool of capitalist
exploitation. Of course, [workers chose industrial jobs because they
paid better than those in agriculture and the]{.underline} like. And
even if boring, such jobs rarely were so backbreaking as life on the
farm. Far from alienating workers from their labor, [the capitalist
arranged new modes of production that vastly increased the value of that
labor, not only for himself, but for workers, too]{.underline}. Whereas
a slave truly is alienated from his labor\--he works but is deprived of
the fruits of his effort\--the industrial worker could count on greater
returns from his labor than ever before. Over the course of the
Industrial Revolution and the following centuries, those returns have
grown immensely and reduced the percentage of people living in extreme
poverty from more than 80 percent to less than 20. Money stores the
value of one\'s effort. It\'s made possible by the legal protection of
property rights. In the words of Francisco d\'Anconia from Ayn Rand\'s
Atlas Shrugged: Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of
his mind and his effort. [Money allows no power to prescribe the value
of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to
trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your
goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them,
but no more.]{.underline} Money permits no deals except those to mutual
benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. (7) Just as the worker
owns himself, he owns the values he produces, on which his life depends,
either directly or indirectly via the sale of those values. [Without
money and the property rights that underlie it, we all would be truly
and fully alienated from our labor, left without enforceable claim to
the values we spend our time\--and thus our
lives\--creating.]{.underline} That\'s an idea hardly fit even for
science fiction, one best relegated to the dystopian genre.

### Human rights

#### A communist revolution will evolve into rejection of communist ideals and human rights violations

Institute for Economic Research. He is also an Associate Professor of

Communism?\", 11-30-2020, AIER,

It's a question of utmost importance in light of our species'
distressing habit of slaughtering one another. That's one of the places
where communism's failures are most conspicuous. **[Experiments with
communism have a distressing tendency to descend into mass
murder.]{.underline}** As Kristian Niemietz explains in his excellent
book [Socialism: The failed idea that never
dies](https://iea.org.uk/publications/socialism-the-failed-idea-that-never-dies/),
intellectuals have a three-stage relationship with socialism. [A
socialist regime emerges and maybe has some successes. During this
honeymoon phase, socialism's defenders point out that the naysayers are
wrong and this time is different. The honeymoon transitions into an
"excuses-and-whataboutery" period where a regime's defenders try to
explain away the trouble in the workers' paradise.]{.underline} [During
this phase, we might learn that bad weather or something like deliberate
CIA sabotage, not central planning, is to blame for economic failure.
Finally, once the experiment's failures become too obvious to ignore or
explain away, we enter the third stage, the "not-real-socialism" stage.
The Soviet Union? Not **real** socialism. China under Mao? Not **real**
socialism. Venezuela? Not **real** socialism. And so on.]{.underline}
Weren't these idealistic--if naive--crusades to better the lives of the
downtrodden? In his foreword to Eugene Richter's excellent [Pictures of
the Socialistic
Future](https://mises.org/library/pictures-socialistic-future-0), Bryan
Caplan explains three theses: there is Lord Acton's thesis, which is
that "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." People
meant well when they got started, but having so much power derailed
them. A second thesis is Friedrich Hayek's explanation for "why the
worst get on top." Power will attract people who crave it, and hence
ambitious, bad people will end up in positions of power. Hence, you
might hear that the USSR would have avoided the horrors of the Stalinist
regime had only Leon Trotsky and not Stalin ascended to power. Caplan
tells a darker story, however, for why communist regimes move so quickly
into oppression and mass murder: [communism is "born bad" in that "the
early socialists were indeed 'idealists'" but "their ideal was
totalitarianism."]{.underline} At a fundamental level, [communist
revolutions have not been about merely producing things more efficiently
or ensuring that output is shared equitably. Communist experiments have
been efforts to fundamentally re-engineer humanity. They have been
projects of social transformation, and their brutality has sometimes
been excused as an unfortunate historical necessity.]{.underline} The
historian Eric Hobsbawm, for example, agreed without hesitation that
millions of deaths would be an acceptable price to pay for a communist
society. After all, Lenin famously said "you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs." Alas, [communist experiments have come and
gone**. They have left us with no omelets, only millions and millions of
broken eggs.**]{.underline}

Collectively, [communist states [killed as many as 100 million
people](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Book-Communism-Crimes-Repression/dp/0674076087),
more than all other repressive regimes combined during the same time
period]{.underline}. By far the biggest toll arose from communist
efforts to collectivize agriculture and eliminate independent
property-owning peasants. In China alone, Mao Zedong's [Great Leap
Forward led to]{.underline} [[a man-made famine in which as many as 45
million people perished -- the single biggest episode of mass murder in
all of world
history](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/08/03/giving-historys-greatest-mass-murderer-his-due/?utm_term=.8e8655f91f4e&itid=lk_inline_manual_5).]{.underline}
In the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin's collectivization -- which served as
a model for similar efforts in China and elsewhere -- [took some 6 to 10
million
lives](http://volokh.com/2010/11/23/did-joseph-stalin-commit-genocide/).
Mass famines occurred in many other communist regimes, ranging from
North Korea to
[Ethiopia](https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/ethiopia-the-communist-uses-of-famine/).
[In each of these cases, communist rulers were well aware that their
policies were causing mass death, and in each they persisted
nonetheless]{.underline}, often because they considered the
extermination of "Kulak" peasants a feature rather than a bug. While
collectivization was the single biggest killer, [communist regimes also
engaged in other forms of mass murder on an epic scale. Millions died in
slave labor camps, such as [the USSR's Gulag
system](https://www.amazon.com/Gulag-History-Anne-Applebaum/dp/1400034094)
and [its equivalents
elsewhere](http://www.thegulag.org/content/chinese-laogai)]{.underline}.
Many others were killed in more conventional mass executions, such as
those of Stalin's [Great
Purge](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/10-facts-stalins-great-purge.html),
and the ["Killing Fields" of
Cambodia](http://www.killingfieldsmuseum.com/s21-victims.html). The
[injustices of communism were not limited to mass murder]{.underline}
alone. Even those fortunate enough to survive still were subjected to
severe repression, including [violations of freedom, of speech, freedom
of religion, loss of property rights, and the criminalization of
ordinary economic activity]{.underline}. No previous tyranny sought such
complete control over nearly every aspect of people's lives. [Although
the communists promised a utopian society in which the working class
would enjoy unprecedented prosperity, in reality they engendered massive
poverty. Wherever communist and noncommunist states existed in close
proximity, it was the communists who used walls and the threat of death
to keep their people from fleeing to societies with greater
opportunity.]{.underline}

#### **Communism fails and makes atrocities inevitable -- full state control, no market incentives, and no sense of market needs**

**Somin, 17** \-\-- Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason
University, is the author of \"Free to Move: Foot Voting, Migration and

How did an ideology of liberation lead to so much oppression, tyranny
and death? Were its failures intrinsic to the communist project, or did
they arise from avoidable flaws of particular rulers or nations? Like
any great historical development, the failures of communism cannot be
reduced to any one single cause. But, by and large, they were indeed
inherent. [Two major factors were the most important causes of the
atrocities inflicted by communist regimes: perverse incentives and
inadequate knowledge]{.underline}. [The establishment of the centrally
planned economy and society required by socialist ideology necessitated
an enormous concentration of power.]{.underline} While communists looked
forward to a utopian society in which the state could eventually "wither
away," they believed they first had to establish a state-run economy in
order to manage production in the interests of the people. In that
respect, they had much in common with other socialists. [To make
socialism work, government planners needed to have the authority to
direct the production and distribution of virtually all the goods
produced by the society.]{.underline} In addition, [**extensive coercion
was necessary** to force people to give up their private property, and
do the work that the state required. Famine and mass murder was probably
the only way the rulers]{.underline} of the USSR, China, and other
[communist states could compel peasants to give up their land and
livestock and accept a new form of serfdom on collective
farms]{.underline} -- which most were then forbidden to leave without
official permission, for fear that they might otherwise seek an easier
life elsewhere. [The vast power necessary to establish and maintain the
communist system naturally attracted unscrupulous people, including many
self-seekers who prioritized their own interests over those of the
cause]{.underline}. But it is striking that the biggest communist
atrocities were perpetrated not by corrupt party bosses, but [by true
believers like Lenin, Stalin, and
Mao](http://volokh.com/2010/04/06/competing-explanations-for-the-oppressive-nature-of-socialism/).
Precisely because they were true believers, they [were willing to do
whatever it might take to make their utopian dreams a
reality.]{.underline} Even as the socialist system created opportunities
for vast atrocities by the rulers, it also destroyed production
incentives for ordinary people. [In the absence of markets]{.underline}
(at least legal ones), there was [little incentive for workers to either
be productive or to focus on making goods that might actually be useful
to consumers]{.underline}. Many [people tried to do as little work as
possible at their official jobs, where possible reserving their real
efforts for black market activity.]{.underline} As the old Soviet saying
goes, workers had the attitude that "we pretend to work, and they
pretend to pay." Even when socialist planners genuinely sought to
produce prosperity and meet consumer demands, they often lacked the
information to do so. As Nobel Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek
described in [a famous
article](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html), [**a
market economy conveys vital information** to producers and consumers
alike through the price system.]{.underline} Market prices [enable
producers to know the relative value of different goods and services,
and determine how much consumers value their products. Under socialist
central planning,]{.underline} by contrast[, there is no substitute for
this vital knowledge.]{.underline} As a result, [**socialist planners
often had no way to know what to produce, by what methods, or in way
quantities.** This is one of the reasons why communists states routinely
suffered from shortages of basic goods, while simultaneously producing
large quantities of shoddy products for which there was little
demand.]{.underline}

#### Communist incentives for supremacy has led China to commit genocide against Turkish Muslims and Uyghur populations

[The motivation for Beijing's attack on rights stems from the fragility
of rule by repression rather than popular consent.]{.underline} Despite
decades of impressive economic growth in China, driven by hundreds of
millions of people finally emancipated to lift themselves out of
poverty, the Chinese Communist Party is running scared of its own
people. Outwardly confident about its success in representing people
across the country, [the Chinese Communist Party is worried about the
consequences of unfettered popular debate and political organization,
and thus afraid to subject itself to popular scrutiny.]{.underline} As a
result, Beijing faces the uneasy task of managing a huge and complex
economy without the public input and debate that political freedom
allows. Knowing that in the absence of elections, the party's legitimacy
depends largely on a growing economy, Chinese leaders worry that slowing
economic growth will increase demands from the public for more say in
how it is governed. The government's nationalist campaigns to promote
the "China dream," and its trumpeting of debatable anti-corruption
efforts, do not change this underlying reality. The consequence under
President Xi Jinping is China's most pervasive and brutal oppression in
decades. What modest opening had existed briefly in recent years for
people to express themselves on matters of public concern has been
decisively closed. [Civic groups have been shut down. Independent
journalism is no more. Online conversation has been curtailed and
replaced with orchestrated sycophancy. Ethnic and religious minorities
face severe persecution]{.underline}. Small steps toward the rule of law
have been replaced by the Communist Party's traditional rule by law.
Hong Kong's limited freedoms, under "one country, two systems," are
being severely challenged. Xi has emerged as the most powerful leader of
China since Mao Zedong, building a shameless cult of personality,
removing presidential term limits, promoting "Xi Jinping thought," and
advancing grandiose visions for a powerful, yet autocratic, nation. [To
ensure that it can continue to **prioritize its own power** over the
needs and desires of the people of China, the **Communist Party has
mounted a determined assault on the political freedoms that might show
the public to be anything but acquiescent to its rule**.]{.underline}
The Unconstrained Surveillance State More than any other government,
Beijing has made technology central to its repression. [A nightmarish
system has already been built in Xinjiang, the northwestern region that
is home both to some 13 million Muslims---Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other
Turkic minorities---and to the most intrusive public monitoring system
the world has ever known. The Chinese Communist Party has long sought to
monitor people for any sign of dissent, but the combination of growing
economic means and technical capacity has led to an unprecedented regime
of mass surveillance.]{.underline} The ostensible purpose is to avoid
recurrence of a handful of violent incidents several years ago by
alleged separatists, but the venture far surpasses any perceptible
security threat. One million officials and party cadre have been
mobilized as uninvited "guests" to regularly "visit" and stay in the
homes of some of these Muslim families to monitor them. Their job is to
scrutinize and report "problems" such as people who pray or show other
signs of active adherence to the Islamic faith, who contact family
members abroad, or who display anything less than absolute fealty to the
Communist Party. This in-person surveillance is just the tip of the
iceberg, the analog prelude to the digital show. Without regard to the
internationally recognized right to privacy, the Chinese government has
deployed video cameras throughout the region, combined them with
facial-recognition technology, deployed mobile-phone apps to input data
from officials' observations as well as electronic checkpoints, and
processed the resulting information through big-data analysis. Data it
collects are used to determine who is detained for "re-education." In
the largest case of arbitrary detention in decades, [one million or more
Turkic Muslims have been deprived of their freedom, placed in an
indefinite detention of forced indoctrination. The detentions have
created countless "orphans"---children whose parents are in
custody---who are now held in schools and state-run orphanages where
they, too, are subjected to indoctrination]{.underline}. Children in
regular Xinjiang schools may face similar ideological training. [The
apparent aim is to strip Muslims of any adherence to their faith,
ethnicity, or independent political views. Detainees' ability to
recapture their freedom depends on persuading their jailers that they
are Mandarin-speaking, Islam-free worshipers of Xi and the Communist
Party. This brazen endeavor reflects a totalitarian impulse to
**reengineer people's thinking until they accept the supremacy of party
rule.**]{.underline}

### **Democracy**

#### **Problems with communism are intrinsic and eliminate any possibility of a democratic government** 

**Somin, 17** \-\-- Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason
University, is the author of \"Free to Move: Foot Voting, Migration and
Political Freedom\" and \"The Grasping Hand: Kelo v. City of New London
and the Limits of Eminent Domain.\" (Ilya Somin, \" Lessons from a

To this day, defenders of socialist central planning argue that
communism failed for avoidable contingent reasons, rather than ones
intrinsic to the nature of the system. Perhaps the most popular claim of
this sort is that a planned economy can work well so long as it is
democratic. The Soviet Union and other communist states were all
dictatorships. But if they had been democratic, perhaps the leaders
would have had stronger incentives to make the system work for the
benefit of the people. If they failed to do so, the voters could "throw
the bastards out" at the next election. Unfortunately, [it is unlikely
that a communist state could remain democratic for long]{.underline},
even it started out that way. [Democracy requires effective opposition
parties]{.underline}. And in order to function, [such parties need to be
able to put out their message and mobilize voters, which in turn
requires extensive resources.]{.underline} [In an economic system in
which all or nearly all valuable resources are controlled by the state,
the incumbent government can easily strangle opposition by denying them
access to those resources.]{.underline} [Under socialism, the opposition
cannot function if they are not allowed to spread their message on
state-owned media, or use state-owned property for their rallies and
meetings.]{.underline} It is no accident that [virtually every communist
regime suppressed opposition parties soon after coming to
power.]{.underline} Even if a communist state could somehow remain
democratic over the long run, it is hard to see how it could solve the
twin problems of knowledge and incentives. Whether democratic or not, [a
socialist economy would still require enormous concentration of power,
and extensive coercion. And democratic socialist planners would run into
much the same information problems as their authoritarian
counterparts.]{.underline} In addition, [in a society where the
government controls all or most of the economy, it would be virtually
impossible for voters to acquire enough knowledge to monitor the state's
many activities.]{.underline} This would greatly **[exacerbate [the
already severe problem of voter
ignorance](https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Political-Ignorance-Smaller-Government/dp/0804799318/)]{.underline}**
that plagues modern democracy. Another possible explanation for the
failures of communism is that the problem was bad leadership. If only
communist regimes were not led by monsters like Stalin or Mao, they
might have done better. [There is no doubt communist governments had
more than their share of cruel and even sociopathic leaders. But it is
unlikely that this was the decisive factor in their
failure.]{.underline} Very similar results arose in communist regimes
with leaders who had a wide range of personalities. In the Soviet Union,
it is important to remember that the main institutions of repression
(including the Gulags and the secret police) were established n[ot by
Stalin, but by Vladimir
Lenin](http://volokh.com/2010/11/23/did-joseph-stalin-commit-genocide/),
a far more "normal" person. After Lenin's death, Stalin's main rival for
power -- Leon Trotsky -- [advocated policies that were in some respects
even more oppressive than Stalin's
own](http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2009_08_09-2009_08_15.shtml#1250038247).
It's hard to avoid the conclusion that either [the personality of the
leader was not the main factor]{.underline}, or -- alternatively --
communist regimes tended to put horrible people to positions of power.
Or perhaps some of both. [It is equally difficult to credit claims that
communism failed only because of defects in the culture of the countries
that adopted it]{.underline}. It is indeed true that Russia, the first
communist nation, had a long history of corruption, authoritarianism,
and oppression. But it is also true that the communists engaged in
oppression and mass murder on a far greater scale than previous Russian
governments. And communism also failed in many other nations with very
different cultures. [In the cases of Korea, China, and Germany, people
with very similar initial cultural backgrounds endured terrible
privation under communism, but were much more successful under market
economies.]{.underline} Overall, **[the atrocities and failures of
communism were the natural outcomes of an effort to establish a
socialist economy in which all or nearly all production is controlled by
the state.]{.underline}** If not always completely unavoidable, the
resulting oppression was at least highly likely.
