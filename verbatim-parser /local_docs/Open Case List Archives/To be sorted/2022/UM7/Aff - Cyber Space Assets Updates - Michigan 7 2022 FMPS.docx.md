However, [the **satellite numbers are expected to multiply rapidly**,
and it was estimated there might be no less than 107,000 active
satellites by 2029]{.underline} (Samson 2020). [Apart from functional
systems, orbits are **congested** by a significant amount of space
debris]{.underline}. As of January 2021, [the U.S. Space Surveillance
Network tracked over 28,000 objects in the orbits; nevertheless, it is
estimated that there are already about 900,000 objects larger than 1 cm
orbiting the Earth, from which only about 34,000 are larger than 10
cm]{.underline} (ESA 2021). The number of 10 cm is vital because,
generally, satellites are protected against a collision with objects
smaller than 0,1 cm and objects larger than 10 cm can be possibly
avoided (EU Community Research and Development Information Service
2012).

U[ntil 2021, there were more than 560 break-ups, explosions, collisions
or other fragmenting events in the orbits registered]{.underline} (ESA
2021), with the most notorious events of the Chinese ASAT test in 2007
and the Iridium-Cosmos collision in 2009. A single intentional Chinese
kinetic ASAT test in 2007 resulted in the creation of more than 3 000
pieces of debris larger than 10 cm (Nicholls 2021) and accidental
collision between Iridium and Cosmos in 2009 produced almost 2 000
pieces of debris larger than 10 cm (Secure World Foundation 2010).
[However, the in-**orbit collisions** predicted by the
socalled]{.underline} Kessler Syndrome [-- a situation when the
naturally occurring collisions **intensify** to a point when they **lead
to a cascading effect** damaging an increasing number of systems -- will
**increasingly occur** as the number of space systems rises and may
**result** in a **cascading effect** that eventually can limit or
preclude access to outer space.]{.underline} Kessler and Cour-Palais
(1978, 2637) stated that "\[[a\]s the number of artificial satellites in
earth orbit increases, the probability of collisions between satellites
also increases. Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments,
each of which would increase the probability of further collisions,
leading to the growth of a belt of debris around the Earth.]{.underline}
Hence, in the case of a severe debris-resulting incident, outer space
may become impenetrable. [Though the in-orbit collisions are currently
rare, they are gradually and steadily **becoming increasingly likely,**
and **long-term space debris accumulating effect** already requires
mitigating countermeasures to keep outer space accessible for the
future]{.underline} (Drmola and Hubik 2018). Moreover, as the Indian
kinetic ASAT test in March 2019 demonstrated, the states apparently did
not completely abandon additional debris-proliferating activities
(Weeden and Samson 2021, 5--3, 5--4).

However, [there are gaps in European STM capacities. **Limited sensor
coverage** (owing to limited funding and relatively low prioritization
in terms of national spending) has led to over-reliance on the US SSN
for comprehensive STM. Similarly, limited national space intelligence
capabilities are largely **reliant on US-provided space
intelligence**]{.underline}. [Another primary EU vulnerability is its
**lack of experience**.]{.underline} The UK has not capitalized on its
experience and although there is expertise in the analysts at
Fylingdales they are, according to some experts,25 not effectively
utilized, and just one sensor in the UK will not provide full STM
coverage.

[In addition, European sensors are **not as capable** as those in the
US]{.underline} -- [they have lower resolution and therefore can only
track large objects.]{.underline} To become more complementary and to
contribute globally, [Europe requires new and dedicated sensors capable
of tracking smaller objects]{.underline}. One individual with experience
both in the military and commercial aspects of STM expressed amazement
that the community talks about the significance of STM but provides
little funding for dedicated sensors. [The **current EU funding** for
future STM support systems was described as '**pitiful'** by one
expert.26 For Europe to significantly contribute to STM, at union and
member state levels, **requires additional funding to develop better
capabilities.**]{.underline}

#### Aligning [NATO policy]{.underline} to support [EU multilateralism]{.underline} solves better.

But [most **[Europe]{.mark}**an governments conduct their national
security policies at a much greater distance from their militaries,
**[celebrat]{.mark}**ing their concentration on ["soft power"
tools]{.mark} in lieu of force. Not only do they privilege those tools,
they often consider their policies, and themselves, morally superior for
the choice]{.underline}. One need only listen to EU Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker or read of the European Parliament passing
legislation condemning U.S. intelligence agencies to share President
Trump's aggravation with Europe. We sentimentalize the Transatlantic
connection at our peril.

[[However, **NATO**]{.mark}'s fundamental bargain [continues to be
**overwhelmingly advantageous**]{.mark} to the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [**[Eu]{.mark}**ropean states [would
be]{.mark} both [less willing and]{.mark} less [able to help]{.mark} us
[without NATO.]{.mark} **European [allies would]{.mark} likely spend
[even less---not more]{.mark}---on defense [without]{.mark} the constant
[hectoring of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [within
NATO]{.mark}**[. They would]{.mark} likely [spend more on]{.mark}
**military [pay]{.mark}** [and **benefits** than]{.mark} on **high-end
[weapons]{.mark}** and **capabilities**; [all]{.mark} Western militaries
[must contend with **competing demands**]{.mark} on their funding,
[but]{.mark} the [problem is **more effectively addressed in NATO**,
where militaries have **greater p**]{.mark}**olitical [c]{.mark}apital**
[to **make hard choices** than]{.mark} in **solely [national]{.mark}**
[or **EU** forums]{.mark}]{.underline}. They would not be nearly as able
to get organized and act decisively for a common purpose when needed.
And they would be less likely to feel an obligation to participate in
wars that the U.S. military fights beyond Europe. Diplomatically, we
would need to negotiate European states into participating in our
endeavors rather than expecting them to proffer a good excuse to remain
out. That may seem a subtle difference, but it isn't.

#### [Only]{.underline} building EU defense [within]{.underline} NATO allows it to be [financially feasible]{.underline} and [synergistic]{.underline} with the U.S.

Stanley R. **Sloan 17**, Visiting Scholar in Political Science at
Middlebury College and Author of Defense of the West: NATO, the European
Union and the Transatlantic Bargain, "Washington Might Feel The Chill Of
A More United European Defense", War on the Rocks, 6/22/2017,
https://warontherocks.com/2017/06/washington-might-feel-the-chill-of-a-more-united-european-defense/

The answer given by most European and American defense experts is that
the [European [allies]{.mark} do [need to do more.
But]{.mark}]{.underline} most also agree that [those [efforts will be
**most effective** if]{.mark} **shaped by** and [**built within** the
**framework** of the]{.mark} **transatlantic [alliance]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} its leading institution, **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A somewhat different argument appeared in these pages recently,
observing that President Trump had not yet reduced its commitment to
Europe as many have feared, but have nonetheless managed to alienate our
allies. Despite the downside, the authors, Benjamin Friedman and Joshua
Shifrinson, argue that Trump's policies could lead to an increase in
European defense efforts. Whether the increases currently underway are
in any way stimulated by Trump's "tough talk" remains to be seen. The
allies agreed in the 2014 Wales Pledge to increase defense spending to
reach the goal of 2 percent of GDP by 2024. The pledge came explicitly
in response to Russian aggression against Ukraine and threatening
behavior toward NATO allies.

Jordan Becker, an expert on NATO burden-sharing, recently observed in
War on the Rocks that "...the true effect of the Wales Pledge will not
be measurable for several years, and it will be difficult to isolate its
effects from the effect of tough talk on burden-sharing from
Washington." From a historical perspective, there is no solid evidence
that "tough talk" from Washington has been particularly helpful in
stimulating European efforts, starting with the fact that the failure of
the European Defense Community in 1954 came in the wake of U.S.
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles warning that such an event could
result in an "agonizing reappraisal" of the American commitment to
European security. That, of course, did not come about because
Washington's perception of the Soviet threat far outweighed the
disappointment at the European failure.

The center of current efforts to improve coordination of European
defense efforts is found in a report by the European Union's executive
body, the European Commission, and the union's top foreign and defense
policy official, Federica Mogherini. This report, "Reflection Paper on
the Future of European Defence," is a responsible, credible piece of
advocacy for the European Union to develop greater coherence in the
defense efforts of its members.

The report reasonably acknowledges that decisions along the way would be
made by the member states, with the E.U. institutions providing support.
The report calls for developing a common defense industrial market while
enhancing E.U. military planning and operational capabilities.

The report lays out three scenarios, or options, moving from a
relatively modest set of goals to more ambitious ones. In the first
scenario, E.U. members would intensify cooperation, but would operate
largely on a volunteer basis:

> Such cooperation would ... depend on ad-hoc decisions as and when a
> new threat or crisis emerges ... Member States would not be bound ---
> politically or legally --- by a common direction of travel in security
> and defence.

In the second scenario,

> the E.U. would enhance its ability to project military power and to
> engage fully in external crisis management and in building partners'
> security and defence capacities. It would also improve its ability to
> protect Europe in areas ... such as counterterrorism, countering of
> hybrid and cyber threats, border control and maritime and energy
> security.

The European Union, in this case, would be far more institutionally
involved in defense and would be "more directly engaged in the
protection of Member States and citizens in case of significant attacks
or disruptions against a country and/or its critical infrastructures."

In the most integrative and ambitious of three scenarios laid out in the
report, the defense union would be sufficiently evolved by 2025 so that
most defense and security decisions would be taken in common and
executed at the E.U. level. According to the report,

> The E.U. would be able to run high-end operations to better protect
> Europe, potentially including operations against terrorist groups,
> naval operations in hostile environments or cyber-defence actions.

The report sees this option as a complement to NATO, not competition:
"...the protection of Europe would become a mutually reinforcing
responsibility of the E.U. and NATO."

This most demanding outcome could be seen as exactly what the United
States wanted when Dulles threatened the "agonizing reappraisal" of its
commitment. However, the Eisenhower administration had not fully
comprehended the many factors, as I have discussed elsewhere, that would
eventually lead to the failure of the European Defense Community. Today,
it is perhaps some Europeans (and Americans, including at one time the
Obama administration) who are being too optimistic about the willingness
of European states to merge their sovereignties so thoroughly.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has in the past
emphasized the importance of the non-military contributions the European
Union makes to security. But in endorsing this report, and apparently
provoked by Trump's critique, he argued "...soft power alone is not
powerful enough in an increasingly militarized world," as he has also
suggested in his past arguments for creating a "European army."

In the report, Mogherini and Juncker all have emphasized that this E.U.
defense enhancement should happen in overt and close cooperation with
NATO. But the undercurrent stimulated by President Trump's apparent
antagonism toward NATO, the European Union, and the European allies has
begun to make this initiative feel like a declaration of defense
independence from U.S. leadership, or at least as a hedge against
American abandonment.

[Americans should wish]{.underline} the members of [the
**[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [the
best of luck in [improving]{.mark} their now-deficient [defense]{.mark}
efforts. But [if]{.mark} it happens **[as a way of]{.mark} politically
[challenging]{.mark}** [the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [we are likely to [see a]{.mark}
**steady [deterioration]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} transatlantic
political-military **[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}.

Now, the irony is that this European [effort is not likely to lead
to]{.underline} the extreme outcomes advocated by some Europeans,
including [the creation of a "European army." To get to]{.underline} the
extreme point of the process --- [a true]{.underline} European [defense
union]{.underline} --- the members of the **[E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [would **first** have to agree on **very
extensive integration** of]{.underline} their political
[systems]{.underline} --- a political union. In this international
environment, we know that things previously unimaginable can become
possible. However, [it seems **highly unlikely**, in the near term,
that]{.underline} E.U. member political [leaders would give
up]{.underline} autonomous [control over]{.underline} such core national
sovereignty decisions such as [sending]{.underline} military
[forces]{.underline} to fight and die on behalf of their country or the
European Union.

[[It]{.mark} also [is **doubtful**]{.mark}]{.underline} that the members
of [the **[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [[would]{.mark} be able]{.underline} in
that same time frame [to **[shift resources sufficiently]{.mark}** to
support such an extensive plan. [They **already** find]{.mark} the NATO
goal of spending [**2 percent** of GDP]{.mark} on defense [challenging.
Why]{.mark} should one [expect E.U.]{.mark} members [to]{.mark} be able
to **[spend]{.mark} what could be [twice that]{.mark}** to support a
fully-fledged European defense union]{.underline}, to say nothing of a
"European army?"

[The **[far more desirable]{.mark} option**]{.underline}, in terms of
both European and American interests, [[is for]{.mark} all [NATO]{.mark}
allies to **[work together]{.mark}**]{.underline} to develop plans and
capabilities to deal with the very real security threats that face them.
[[This]{.mark} process [can]{.mark}]{.underline} and should
[[include]{.mark} much [more intensive **Eu**]{.mark}ropean-level
**[coop]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration, [**[if]{.mark}** it is
[developed]{.mark} in an intensive cooperation between [NATO and]{.mark}
the **[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion.

#### Strategic autonomy? More like [strategic incompetence]{.underline}. 

Edward **Lucas 18** \-\-- Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis (CEPA).

[Some [Europeans want to **take the initiative**]{.mark}]{.underline},
stitching up deals with China and other trading partners (Latin America,
Japan) who feel bruised by the mercantilist "America First" approach.
They would like to make the euro into a reserve currency, ending the
European dependence on the dollar-based international financial
infrastructure. [Europe may be puny when it comes to hard security, they
argue, but it **wields clout elsewhere**: just imagine if it combined
its capabilities on aid, diplomacy, finance, trade, and soft-power
strategically.\]{.underline}
\
Such an approach would be interesting; it would certainly give the U.S.
administration cause to rethink its approach to Europe, though possibly
not in the way that Europeans would like.\
\
[[For]{.mark} now and [the **foreseeable future**]{.mark}, though, the
question is **purely theoretical**]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} practical
[trend is towards **greater impotence**]{.mark}, **not
autonomy**]{.underline}. [[**Brexit** is a
distraction]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The **[Franco-German
axis]{.mark}**,]{.underline} on which many hopes rested only a year ago,
[has **[splintered]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Second-tier countries**
such as [Italy]{.mark} (run by **[eccentric populists]{.mark}**) and
**[Spain]{.mark}** (with a **[weak minority]{.mark} government**),
**[Sweden]{.mark}** (with **[no government]{.mark}** at all) and
**[Poland]{.mark}** (self-**[marginalized]{.mark}**) [are in **no
position**]{.mark} to take their **share of the burden**]{.underline}.
[At the level of European institutions, nothing will happen until the
dust settles from the European Parliament elections, perhaps by the end
of next year.\]{.underline}
\
[The result is **[introversion and impotence]{.mark}**: an [open]{.mark}
door [for Russian influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, and, increasingly,
Chinese. That is frustrating for everyone, not least the United States,
which for years has been urging Europe to do more. [But **instead of
serious contributions** to global security, what [Europe offers]{.mark}
is **[empty talk of autonomy]{.mark}**, exemplified by the notion of a
"European Army"---a militarily nonsensical idea which threatens to
weaken NATO at a time when the Alliance needs to do more, not
less]{.underline}.\
\
Against this bleak background it is easy to despair. But it is worth
remembering that the West survived the Cold War in worse shape than it
is now. The USSR was a serious strategic adversary which controlled half
of Europe and projected power all over the world. Russia is a nuisance
not a threat. It succeeds mainly through bluff, not muscle.
Transatlantic disunity is nothing new either. Europe shunned the
U.S.-led cold war in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. France stormed out
of NATO's command structure in 1966 and did not return until 2009.\
\
[Woolly, self-indulgent **talk of "[autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
strategic or otherwise, [[counts for little when **migration**]{.mark},
**[climate change]{.mark}**, **[humanitarian catastrophes]{.mark}**, and
**[technological change]{.mark}** all remind Europeans insistently of
the competitive, dangerous]{.underline}, an[d interconnected outside
world]{.underline}. Like it or not, [these threats [necessitate]{.mark}
cohesion, decisiveness---and [a **strong transatlantic
Alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Alt causes to EU leadership.

\"New EU leadership team must up its game on foreign policy,\"
https://www.ft.com/content/e08b101e-fa48-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6\
\
The [new EU leadership]{.underline} team taking office in Brussels
[knows that, if the bloc's common foreign policy is to command
respect]{.underline}, the first place where it must achieve success is
in Europe's neighbourhood. [It needs to be well-planned]{.underline}, as
[united]{.underline} as possible, [efficiently executed and]{.underline}
[imbued with a larger sense of long-term strategy]{.underline}. [In all
these regards]{.underline}, two [recent episodes]{.underline} --- one
concerning [[the Balkans]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the other [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
**[have been little short of a debacle]{.underline}**.

[[Each incident points to the **EU's inability to translate its
undoubted weight**]{.underline}]{.mark} as a commercial and regulatory
bloc **[[into]{.underline}]{.mark}** hard **[[power on the world
stage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**[It is not just a matter of lack of
military muscle]{.mark}**, important though that is. [The real problem
is]{.mark}]{.underline} that, [[whenever two or more of the EU's biggest
countries are in disagreement]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [common European
foreign [policy]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline} either ~~paralysed~~
\[[[stagnated]{.underline}\]]{.mark} [or becomes a question of finding
the **lowest common denominator**]{.underline} among 28 states. An often
overlooked point is that [these [disagreements]{.mark} tend to [arise
out of **domestic political tensions**]{.mark} in individual
countries]{.underline} --- over, for example, irregular migration or
attitudes to Islam or Russia. Such [tensions]{.underline}
[hobble]{.underline} the [attempts of governments to **find common
ground** with their EU partners]{.underline}.

In any case, [[France, Germany and other EU countries]{.mark} usually
[prefer to keep their freedom of manoeuvre]{.mark} when it suits
them]{.underline}. The Syrian episode centres on Annegret
Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is Angela Merkel's preferred candidate to succeed
her as German chancellor. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer was named defence
minister in July in an apparent attempt to raise her profile with German
voters. But the proposal for a multinational security zone in northern
Syria that she came up with this month was startling for its naivety and
lack of preparation. Before unveiling her plan, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer,
who replaced Ms Merkel as the Christian Democratic party's leader in
December ahead of elections due in 2021, consulted neither her Social
Democratic coalition partners nor Germany's Nato and EU allies. Her
proposal skipped over crucial questions such as whether the UN Security
Council would endorse it, whether the US would take part and whether
Germany's under-resourced armed forces would send soldiers to Syria. To
each question it rapidly became clear that the answer was almost certain
to be no. Indeed, it was hard to tell who was more dismissive of the
initiative --- Russia and Turkey, which control events on the ground in
Syria, or Heiko Maas, Germany's foreign minister, who is of course a
colleague of Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer. In this way, the plan served no
purpose other than to illustrate the incoherence of the German
coalition's foreign policy, not to mention the EU's near-irrelevance in
Syria.

This is a sobering thought in view of the fact that the 2015 arrival of
large numbers of war refugees from Syria and other conflict zones, plus
other migrants, precipitated one of the EU's worst crises since the 1957
Treaty of Rome that set up the bloc.

The [EU's mis-steps in the Balkans are no less painful to
watch]{.underline}, but in this case the main culprit is France, not
Germany. By blocking Albania and North Macedonia from opening EU
membership talks, President [Emmanuel Macron **shocked and undermined a
region whose stability is integral to**]{.underline} the [**stability**
of the European continent]{.underline}. In North Macedonia's case, Mr
Macron's move made the EU reek of hypocrisy. For the EU had long
promised to start entry talks, provided that the Macedonians compromise
with Greece over their country's disputed name --- a condition fulfilled
in the Prespa agreement, which came into force last February.

In fairness to Mr [Macron]{.underline}, he [is not alone in having
doubts about enlarging the EU into south-eastern Europe]{.underline}.
Denmark and the Netherlands joined France in opposing Albania's entry
talks. Moreover, when the European parliament adopted a resolution last
week in favour of starting accession talks with the two Balkan states,
some 136 MEPs --- or almost a quarter of those who voted --- backed Mr
Macron's position. Furthermore, Mr [Macron]{.underline} has a point when
he [suggests]{.underline} that [the EU should focus on **internal
reforms** before absorbing]{.underline} new members. The EU's most
important project, [the 19-nation eurozone, remains a half-built
house]{.underline}. **[[Effective EU-wide action is woefully
lacking]{.underline}]{.mark}** in areas such as migration and asylum
policy. However, Mr Macron would sound more persuasive, but for the
persistent rumours that France's true objective is to close the EU door
forever to western Balkan countries. Instead they would be fobbed off
with membership of the European Economic Area, which would keep them out
of the EU's political institutions and make them permanent second-class
Europeans. The Syrian and Balkan embarrassments are symptoms of an EU
unsure of its place in the world and suffering from ineffective
Franco-German co-operation. But if **[[the EU cannot get things right on
its own doorstep]{.mark}, where can it?]{.underline}**

[Yet the [Europeans would]{.mark} immediately [face **institutional
hurdles**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Compared with Russia's top-down system,
[**command and control is hard enough** in]{.mark}
consensus-bound [nato]{.mark}. [It would be a **bigger challenge** for
Europeans alone]{.mark}, especially if they did not inherit nato's
**command structure**]{.underline}. [The eu may want to take the lead,
but **military thinking** is not in its dna]{.underline}. [Besides,
an eu-only alliance would be a **pale shadow** of nato]{.underline}:
after Brexit, non-eu countries will account for fully 80%
of nato defence spending.

[[There would be **gaps**]{.mark} **in capabilities**, too]{.underline}.
How bad these were would depend on the mission, and how many operations
were under way at the same time. [The European-led interventions in
Libya and Mali exposed [**dependence on America** in]{.mark} vital areas
such as **[air-to-air refuelling]{.mark}** and
**[intelligence]{.mark}**, **[surveillance]{.mark}** and
**[reconnaissance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A detailed look at the sort of
scenarios Europe might face would help to identify other gaps, and what
it would take to fill them. [Bastian Giegerich of the iiss, who is
starting to work on such assessments, reckons that **realistically**
[the gap-filling]{.mark} **[could take 15 years]{.mark}** or
so]{.underline}. [That is a **long time** for places like **Poland** and
the **Baltic countries** that feel under threat. **[Fear and]{.mark}
[mistrust]{.mark}** [could]{.mark} quickly conspire to [make]{.mark}
**narrow [national interests]{.mark}** [trump]{.mark} efforts to
**maintain [European unity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Hence a second,
perhaps likelier, version of what might follow an American withdrawal:
**Europe Divided.**]{.underline}

[Jonathan Eyal]{.underline} of the Royal United Services Institute in
London [imagines [a **frenzy of activity**]{.mark}, a cacophony of
summits---and a [renationalisation of defence strategies]{.mark}. Lots
of [countries would seek]{.mark} **bilateral [deals]{.mark}**. In
central Europe he would expect an alliance between Poland and Romania to
guarantee the eastern border]{.underline}. [The
**[Russians]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Chinese **[[would not sit]{.mark}
idly [by]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} he says, [but would **play
their own games** with the Greeks, Hungarians and others.]{.underline}

[It is [these **games of mistrust** that]{.mark} the American
[**security guarantee** has]{.mark} largely **[helped to
avoid]{.mark}**. [They could]{.mark} all too **[easily
resurface]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[Establishing a **purely [European
defence]{.mark}**", warns Michael Rühle, a long-time nato official,
"[would **overwhelm** the Europeans]{.mark} **politically**,
**financially** and **militarily**]{.underline}."
