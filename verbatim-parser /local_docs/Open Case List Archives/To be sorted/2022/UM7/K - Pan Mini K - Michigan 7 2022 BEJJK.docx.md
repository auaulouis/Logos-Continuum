According to the holographic worldview, [[the universe is "an]{.mark}
**undivided and [unbroken whole]{.mark}**[" which is enfolded into
parts]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, the [division within]{.mark} as well
as between [society and nature is "a **crude abstraction**]{.mark} and
**approximation**]{.underline}" (Bohm, 1980: 158, emphasis in original;
see also Barad, 2007: 24--25). In his book Wholeness and the Implicate
Order, [Bohm expressed a [pressing concern]{.mark} with the tendency [to
divide]{.mark} and **subdivide [the world]{.mark}** [into]{.mark}
essentially **[different units]{.mark}** or groupings: IR scholars are
no stranger to the tendency described by Bohm. [The world,]{.mark}
apparently [organized into **sovereign states**, appears to be]{.mark}
as **[fragmented]{.mark}** as ever, further [compounded]{.mark} today
[by]{.mark} the rise of **[nationalism]{.mark}, populism**, and identity
politics, as well as by the socalled return to geopolitics or even the
Cold War. A]{.underline}ll these fragmentations and conflicts in IR seem
to conform with the Newtonian ontology of things. However, what is
revealed in this orthodox ontology is merely the explicate order of IR,
whose implicate order and implicate relations have yet to be adequately
understood and theorized. Bohm's insights into holographic relationality
lay an important foundation for such theorizing in IR. As will be
illustrated below, the Bohmian holographic theory can give IR, among
other things, a stronger ontological commitment to whole and wholeness,
a more holographic relational conception of parts such as states, and a
novel account of differences as contingent and spatio-temporally
situated unfoldments of holographic parts. Wholeness and the study of IR
[The concept of wholeness is central to Bohm's ontological
interpretation of quantum theory]{.underline} (Bohm, 1980; Bohm and
Hiley, 1993; Zinkin, 1987: 6). [Despite a growing effort to include a
wider array of issues and factors, IR still has a rather "weak sense of
a social whole]{.underline}" (Albert and Buzan, 2013: 121). Even as IR
scholars focus on "macrolevel" factors such as international political
systems, international structures, international societies, world
systems, and global networks, [these systemic factors are at best
particular **structural abstractions** of world politics, such as
anarchy, the distribution of capabilities, and international norms and
rules]{.underline}. [While these [systemic]{.mark} or structural
[features are **part and parcel** of the whole]{.mark}, ontologically
[they are often seen as]{.mark} either **mere [external]{.mark}** [and
causal **determinants** of state behavior]{.mark}, or **ultimately
[reducible]{.mark}** [to parts]{.mark} (e.g. states, material resources,
or ideas),15 rather than as the whole in the **holographic sense** of
the word]{.underline}. By whole we mean the entirety of space, time, and
the information, relations, structures, processes, movements, and
parts/agents contained within that all-encompassing space-time. [[In the
IR context, the whole]{.mark} goes well beyond states and the totality
of their interactions. It [embodies]{.mark} the whole [**social and
ecological** systems as well as their]{.mark} **explicate and [implicate
relations]{.mark}** both between and [embedded within]{.mark} their
constituent "[parts]{.mark}]{.underline}." Such "parts" may include
regions, states, societies, cultures, religions, peoples, economies,
markets, goods, histories, ideas, emotions, materials, creatures, and
natural phenomena. Of course, what exactly makes up the whole for IR
cannot be exhaustively tallied a priori, because by definition such a
task is impossible in any given space-time. But the point is that
[wholeness should be given a higher ontological priority in
IR]{.underline}. Just as trees do not grow as assemblages of previously
separate branches, leaves, and roots, [[the world does not **start off**
with]{.mark} merely **fragmented** parts and preexisting **[sovereign
states]{.mark}** which then come together to form a global
system]{.underline}; it is the other way round: [[the whole
**permeates**]{.mark} through the parts [and forms the]{.mark} essential
**relational conditions** under which [parts]{.mark} emerge and
exist]{.underline}. This approach makes it imperative for IR to look for
relations in much broader contexts which otherwise have been invisible,
understudied, or artificially carved up by mainstream IR. To advocate
for wholeness does not mean always privileging "macro-level" issues at
the global level. In any case, [whole-part or [macro-micro issues
are]{.mark} **always [already entangled]{.mark}** and co-emergent
(Wendt, 2015: 257). Micro parts and issues, precisely because they are
microscopic, may be **particularly prone** to be **diffusely spread and
enfolded** into various parts of the whole]{.underline}. As a result,
micro parts simultaneously develop an emergent, holographic property of
the whole. [The fact that [the **tiny coronavirus** can be]{.mark}
quickly [enfolded]{.mark} into almost every corner of the whole world
and turn global life upside down [illustrates the part-whole
entanglement]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we dismiss its holographically
holistic nature and impact at our own peril. To further illustrate,
often traditionally considered outside the purview of IR, [[micro
issues]{.mark} or events [such as]{.mark} music (Gienow-Hecht, 2015),
sports (e.g. **[ping-pong diplomacy]{.mark}**), the [Chernobyl]{.mark}
disaster (e.g. the collapse of the Soviet Union, van der Veen, 2013), a
flight school in Florida (e.g. 9/11), US subprime mortgage crisis,
[**Fukushima**, Wikileaks]{.mark}, melting polar ice caps, [a **Tunisian
street vendor**]{.mark} (e.g. the Arab Spring and the Syria
conflict]{.underline}) [and now even COVID-19 [may be]{.mark} all in
various ways "**[localized]{.mark}" holographic
[instantiations]{.mark}** [of the wholes]{.mark}. As such, [they]{.mark}
can and do [play an important part in]{.mark} both **reflecting** and
**[shaping the whole]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially in the form of
some unexpected events and surprising turns, such as the end of the Cold
War, 9/11, the global financial crisis, the rise of Donald Trump, and
the current global pandemic. True, some of those "micropolitical" issues
have begun to attract IR's attention (Kertzer, 2017; Solomon and Steele,
2017), but [overall the discipline lacks an **explicit** and
**holographic ontological** and conceptual foundation for a more
systematic engagement with the duality of whole-part]{.underline}. Of
course, we cannot deal with "the whole of reality all at once" (Bohm,
1980: 2; see also Wendt, 1999: 14). Often it is necessary to take things
"apart" and analyze them as if they were separable units. But it is
important to always remember the "as if" caveat, lest we reify them as
something objectively autonomous. It is also worth remembering that
ontologically international relations are always a holographic part of
bigger wholes, not closed or autonomous systems or units in and of
themselves. In this context, a [**[quantum holographic]{.mark}**
perspective [becomes **imperative**]{.mark} especially [in the
face,]{.mark} for example[, of]{.mark} the increasingly apparent
**human-nature holographic entanglement** as evidenced by mounting
"**local" [environmental crises]{.mark}** and their implications for
[**economic development**, international conflict, and **planetary
survival**]{.mark}. Contrary to the [prevailing IR approaches]{.mark}
that continue to [subordinate environmental issues to a **state-centric
framework** and a "**national economic" imperative**]{.mark} (Saurin,
1996), a quantum holographic approach has the potential to **bridge**
the **ontological and conceptual division** between the parts and the
wholes.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is [quantum holography]{.underline}. That challenges the [tautological]{.underline} ontology of the Newtonian narrative.

Despite its name, International Relations (IR) has long been predicated
on a Newtonian substantialist ontology of things, rather than an
ontology of relations, which are "the important missing dimension in
most theories of IR" (Wight, 2006: 296). In recent years, IR's "deep
Newtonian slumber" (Ruggie, 1998: 194) has been disturbed by a
"relational turn["]{.underline} (Bousquet and Curtis, 2011; Jackson and
Nexon, 1999; Kavalski, 2018; McClurg and Young, 2011; Neumann, 2013;
Nexon, 2010; Nordin et al., 2019; Nordin and Smith, 2018; Qin, 2018;
Shih, 2016; Trownsell et al., 2019). [[Challenging]{.mark} two versions
of]{.underline} [Newtonian substantialism]{.underline}:
**[atomism]{.underline}** (individualism) [[and
**structuralism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (structuralistsubstantialism)
(Zanotti, 2017; see also Wendt, 1999: 26), [[the gist]{.mark} of this
turn [is that the]{.mark} fundamental [**reality** is **not
independent** things]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Focusing on "a relation between
entities" (Jackson and Nexon, 2019: 584--585, emphases in original), the
relational scholarship also departs from the agent-structure and
level-of-analysis debates. Yet, [**[despite this]{.mark}**
significant]{.underline} and welcome development, [[**IR's relational
turn** suffers]{.mark} several **[drawbacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
First, [[it lacks a]{.mark} clear [**conception** of
relations]{.mark}]{.underline}/relationality [[beyond]{.mark} often
**[tautological definitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, [insisting
on the temporal priority of relations over entities]{.underline},
[[much]{.mark} of the literature [sidesteps an implicit]{.mark}
**["chicken-egg" dilemma]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between entities and
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Further [and]{.mark} more
importantly]{.underline}, [the relational turn [has
not]{.mark}]{.underline} yet [seriously [engaged
with]{.mark}]{.underline} another important development in the social
sciences in general and IR in particular, namely, [[the **"quantum
turn"**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Keeley, 2007; Wendt, 2015), or according
to Der Derian and Wendt (2020), [a permanent quantum
revolution]{.underline}. This neglect is both surprising and lamentable.
[Both turns share an anti-Newtonian stand]{.underline}, and as a
"momentous shift in metaphysical outlook" (Seager, 2018: 5), [[**quantum
mechanics** espouses]{.mark} a doctrine of **[relational
holism]{.mark}** "in an all pervasive way"]{.underline} (Teller, 1986:
71), [[which would make **quantum theory** a valuable
source]{.underline}]{.mark} in IR's relational quest. To be fair, at
least in the IR context the neglect seems mutual. With few exceptions
and some general references to relational ontology (e.g. Wendt, 2015;
Fierke, 2017; Zanotti, 2017), the burgeoning quantum turn literature in
IR has not focused extensively on relations either.
[Wendt's]{.underline} pioneering work on quantum theory, for example, is
[driven primarily by the need to "reconcile consciousness]{.underline}
and meaning [with the material world]{.underline}" (Wendt, 2006: 218),
though he acknowledges that quantum mechanics' holistic and relational
contribution is "a thematic that needs to be developed down the road"
(Wendt, 2015: 35). Therefore, [[the gap between these two]{.mark}
turns]{.underline} in IR [[calls for an explicit **quantum**]{.mark}
**relational [perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is what this
article sets out to do, [[by offering]{.underline}]{.mark}, more
specifically, **[[a]{.mark} quantum [holographic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The]{.mark} basic [notion of
**holography**]{.mark} is that an "object" is "**[part of the
whole]{.mark}** [while it]{.mark} simultaneously **[contains the
whole]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Van Daele, 2018: 651, emphases added).1
In quantum theory, [the holographic [principle promises]{.mark} a
solution]{.underline} to the well-known tensions [[between
**atomic-level**]{.mark} quantum physics [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
Albert [Einstein's [**planet-level** theory]{.mark} of gravity [by
suggesting]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the universe is a **holographic
[projection]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[what appears on]{.mark} the
surface]{.underline} (**[[event horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [of a
black hole [is **encoded information**]{.mark} [about **what is
inside**]{.mark},]{.underline} "just as a two-dimensional hologram
encodes a three-dimensional image" (Merali, 2013: 517). So far still
largely alien to this field (few exceptions include Pan, 2018; Wendt,
2015), quantum holography adds value to IR in several important ways.
First, [as a specific form of relationality]{.underline}, [quantum
holography helps mitigate the existing definitional vagueness about
relations]{.underline}. Second, instead of asserting relations' priority
over entities, quantum [[holography]{.mark} [accentuates
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**ontological [duality]{.mark}** [of
**relations** and **things**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Avoiding the
ontological chickenegg]{.underline} [dilemma]{.underline} over which
comes first, [[the]{.mark} duality [proposition suggests that]{.mark}
**[relations do not exist either before or after]{.mark}**
things]{.underline}; rather, [relations are from the outset implicated
or embodied in things]{.underline}. Relations-in-things are implicate
relations that can be better understood through quantum mechanics,
whereas things-in-relations (and relations-between-things) represent
more classical understandings of relations as something external,
compositional, and derivative. Third, [**quantum [holography]{.mark}**
[provides a]{.mark}]{.underline} deeper and [more [sophisticated
understanding of]{.mark} relations]{.underline}, [including
**[whole-part]{.mark} relations**]{.underline} [[and **internal
relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which have not been adequately
theorized in IR]{.underline}. Furthermore, [its differentiation between
explicate [and]{.mark} implicate relations [enables us
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[incorporate]{.mark} mainstream IR's [Newtonian
ontology **as a limiting case**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in a broader
quantum relational ontology,]{.underline} [rather than simply brush it
aside.]{.underline}

#### The [observer effect]{.underline} creates [erroneous]{.underline} predictions in foreign policy. A [quantum]{.underline} approach [halts]{.underline} these [false alarms]{.underline}.

Uncertainty, as noted earlier, is one of the key features of quantum
mechanics. It [holds that no matter how carefully we observe, even with
adequate knowledge of initial conditions, we can never objectively
understand a physical reality]{.underline}. Applying the concept to
politics, Cioffi-Revilla defines uncertainty as the "lack of sureness or
absence of strict determination in political life"44 Rathbun furthers
that "information is ambiguous because the world is complex and can only
be approximated and partially understood due to cognitive
limitations."45 He therefore sought to explain the element of
uncertainty within mainstream IR theories. For realists, it is
experienced in fear of each other's intention, while rationalists try to
cope with uncertainty through international institutions charged to
monitor and signal benign intent. For constructivists, uncertainty stems
from an assumption that states are uncertain about action to take when
norms as defined by identity are absent. Then cognitivists argue that
uncertainty emanates from the confusion caused by the complexity of
international politics as well as mental limitations of statesmen. 46
Assessing uncertainty from the quantum mechanical framework, we begin
with Heisenberg who is arguably the first to introduce the principle.
From his perspective, [we cannot completely describe an object since we
cannot simultaneously describe its momentum and position with
exactitude. [The more]{.mark} accurately [we understand **position**,
the less]{.mark} accurately [we understand]{.mark} the
**[momentum]{.mark}, vice versa**]{.underline}. [As such, it **becomes
impossible** to predict the **destination** of a moving object since we
cannot **accurately determine** its position and momentum at the same
time]{.underline}. From quantum mechanical thought, this is may be due
to hidden variables and/or non-locality. Non-locality describes the
possibility of a quantum state to interact with another quantum state of
the same pair, even when separated by large distances without an
established means of communication. [By position we refer to the
**location** of an object relative to a **reference point** while
momentum is taken to mean the measure of the motion of an object
relative to its mass and velocity]{.underline}. Position in theoretical
physics is synonymous with the condition of a State prior to an action
or event being analysed. By condition we mean the geographic and
politico-economic structure of a State. [In the same vein, the foreign
policy action of a State in a given case, accounts for momentum in
physics. Therefore, by directly applying Heisenberg's argument to
foreign policy analysis, [it is impossible to]{.mark} **completely
[understand]{.mark}** foreign policy [behaviour of a State **by merely
understanding** its condition]{.mark} prior to the behaviour being
analysed]{.underline}. Also, it is impossible to predict the outcome of
a given foreign policy behaviour. This explains why despite efforts to
predict the outcome of a given foreign policy behaviour, mainstream
approaches to foreign policy analysis have routinely fallen short in
this regard. [[A good example]{.mark} showing the compatibility of
Heisenberg's uncertainty in foreign policy analysis [could be found in
the]{.mark} recent [Arab Spring]{.mark}. An understanding of the
socio-political landscape of the Arab world had led [scholars of
different]{.mark} schools to [conclude that democracy was]{.mark}
essentially [incompatible]{.mark} with the Arab world. However, [at the
outbreak]{.mark} of the region-wide uprising, [scholars began to
**foretell democratization**]{.mark}. Soon, [scholars began to **make
reversals** in]{.mark} their [predictions]{.mark}, such that it **is no
longer fashionable** to equate the Arab uprising with
democratization.]{.underline} What is deducible from this instance is
that, in agreement with Heisenberg's uncertainty, [[it is impossible
to]{.mark} understand the present and [predict]{.mark} the future [by
simply understanding **initial conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
position is also understood by recalling that whereas the [[Cold
War]{.mark} engaged IR scholars in a war of paradigms, **[none of the
theories]{.mark}** and models [**predicted** the end]{.mark} of the
conflict.]{.underline}47 [[Schrodinger's **wave equation**]{.mark}
furthers our understanding of the **compatibility of quantum
mechanics**]{.underline} with foreign policy analysis. Inferring from
his postulation, it is impossible to understand the totality of a
State's foreign policy behaviour. Rather, [[every State possesses
**every possible**]{.mark} theoretical [element]{.mark} that can be
attributed to a State's foreign policy]{.underline}. For instance,
before observation is made, every state is weak and strong at the same
time; aggressive and accommodating; cooperative and competitive.
However, [[upon observation, the observer **interferes** with
reality]{.mark} such that the condition of [the State aligns with **the
premonition**]{.mark} of the observer/analyst. Thus, [we are
**uncertain** of a State's]{.mark} foreign policy [behaviour **until**
we decide to observe]{.mark} and/or analyse]{.underline}. [Upon
analysis, our [uncertainty is substituted by the '**creation' of
reality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is at this point therefore that the
foreign policy analyst relinquishes every claim to objectivity, having
created the reality s/he claims to analyse. Relating the foregoing to
Bohr's contribution to Quantum Mechanics, [[the]{.mark} foreign policy
[analyst can]{.mark} no longer [be regarded as an]{.mark} **impartial
observer** but as an **[active participant]{.mark}**. The instrument
with which s/he assesses a phenomenon directly interacts with the
physical object being observed to influence the result
obtained]{.underline}. Consequently, we could safely assume that if no
one was observing, then nothing would be existing. Then, should we now
assume that occurrences in international politics are the creation of
analysts? To a large extent, [the answer weighs to the affirmative and
accounts for why certain state and non-state actors, cognizant of this
fact, have immensely invested towards gaining the attention of
observers/analysts. **[Terrorist organizations]{.mark}** routinely [post
videos of **violence**]{.mark} on the internet [for analysts to
'**create' their existence**. States]{.mark} **regularly
[release]{.mark}** [videos]{.mark} and images of **military drills** and
military **hardware**. The essence is [to gain attention of **analysts**
who would]{.mark} therefore '**[create' the desired
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, [terrorism is **non-existent**
until it is so **designated**]{.mark} by analysts. More so, [war
is]{.mark} simply [what analysts]{.mark} and observers **[make of
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to the foregoing[, quantum
mechanics gives us insight in **understanding causation**. This is
chiefly in its **notion of interconnectedness** which carries
potentially **far-reaching implications** for foreign policy
analysis]{.underline}. According to Senge, et al, we are now aware that
interconnectivity is the organizing principle of the universe.48 The
universe is interconnected in a complex web or relationships such that
we cannot adequately understand a physical reality without acknowledging
its web of relationships. However, this aspect of the universe was
ignored by the Newtonian scientists perhaps as a result of the
pervasiveness of relationships which can sometimes fade into the
background so that "only the apparently separate 'things' of the world
are noticed."49 If objects are interconnected within the universe, do we
then assume same for humans and States? Of course, yes. This is largely
because humans as well as States share the same feature with all other
objects: wave-particle duality. As particles they have form, boundaries,
and identity while as wave, they possess an unstructured potential
which, according to Zohar, spreads out across the boundaries of space,
time, choice and identity.50 Therefore, State and non-State actors, as
applicable to other objects, are interconnected or better still
entangled in a complex manner that makes it particularly tasking if not
impossible to accurately assess foreign policy behaviour. From the
foregoing, it could be assumed that quantum mechanics emphasizes what we
cannot do over what we can do. How does it then help our understanding
of foreign policy? The answer is not far-fetched. [[By identifying
**what we cannot** do]{.mark}, [quantum mechanics saves us from]{.mark}
raising [**false alarms** and]{.mark} making [**erroneous claims**.
It]{.mark} rather [makes case for]{.mark} **intellectual
[diligence]{.mark}** [by encouraging **cross-paradigmatic approach** to
foreign policy]{.mark} analysis. It underscores that **[no single
theory]{.mark}** or approach to **foreign policy analysis** [is on its
own **adequate**]{.mark} for foreign policy analysis. Thus, by engaging
all possible approaches, the analyst increases the proportion of
objectivity in his/her analysis.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Root Cause

#### [Binarism]{.underline} is the [cause]{.underline} of external conflict.

Australia, 2020, "Enfolding wholes in parts: quantum holography and
International Relations," European Journal of International Relations
2020, Vol. 26(S1) 14--38

This article situates itself between [the relational turn in IR and the
quantum turn in the social sciences]{.underline} (and lately in IR as
well). Between the two turns, [there has been a mutual neglect at the
expense of a better defined and more operationalizable relational
approach to IR]{.underline}. To address the gap, [this article has
outlined [a **quantum holographic ontology**]{.mark}, which stipulates
that [parts are **more than just parts**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
conventional sense of the word, [[but are]{.mark} specifically [enfolded
wholes]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Drawing on Bohm's insights into
wholeness and the implicate order, the article has introduced a set of
new conceptual tools to IR in general and to the relational debate in
particular, such as whole-part duality, enfoldment, unfoldment,
implicate order, and explicate order[. [These tools help us **rethink
IR**]{.mark} and many **dominant IR concepts** in some ontologically
innovative ways, including the need to take wholeness in IR **more
seriously**]{.underline}, a new emphasis on the holographic nature of
the state, and [the promises of this approach for **explaining and
mitigating** difference and conflict in IR theory and
practice]{.underline}. By way of conclusion, the article now briefly
considers two ethical implications of quantum holography for IR. First,
[t[he holographic being]{.mark}/becoming for "parts" [is]{.mark}
**immensely [empowering]{.mark}**, because [it reveals that]{.mark} the
[parts, or]{.mark} previously assumed [**individual "selves,"** are
never alone]{.mark} in a frightening state of nature; rather, [they are
**inescapably linked** to]{.mark} [and **sustained by the
whole/world**]{.mark}: indeed, their holographicity means that **they
are the whole/world**, [merely on smaller scales. This should
**transform**]{.mark} the way we think about [our **identity, interest,
and security** in a]{.mark} fundamentally **relational and
[positive]{.mark}** [way]{.mark}, because in a holographically related
world, [there can be no inherent]{.mark} "**Others" or "[external"
threats]{.mark}** [out there unless we]{.mark} **consciously or
subconsciously [divide the world]{.mark}** [in binary terms]{.mark} and
act accordingly]{.underline}. [Second, [holographic
being]{.mark}/becoming [entails]{.mark} holographic
[responsibility]{.mark}, which is an ethical commitment to the notion
and practice of responsibility for all. By all we mean [the
whole]{.mark} and its various "parts," [including the **smallest
"components**]{.mark}," such as corals and insects. To the extent that
they all [**ultimately** share the same whole]{.mark}, all parts, large
or small, are real or **potential enfoldments** of the
whole.]{.underline} Their well-being, as an indicator of the well-being
of the whole, matters to the whole and to each of its parts. [Thus,
[responsibility for all means "**care for all** and **do no
harm**."]{.mark} In a holographically connected world, [harm to
"others]{.mark}"]{.underline} (even the smallest "[others")
[means]{.mark} inevitably [harm to the]{.mark} whole, including the
"[self]{.mark},"]{.underline} who necessarily enfolds the whole: here
the example of the microplastics problem comes to mind. Cosmopolitanism
has long held the idea that "harm to individuals \[is\] a moral problem
for the world as a whole" (Linklater, 2002: 320), and quantum holography
can enrich the relational ontology of cosmopolitanism and at the same
time help it move beyond its narrow humanist focus.

[A [China]{.mark} that holographically emerges out of the contemporary

[by theories]{.mark} that are still [based on **the Newtonian
ontology**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which treats]{.mark} states like
[China as]{.mark} ontologically **separate and [distinct]{.mark}**.
In]{.underline} opening up a new ontological perspective, [this chapter
now turns to a brief examination of why mainstream IR theories,
particularly [**realism and liberalism**, need to be
rethought]{.mark}]{.underline}. [First, [realism]{.mark}, and **power
transition theory** in particular]{.underline} (Tammen and Kugler, 2006;
Lai, [2011), [have]{.mark} almost completely [overlooked China's]{.mark}

2005: 32). Western theorists may have good reason to draw upon past
European and American experiences to fear the prospect of China adopting
its own 'Monroe Doctrine' or falling into the 'Thucydides Trap'
(Allison, 2017). [What [they fail to]{.mark} adequately
[appreciate]{.mark} is that [the whole]{.mark} from which China has
emerged [has]{.mark} now [become]{.mark} **quite [different]{.mark}**
(Wang, 2013).]{.underline} The holographic relational perspective does
not necessarily mean that China's rise or 'Chinese' relationality will
be peaceful (Shih, 2016: 687). Hard power still matters in contemporary
world politics, and realism remains part and parcel of China's strategic
thinking[. Hence, despite the existence of a holographic world[, if
Chinese leaders behave as if they live in a **Newtonian world**]{.mark}
of mechanistic relations, then the **earlier-mentioned [fears]{.mark}**
[of China may be **warranted**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the face of the
COVID-19 pandemic, rising [**antiglobalization sentiment** and]{.mark}
increasing **global [trade tensions]{.mark}**[, the shift to]{.mark}
more [emphasis on domestic circulation]{.mark} in China's 'dual
circulation' economic strategy [seems to signal the **winding back** of
its]{.mark} holographic [engagement]{.mark} with the world]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, a couple of points are worth noting here. One is that
there is some Chinese recognition, at both scholarly and official
levels, of the world as a cosmopolitan whole (for example in terms of
'the community of common destiny'), and of the holographic entanglement
that there is something of each in the other (ni zhong you wo, wo zhong
you ni) (Xi, 2015). [Whether Chinese foreign policy]{.underline} (for
example the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI[)) will live up to such
rhetoric remains to be seen]{.underline}, but at least such
understanding could help underpin a consistent policy of opening up.
Another point is that [China's holographic relational being/becoming is
by definition **relational and reciprocal**]{.underline}. Given that how
its significant 'Others' behave constitutes part of China's holographic
whole[, [the dominance of **a zero-sum**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[**non-holographic way** of understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
dealing with China from **the 'outside' world** [is likely to produce a
China that is]{.mark} similarly **[uncompromising and
assertive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi
was quoted as saying during his discussion with US Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, 'China will consider how to engage with the U.S. side
based on the U.S. attitude towards China' (Reuters, 2021). Second, while
[[liberal scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} do pay close attention to
China's transformation and socialization (Economy and Oksenberg, 1999;
Johnston, 2008), [they also [fail to recognize]{.mark} that its
[transformation]{.mark}/socialization [is fundamentally
**holographic**]{.mark} **and multidirectional**]{.underline}, [[rather
than **linear**]{.mark} or unidirectional]{.underline}. Some liberal
thinkers are right that it would be illogical and extremely difficult
for today's China to overturn the international capitalist order
(Ikenberry, 2008); after all, China is already a holographic part of
that order and so turning against that order would mean turning against
itself. Still, [many tend to misconstrue its holographic transition as
reducible to **Westernization** or **democratization** in the Western
image]{.underline} (Gilley, 2004; Hutton, 2006; Kristof, 2013), [while
forgetting that the [**sources** of]{.mark} holographic
[influence]{.mark} on China [are **global**, rather than]{.mark} merely
'[Western']{.mark}]{.underline}. The global whole in which China exists
and evolves includes also the 'nonWestern' world as well as 'Chinese'
history and tradition (or what Wang Jisi calls 'historical China', see
Chapter 6). [[To ignore]{.mark} those connections and [their **complex
impact** on China]{.mark} is to [**miss** a significant aspect of
China's]{.mark} rise that does not fit well with the **liberal
narrative**]{.underline}. Furthermore, even as China has absorbed many
'Western' influences (bearing in mind that there is nothing purely
Western to begin with, as Hobson \[2004\] points out), [such outside
influences, once transmitted into China, may undergo further local
**holographic transition** of their own by taking on some 'Chinese'
characteristics]{.underline} (Pan, 2012: 116--17). Also, as China's
power grows and its relations further expand (such as through the BRI),
it is certain to once again become a major source of holographic
transition for other countries, just as it once was, particularly
through its tributary system, in which the participation of the
'barbarians' was in part to 'come and be transformed' (lai-hua)
(Fairbank, 1942: 132). Thus, China's rise is both an object and an agent
of holographic transition. To sum up, [both [the '**identity'** of China
and]{.mark} its **[implications]{.mark}** for the world [are inherently
**complex**]{.mark}**, dynamic and indeterminate**. As a case of
holographic transition, [China's rise defies the **binary scenarios**
of]{.mark} either [a **hegemonic challenge**]{.mark} to the
Western-dominant order [or a **linear integration**]{.mark} into it
(]{.underline}see also Chapter 9). [With China unable to meet the
liberal expectation, there has now been growing disillusionment with,
and **renewed realist fear** of, it in recent years]{.underline} (Pan,
2012: Chapter 7; Campbell and Ratner, 2018). China's rise does pose many
profound challenges, whether economically, politically, normatively or
environmentally. But such challenges, despite their apparent 'Chinese'
symptoms, often have their holographic origins in the world. Thus,
without denying Chinese responsibility or agency, [[**to effectively
deal** with those]{.mark} challenges [requires us to see them]{.mark}
also [as]{.mark} **global and [holographic challenges]{.mark}** [that
cannot be reduced to]{.mark}, let alone solved as, [uniquely Chinese
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Global problems demand global public
policy and cooperative solutions. As such, the United States' focus on
'Chinese' imports, for instance, as the cause of its job-loss problem
misses the point. Similarly, [[attempts to contain China are **unlikely
to be effective**]{.mark} given that [China's]{.mark} very [being has
been]{.mark} **embodied and [embedded]{.mark}** [in **holographic
relations**]{.mark} with the global whole, with which we are all
**inextricably entangled and implicated**.]{.underline}

#### Nation states are the [cause]{.underline} of peace and promote [regional unity]{.underline}.

University, International Cooperation, "A study on how modern
nationalism can prevent imperialism from re-emerging," February 2018,

Though we do live in the most peaceful era of our time, we tend to
forget how much more violent the world has used to be. [These days, more
people die of **car crashes** than being killed by **wars** or
terrorism. We commemorate the wars and celebrate our
**independence**,]{.underline} to continue the realization of what
happened and to what extend we are capable of committing inhumane
crimes. Whether internal state conflicts have been decreased since the
end of World War II is debatable, [but that clashes between states have
decreased is **undeniable**]{.underline}. The succession of the League
of Nations by the United Nations, provides one of the most powerful
resistance to pull factors in keeping nations in check with regards to
imperial ambitions. Obviously there were tensions during for example the
Cold War and conflicts did break out between states, but in light of the
historic time frame, [it has **never been this peaceful** as it is
today. No Roman or Ottoman empire can start a conquest, in fact, ever
since the end of the last great war no country recognized by the United
Nations has been conquered or wiped of the map. Even the superpowers
today who have all the means for starting their imperial conquest have
to take into account that such **conquest are too costly** to
undertake]{.underline} (e.g. Russia and Crimea, China and Tibet). And
despite that conflicts are still present; the United Nations does not
only have the tools to interfere military wise (i.e. peacekeeping
operations), but also the capabilities to sanction perpetrators. The
United Nations might be far from perfect as power struggles within the
system exist, causing nations among each other to differentiate in
meaning and action. However, as long as it is in place, [nations will
rethink once more their behavior]{.underline}.

Thus, [no country has attempted to conquer another nation **ever since**
the end of the decolonization period. The rise of the nation has a
causal relationship to the **decline in interstate
violence**]{.underline}. Moreover, the nationalists in a country do not
want to start an imperial conquest and make colonies, instead, they want
the colonials out of their country. [The nationstate as we know it today
is deeper rooted in the **emotions of the masses** than any other
previous political organization has achieved before. In order for
nationalism to develop and for sovereignty to be claimed by the
populace, a **complete revision** of the status quo was
required.]{.underline}

As for Korea, the foundation of nationalism developed during the
annexation by Japan and it was not strong enough to prevent the
separation between the North and South. These days, South-Korea has
probably one of the strongest forms of nationalism. The love for the
flag and the (popular) culture, the remembrance of its past, all
contribute to strong sense of horizontal connection. The best and most
recent display of Korea's nationalism were the regular massive protests,
by the millions, opposed to the Korean president. The fear of the Korean
people in the survey stated in the introduction are therefore overrated.

[Not only have the **costs** of imperial warfare gone up, its **profits
also declined**.]{.underline} Looking into the history of empires, the
mere reason for expanding was to search for resources that could still
the economic hunger for growth. Thus, most conquests were focusing on
securing material wealth such as gold, silver, spices, cattle, but also
slaves. These days, we all have access to a global market and as our
traditional resources are getting exhausted, there is a shift in focus
to for example renewable energy sources. [So, not only war did war
became less profitable, **peace** became more **lucrative** than
ever.]{.underline}

Additionally, when we examine the historical developments starting from
the cognitive revolution till present day, [we can observe that we are
moving **toward unity**. The reason for this observation is that we
moved throughout history from many separate tribes and communities into
the large nations covering territories today]{.underline}. We now share
a mostly similar geopolitical system as the world has been divided into
internationally recognized nations, we share a similar economic system
(i.e. capitalist open market place), a similar legal system (i.e.
international and human rights), and we use the same scientific system
(scientist from all over the world share the same view about the
structure of atoms or the treatment of tuberculosis). [This applied to
the transformation of nationalism too, it did not spread evenly across
the globe. It was a phenomenon that slowly spread itself. Notably,
nationalism is not the end station. After the dynasties transformed into
what we call nations, we are now at the **brink of a breakthrough** of a
new transformation, **regionalism**]{.underline}. Europe is ahead of
this transformation, with the establishment of the European Union and
its Schengen treaty of free movement. [There are more **regional
blocks** rising in the world, even within Africa.]{.underline} Though
regionalism is experiencing some setbacks as we have seen with the
Brexit and the rise of nationalistic movements, this form will at some
point in time succeed nationalism and its pre-predecessor dynasticism.
Whereas [with nationalism we feel this horizontal comradeship with our
own nationals, in regionalism we feel connected in a similar way with
**other nationals**.]{.underline}

#### Humans are [disentangled]{.underline} from nature. The idea of [entanglement]{.underline} is intrinsically [Newtonian]{.underline}.

Scott **Hamilton 18**, professor at the London School of Economics and
Political Science (LSE), London, UK, "Securing ourselves from ourselves?
The paradox of "entanglement" in the Anthropocene," rime Law Soc Change
68, 579--595 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10611-017-9704-4

This article argues that [an epoch defined by and through the action of
anthropos, the human, **does not** represent an **entanglement** of
humanity with things, nature, or the Earth]{.underline}. Instead, [the
Anthropocene illustrates and intensifies a profound **separation or
dis-entanglement** of humanity from nature. It replaces what was once
the primary and objective concern of security -- i.e., survival, or
avoiding death -- with anthropos, the human being, as a new geological
and spatiotemporal force to be **problematized and secured** in both the
present and the future.]{.underline} Rather than protecting itself from
physical threats in an external world, humanity now subsumes that world
by making itself the simultaneous subject/object of security; an
Archimedean point. With the catastrophic prognoses for the
Anthropocene's future making humanity's temporal, ontological, and
epistemological essence uncertain, a paradox forms: an existential
discontinuity, in which humanity must secure itself in the future from
itself in the present.

This "[Paradox of the Anthropocene" forms an **ontological insecurity**
that is evinced through the concept of "entanglement" now borrowed from
**quantum physics** and applied to **human/nature
relations**]{.underline}. As noted above, [entanglement is commonly used
as an expression emphasizing humanity's enmeshment with]{.underline},
and hence [its ethical responsibility towards, non-human forms of life
and matter.]{.underline} However, although its complex understanding of
space, time, and [the nature of reality offers a **quantum rejoinder**
to neo-Newtonian or "classical" understandings of physics, upon closer
inspection 'entanglement' is found to replicate and exacerbate these
same **classical dynamics** within Anthropocene discourses]{.underline}.
The atomic scale and nature of "quantum" is so complex that [any
observation of nature in-itself is impossible]{.underline}, in that any
knowledge of quantum always already presupposes human interference and
involvement in nature \[7\]. This implies that [security or morality in
the Anthropocene cannot be derived from, nor based upon, the
mathematical principles of entanglement alone]{.underline}. Rather, it
is from humanity's dis-entanglement -- the gap or distance between our
mathematical knowledge of entangled phenomena and the social world
within which we as humans reside -- from which ethics, norms, and values
are derived. The danger lies not in promoting and demanding humanity's
ethical responsibility towards nature and Earth -- a noble and essential
task indeed -- but in attributing these ethics to entanglement, thereby
forgetting how it is only through a social and human world that forms of
security and responsibility are made practicable and thinkable.

This article proceeds as follows: First, it provides a brief overview of
how security and entanglement are commonly used and combined in
scholarly literature. The [Anthropocene's "entanglement" claims are
generally positioned as a new form of human/nature order in response to
the destabilization of traditional subject/object binaries that outmoded
logics of security were previously grounded upon]{.underline}. Second,
it examines how a specific variant of security -- "ontological
security", or the existential securing of a continuous sense of self --
best exemplifies or situates security discourses surrounding the
Anthropocene today. The success of the concept of the Anthropocene is an
artifact or product of this profound new ontological (in)security. In an
uncertain future, [the Anthropocene provides a new ontological certainty
and stable understanding of what humans as individuals, and as a
species, have become: a planetary force]{.underline} \[8\]. Third, by
examining the concept of quantum entanglement in greater detail, this
[article outlines how its version of anthropos is made always already
present in a **neo-Newtonian guise**]{.underline}. By elevating itself
to the status of a present and future global security problem, [the
human is neither entangled or entwined with nature, but only with its
**own classical knowledge** of nature]{.underline}. Finally, the article
concludes by outlining a possible solution to this paradox: to embrace
humanity's dis-entanglement from Nature as a social space, within which
to recognize and act ethically against humanity's catastrophic effects
on the planet. This requires grasping the quantum lesson that humanity
will never be fully enmeshed or entangled with Nature: "Thus even in
science the object of research is no longer nature itself, but man's
investigation of nature. Here, again, man confronts himself alone"
(\[7\], p.24).

#### Predictions are good and true

What Are the Pros and Cons of a Predictive Approach to Social Science?

[The main pro is that the predictive enterprise helps us evaluate how
well we are doing so that we can improve our understanding of the
world]{.underline}. It is the gold standard of a scientific approach. We
do not yet have an experimental framework for many important subjects.
As a result, it is important to make sure we can get the same kind of
results with new information that we got with the data we began
investigating. That means we have to either save some data back (a great
idea), use the future to see how well our modeled understandings
perform, or preferably both. There are only nascent traditions of this
in the social sciences at present. Keeping track of your success is not
collecting significant coefficients. Keeping track matters. One
consequence is that we cannot just keep using the same data over and
over. And over. One reason that many hate predictions is that talking
heads make many predictions in the media, but few of them ever keep
track of how well they are doing. Their goal is somewhat akin to a
venture capitalist's make enough bets that eventually one of them is
correct enough that you get to make a lot more bets. Ascher (1979) long
ago showed that the talking heads were most often wrong. This is still
true. You would think that they would get better over time, but there is
little evidence that this is the case.

[We also will be driven into making more **precise investigations** once
we start to predict. We will not be satisfied with annual data for most
things. Nor will we necessarily be satisfied with national-level
information because it becomes even more apparent in the predictive
domain that the world is neither flat nor homogeneous. As a result, we
should get more precise understandings of how things play out in our
social world.]{.underline} At the same time, we have to recognize that
our predictions are probabilistic and contain a large amount of
uncertainty, more so than in other endeavors.

As a result of these two aspects, better and more precise understandings
of our social world, it is possible to be more relevant to decision
makers at all levels. This does not mean just inside the beltway. It
also means decision makers at CDC (Centers for Disease Control) as well
as those in non-governmental organizations around the world.

What are the cons? Several arguments are usually brought to the fore.

[1. The world is inherently unpredictable. But we are studying it
anyway. Go figure. The refrain to this litany is often "but I know what
is going to happen in this instance." Maybe, but **let us keep track and
find out if you are right**. This is the talking heads premise, and it
is demonstrably false**. Making cause and effect statements about
politics does imply that politics is** in part, at least,
**predictable.**]{.underline}

2\. This will empower the establishment and impoverish those without
power. Actually, it might. But at the same time, it provides ways in
which those outside the capitals can also affect the future. Why will
prediction be more valuable to the establishment than it is to the rest
of society? Is the same thing true of explanation and substantive
knowledge? Western society is based in part on the idea that knowledge
is a valuable thing for all. It is true that some take more advantage of
it than others. But having open and available knowledge can be important
for many diverse groups. As an example, we might think that clandestine
organizations can benefit from open knowledge, even precise actionable
knowledge, but as we think these thoughts, most of us might not be
thinking about transnational activist networks but rather large
governmental organizations. However, it is clear that non-governmental
actors are also consumers of knowledge.

3\. It is possible to predict things without true understanding or
knowledge. Sure, but rarely is this true for any but the simplest of
systems. I am reminded of the wonderful essay by Calvin Trillin
describing the chicken on Mott Street in New York's Chinatown that
played and always won Tic-Tac-Toe. The chicken did not understand the
game. But the chicken always won.6 It is ridiculous to suggest that we
have models that predict as accurately as the (now gone) Mott Street
chicken but have the same understanding of the "chicken" game. Even if
it were the case (and I repeat it is not), could the opposite really be
true? If you have deep understanding of the world, should you not be
able to generate accurate predictions of how it will work in situations
you have not seen before? Will proximate effects lead us toward distant
causes much like proximate causes can lead us to distant effects?

4\. We will disrupt the space-time continuum. [If we can predict
conflict, for example, we will be able to prevent it. Or start it where
we want. And then we will no longer be able to predict conflict. One of
my models attempts to predict where there will be coups de e´tat and
other types of irregular regime changes on a monthly level.]{.underline}
Maybe if Muhammadu Buhari, who assumed the presidency of Nigeria at the
end of May 2015, sees our manuscript, he might be able to prevent any
irregular leadership change from occurring in the next six months. And
maybe that would be bad. Or good. But in any case, I am pretty sure that
the Nigerian president is already aware of the fragility of the Nigerian
political landscape. This is a frequent type of criticism of
forecasting. I think we can wait for this to become a real problem
before we stop trying to develop better understandings of the world.

5\. Real social effects occur glacially. Predictions will be focused on
epiphenomenal changes that won't matter in the long run. How do you
know?

In summary, we need less theory because most theory is an attempt to
rescue or adapt extant theory[. We need more predictions in order to
**keep track of how well we understand the world around us**. They will
tell us how good our theories are and where we need better
explanations.]{.underline} Predictions are like cell phones. First, they
seem arcane and bizarre. Then, in a few short years, there is no one
around who remembers life without cell phones and your kids use them in
ways you don't understand. The 2012 US presidential election was the
first that was famously and accurately predicted. But it will be the
first of many. All future voters will vote in an era in which accurately
predicting the election will be the norm, not the exception, though as
in the UK in 2015, there will be exceptions. This will have consequences
for democracy. In the same way that having a product recommended to us
on the web is now normal, this will become the new normal. Data science
(and more data) will guide us to a better understanding of our future
than we have now. [Whether you are involved with commercial
organizations, local government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
the federal government, or international organizations, prediction will
be part of the daily ebb and flow of information, and we shall become
used to seeing accurate predictions about a wide variety of political
phenomena.]{.underline}

#### The alternative's [imagination]{.underline} doesn't [change reality]{.underline} but creates [violence]{.underline} through erasing boundaries.

Scott **Hamilton 18**, professor at the London School of Economics and
Political Science (LSE), London, UK, "Securing ourselves from ourselves?

68, 579--595 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10611-017-9704-4

Although the basics of [quantum physics also depends upon
statistics]{.underline} and a type of quantum causality to make
predictions, "quantum mechanics is incompatible with the view that
physical observables possess pre-existing values independent of the
measurement context" (\[37\], p. 259). Nature might be manifested in
certain phenomena in the macro world, but conceived through
entanglement, [these manifestations would be so incommensurable to
everyday neo-Newtonian thought that they would be "irreducibly beyond
anything we can experience or beyond anything we can possibly conceive
of"]{.underline} (\[38\], p. 1653). In other words, quantum uncertainty
rules entanglement in a mind-boggling way, while classical certainty
(i.e., causality) rules Newtonian metaphysics so uniformly that today we
barely even notice it. [**Declaring classical sciences** and renderings
of nature to be "entangled", therefore, **does not actually make them**
so. It actually masks the **certainty** of a classical **Newtonian
causality** still working beneath the Anthropocene's discursive surface.
One cannot overcome Western metaphysics simply by reading about how to
overcome Western metaphysics, and then **asserting it to be
so**.]{.underline} This only intensifies the underlying conceptual
foundations that treat quantum entanglement itself as a concept, tool,
or object that can be causally applied to a human subject and its world.

For example, following Maslin, take the concept best framing the effect
of humanity upon the Earth system: planetary boundaries (\[9\], p. 2).
[These are discrete and **quantitative boundaries**, units, or limits,
within which humanity should **operate** to achieve a **safe space** for
human development. Notions of quantified "safe" spaces obviously retain
the classical Newtonian epistemologies of calculating secure, bounded
limits for the "future" of humanity]{.underline}; a predictive orderly
security, designed to reduce uncertainty within discrete limits, to
ensure survival from chaos outside these spatiotemoporal limits. Indeed,
humanity must respect the limits of these linear thresholds as "Earth's
'rules of the game' or, as it were,. .. the 'planetary playing field'
for the human enterprise" (Röckstrom et al., 2009). The point here is
that ESS and its planetary boundaries model replicates a Western secular
cosmology that works by explicitly measuring the distance between an
"objective" nature and humanity. Nature is once again placed into a
structural numerical box as the background context from which humanity
is contrasted in order to make itself secure \[34\]. As Fagan \[6\] has
noted, [an implicit human/nature dualism results from this. Any relation
of the environment and security supposedly **erasing the boundaries**
between humanity and nature **becomes itself a violent act** \[6\]. In
this case, entanglement becomes, therefore, an analogy masking a
neo-Newtonian ordering of subject to object that is actually inherent to
the ESS, and thus to conceptualizing the Anthropocene. If we were
actually entangled, not only should there be no boundaries, but it would
be **impossible to detect** them]{.underline}. This new metaphysical
orientation would have to replace or transcend thinkable subject/object
binaries, rather than focus on or assert their interdependence or
interconnection, which we still see in IR's security discourses today.
