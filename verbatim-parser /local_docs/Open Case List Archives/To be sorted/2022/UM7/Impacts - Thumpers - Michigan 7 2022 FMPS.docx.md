[If Finland and Sweden join NATO]{.underline}, it would [mark one of the
most significant expansions of the alliance in decades]{.underline} at a
time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine has radically altered Europe's
security calculus. [It also underscores how the war in Ukraine has
undermined President Vladimir V. Putin's aim of weakening
NATO]{.underline} by pushing Sweden and Finland, which were neutral and
nonaligned for decades, into the alliance's arms.

"I'm pleased to announce that we **[now have an agreement that paves the
way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO]{.underline}**," NATO's
secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Tuesday evening. "**[Turkey,
Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses Turkey's
concerns]{.underline}**, [including around arms exports, and the fight
against terrorism]{.underline}."

The meeting in Madrid included the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of
Turkey, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and President Sauli
Niinisto of Finland, and was chaired by Mr. Stoltenberg.

"As a result of that meeting, our [foreign ministers signed a trilateral
memorandum which **confirms that Turkey will**]{.underline}, at the
Madrid summit this week, **[support the invitation of Finland and Sweden
to become members of NATO]{.underline}**," Mr. Niinisto said. "[The
concrete steps of our accession to NATO will be agreed by the NATO
allies during the next two days]{.underline}, but that decision is now
imminent."

MADRID --- [**Turkey has agreed to support Finland's and Sweden's
membership in NATO,** paving the way for the alliance to grow. The
leaders of the three countries signed a memorandum]{.underline} Tuesday
at a NATO summit in Madrid [confirming Turkey's support for the
membership bids]{.underline} by Helsinki and Stockholm. [Russia's
invasion of Ukraine pushed Finland and Sweden to seek to join the
alliance.]{.underline}

[Leaders from the Group of Seven]{.underline} wealthiest democracies
ended their summit in Germany [promising to "urgently" explore price
caps on Russian oil and gas.]{.underline} They did not, however, impose
new energy sanctions. In closing remarks, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
said Russian President Vladimir Putin "must not win the war."

[Ukrainian President]{.underline} Volodymyr Zelensky again [urged the
United States to name Moscow a state sponsor of terrorism]{.underline}
--- a designation that would trigger significant penalties --- after a
Russian missile strike on a shopping mall in the central city of
Kremenchuk killed at least 18 people. In a Tuesday speech to the U.N.
Security Council meeting, Zelensky said Russia should be stripped of its
seat on the council and a tribunal should be established to investigate
Moscow's "daily terrorist acts."

### finland and sweden- baltics

#### Finland and Sweden provide NATO with prime geography to reinforce against a Russian attack

NATO, Europe's Geography Just Got A Lot More Difficult For Russia,\"

[Turkey will lift its objection to Finland and Sweden joining NATO,
setting the stage for the alliance's biggest expansion in a
generation.]{.underline}

**[The expansion will dramatically alter Europe's strategic
geography---in NATO's favor.]{.underline}**

The decision came at the beginning of a NATO summit Tuesday in Madrid.
"We had a thorough meeting with President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
and Prime Minister of Sweden Magdalena Andersson, facilitated by
Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg," announced Sauli Niinistö,
the president of Finland.

[The Finnish and Swedish governments stated their intentions to join the
30-country military alliance back in]{.underline} April, six weeks into
Russia's wider war on Ukraine. Both countries for decades maintained a
Western-leaning non-alignment---coordinating and training with NATO but
avoiding any treaty entanglements.

[Russia's]{.underline} brutal [attack on Ukraine changed
everything]{.underline}. [Popular opinion in Sweden and Finland quickly
shifted in favor of joining NATO]{.underline}. Article V of the alliance
charter obligates member states to defend each other in the event of an
attack.

[Turkey stood in the way of Swedish and Finnish membership, at
first.]{.underline} The NATO charter requires the unanimous consent of
existing member states before any new state can join. [Erdogan
objected]{.underline}, unfairly accusing Sweden and Finland of
supporting two Kurdish militant groups, the PKK and YPG.

In Madrid, [Swedish and Finnish officials reaffirmed their commitment to
counterterrorism. That, plus whatever arms deals get announced in coming
days, clearly was enough for the Turks]{.underline}. **["The concrete
steps of our accession to NATO will be agreed by the NATO allies during
the next two days]{.underline}**, but that decision is now imminent,"
Niinistö said.

In joining NATO, [Finland adds its 24,000 active troops, 100 warplanes
and scores of warships to the alliance, while Sweden adds its own 15,000
active troops plus similar numbers of planes and ships.]{.underline}

The additional manpower isn't hugely significant in an alliance that
already includes 3.5 million troops**[. The geographical changes
arguably are more important. With Finland and Sweden in NATO, the
alliance extends along all Finland's 830-mile land border with
Russia---and also nearly encircles the Baltic Sea.]{.underline}**

The latter is key. [NATO's most vulnerable
members]{.underline}---Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia---[are sandwiched
on the Baltic]{.underline} between Russia and Kaliningrad, Russia's
Baltic exclave. "[NATO would almost certainly need basing rights in
Finland and Sweden to defend the Baltic states]{.underline}," the New
York City-based Council on Foreign Relations explained prior to
Tuesday's membership announcement.

[Admitting Finland and Sweden gives NATO myriad air bases, ports and
lines of communication north of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia,
facilitating swift reinforcement of the three countries in the event of
a Russian attack.]{.underline}

[The breakthrough in the top-level diplomatic talks between Finland,
Sweden and Turkey came shortly after President Joe Biden and other NATO
leaders arrived]{.underline} in Spain [for a three-day
summit]{.underline} that will determine the course of the alliance for
years.

**[Finland's and Sweden's entry into the alliance will vastly expand its
reach.]{.underline}**

[Finland shares an 830-mile border with Russia, **allowing NATO to
fortify its eastern flank**.]{.underline} [Both countries]{.underline}
also [sit along the Baltic Sea]{.underline}, a vast body of water
bordering nine countries, including Denmark and Germany to the west and
Estonia and Russia on the east. [Once Finland and Sweden formally enter
NATO, **the Baltic Sea will be essentially controlled by the military
alliance.**]{.underline}

"[**Finland and Sweden joining NATO turns the Baltic Sea into a NATO
lake**, where the Russian navy will be operating on NATO
terms]{.underline}," said Rose Gottemoeller, NATO's former deputy
secretary general. \"[It will be surrounded by NATO countries on every
side]{.underline}."

NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg announced]{.underline} Monday
that [NATO allies will agree at the summit to increase the strength of
the alliance's rapid reaction force nearly eightfold]{.underline}, from
40,000 to 300,000 troops. [The troops]{.underline} [will be]{.underline}
based in their home nations, but [dedicated to specific countries on
NATO's eastern flank, where the alliance plans to build up stocks of
equipment and ammunition.]{.underline}

"As a consequence, **[it strengthens NATO's ability to monitor
developments in the Baltic and to operate in the Baltic]{.underline}**,"
Kupchan said.

## russia war

### no escalation

#### Russia doesn't have the capabilities for escalation, they've tried and failed :(

David E. **Sanger** and Julian E. **Barnes**, **6-22**-2022, \"Many
Russian Cyberattacks Failed in First Months of Ukraine War, Stud...,\"
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/us/politics/russia-ukraine-cyberattacks.html,
accessed 7-8-2022//cpd

WASHINGTON --- A new examination of how Russia used its
cybercapabilities in the first months of the war in Ukraine contains a
number of surprises: [Moscow conducted more cyberattacks than was
realized at the time to bolster its invasion]{.underline}, [but **more
than two-thirds of them failed,** echoing its poor performance on the
physical battlefield.]{.underline}

However, the study, published by Microsoft on Wednesday, suggested that
the government of President Vladimir V. Putin was succeeding more than
many expected with its disinformation campaign to establish a narrative
of the war favorable to Russia, including making the case that the
United States was secretly producing biological weapons inside Ukraine.

[The report is the latest effort by many groups]{.underline}, including
American intelligence agencies, [to understand the interaction
of]{.underline} a brutal physical war with a parallel --- and often
coordinated --- [struggle in cyberspace.]{.underline} It indicated that
**[Ukraine was well prepared to fend off cyberattacks,]{.underline}**
[after having endured them for many years]{.underline}. That was at
least in part because of a well-established system of warnings from
private-sector companies, including Microsoft and Google, and
preparations that included moving much of Ukraine's most important
systems to the cloud, onto servers outside Ukraine.

[The account of Russia's cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns
showed that]{.underline} **[only 29 percent of the attacks breached the
targeted networks]{.underline}** --- in Ukraine, the United States,
Poland and the Baltic nations. But it points to a more successful effort
underway to dominate the information war, in which Russia has blamed
Washington and Kyiv for starting the conflict that is now raging in
Ukraine's east and south.

[The war is the first full-scale battle in which traditional and
cyberweapons have been used side by side, and the race is on to explore
the never-before-seen dynamic between the two.]{.underline} So far,
**[very little of that dynamic has developed as expected.]{.underline}**

Initially, analysts and government officials were struck by the absence
of crippling Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid and communications
systems. In April, President Biden's national cyberdirector, Chris
Inglis, said "[the question of the moment" was why Russia had not made
"a very significant play of cyber, at least against NATO and the United
States."]{.underline} He speculated that the [Russians]{.underline}
thought they were headed to quick victory in February but "[were
distracted" when the war effort ran into obstacles.]{.underline}

The Microsoft report said that [Russia had attempted a major cyberattack
on Feb. 23, the day before the physical invasion]{.underline}. That
attack, using malware called FoxBlade, was an attempt to use "wiper"
software that wiped out data on government networks. [At roughly the
same time, Russia attacked the Viasat satellite communications network,
hoping to cripple the Ukrainian military.]{.underline}

"We were, I think, among the first to witness the first shots that were
fired on the 23rd of February," said Brad Smith, the president of
Microsoft.

"It has been a formidable, intensive, even ferocious set of attacks,
attacks that started with one form of wiper software, attacks that are
really being coordinated from different parts of the Russian
government," he added on Wednesday at a forum at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation and Institute in Washington.

[But **many of the attacks were thwarted,** or there was enough
redundancy built into the Ukrainian networks that the efforts did little
damage.]{.underline} The result, Mr. Smith said, is that the attacks
have been underreported.

The G7 agrees to seek price caps on Russian oil, as allied diplomacy
shifts to NATO.

G7 leaders press ahead with price cap on Russian oil.

Biden speaks with Erdogan before a NATO summit.

In many instances, [Russia coordinated its use of cyberweapons with
conventional attacks,]{.underline} including taking down the computer
network of a nuclear power plant before moving in its troops to take it
over, Mr. Smith said. Microsoft officials declined to identify which
plant Mr. Smith was referring to.

While much of Russia's cyberactivity has focused on Ukraine, Microsoft
has detected 128 network intrusions in 42 countries. Of the 29 percent
of Russian attacks that have successfully penetrated a network,
Microsoft concluded, only a quarter of those resulted in data being
stolen.

Outside Ukraine, R[ussia has concentrated its attacks on the United
States, Poland and two aspiring members of NATO]{.underline}, Sweden and
Finland. Other alliance members were also targeted, especially as they
began to supply Ukraine with more arms. [Those breaches, though, have
been limited to surveillance --- indicating that **Moscow is trying to
avoid bringing NATO nations directly into the fight through
cyberattacks,** much as it is refraining from physical attacks on those
countries.]{.underline}

#### No Russian escalation, Putin is focusing on getting more weapons to Ukraine \[ALT: No Russian escalation, they can't even supply the war in Ukraine\]

For the first time, **[Russia has admitted that it is running out of
weapons in the Ukraine war]{.underline}**, [after President Vladimir
Putin\'s government created a draft federal law that would allow the
country to quickly repair weapons and military equipment.]{.underline}

On Thursday evening, the Kremlin submitted a bill to the State Duma on
\"special economic measures\" for \"counterterrorist and other
operations\" outside of Russia.

An explanatory note attached to the bill said that [there
is]{.underline}, particularly amid Putin\'s war against Ukraine, \"[a
short-term increased need for the repair of weapons and military
equipment.\"]{.underline}

In this combination image, Vladimir Putin at the Ashgabat International
Airport, late June,29,2022, in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan and inset of Pro
Russian rebels fire grad rockets on Ukrainian positions

The bill proposed, among other measures, \"the implementation of
material assets from state reserves\" and \"the temporary activation of
mobilization capacities and facilities,\" as well as overtime work in
\"individual organizations.\"

The text of [the draft law notes the need for Russia to repair its
weapons and military equipment amid \"a special military
operation]{.underline} in the territories of the Donetsk People\'s
Republic, the Luhansk People\'s Republic and Ukraine,\" referring to the
war against Ukraine, which Putin launched late February.

\"[The need to promptly]{.underline} meet these requirements, especially
in the context of the introduction by foreign states and international
organizations of restrictive measures against Russian citizens and
Russian legal entities, will require temporarily focusing efforts in
certain sectors of the economy (in certain areas), [reloading the
production capacities of organizations of the military-industrial
complex]{.underline}, including mobilization, and to organize resource
support for deliveries within the framework of the state defense
order,\" the note said.

According to the explanatory note, the bill, if signed into law, would
give the Kremlin the authority \"to establish special regulations
concerning labor relations for certain organizations, their divisions
and selected production facilities.\"

**[This marks the first time Russia has signaled that it is suffering
huge military losses in its war against Ukraine.]{.underline}**

[Ukrainian officials regularly provide updates on Russian military
losses.]{.underline} On Friday, the general staff of the armed forces of
Ukraine said on Facebook that so far, Russia has lost 35,750 military
personnel, 1,577 tanks, 3,736 armored combat vehicles, 796 artillery
systems, 246 multiple rocket launchers, 105 air defense systems, 217
aircraft, 645 operational-tactical UAVs, 15 ships/boats, 2,610 vehicles
and tankers, and 186 helicopters.

The British defense ministry noted in an intelligence update late May
that [Russia\'s decision to deploy old Soviet-era tanks on the
battlefield highlighted \"Russia\'s shortage of modern, combat-ready
equipment.\"]{.underline}

A bipartisan bill introduced Wednesday in [the Senate aims to shore
up]{.underline} the healthcare industry's [cyber defenses shortly after
White House warnings of potential Russian cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} so-called Healthcare Cybersecurity [Act would direct
the]{.underline} Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency ([CISA]{.underline}) and the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) **[to work side by side on bolstering
cybersecurity readiness]{.underline}** among healthcare and public
health organizations, according to statements from its co-sponsors.

[Additionally, the bill would authorize cybersecurity
training]{.underline} to healthcare and public health asset owners and
operators [as well as task CISA with conducting a new study on
cybersecurity risks in these sectors.]{.underline}

"**[Health centers save lives and hold a lot of sensitive, personal
information. This makes them a prime target for
cyberattacks,]{.underline}**" Sen. Bill Cassidy, M.D., R-Louisiana, a
co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. "[This bill protects
patients' data and public health by strengthening our resilience to
cyber warfare]{.underline}."

Announcements from Cassidy and fellow co-sponsor Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada,
cited a recent Politico analysis of HHS data that found [over 46 million
people in the U.S. had their health data breached last year,
representing a threefold increase in three years.]{.underline}

The list of industry sectors [heavily impacted by cyberattacks also
includes]{.underline} **[the financial, telecom, infrastructure, and

### yes escalation

#### Despite current lack of escalation, experts predict a major destabilizing attack soon

Kyle **Alspach**, **6-29**-2022, \"Security experts brace for possible
Russian cyberattacks,\" Protocol,
https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/russia-cyberattacks-ukraine-putin-us,
accessed 7-6-2022//cpd

In the four months since its invasion of Ukraine, [Russia hasn\'t
intensified its usual pattern of cyberattacks against the U.S. and
Western Europe in response to sanctions and Ukrainian military aid, as
many expected]{.underline}. **[But that doesn\'t mean the risk of
escalation with the West is gone]{.underline}**, numerous experts told
Protocol.

**[In other words, don\'t lower your shields just yet.]{.underline}**

At the moment, it\'s clear that Vladimir [Putin has made a calculation
not to inflame tensions with the West,]{.underline} said Dmitri
Alperovitch, the Russian-born cybersecurity and geopolitics expert who
co-founded CrowdStrike.

But [if things don\'t go Putin\'s way on Ukraine and sanctions, **he
\"may very well resort back to cyber to increase pressure on the
West**,\"]{.underline} Alperovitch said.

Ciaran Martin, who was the founding CEO of the U.K. government\'s
National Cyber Security Centre, [agreed that Putin's approach toward the
West on cyber may change in response to events on the ground in Ukraine.
"**Russia could decide that it needs to make a point to the West, in an
escalatory way**,]{.underline}\" Martin said, though "the chances of
\[that\] are not high at the moment."

To get a better sense of the current state of the Russian cyber threat
against the West, Protocol recently spoke with 20 experts --- including
threat researchers, former government officials and those with expertise
on critical infrastructure and Russia.

A number of them are concerned that, as soon as later this year, [Putin
may give the green light for major cyberattacks aimed at **disrupting
critical infrastructure and supply chains in the West.**]{.underline} A
surge of attacks from proxy groups is also probable, according to some
Russia watchers.

\"I fear **[this is a \'calm before the storm\'
situation]{.underline}**,\" said Chester Wisniewski, principal research
scientist at cybersecurity giant Sophos.

In all likelihood, [the political and economic issues facing the Kremlin
will only continue to mount, raising the prospects of Russia bringing
new cyber pressure against the U.S]{.underline}., said Chris Krebs,
former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA).

\"Once they start losing good options, [they\'re going to start using
some of their capabilities they\'ve kept in reserve to strike back at
the U.S. and say, \'Hey, wipe off the sanctions]{.underline},\'\" Krebs
said. \"How are they going to do it? [It would be a highly visible,
**likely destructive attack**]{.underline}.\"

#### Russia will attack!

Cyberattacks -- InsideSources,\" InsideSources, Paul Steidler is a
senior fellow with the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank

[The United States faces an alarming and growing threat of cyberattacks
from Russia.]{.underline} Some in Congress would compound these dangers
by enacting legislation that would force America's leading tech
companies to allow access to their software, hardware and operating
systems to customers and competitors in the U.S. and overseas.

[The]{.underline} Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency [(CISA) has been
blunt about Russia.]{.underline}

"[The Russian government engages in malicious cyber activities to enable
broad-scope cyber espionage, to suppress certain social and political
activity, to steal intellectual property, and to harm regional and
international adversaries]{.underline}," CISA says on its website.

During a "60 Minutes" interview on April 17, [CISA director]{.underline}
Jen Easterly [said]{.underline}: "[We are seeing evolving intelligence
about Russia planning for potential attacks. And we have to assume that
**there's going to be a breach. There's going to be an incident. There's
going to be an attack.**]{.underline}

[Last year, a ransomware attack]{.underline} on the Colonial Pipeline,
thought to have been done by criminals in Russia but not the Russian
government itself, [caused widespread disruption even though it lasted
just a few days. **Coordinated, sustained attacks from Russia's
government would impose exponentially more harm.**]{.underline}

Against this backdrop, the Senate is poised to vote on the American
Innovation and Choice Online Act that would compound these dangers.
Introduced by senators Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Chuck Grassley,
R-Iowa, it broadly requires Big Tech companies to provide information
about back-end infrastructure, that is hardware and software, to
competitors and third parties.

While exceptions are in place for cybersecurity threats, the language
governing this is vague, and the enforcement powers given to regulators
are exceptionally strong. With companies facing fines of up to 10
percent of annual revenue for non-compliance, there will be considerable
pressure to give in.

Bad actors do not announce they are bad actors before penetrating
companies. [Given this and the heightened dangers from Russia, now is a
time to be especially cautious about granting such access.]{.underline}
Even the European Union has not been as reckless as AICO would be from a
cybersecurity standpoint.

Regardless of how events go in the war with Ukraine, **[Russia's
cyberattack risks will be extremely high during the next year or
longer.]{.underline}** [A Ukrainian victory, or battlefield humiliation,
could lead Russia to lash out]{.underline} and flex its cyber muscle to
deter U.S. support for the Ukrainians' brave an honorable fight.

**[And a Russian victory, with sanctions still in effect, could lead
President Vladimir Putin to use cyber as weapon to curb
sanctions.]{.underline}**

[Russia has already blatantly engaged in cyberattacks against Ukraine's
postal service, Ukraine's electric grid, and a Saudi Arabian oil
refinery. And we know there are no limits to Russian brutality in
Ukraine.]{.underline}

As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has documented, America's large tech
companies, including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, are playing a
critical role in preventing cyberattacks in Ukraine. Many other
world-class companies are helping keep us safe from electric grid
attacks, such as Raytheon Technologies, Sierra Nevada Corporation and
Forescout.

[These companies know that **now is a time for especially strong
vigilance on cybersecurity**,]{.underline} which the U.S. Congress
should take to heart.

### nato cohesion high now

#### NATO cohesion against Russia and China is strong now

Steven **Erlanger, 6-29**-2022, \"A More Muscular NATO Emerges as West
Confronts Russia and China,\"

MADRID --- [Faced with a newly aggressive Russia, NATO leaders on
Wednesday outlined a muscular new vision that names Moscow as the
military alliance's primary adversary but also]{.underline}, for the
first time, **[declares China to be a strategic
"challenge."]{.underline}**

[It was a fundamental shift for an alliance]{.underline} that was born
in the Cold War but came to view a post-Soviet Russia as a potential
ally, and did not focus on China at all.

But that was before Feb. 24, [when Russian forces poured across the
border into Ukraine]{.underline}, and [Chinese leaders pointedly did not
join in the global condemnation that followed.]{.underline}

"The deepening [st**rategic partnership between the People's Republic of
China and the Russian Federatio**n and their mutually reinforcing
attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to
our values and interests,"]{.underline} NATO leaders said in a new
mission statement issued during their summit in Madrid.

The announcement came on a day when a top U.S. intelligence official
said victory in Ukraine was not yet in Russia's grasp, the two sides
said they had exchanged more than 200 prisoners of war, and a Ukrainian
official said, "There are battles everywhere."

In a flurry of steps at the summit in Madrid, which ends Thursday,
President Biden and other NATO leaders sought to respond to President
Vladimir V. Putin's resurgent and bellicose Russia. Just before
publishing the mission statement, [they extended formal membership
invitations to the until-now nonaligned Nordic countries Finland and
Sweden, paving the way for **NATO's most significant enlargement in more
than a decade.**]{.underline}

"In a moment when [Putin has shattered peace in Europe and attacked the
very tenets of the rules-based order, **the United States and our allies
--- we're going to step up,"**]{.underline} Mr. Biden said. "We're
stepping up."

The secretary-general of NATO, Jens [Stoltenberg, announced that
thousands of new troops would be deployed in eight countries on NATO's
eastern flank.]{.underline} And Mr. [Biden said that Washington would
deploy an Army garrison headquarters and a field support battalion in
Poland]{.underline}, the first U.S. forces permanently located on NATO's
eastern flank.

[China offered]{.underline} [a chilly response]{.underline} to the new
NATO moves.

"[We oppose certain elements clamoring for NATO's involvement in Asia
Pacific, or an Asia Pacific version of NATO based on military
allianc]{.underline}e," said China's ambassador to the United Nations,
Zhang Jun. "[The outdated Cold War script must not be reenacted in Asia
Pacific. The turmoil in parts of the world must not be allowed in Asia
Pacific.]{.underline}"

#### The Madrid summit proves cohesion against Russia is at an all time high

Summit: What Does It Mean for Russia?,\" Council on Foreign Relations,

[Russia's strategic position has deteriorated substantially]{.underline}
[as a consequence of]{.underline} President Vladimir **[Putin's decision
to invade Ukraine.]{.underline}** [**NATO is more unified in opposition
to Russia than it has been for years**, NATO has more forces along its
borders than ever since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}, [and
Finland and Sweden are set to join the alliance.]{.underline} Talking to
the press along with U.S. President Joe Biden, NATO Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg noted the irony: [Putin wanted less NATO on his
borders, but because of his actions, **he's getting more.**]{.underline}

Nevertheless, [Russia's reaction has been surprisingly
mild.]{.underline} Senior officials have declared that [Russia will take
compensatory steps to guarantee its security,]{.underline} which could
include additional troops and perhaps nuclear forces in its border
regions. However, in May, [Putin said that Russia has no problems with
Finland and Sweden and that their joining NATO does not pose a direct
threat, as long as NATO does not build up military contingents and
infrastructure in those countries.]{.underline} What lies behind this
stance is unclear, but, given the tough battle in Ukraine, Putin might
not want to take on additional problems.

Could changes to force posture and strategic concept have any impact on
the assault on Ukraine or Russia's longer-term calculations?

[NATO's new force posture and strategic concept are not likely to prompt
Putin to rethink his Ukraine strategy.]{.underline} He is making slow
but steady progress on the battlefield in the east and south. [Nothing
suggests that he believes that the West's provision of more
sophisticated weaponry is going to shift fortunes on the
ground.]{.underline} But **[the new circumstances in Europe do pose a
long-term strategic challenge to Russia.]{.underline}** Increasingly
isolated in Europe, Putin was surely pleased to attend the recent
summits of the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South
Africa) and of the Caspian states to underscore that Russia has friends
and allies elsewhere. Whether they can compensate for the loss of
European ties is another matter.

Did **[the summit reveal a newfound sense of NATO unity?]{.underline}**

[**The summit was an impressive show of resolve to counter Russia's
aggression**, including through continued diplomatic, economic, and
military support for Ukraine.]{.underline} [NATO pledged to further
expand its military support for its vulnerable allies along the Russian
frontier.]{.underline} In particular, the United States announced that
it will establish a permanent headquarters for its V Corps in Poland**[.
Most important was the eleventh-hour agreement that Turkey reached with
Finland and Sweden,]{.underline}** by which Ankara lifted its objections
to their joining the alliance and allowed NATO to begin the accession
process.

#### reconciliation fails- McConnell is giving ultimatums!

Steve **Benen 07-01**-2022, \"Mitch McConnell's new hostage threat is
brazen (even for him),\" MSNBC,
https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mitch-mcconnells-new-hostage-threat-brazen-even-rcna36294,
accessed 7-3-2022//cpd

Senate Minority Leader Mitch [McConnell has never been timid about
launching legislative hostage strategies.]{.underline} Indeed, for the
Kentucky Republican, the word isn't even especially inflammatory:
McConnell has literally referenced "hostages" when describing his
tactics.

That said, [the Senate GOP leader's newest threat is
brazen]{.underline}, even by McConnell's standards. Roll Call reported:

[Republicans won't back compromise legislation to boost domestic
semiconductor manufacturing and U.S. competitiveness with China if
Democrats continue to negotiate a partisan budget package that can pass
without GOP support, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said
Thursday.]{.underline}

**["Let me be perfectly clear: there will be no bipartisan USICA as long
as Democrats are pursuing a partisan reconciliation bill," the Kentucky
Republican declared via Twitter.]{.underline}**

At this point, I suspect some of you are asking, "What in the world is
USICA?" so let's review how we arrived at this point.

As legislative fights go, this one hasn't exactly been front-page news,
but lawmakers --- from both chambers and both parties --- have spent
much of the last year on an ambitious bill to bolster American
competitiveness and counter China, in large part by addressing domestic
semiconductor shortages.

The point of the measure --- the "United States Innovation and
Competition Act" (USICA), though it's gone by a few different names ---
is to make Americans less dependent on foreign manufacturing, especially
in high tech. Some have even characterized this as a national security
issue. It's how this became a rare effort that's intended to address a
concern Democrats and Republicans take seriously.

It's why the House and Senate both passed versions of the bill, sending
the issue to a conference committee that began work in April on merging
the competing measures into one final package. Most Capitol Hill
observers agreed that USICA was likely to pass before the fall
elections.

That is, until yesterday.

McConnell's unexpected tweet was effectively a shot across the bow: [The
Senate Republican leader is prepared to throw away a year's worth of
work,]{.underline} derailing a bill his own party takes seriously,
[unless Democrats abandon their budget reconciliation bill.]{.underline}

And at this point, some of you are now also asking, "There's a
Democratic budget reconciliation bill?" The short answer is no, but
[after the Build Back Better effort was left for dead months ago,
there's been significant progress of late on a new bill that would focus
on, among other things, lowering prescription drug costs.]{.underline}

#### Manchin is on board for BBB- Sinema is key 

Joseph **Zeballos-Roig**, **7-2**-2022, \"Senate Democrats are edging
closer to a deal with Manchin to resurrect Biden\'s economic agenda.
They\'ll face Sinema next.,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/senate-democrats-sinema-deal-biden-economic-agenda-bbb-millionaire-tax-2022-7,
accessed 7-3-2022//cpd

[Senate Democrats are inching closer to a deal with]{.underline} Sen.
Joe [Manchin]{.underline} of West Virginia [to resurrect]{.underline}
swaths of President Joe Biden\'s stalled economic agenda once known as
[Build Back Better]{.underline}. [That has positioned the party to
advance over GOP opposition a measure that would slash prescription drug
prices]{.underline}, one of their chief priorities stretching back
years.

However, if Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have
any hope of securing other initiatives like an extension of enhanced
Affordable Care Act subsidies, [their attention must soon shift
to]{.underline} another centrist with outsized influence over the
party\'s agenda: Sen. Kyrsten [Sinema]{.underline} of Arizona.

[Manchin and Sinema hold the power of the purse to opposite ends. While
Manchin largely dictates how Democrats are spending their money, Sinema
prescribes how they\'re raising it to pay for new clean energy and
healthcare programs.]{.underline}

\"Her position is now is not the time to raise taxes in any way that
would harm small business owners or individuals who are not super
rich,\" John LaBombard, Sinema\'s former communications director, told
Insider. \"[Senator Sinema is not somebody to announce as a position
without thinking it through or has one position one day and a different
position the next]{.underline}.\"

The Arizona Democrat was tight-lipped throughout talks that dragged on
for much of last year, often spurning questions about her positions from
Capitol Hill reporters. She preferred negotiating directly with Biden
and senior White House officials on the size and scope of their economic
spending plan.

At one point, Sinema nearly stormed out of an Oval Office meeting after
the president spilled to other Democrats the maximum amount she wanted
to spend on the economic package, as reported in the book \"This Will
Not Pass\" by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns.

[Sinema\'s approach vexed many of her Democratic colleagues and kept
them guessing on what she actually wanted]{.underline} in their social
spending and climate bill. Manchin later killed the House-approved
legislation in December.

#### Manchin is agreeing to a path forward!!

Sahil **Kapur**, **6-29**-2022, \"Senate Democrats see \'major
progress\' on Biden agenda bill, hope for July vote,\" NBC News,

WASHINGTON --- [Senate Democrats are **close to a deal** to lower
prescription drug costs as part of a larger party-line package to
advance a number of President Joe Biden\'s economic
priorities,]{.underline} three sources familiar with the negotiations
said.

[Democrats plan to submit a \"finalized agreement\"]{.underline} on
allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies to a
key Senate official \"in the coming days\" to see whether it complies
with the chamber\'s strict budget rules, one of the sources said.

The source, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations
between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe
Manchin, D-W.Va., [described the expected move as \"major progress\"
that shows Democratic leadership wants to \"move forward with a bill on
the floor as early as next month.\"]{.underline}

[There\'s no final deal]{.underline} on the broader bill, however, as
the other major parts of the \"reconciliation\" package --- energy and
climate policy provisions and tax changes to raise revenue --- are still
being negotiated between Schumer and Manchin. Unless an agreement can be
reached quickly, it would be difficult to pass the bill before a
scheduled monthlong August recess.

**[Manchin's office said Wednesday there is consensus and a path forward
on drug pricing.]{.underline}**

"Senator [Manchin]{.underline} has long advocated for proposals that
would lower prescription drug costs for seniors, and his support for
this proposal has never been in question," Manchin spokeswoman Sam
Runyon said. "He's [glad that all 50 Democrats agree]{.underline}."

What\'s in the drug pricing deal?

According to a summary of provisions obtained by NBC News, the emerging
deal would empower Medicare to directly negotiate prescription drug
prices starting next year to lower costs for consumers. It would cap
out-of-pocket costs for Medicare patients at \$2,000 per year and allow
the cap to be broken up into monthly payments. It also would impose a
new \"inflation rebate\" policy forcing drug companies to send money
back to consumers if they raise prices above inflation.

In addition, the deal would add new incentives for drugmakers and
insurers to limit drug price hikes, provide free vaccines for seniors,
enhance premium and copay assistance for lower-income people and ensure
the Department of Health and Human Services always negotiates for the
maximum number of eligible drugs. And it would require negotiations to
lower prices \"if a drug company continues to block generic
competition,\" the summary said.

[Manchin]{.underline} rejected the House-passed Build Back Better Act in
December but later [indicated openness to a slimmed-down version that
includes drug savings, climate and energy policy and higher taxes on
upper earners and corporations.]{.underline} The Senate has not taken
any action since then.

### at- nato obsolete

#### NATO is needed as much now as during the cold war

Andreas **Kluth**, **6-30**-2022, \"Rumors of NATO's Brain Death Were
Greatly Exaggerated,\" Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-06-30/nato-turkey-s-nod-to-finland-and-sweden-create-a-baltic-lake-to-buttress-east,
accessed 7-3-2022//cpd

Far from comatose, **[NATO is today more vital and vigorous than it's
been since the height of the Cold War.]{.underline}** [It remains the
greatest guarantor of security in the West and the entire free world. It
is without doubt **the most successful alliance in
history.**]{.underline}

[When Macron was speaking]{.underline} off the cuff [in
2019]{.underline} --- a time so recent in years and yet so distant in
events --- [the allies had a lot to worry about.]{.underline} One
concern was a US president, Donald Trump, who disdained America's
partners and cast doubt on NATO's theretofore sacrosanct mutual-defense
clause, and thereby its power to deter aggression.

Another worry was NATO's mission drift. The original threat --- from the
Soviet Union between 1949 and 1991, Russia thereafter --- appeared to
wane. China and climate change weren't on the official list of
adversaries yet. The case for "out of area" operations --- from the
Balkans to the Horn of Africa --- had often been flimsy.

[The credit for]{.underline} curing [this]{.underline} identity crisis
[belongs,]{.underline} of course, [to]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin. By becoming exactly the kind of threat NATO was founded
to defend against,]{.underline} he proved his erstwhile appeasers wrong
and the Cassandras right. [Putin's attack on Ukraine this year has been
so brutal, irrational and inhumane that all allies have remembered
NATO's raison d'etre: deterrence of Russia]{.underline}, and --- if it
comes to that --- defensive war against it.

The immediate outcome of the Madrid summit will therefore be the
refortification of NATO's entire eastern front facing Russia and its
accomplice, Belarus. [Its members will also increase their military
spending. That includes, at long last, Germany.]{.underline}

Above all, [the alliance will expand, by adding two militarily strong
and geographically strategic members: Finland and Sweden.]{.underline}
Both countries long prided themselves on their neutrality, but now want
the safety of NATO's Article 5 --- an attack on one is an attack on all.
[In return, they can help turn the Baltic Sea into a NATO lake, the
better to defend the most exposed allies --- Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.]{.underline}

[Putin Wanted Less NATO; He'll Get More of It]{.underline}

**[The alliance would have more control of the Baltic Sea once Sweden
and Finland join]{.underline}**

The backstory to this Scandinavian enlargement highlights another
difference between 2019 and 2022. [It is that NATO once again, as during
the Cold War, benefits from American leadership.]{.underline}

Recep Tayyip [Erdogan, the president of Turkey, had been blocking the
accession of Finland and Sweden, accusing both of coddling Kurdish
groups he considers terrorists]{.underline}. In exhausting negotiations
between the three countries, **[Turkey has now extracted enough
concessions from the Nordics for Erdogan to drop his
veto.]{.underline}** Sweden and Finland will apparently clamp down on
Kurdish organizations, but without sacrificing the rule of law in
individual cases.

The decisive nudge appears to have come from US President Joe
[Biden]{.underline}, who [gave his Turkish counterpart a good talking
to. Biden is loath to reward autocrats]{.underline} --- and that's what
Erdogan is nowadays --- [with one-on-one time]{.underline}. But this
week Biden reminded Erdogan of the bigger geostrategic picture, while
publicly keeping his role deliberately below the radar. This is the
opposite of the approach taken by Trump, who relished causing discord at
maximum volume.

The allies won't be able to resolve all vexing questions this week. It's
far from clear how they should deal with China, a potential adversary in
the future, or climate change, the meta-problem that will cause
countless conflicts to come. Nor is it obvious how exactly NATO and the
European Union, which is also trying to strengthen its internal military
cooperation, should overlap. Above all, [NATO must --- in secrecy ---
war-game the worst scenario: What if Putin uses nuclear
weapons?]{.underline}

That said, [the alliance deserves accolades.]{.underline} **[It is
containing the kind of aggressor it was built for]{.underline}**, and
thereby [keeping its allies as safe as they can be.]{.underline} Jens
Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary general, said it best. Putin wanted less
NATO; instead, he's getting more of it. Good.
