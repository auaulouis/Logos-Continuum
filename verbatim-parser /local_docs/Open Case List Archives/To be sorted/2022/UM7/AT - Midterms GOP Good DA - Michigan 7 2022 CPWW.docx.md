### Dems take Senate Now

#### Non unique - Democrats take the Senate now -- key swing states go Democrat

**Enten 7-5** (Harry Enten, Senior Data Reporter at CNN, Former Senior
Political Writer at FiveThirtyEight, "Here\'s why Democrats could keep
the Senate", CNN, 7/5/22,

[Don\'t write off]{.underline} the [Senate Democrats]{.underline} just
yet Perhaps, the biggest polling shock this past week came from the
state of Georgia. A Quinnipiac University poll found Democratic Sen.
Raphael Warnock with a 10-point lead over Republican Herschel Walker,
54% to 44%. The result was far better for Warnock than the long-term
average for the race (which has either candidate up by a point or two,
depending on how the average is calculated). But even the average
indicates that [Warnock could win, despite Biden\'s approval rating
being well below 40% in the Peach State.]{.underline} The Georgia race
is among [several]{.underline} in 2020 [battleground states]{.underline}
that the national environment suggests **[should be leaning Republicans
but polling on the ground suggests otherwise]{.underline}**. It\'s an
indication that the outcome for Senate control isn\'t close to being
finalized. The 2022 Senate map is rather small. Of the 35 seats up this
cycle, I would categorize less than 10 of them at this point as
competitive \-- i.e., where each side has a better than 10% chance of
winning. A few races could make the difference either way. I base that
assessment off a simple data model that looks at state-level polling,
national indicators (i.e., the generic congressional ballot and the
President\'s approval rating), the past presidential vote, whether the
election was a midterm or not, and expert race ratings (by, say, the
Cook Political Report). All told, the model indicates that the most
likely outcome is for Republicans to pick up a seat or two. That\'s
enough for a majority, as the GOP needs a net gain of just a seat for
control. Considering past errors of the model, it suggests that
Republicans have a roughly 3-in-5 shot at winning back the Senate. The
reason the model is so high on Senate Democrats compared with what you
might expect given the national environment is simple: the state-level
polling in swing states. [Recent public data has looked surprisingly
strong for Democrats in]{.underline} places such as [Arizona, Georgia,
Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.]{.underline}

#### Non UQ - Supreme court deicisons have caused leftist backlash

[Recent [unfavorable news for Democrats,]{.mark} in the form of [Supreme
Court
rulings](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/21/us/major-supreme-court-cases-2022.html),
and some tragic news nationally might [ordinarily mean trouble]{.mark}
for the party in power[, but that's not what]{.mark} the [results
suggest.]{.mark}]{.underline} The survey began 11 days after the Supreme
Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, when cellphones were still
buzzing with news alerts about the mass shooting in Highland Park, Ill.
In an open-ended question, those who volunteered that issues related to
guns, abortion or the Supreme Court were the most important problem
facing the country represented about one in six registered voters
combined. Those voters preferred Democratic control of Congress, 68
percent to 8 percent. Some of the hot-button social issues thought to
work to the advantage of Republicans at the beginning of the cycle, like
critical race theory, have faded from the spotlight. Only 4 percent of
voters combined said education, crime or immigration was the most
important issue facing the country. [The Times/Siena survey is not the
first to suggest that [the]{.mark} national [political environment has
improved for Democrats since]{.mark} the Supreme Court overturned
[Roe]{.mark}.]{.underline} On average, [[Democrats have gained]{.mark}
about [three points]{.mark} on the generic congressional ballot
[compared](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/maybe-dobbs-did-change-the-race-well-need-more-time-to-know-for-sure/)
with surveys taken beforehand.]{.underline} In the wake of the court's
ruling, the poll finds greater public support for legal abortion than
previous Times/Siena surveys. Sixty-five percent of registered voters
said abortion should be mostly or always legal, up from 60 percent of
registered voters in September 2020. The proportion of voters who
opposed the court's decision --- 61 percent --- was similar to the share
who said they supported Roe v. Wade two years ago. [Democrats are
maintaining [the loyalty of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a crucial sliver of
predominantly [liberal and]{.mark} highly [educated voters who
disapprove of]{.mark} Mr. [Biden]{.mark}'s performance **[but care more
about]{.mark} debates over [guns, democracy and]{.mark} the shrinking of
[abortion]{.mark} rights [than the]{.mark} state of the
[economy]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Non UQ - Subtle polling trends show Dems are gaining ground after roe, even if republicans are up now trends are in the right direction 

**Panetta 22 \[**Alexander Panetta, Washington correspondent for CBC
news ; "Will Abortion Upend American Politics? Here's what the early
polling tells us" ; DOA 7/14/22 ; Published by CBC news
<https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/abortion-american-politics-early-polls-1.6451553>**\]**

The latest Morning Consult poll, from May 6 to 9, found a sudden
tightening of the so-called enthusiasm gap after months of Republicans
expressing far greater eagerness to vote this year. [It showed that the
percentage of [Democrats describing themselves as]{.mark} \"extremely
[enthusiastic]{.mark}\" about voting this year [jumped eight]{.mark}
percentage [points from two weeks ago**. Younger voters are
key:**]{.mark} They\'re especially supportive of abortion access, and
their level of enthusiasm increased in the latest Morning Consult
poll.]{.underline} Last month, Republicans held a more daunting
advantage, with their voters 12 percentage points more likely to call
themselves extremely enthusiastic, compared with seven points now. [And
[respondents]{.mark} [across different surveys were]{.mark} also more
[likely to describe abortion as a top issue]{.mark} for them in
determining their vote this fall. \"[It could be a leading
indicator]{.mark} of something,\" said Kathy Frankovic, a representative
of the YouGov firm. \"There are some inklings [that things could be
changing]{.mark}]{.underline}. But we really need to wait.\" There are
such inklings in different polls. The Monmouth University Polling
Institute says abortion [has surged to the top tier of
issues](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_051222/)
voters find important, suddenly ranking alongside the economy and ahead
of other topics. The same pollster says
[opinion](https://twitter.com/emmakinery/status/1524407525415739395?s=21&t=qCsHr1fsKEvSH2XyaQJ44A)
of the Supreme Court has plunged. There are other data points telling a
similar, albeit subtle, story. YouGov finds abortion still ranking as
far less important than the economy, but it\'s climbed up the priority
list, particularly for Democrats --- going from the top priority of just
two per cent of Democratic voters to 10 per cent. \"That\'s \[a\] pretty
big shift,\" Frankovic said. That\'s why Easley offers three caveats to
his broader takeaway that the current numbers don\'t look promising for
Democrats. His first caveat is that sudden burst of passion. That\'s a
shift, with the wobbling economy and their party struggling to pass
signature promises through Congress. Of the looming abortion fight,
Easley said: \"It has revved up Democratic intensity a little bit.\" His
second caveat? [[Even a small shift in public opinion could make a
difference]{.mark} in one or two close Senate races, and that could
decide who controls that powerful chamberThen there\'s his third and
final caveat: that nothing has happened yet]{.underline}

### Thumper -- Trump

#### Trump will enter the race -- guarantees Dems win. 

**Drucker 6/19** (David, senior political correspondent for the
Washington Examiner, previously reported for CQ Roll Call and the Los
Angeles Daily News, "Trump 2024 launch before November midterm elections
could become a problem for GOP," Washington Examiner, 6/19/2022,
<https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/trump-2024-launch-november-midterm-problem-gop)->

[Top [Republicans are keeping a **wary eye** on]{.mark} Donald
[Trump]{.mark}, [worried]{.mark} t[he]{.mark} former president [might
announce a **2024 bid before Election Day**]{.mark} this year,
[distracting voters]{.mark} [from]{.mark} President Joe [Biden's]{.mark}
embattled [leadership]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [**galvanizing** Democratic
turnout]{.mark}.]{.underline} With [speculation rising that Trump could
declare for president before the midterm elections]{.underline} to box
out GOP competitors, some Republican strategists and party insiders are
anxious. They fret the move would transform a referendum on Biden poised
to generate a massive Republican electoral wave on Nov. 8 into a more
evenhanded debate between the president, reeling from skyrocketing
inflation and myriad crises, and his polarizing predecessor. [The fear
is not so much that Trump's direct injection into the midterm campaign
turns Biden into a popular president and makes 2022 a Democratic
year.]{.underline} Rather, Republicans are concerned the 45th
president's early candidacy would **[dilute]{.underline}** Republican
messaging focused on Biden and boost moribund Democratic enthusiasm,
shrinking the size of the red wave in a manner that tempers GOP gains in
the House and Senate. "[[Trump being front and center could affect GOP
gains in the House by **five seats**]{.mark} or so]{.underline}," said
Jeff Burton, a Republican strategist in Austin, Texas. "[[But it could
really affect the Senate, which could end up 50/50 again based on how
the seats are looking]{.underline}]{.mark}." "Anything, and I mean
anything, that takes the focus off the miserable job Joe Biden is doing
is bad for Republicans," added Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and co-host of Ruthless, a
podcast popular among conservatives. Earlier this month, NBC News
reported Trump was mulling whether to announce a 2024 bid this summer.
Traditionally, Democrats and Republicans planning to run for president
wait for the midterm elections to conclude before making overt moves to
build their operation, let alone launch a campaign. But the former
president's considerations of an early reveal are based at least in part
on a desire to preserve his advantage over multiple other Republicans
preparing to run. Despite Trump's popularity with grassroots
Republicans, he would face competition in the 2024 primary. Prominent
Republicans who are signaling Trump's entry into the contest would not
preclude them from running include his former running mate, former Vice
President Mike Pence; his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; and a
political ally, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) --- among others who are
traveling to key early primary states and taking steps to mount White
House bids. For Republican politicians and operatives fixated on the
election at hand, Trump running for president is not necessarily
concerning, versus when he announces. They want a clean shot at Biden
and Democrats in Congress so that they have the best opportunity to run
up the score and win governing majorities. The [[Democrats]{.mark} are
defending a five-seat House majority]{.underline}. [Their [Senate
advantage rests on]{.mark} Vice President Kamala [Harris's]{.mark}
**[tiebreaking vote]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "It would not be in the
president's best interest to launch his campaign that early --- and it
would definitely be a distraction \[in terms of\] the midterm
elections," one House Republican said, requesting anonymity to speak
critically of Trump. [Republicans are hoping the allure of taking credit
for a big Republican victory in the midterm elections will forestall an
early 2024 announcement]{.underline}. "If Trump is smart, he will get
that and declare victory for the largest possible win after it happens,"
said a Republican strategist advising several candidates on the 2022
ballot. "The problem is that all Republican candidates would suddenly
have to answer a new question --- and they'd all prefer to only be
talking about Joe Biden,\" this strategist added. \"We need an election
that's a pure plebiscite on Biden's job approval, an election in which
the conversation is about Biden and Biden alone." With Biden's job
approval ratings cratering at just under 40% and Republicans leading
Democrats on the generic ballot 46.4% to 43%, [[Republicans are
positioned for **significant gains** this fall in Congress]{.mark} and
contests for office at the state and local levels]{.underline}.

### Thumper -- Inflation

#### Inflation thumps -- Foreign policy is nowhere near top issues for voters, even in "Democratic Favorable" agenda

**Fingerhut 7-8** (Hannah Fingerhut, Senior writer at the Associate
Press, editor at PBS, "Inflation, personal expenses rise sharply as
election priorities, poll suggests", PBS, 7/8/22,

-- aagg

[Concerns about inflation and personal finances have surged]{.underline}
while COVID has evaporated as a top issue for Americans, a new poll
shows, marking an upheaval in priorities just months before critical
midterm elections. [Forty percent of U.S. adults specifically name
inflation in an open-ended question as one of up to five priorities for
the government to work on in the next year,]{.underline} according to a
June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs
Research. That's a [sharp rise from 14 percent in December]{.underline}
and less than 1 percent the year prior. In all, 77 percent mention the
economy in any way, up from 68 percent in December. But just 10 percent
specifically mention jobs or unemployment, as U.S. employers continue to
hire despite high inflation and weak economic growth. Now, too,
Americans increasingly call their personal finances a major issue: 44
percent mention it, up from 24 percent in December and 12 percent the
year before. That includes more mentioning gas or energy prices (33
percent now vs. 10 percent in December) and food costs (9 percent vs.
less than 1 percent). Those [shifts may be advantageous to Republicans
as they campaign to win control of Congress]{.underline} in this year's
midterms; the [economy has increasingly been a sore subject for
President Joe Biden]{.underline}. Still, the economy isn't the only
issue getting more attention this year. [Many also
prioritize]{.underline} issues that are core to Biden and Democrats'
agenda, including [abortion, women's rights and gun policy]{.underline},
which could help Democrats as they try to pad --- or at least protect
--- their razor-thin majority.

WASHINGTON --- Triple-digit gasoline bills. Bulging hamburger prices. A
Fourth of July holiday that broke the bank. [**Prices are rising** at
the fastest rate in four decades, a painful development that has **given
Republicans a powerful** talking point just months **ahead of the
midterm election**s.]{.underline} With control of Congress very much in
play, Republicans are investing heavily in a blitz of campaign
advertisements that portray a dark sense of economic disarray as they
seek to make inflation a political albatross for President Biden and
Democrats. According to Kantar's Campaign Media Analysis Group,
candidates running in House, Senate and governor races around the
country have spent nearly \$22 million airing about 130,000 local and
national television ads that mention inflation from early April through
the beginning of July. Inflation was the 10th most common issue
mentioned by Democrats and 11th most common for Republicans, according
to the data, underscoring how critical the issue is to both parties this
election cycle. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story The data
released Wednesday showing that prices in June climbed 9.1 percent over
the past year gave Republicans fresh ammunition against Mr. Biden and
his party, ammunition that includes faulting Democrats for passing a
\$1.9 trillion stimulus package last year and efforts to push through
additional spending in a sweeping climate and economic package known as
"Build Back Better." [The **intensifying focus on inflation is already
weighing on Mr. Biden's poll number**s]{.underline}. A New York
Times/Siena College poll this week showed his approval at a meager 33
percent, with 20 percent of voters viewing jobs and the economy as the
most important problem facing the country. Inflation and the cost of
living followed closely behind. The poll also showed that the race for
control of Congress is surprisingly tight. While gas prices have fallen
from their \$5 a gallon peak and there are signs that inflation might be
slowing, consumers are unlikely to feel better off anytime soon. Gas
prices are still much higher than they were a year ago, with the average
national price for a gallon at \$4.60 versus \$3.15 in 2021, according
to AAA. Image Voters view jobs and the economy as among the most

the Democrats,]{.underline}" said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard
University and former Obama administration economic adviser. "My guess
is that [**the negative views about inflation are so deeply baked in
that nothing can change in the next few months to change
them**."]{.underline} The White House, while acknowledging the pain that
inflation is causing, has tried to deflect responsibility, saying that
it is a global problem and attributing it to shortages of food and oil
stemming from Russian President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Mr. Biden called the latest Consumer Price Index
"out-of-date" given the recent fall in gas prices and said the data "is
a reminder that all major economies are battling this Covid-related
challenge, made worse by Putin's unconscionable aggression." 8 Signs

the Commerce Department showed that retail sales fell 0.3 percent in

sentiment hit its lowest level in its 70-year history, with nearly half

of new homes is slowing. These trends could continue as interest rates

about the global economy --- because of its widespread use in buildings,

January, hitting a 17-month low on July 1. Oil. Crude prices are up this
year, in part because of supply constraints resulting from Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, but they have recently started to waver as
investors worry about growth. The bond market. Long-term interest rates
in government bonds have fallen below short-term rates, an unusual
occurrence that traders call a yield-curve inversion. It suggests that
bond investors are expecting an economic slowdown. However, Treasury
Secretary Janet L. Yellen has acknowledged that the pandemic aid package
contributed to inflation by spurring demand in the economy. Last month,
she admitted that she was "wrong" to describe price increases as
"transitory." [**Republicans have latched** **on to that as proof that**
Democrats and **the Biden administration misled voters** **and**

labor market and other signs of economic health --- **[that the nation

Nation, a nonprofit group aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, links rising prices to the \$1.9 trillion

Mike DeWine, a Republican. The TV ad opens with a pointed critique of
the president's handling of the economy: "Joe Biden's inflation is
crushing Americans." The National Republican Congressional Committee
highlighted the soaring sticker prices of hamburgers, buns, propane and
gasoline in an ad assailing Representative Dina Titus, a Nevada
Democrat, who is running against Mark Robertson, a Republican who is an
Army veteran and a business owner. "[Democrats' harmful economic
policies are making everything more expensive, and there's no end in

WASHINGTON --- [Republicans are torn between their policy
goals]{.underline} and political ones [in the wake of the Supreme
Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, [with activists'
rush to capitalize]{.underline} on the ruling [running into the
political reality that abortion rights remain popular]{.underline} in
many of this year\'s midterm battlegrounds. "I don't think this alters
the midterm advantage for Republicans because of Biden's economic woes,"
said former Virginia Republican Rep. Tom Davis. "But [**in a cycle that
is all about turnout, it is a net benefit for Democrats. Angry voters
vote**."]{.underline} For months, all signs have been pointing to a
landslide victory in November for Republicans. But [some in the
GOP]{.underline} now [worry that]{.underline} even [if they retake the
House]{.underline} and make overall gains, **[abortion politics could

of Americans saying they want Democrats in control of Congress has risen
in polls taken since the decision. "With inflation as high as it is, for
the first time I think it's a jump ball. The Democrats are now back in
it." "If I were a betting man," Madrid added. "I would say Republicans
pick up a majority, but maybe it's not as big as it could or should be."

[The Supreme Court's **decision to overturn Roe v. Wade** catapulted the
issue of abortion rights directly into the midterms campaign on Friday,
with **Democrats seeking to put the issue front and
center**.]{.underline} Democratic candidates up and down the ballot
issued their reactions in a slew of statements following the decision,
while the party's national campaign apparatus rolled out a website
designed to "help voters channel anger into action and organize with
local coordinated field campaigns." [While issues like rising inflation,
crime and the flow of migrants over the U.S. southern border have
dominated campaign rhetoric on the GOP side, **Democrats are hoping to
use the high court's decision to galvanize their own
bases.**]{.underline} "This fall, Roe is on the ballot. The right to
privacy is on the ballot," President Biden said at a press conference
following the decision's release on Friday. Democrats and abortion
rights advocates point to what they say is conservatives' goal to ban
abortion nationwide. "They won't give up unless voters stop them. The
stakes in November's midterm elections are higher than ever for
reproductive health and rights, including abortion," Planned Parenthood
said in a statement on Friday. [In swing states and districts across the
country**, Democratic candidates** rolled out their own statements
hitting **their Republican opponents over the issue**.]{.underline} In
Wisconsin, Senate candidate and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes (D) called for
the filibuster to be abolished so Roe could be "the law of the land."
Fellow Wisconsin Democratic Senate candidate Alex Lasry also called for
the filibuster to be abolished, accusing Republicans of "embracing
extremism." In Pennsylvania, Democratic Senate nominee and Lt. Gov. John
Fetterman (D) drew a clear contrast with his Republican opponent Mehmet
Oz on the issue. "I will protect abortion rights. Dr. Oz will take them
away. It's that simple," Fetterman said. In Texas, which has an abortion
trigger law that will go into effect within the next month, Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke released a video calling for
voters to support his campaign amid news of the ruling. "We have to
focus on the way in which we are going to overcome this," O'Rourke said.
"The only way to do this is to win political power." At the House level,
[Democratic candidates]{.underline} and incumbents also issued reactions
leaning into the issue. Incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.), who is
facing a contentious election bid in the commonwealth's 2nd
Congressional District, condemned the decision along with Gov. Glenn
Youngkin's (R) [announcement that he will seek a 15-week abortion ban
following the decision.]{.underline} "And there it is," Luria tweeted.
"Republicans in Virginia have a plan to remove existing protections for
women to make decisions about their body." In Texas's 15th Congressional
District, Democratic nominee Michelle Vallejo released a statement
calling for Roe v. Wade to be codified into law. ["**We need
representa**tives that will codify Roe V. Wade and **advocate every
single day for our right to choose**]{.underline}," Vallejo. "I will do
everything in my power as the next congresswoman from TX15 to be a
champion for Texas women and families." The issue is also poised to play
a role in competitive state legislature races, like in Michigan,
Arizona, Pennsylvania, Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.
"[**Republican** majorities in these state legislatures are in for a
**rude awakening** **when they start taking away people's
rights**]{.underline}," said Vicky Hausman, co-founder of Forward
Majority, a Democratic group that works elect Democrats to state
legislatures. "We see a great deal of outrage driven by this decision
and that outrage is happening exactly where Democrats need to be winning
in these key districts that present a path to a majority in state
legislatures," she continued. Former Vice President Mike Pence seemed to
confirm those concerns when he called for a nationwide abortion ban on
Friday. "Having been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest
and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center
of American law in every state in the land," Pence said in a tweet.
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel also rolled out
a statement exclaiming "Life wins!" "As this debate now returns to the
states and the American people, we know there is still much work ahead.
Republicans will continue to advocate for life, uphold the law, and
stand against an extreme Democrat Party's pro-abortion agenda," McDaniel
said. However, other [Republicans are signaling they intend to
stay]{.underline} laser-[focused on their messaging regarding inflation,
crime and the border.]{.underline} "Today's Supreme Court ruling returns
the issue of abortion to the states and allows voters to decide whether
they agree with Democrats' extreme support for taxpayer-funded late term
abortion," said Samantha Bullock, spokeswoman for the National
Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. "This ruling does nothing
to change the fact that voters' top concerns are rising prices, soaring
crime, and the disaster at the southern border," she continued.
Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano downplayed
the ruling, saying in a statement that Democrats want to use the Supreme
Court's decision on Roe to distract voters from issues that matter more
to them. "People in this area and in my part of the state across the
border here are struggling to make ends meet and they don't care about
those issues over there," Mastriano, who's up against Democrat Josh
Shapiro, said. "They want to have security. They want crime to be down.
They want to be able to put food on the table and gas in their cars."
[Democrats say]{.underline} they [are]{.underline} keenly [aware of the
role other issues, like inflation, are playing in campaign discourse,
but argue that abortion access is an economic and health care
issue]{.underline}. "We can walk and chew gum at the same time," said
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford (D), who also serves as co-chair of
the Democratic Attorneys General association. "This is an important
issue. It is not something that takes second seed to any of the other
issues and nor do other issues take second seed to this."
**Anti-abortio**n organizations are signaling they want to play a
**leading role in the midterms**. On Thursday, the conservative
anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America launched a \$2
million digital ad buy in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, North
Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin for two weeks. "This is
going to be hugely mobilizing for pro-life Americans, who have now seen
the fruition of their past political engagement, especially the last 10
years when we've focused heavily on Senate races and the White House to
give us this court," said Mallory Carroll, vice president of
communications at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. The Hill's Morning
Report --- Biden leaves Jan. 6 behind with high-stakes Middle East trip
The Memo: Jan. 6 panel looks to build on big Hutchinson moment "We're
talking to pro-life Americans, who don't always vote in non-presidential
election years, and people we've identified as being persuadable, so the
infamous women in the suburbs, Hispanic voters, Black voters \[and\]
traditional Democratic voting groups," she continued. But Democrats and
abortion rights groups are pouring in money as well. In April, the
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action
Fund announced a \$16 million paid media campaign "to educate and
increase urgency around the abortion access crisis facing the country."
"This is more than a Democratic issue," Ford said. "You have several
folks who are Republicans and Independents who support a right to an
abortion and who I think will be concerned about the fact that the
Supreme Court has now for the first time in our country removed a
constitutional right."

#### Roe v Wade is a winning point for Dems but no momentum for GOP voters

Multiple polls conducted since the Supreme Court\'s ruling overturning
Roe v. Wade find that **[broad majorities of the public
disapprove]{.underline}** and suggest that in the immediate aftermath
[**of the ruling**, the decision could be more motivational for
Democrats than Republicans.]{.underline} In a new [Monmouth University
survey]{.underline} released on Tuesday[, 60% of US adults disapprove of
the Supreme Court\'s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, with
just 37% approving. There\'s also a significant intensity gap: [53% of
Americans strongly disapprove of the ruling, including 84% of Democrats,
compared with 29% who strongly approve, including 58% of
Republicans.]{.underline} That\'s similar to the finding of two other
polls conducted after the ruling: an [NPR/PBS]{.underline}
NewsHour/Marist [survey (56% of US adults oppose the court\'s decision,
40% support it) and a CBS]{.underline} News/YouGov [survey (59% of US
adults disapprove, 41% approve).]{.underline} In the CBS/YouGov survey,
[52%]{.underline} overall [call the decision a step backward for
America]{.underline}, compared with 31% who see it as a step forward. In
that poll, [51% also say it will make the lives]{.underline} of most
American [women worse]{.underline}, compared with 18% who say it will
make their lives better. [Democrats are more apt to call it a step
backward (77%) than Republicans are to say it\'s a step forward
(64%)]{.underline}, and [while three-quarters of Democrats say it will
make life for American women worse (76%), only 33% of Republicans see
the ruling as making life better for American women.]{.underline} Just
shy of half of US adults, 46%, say it would bother them a lot if
abortion were banned in certain states, according to the Monmouth poll,
with Democrats 60 percentage points more likely than Republicans to say
they would be bothered a lot, 78% vs. 18%. [An 85% majority overall say
that]{.underline} any such [state bans should include exceptions in
cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at
risk]{.underline}; 72% say it would bother them a lot of state abortion
bans did not include such exceptions. It\'s still too early to draw
strong conclusions about what effect the decision might have on the
outcome of the midterm elections. Future polling will show whether the
ruling leads to significant and lasting changes either on which party
voters prefer, or on which side\'s voters are more likely to turn out.
Most Democrats in the CBS/YouGov poll report that the decision left them
feeling upset (78%) and angry (72%), while a somewhat smaller majority
of Republicans describe themselves as happy (60%). Half (50%) of
Democrats said in the CBS/YouGov poll that the decision makes them more
likely to vote in the midterms, compared with just 20% of Republicans
who said the same. While this question does not provide an accurate
gauge of actual shifts in voters\' intention to turn out, it suggests
that Democrats are currently more likely than Republicans to consider
the Supreme Court\'s decision a good reason for voting later this year.

**well positioned** to maintain his seat in November\'s

Senator Kelly Loeffler in a special runoff election, helping Democrats
flip the Senate blue. As the legislative chamber remains evenly split,
with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the power to cast tie-breaking
votes, Warnock losing his seat in November without Democrats
simultaneously picking up another would shift control of the Senate back
to the Republicans. [New polling carried out by AARP from July 5 to 11
showed Warnock **ahead** with independent voters in Georgia as well as
with the state\'s electorate overall. In the survey, Warnock had the
support of 48 percent of independent voters, compared with 45 percent
who said they\'d back Walker, a former football star who has been
endorsed by former President Donald Trump. That\'s **a 3-point lead**
for the incumbent Democrat among independents in Georgia]{.underline}.

by about 1.6 percent. The senator has the support of about 47.8 percent

[[Historically, the president's party loses votes in midterm
elections]{.underline}.]{.mark} For instance, in the 19 midterms between
1946 and 2018, the president's party gained in the share of the House
popular vote just once. The notable exception happened in 2002 when
Republicans won the popular vote by 4.6 points, 4.3 points higher than
four years earlier. But the context of that midterm election was highly
unusual: it was just one year after 9/11 and President George W. Bush
was still extraordinarily popular. [The results of the Virginia and New
Jersey gubernatorial elections last year and the current low approval
rating of President Biden may also suggest that a "red wave" is coming
in November]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark},]{.underline} it is not only
bad news for Democrats. In the 35 races for the Senate, [21 seats are
currently occupied by Republicans and only 14 by the Democratic Party.
Moreover, six Republican senators will not seek
re-election]{.underline}: Shelby (Alabama), Blunt (Missouri), Burr
(North Carolina), Portman (Ohio), Inhofe (Oklahoma), and Toomey
(Pennsylvania); while only one Democrat, Patrick Leahy (Vermont)
retired. In total, [[15 Republicans and 13 Democrats are running for
re-election.]{.underline}]{.mark} Crucially, in contrast to 2018, when
Democrats were defending 10 seats in states that Donald Trump won in
2016, Democrats are holding no seats in any state that was won by Trump
in 2020. Meanwhile, [[Republicans are defending two seats (Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin) in states that Biden won in 2020,]{.mark}]{.underline}
compared to just one seat (Nevada won by Hillary Clinton in 2016) that
was up for election in the 2018 cycle. Primary elections with no current
senators running are ongoing; however[, the real "battle" for the Senate
majority seems to be concentrated in five key states: Arizona, Georgia,
Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.]{.underline} Republicans are
targeting the first three states, where incumbent Democrats are fighting
for a difficult re-election; the [Democratic Party has a significant
chance of winning the last two, where the GOP will try to keep its seats
in states where Biden narrowly prevailed in 2020.]{.underline} [[For the
House election, the picture is still quite blurred]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Many primaries are still to be held and at least 49 representatives (as
of 25 May 2022) have announced that they will be retiring (31 Democrats,
18 Republicans). [[One]{.mark} additional [complication is]{.mark} that
since these [elections will be the first conducted after the
post]{.mark}-2020 [census redistricting,]{.mark} several [districts may
lack an incumbent or]{.mark} might even [have multiple]{.mark}
incumbents.]{.underline} The general prediction is that [[Republicans
have]{.mark} a high [chance of taking control]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the House after six years of Democratic majorities. [[However]{.mark},
in current politics,]{.underline} six [[months are an eternity:
inflation,]{.mark} war in [Ukraine and the]{.mark} COVID-19 [pandemic
may be]{.mark} very [different from what they are
now]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Biden's approval ratings are already
providing signs of revival. After reaching a record-low 41% of positive
views in February, three months later the RealClearPolitics average
favorability rating positions him three points up, with a general
impression that his [administration's reaction to the Russian invasion
is starting to pay off in terms of popularity.]{.underline}

Given how monolithic partisans are in their approval ratings and actual
voting, it is always useful to look only at independents, the 'jump
ball' Americans. Biden's overall rating among them was 35 percent (5
points below his approval among all adults). His best marks were on
dealing with the coronavirus (45 percent approval), followed by foreign
policy (37 percent), Russia (35 percent), and the economy (30 percent).

Republicans actually score a net gain in the Senate while getting hosed
(a political science term) in the House. Right now, Democrats are the
party suffering from a lack of motivation among their base. If someone
wanting a read on a midterm is only going to watch two things, it should
be a president's approval rating and the generic congressional ballot

#### Voters value domestic issues over NATO, no link, and domestic issues deck fo po solvency. 

**Stokols 5/30**/22 (Eli Stokols is a White House reporter based in the
Los Angeles Times' Washington, D.C., bureau. Published 5/30/22,,

NSH

President Biden's five days of meetings in Europe and the bold actions
undertaken by the U.S. and its Group of 7 and NATO allies reflect an
abrupt sea change in the West's approach to its own defense in response
to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The conclusion of a historic summit
here saw members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [ratify a new
strategic
concept](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-29/nato-summit-biden-commits-more-us-forces-europe) that
will maintain a stronger military presence in Eastern Europe and the
formal invitation of Finland and Sweden to join the alliance. That came
on the heels of a G-7 summit in the Bavarian Alps where
leaders [committed billions more to Ukraine's
defense](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-27/implored-by-zelensky-biden-and-g-7-allies-will-increase-ukraine-defense-aid-economic-support) and
agreed to work toward imposing price caps on Russian oil to further
stymie the country's ability to fund its war. "This summit was about
strengthening our alliance, meeting the challenges of the world as it is
today," Biden said Thursday during a news conference, adding that "the
world is changing. And NATO is changing as well. Allies across the board
are stepping up, increasing defense spending." "The United States," he
added, "is rallying the world to stand with Ukraine." But the president,
resolute in defense of global democracy, has been slower to respond to
changes tearing at the democratic fabric of his own country, some say.
His summit meetings were overshadowed by the [Supreme Court ruling
striking down Roe vs.
Wade](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-24/supreme-court-overturns-roe-vs-wade-frees-states-to-outlaw-abortion) and
a blockbuster congressional hearing at which a [former aide to President
Trump
testified](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-28/jan-6-hearing-day-6) about
how Trump's behavior on Jan. 6, 2021, contributed to the violent
insurrection at the Capitol. [[Biden's conviction in Bavaria and Madrid
is not likely to improve his low standing with voters fixated on
pocketbook issues.]{.mark} But it did offer a sharp contrast with what
critics see as his hesitation in seeking to shore up democratic
institutions in the United States.]{.underline} "We talk about democracy
being in crisis in other countries. [Democracy is in crisis in the
United States, and it doesn't always feel like this White House
understands that,"]{.underline} said Amanda Litman, the founder of Run
for Something, a progressive organization that helps young people run
for elected office. [At Biden']{.underline}s NATO [news
conference]{.underline}, his final event before returning to Washington,
[the questions he received focused as much on domestic issues as the
foreign policy moves he and allies made]{.underline} this week. [Asked
about
a [poll](https://apnews.com/article/inflation-russia-ukraine-biden-covid-health-b6d1751b2554555f7246f9e914b87c59) showing
[85% of Americans believ]{.mark}ing [that the country is on the "wrong
track,"]{.mark} he was defiant, attributing their frustrations over
inflation to Russia's war in Ukraine and the Supreme Court.]{.underline}
"America is better positioned to lead the world than it ever has been,"
he said. "The one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous
behavior of the Supreme Court." Again urging Americans to channel their
frustrations into voting in November's midterm elections, Biden renewed
his call for Congress to codify abortion protections into federal law,
saying for the first time that he supports an exception to the Senate's
60-vote filibuster rule so that legislation can advance with just 50
votes to preserve women's reproductive rights. "If the filibuster gets
in the way, like on voting rights, it should be provided an exception
for this action," he said. That position could help soften some of the
rising frustration toward Biden on the left in the wake of the court's
Roe decision. But Democrats don't appear to have the 50 votes needed to
change the filibuster requirement and pass federal abortion protections.
Although he [forcefully denounced the
ruling](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-24/watch-live-biden-speaks-on-supreme-courts-roe-vs-wade-decision) as
a "tragic error," his administration has been clearer spelling out what
the president won't do, ruling out a proposal to situate abortion
clinics on federal land and the possibility of adding justices to a
Supreme Court dominated by conservatives, three of whom were appointed
by his predecessor. Many prominent Democrats, including Massachusetts
Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York,
have expressed disappointment that Biden hasn't seemed to share their
outrage or sense of urgency in helping women in peril. Asked Thursday
whether he would call a public health emergency as Warren and others
have called for, Biden demurred, saying only that he plans to meet
Friday at the White House with a group of governors to discuss actions
at the state level. When a reporter questioned whether he was the best
messenger to lead his party's response following the Roe ruling, Biden
offered a somewhat glib response. "I'm the president of the United
States of America," he said with a grin. "That makes me the best
messenger." By comparison, Biden's commitment to defending Ukraine "as
long as it takes" was articulated more forcefully, even as he
acknowledged the effects on American consumers and the global economy.
Asked how long Americans should tolerate paying more for gas as a result
of the war in Ukraine, he was blunt, repeating himself: "As long as it
takes so Russia cannot in fact defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine,"
he said. "This is a critical, critical position for the world."
Republicans, a few of whom attended the summit and met with Biden before
he left Madrid, have largely supported the president's response to
Ukraine. Nevertheless, [[many have]{.mark} also [blamed him for rising
gas prices and the inflation that's been exacerbated by the
war.]{.mark}]{.underline} "There's more of a bipartisan spirit when it
comes to NATO than any of Biden's domestic challenges," said Ash Jain,
an expert on democracies at the Atlantic Council. The juxtaposition
between how Biden carries himself abroad alongside like-minded allies
and at home is evidence that the president faces more constraints and
political challenges within the American political system.
["[It's]{.mark} just [a much harder environment to operate in and the
solutions are much more complicated,]{.mark}" Jain said.]{.underline}
Despite the seriousness of the commitments outlined this week by G-7 and
NATO allies, Biden's political weakness at home --- and that of other
G-7 leaders, who've seen their own support and governing coalitions
wobble in recent weeks --- could work to Russian President Vladimir
Putin's benefit over time, as the autocrat seeks to outlast the West on
the battlefield. NATO allies continue to express concern about America's
political instability. They worry about making commitments to Biden that
might be cast aside should he lose reelection in 2024. "The other
leaders want to know what is he is going to do about a Supreme Court
stripping away people's rights, about these efforts by Trump and others
to attack American institutions," said Brett Bruen, a former National
Security Council official in the Obama administration. "[He has not had
a great plan, and if he doesn't, [the domestic quagmire can become a
major drag on what he's able to accomplish
internationally."]{.mark}]{.underline} Presidents have more latitude to
act in foreign affairs than on domestic matters, where they are more
constrained by Congress and the courts. But Biden's reluctance to
consider structural changes to the Constitution has been a source of
frustration among the base of his party long before the Supreme Court's
Roe decision. "Even if there are some very real structural barriers in
place, we need to see the White House and the president feel the same
rage and fury and frustration that we do," said Litman, the progressive
organizer. "We need to see that he sees the crisis and is unafraid to do
whatever it takes within his power because he's asking us to sacrifice
and organize." With Democrats narrowly controlling the evenly divided
Senate thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' ability to break a tie
vote, Biden nevertheless has seen much of his legislative agenda
derailed. Until Thursday, he had been reluctant to call on Democratic
leaders to change the filibuster rule requiring 60 votes to advance

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [There's [little support among Americans for]{.mark}
a major [U.S]{.mark}. role [in the Russia-Ukraine conflict]{.mark},
according to a new poll, even as President Joe Biden imposes new
sanctions and threatens a stronger response that could provoke
retaliation from Moscow.]{.underline} Biden has acknowledged a growing
likelihood that [war in Eastern Europe would affect
Americans]{.underline}, though he has ruled out sending troops to
Ukraine. [[Gas prices in the U.S. could rise in the short term]{.mark}.
And Russian President Vladimir Putin has a range of tools he could use
against the U.S., including cyberattacks hitting critical infrastructure
and industries.]{.underline} "[Defending freedom will have costs for us
as well, here at home]{.underline}," Biden said Tuesday. "We need to be
honest about that." Just [[26 percent say the U.S. should have a major
role in the conflict]{.underline},]{.mark} according to a new poll from
The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
**[[Fifty-two percent say a minor role]{.mark}; [20 percent say none at

fellow Democrats that while the crisis may consume Washington in the
coming months, [pocketbook issues are likely to be a bigger
priority]{.mark} for voters heading [in]{.mark}to [the midterm]{.mark}
elections.]{.underline} A December AP-NORC poll showed that [**Americans

inflation**.]{.underline} The Biden administration has argued that
supporting Ukraine is a defense of fundamental American values and has
made a concerted effort to declassify intelligence findings underscoring
the dangers it sees for Ukraine and the wider European region. [But the

### AT: Turnout

#### Turnout is a myth -- Democrat base turnout isn't enough for the win

**Teixeira 6-16** (Ruy Teixeira, Senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, Co-founder at the Liberal Patriot, "Turnout Myths Are
the Democrats\' Drug of Choice", theliberalpatriot, 6/16/22,
<https://theliberalpatriot.substack.com/p/turnout-myths-are-the-democrats-drug>,) -
aagg

There are, however, a number of reasons why this [turnout fix is highly
unlikely]{.underline} to work and, in fact, borders on the
delusional. 1. Some Simple Math. Start with this: [when Democrats
persuade a voter to switch sides]{.underline}, that nets two votes for
the Democrats (one less for the Republicans, one more for the
Democrats). When Democrats turn out one more voter to vote Democratic
that is, of course, a net of only one vote for them. But it's really
worse than that. Typically, Democrats think of increased base turnout in
terms of turning out more voters from various pro-Democratic demographic
groups---young voters, black voters, Hispanic voters, college-educated
whites, whatever. But not all the voters in these groups favor the
Democrats so [mobilization of more voters from a given group may well
net less than one vote per additional voter]{.underline}. For example,
looking at current Congressional ballot preferences, Democrats might net
only a third of a vote for every additional Hispanic or young voter,
six-tenths of a vote from every additional black voter and just a sixth
of a vote from every additional college-educated white voter. The math
looks even more unfavorable when the following is considered: [Democrats
tend to assume that nonvoters from a given demographic are the same
politically as voters from the same group....except they don't
vote.]{.underline} But a mountain of political science evidence shows
that's not so. Nonvoters, controlling for demographics, tend to be less
ideological and, very importantly, if they do vote tend to swing in the
direction of the prevailing political environment---which of course is
currently terrible for the Democrats and likely to be so on election
day. This means the "yield" for the Democrats from higher turnout could
be even less than the data above indicates. Finally, the general
assumption seems to be that an aggressively polarized election will
juice turnout among Democratic-leaning constituencies\....but (somehow)
not on the other side. That's not the way it works. The other side gets
to vote too so dialing it up to 11 on the Democratic positions may
mobilize the other side just as much---maybe more!---than the left's
side. Once again, the basic math on the turnout-driven strategy is much
less favorable than most Democrats assume. 2. The Empirical Record. The
[evidence for turnout patterns driving Democrats' electoral fate is
extremely thin]{.underline} as conclusively demonstrated in The Turnout
Myth: Voting Rates and Partisan Outcomes in American National Elections
by political scientists Daron Shaw and John Petrocik. Recent election
results bear this out. Take the [2020 election]{.underline}. That
election presented a very stark choice to voters. And it was indeed a
high turnout election. The problem: [everyone's turnout went
up]{.underline}, including among groups Democrats would have preferred
stayed home. The net result of higher turnout did not significantly
boost Democratic fortunes; if anything [Republicans may have a
benefitted a bit more from the higher levels of turnout.]{.underline}
This helps explain why Biden's 2020 victory was so much narrower than
anticipated and why the election saw Democrats lose ground in the House
and in state legislatures Closer to the present, look at the Virginia
2021 gubernatorial election. The highly-polarized election, where
Republican Glenn Youngkin beat Democrat Terry McAuliffe in a heavily
blue-trending state, was a very high turnout election. Under the state's
newly liberalized voting laws, the number of votes cast in this
governor's race was 25 percent higher than in any previous race. Turnout
was strong everywhere, including in important Democratic areas like
northern Virginia, black precincts and college towns, but also surged in
redder areas of the state. The real reason why McAuliffe lost was, above
all, vote-switching---in other words, persuasion. According to a
detailed vote history analysis by Civis Analytics, vote-switching from
2020 to 2021 accounted for about 80 percent of the shift away from the
Democrats in the gubernatorial election. Finally, cast your mind back to
the 2018 midterm election where the Democrats did so well. In that
election, the Democrats took back the House (a net 40-seat gain),
carried the House popular vote by almost nine points and flipped seven
Republican-held governorships. Turnout in that election was outstanding,
topping 49 percent --- the highest midterm turnout since 1914 and up 13
points over the previous midterm, in 2014 --- and the demographic
composition of the electorate came remarkably close to that of a
presidential election year. (Typically, midterm voters tend to be much
older and much whiter than those in presidential elections.) This was
due both to fewer presidential "drop-off" voters (people who voted in
2016 but not 2018) and to more midterm "surge" voters (those who voted
in 2018 but not 2016). Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the
Democrats' improved performance came not from fresh turnout of
left-of-center voters who typically skip midterms, but rather from
people who cast votes in both elections --- yet switched from Republican
in 2016 to Democratic in 2018. The data firm Catalist, whose numbers on
2018 are the best available, estimates that around 90 percent of the
Democrats' improved performance came from persuasion --- from
vote-switchers --- not turnout. In its analysis, Catalist notes, "If
turnout was the only factor, then Democrats would not have seen nearly
the gains that they ended up seeing ... a big piece of Democratic
victory was due to 2016 Trump voters turning around and voting for
Democrats in 2018." It is hard to avoid the conclusion that higher
turnout is not the Holy Grail for the Democrats, either in this coming
election or in future ones. Instead, it is time for them to recover the
lost art of persuasion. It may be too late in the current cycle for this
to be done or done enough to make a difference. But done it will have to
be if Democrats are serious about creating a durable majority that can
carry their agenda forward. As I have noted previously, [Democrats may
be better off accepting they will take their lumps in 2022]{.underline}
(while attempting to minimize the damage) but use the election as a
teachable moment. That teachable moment should be, above all, about
re-acquainting the party with the actually-existing demographics and
politics of the country they live in. Given patterns of [educational and
geographic polarization, they are now at a crippling disadvantage in
what remains an overwhelmingly working class and non-urban country.
There are simply too many districts and states in the country where
polarization redounds to their disadvantage and makes them
uncompetitive.]{.underline} That is [not a problem]{.underline} that can
be [solved by "mobilizing the base".]{.underline} It calls instead for
expanding your coalition by persuading more working class and non-urban
voters you share their values and priorities.

A month after 20,000 private emails from the Democratic National
Committee were published online, election officials across the country
received a series of warnings from the FBI: Hackers were targeting
states' election websites and, in at least one case, were able to steal
voter registration data. The Department of Homeland Security has since
created an election cybersecurity action campaign, and US intelligence
officials have begun investigating the possibility of a covert Russian
intelligence operation that seeks to undermine the integrity of the
American election. But [despite the growing concerns over foreign
meddling coming from Congress, intelligence experts, and the Clinton
campaign, state election officials say **American voters have little to
fear.**]{.underline} ["There are over 9,000 jurisdictions that operate
elections at a very local level, so that's both a blessing and a
curse,"]{.underline} Denise Merrill, Connecticut's secretary of state
and president of the National Association of Secretaries of State
(NASS), a nonpartisan organization that represents the country's top
state election officials, told BuzzFeed News. ["It really saves us from
worrying too much about cybersecurity --- we have other concerns, but
that's kind of not one of them."]{.underline} Merrill was appointed by
NASS to join Homeland Security's special working group on election
cybersecurity. The group's goal is to build closer ties between the
federal government and local election officials, and also to consider
designating state voting systems as "critical infrastructure," akin to
dams and power grids, granting election offices additional resources and
protections from the federal government. Merrill, along with the
secretaries of state and election officials representing California,
Florida, Ohio, Minnesota, Colorado, and Iowa, told BuzzFeed News that
[pre--Election Day simulations, paper trail audits, and the fact that
voting machines are not connected to the web provide strong safeguards
to the electoral system.]{.underline} State election officials
emphasized that [the recent hack into voter registration databases
differs from the risks faced by their offices, because these databases
aren't directly tied to voting on Election Day and because voting
machines cannot be accessed remotely through the internet.]{.underline}
"That's [the voter registration system]{.underline}, which [is not at
all connected to the actual voting]{.underline}," Merrill said, adding
[that in almost every state, voter registration is completed on paper.
"There are backup paper systems for every process in our election, and
that means cybersecurity is not the concern that it's being portrayed to
be nationally."]{.underline}

### Gridlock Bad

#### Political gridlock bad\-\-- affects infrastructure

Infrastructure talks are heating up again. In just the last week, 2020
presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar pitched a trillion-dollar
infrastructure proposal while the Trump administration and Congress
continue to flirt with major infrastructure packages. This kind of
thinking reflects clear public support for greater investment. While
these concepts and conversations suggest bipartisanship could deliver
infrastructure reform, the current state of national politics delivers
anything but an infrastructure boost. Put bluntly, [when political
discord leads to infrastructure failure, it doesn't just deepen our
distrust of government---it also takes our economy down with
it.]{.underline} After all, it was only months ago when [fights between
House Democrats and the Republican White House spilled over into our
airports.]{.underline} With public employees and contractors forced to
work without pay during the budget shutdown, it was little surprise that
TSA security officers and air traffic controllers started calling in
sick. Then, 35 days after the shutdown began, LaGuardia Airport closed
due to staffing shortages. The budget fight ended just hours later.
[While the budget fight may be over (for now), our political system is
regularly causing less perceptible but more sustained disruptions to our
road, water, and other physical networks]{.underline}. [We can no longer
afford this kind of unnecessary economic harm due to short-sighted
politics.]{.underline} This administration's trade and tariff policies
serve as a potent example of [self-inflicted economic harm]{.underline}.
Since the Trump administration applied tariffs on imported steel and
aluminum, the cost index for steel mill products alone rose by almost 14
percent from March 2018 to January 2019. This directly impacts our state
departments of transportation, their local peers, and water authorities
who all rely on steel and aluminum to construct major capital projects.
As Mark Niquette at Bloomberg reported, states from California to
Michigan to Virginia have already seen certain project costs jump by
millions of dollars. Meanwhile, steel and aluminum manufacturers in the
U.S. have been hit hard by the costs, needing to lay off workers to
close budget gaps. Price increases can act as a fiscal virus, infecting
an agency's entire project pipeline[. Since infrastructure agencies work
on tight budgets and are naturally capital-constrained, there's only so
much construction to go around.]{.underline} So, [when current projects
start costing significantly more, agencies have no choice but to delay
other projects]{.underline}. If the tariffs remain in future years---and
the politically-motivated rhetoric suggests the president will keep
them---[the effects will only compound as more projects are either
delayed or outright scrapped. The net result: lower quality
infrastructure than if the country never instituted the new
tariffs.]{.underline} Oddly enough, while the president pushes a trade
war to boost global competitiveness, our domestic infrastructure will be
less prepared to power our economy once the war is over. [Politics
disrupting our infrastructure stretches far beyond tariff
fights.]{.underline} For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation
has now twice delayed promised capital grants to local transit agencies.
Similarly, Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration cannot agree
on how to manage and comprehensively fund a new satellite-based air
traffic control system. They're all guaranteed ways to raise
infrastructure costs in the long-term and reduce public trust today.
That's why these next two- and four-year periods are so important at the
federal level. For the nearly two years remaining on President's Trump
term, there is a major negotiation coming with congressional Democrats
around our next surface transportation bill, if not a larger
infrastructure package. If the two parties can craft a bill that boosts
investment around long-run needs---from resilience to electrification to
digitalization---and reduce tariff impacts in the process, we'll all be
in a better place. Washington has the chance to give long-run certainty
to our state and local partners, who build all the projects and pay the
majority of costs, anyway. But [if political compromise doesn't
happen---and we have our doubts---the pressure will only be higher on
the next Congress and president to deliver a more collaborative,
bipartisan vision for the country's future]{.underline}. It's why we're
not just watching what happens on the Hill these next couple years, but
why we all should carefully watch the infrastructure and trade platforms
put together by the Democratic candidates for president. Of course,
everyday Americans use infrastructure systems that remind us what
political compromise can deliver. The national highway network is still
one of the world's great capital projects. The commercial air network is
the busiest and safest in the world. We've grown accustomed to clean
water access and are shocked when it fails. [But we have to remember how
easily our politics can upend high-functioning
infrastructure.]{.underline} As the budget fight grounded planes at one
of the busiest airports in our nation's biggest city, stacking up on the
runway, the image said it all. [Unnecessary gridlock eventually drags us
all down.]{.underline}

WE MUST ALL STRENGTHEN THE 'GOVERNING CENTER' [[In
business]{.underline}]{.mark}, building consensus is a fact of life. The
[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [large and small]{.underline},
that [ultimately [succeed]{.mark}]{.underline} are those [propelled [by
a can-do spirit and a relentless drive for
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the executives who lead them must
bridge divides and rally teams around shared goals every day in order to
boost productivity, support morale, serve customers, and drive growth.
These leaders welcome various viewpoints and vigorous exchanges of ideas
because it's often through the questioning and challenging that
breakthroughs are achieved and innovations are discovered. [[Gridlock is
not an option]{.mark} for business]{.underline}, [[and it shouldn't be
an option for]{.mark} the [elected officials]{.mark} who run our
government]{.underline}. Voters rightly expect results from the men and
women who represent them. And businesses---of all sectors and sizes
whose interests the U.S. Chamber represents---expect our leaders to work
through differences and make smart policy decisions that will allow them
to invest, hire, and grow[. [We need a Washington that
works]{.mark}]{.underline}, driven by men and women who work together[,
[to help rebuild our country]{.underline}]{.mark} [and ensure all its
citizens have equal opportunity [to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
today's polarized political environment, this is easier said than done.
For many, [compromise is a four-letter word and consensus is a
fantasy]{.underline}. But that does not have to be the case---and given
the sobering slate of challenges before us, it cannot be. We need a
Washington that works, driven by men and women who work together, to
help rebuild our country and ensure all its citizens have equal
opportunity to succeed. [[Challenges of the magnitude we
face]{.mark}---an economic crisis caused by the pandemic and a national
reckoning over systemic inequalities]{.underline}---should compel our
leaders to rise to the moment. They can reject the tribalism that has
fractured not only our political system but also our society. They can
lead with constructive discourse in pursuit of real solutions. That
requires listening to all viewpoints. Negotiating in good faith
acknowledges the skills, knowledge, and perspectives others bring to the
table---including those with whom you disagree. Shutting them out of the
conversation will not build the good will needed to achieve compromise.
[Our leaders also [must focus on achieving an outcome]{.mark}, not
getting credit (or assigning blame)]{.underline}. This is easier when
operating from the assumption that everyone fundamentally shares the
same goals of helping people and solving problems, even if ideas on how
to get there differ. When it comes to serving our country, our leaders
will succeed as a group, or fail as a group---regardless of party
affiliation. Inevitably, there will be issues where the gulf seems too
wide. That is why [we need a strong governing center]{.underline},
populated by lawmakers from both parties who have the courage to reach
across the aisle and build consensus. We know these leaders exist---and
they are crucial to restoring a well-functioning government. In order to
help grow the governing center, the Chamber recently revamped its
congressional scorecard for the first time in 40 years. Now [lawmakers
can earn the Chamber's support not only by voting for the business
position on key bills, but also by demonstrating bipartisanship and
legislative leadership.]{.underline} We were proud to recognize the 59
Democratic and Republican members of Congress who earned the highest
scores by these measures at our first annual Governing with Distinction
Awards earlier this year. We are committed to championing them and
growing their ranks. Such leaders have long been part of our legacy. As
President George W. Bush said in his moving eulogy for Rep. John Lewis,
"John and I had our disagreements, of course. But in the America John
Lewis fought for, and the America I believe in, differences of opinion
are inevitable elements and evidence of democracy in action."
[[Collegiality and cooperation---not just in politics, but across the
public discourse]{.mark}---[will be needed to confront]{.mark} the most
daunting set of challenges in decades: a global [pandemic]{.mark}, a
[devastated economy]{.mark}, and deep-seated [inequality of
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. These crises are intertwined, and [if

**[2. Competition]{.underline}** All of the developments in [the global
clean energy transition outlined above mean that sitting on top of
massive petroleum reserves **no longer translates** to **global power**
and **influence** like it used to.]{.underline} Clean energy, in many
ways, is a democratizing development in global energy industries, as
practically anyone with the infrastructure can produce their own energy
relatively cheaply. Of course, while generally true, this is a gross
oversimplification. [Even renewable energy and electric vehicles require
finite resources that certain countries have in spades and which others
do not.]{.underline} [This will likely be a **major geopolitical
factor** in the **energy landscape** of the future\--but it won't be in
the United States' favor.]{.underline} A clean energy resource war could
be brewing between the first and second biggest economies in the world.
[Renewables are currently reliant on lengthy supply chains for finite
**rare earth minerals** and metals including lithium and cobalt, and at
present **China** is **in control** of more than **90 percent** of some
of these **essential resources.**]{.underline} While China has been keen
to become energy independent and energy secure for a long time now,
renewables have emerged as the nation's clearest path to achieving that
goal, as well as to establishing Beijing as one of the major
energy-industry superpowers of the world, if not the outright global
leader. [While the United States will still be able to produce plenty of
its own energy through natural gas and its own clean energy
production]{.underline}, there is no doubt that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [overall **energy independence** and **exporting
power** will fade right along with the **shale revolution** as other
powers around the globe **expand their own energy production
capacity.**]{.underline}

#### Oil dependence doesn't cause war.

These findings indicate that [[oil wars]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
conventionally conceived, **[[do not exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Oil
is an extremely valuable natural resource. However, [**invasion**,
**occupation**, **international**, and **investment costs** reduce the
payoffs of seizing foreign resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Profiting]{.mark} from seized oil [is]{.mark} difficult at best and
**[impossible]{.mark}** at worst]{.underline}. As a result, [[petroleum
prizes]{.mark} [are **not**]{.mark} **sufficiently [valuable]{.mark}**
[for oil to be a]{.mark} significant [contributor to]{.mark} leaders'
decisions for international [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, a
territory's petroleum endowments are a poor predictor of its ability to
inspire interstate conflict. [[These observations have **positive
implications** for]{.mark} contemporary [disputes in]{.mark} oil-rich
regions like [the]{.mark} [S]{.mark}]{.underline}outh
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea,
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}ast [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea, [[eastern Med]{.mark}iterranean, [and
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as they suggest that [[competition]{.mark}
over these territories' oil resources [**will not** lead to]{.mark}
intense militarized [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, one might
counter this optimistic assessment by arguing that the contemporary
contests are not analogous to the historical cases. The greatest
difference between them is that, in the current disputes, political
authority is ambiguous; multiple countries have legitimate claims to
contested territories. Consequently, in these areas, [an aggressor would
not be seizing "foreign" oil]{.underline}. This distinction would reduce
occupation costs, as local resistance would be more restrained.140
Invasion costs would also be lower, since most of the resources at stake
in these contests are prospective; there is less oil infrastructure for
aggressors and targets to destroy.141 These arguments have some merit.
However, [**[prospective resources]{.mark}** also [generate
**higher**]{.mark} investment [costs, as countries must
**explore**]{.mark} for oil [instead of just producing
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The total [payoffs]{.mark} that an aggressor
can accrue from prospective resources [are]{.mark} also **[very
uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [[**international costs**
remain high]{.mark}, as the international community condemns the use of
force in all territorial disagreements, including those where political
authority is ambiguous]{.underline}. Hence, [[the costs]{.mark} of
aggression should still **[deter]{.mark}** contemporary [adversaries
from fighting for oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not to say that
current disputes in purportedly oil-rich regions will never escalate.
However, if they do, it will be for other, more pressing reasons. The
resultant conflicts will not be oil wars

### AT: Readiness

#### Readiness impact cards are lobbying tactics.

**Adams 18** Gordon Adams, professor of international relations at
American University\'s School of International Service and is a
distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center. \[The Military's
\'Readiness\' Scam Worked Again, 2-14-2018,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/15/the-militarys-readiness-scam-worked-again/\]

For the next two years, at least, [the American public should be
spared]{.underline} the U.S. [Defense]{.underline} Department['s
**wailing about "readiness."**]{.underline} After seven years of
teeth-gnashing and garment-rending, the [military is]{.underline}
finally [getting]{.underline} what it wants: [more money than
ever]{.underline}. The Donald Trump administration's defense budget
request for fiscal year 2019 is out, less than a week after Congress cut
an overall deal on spending levels for 2018 and 2019. Unlike the
domestic spending part of the administration's budget request, the
defense numbers aren't dead on arrival --- in fact, the military can
count on getting every cent. The [congressional deal set **new levels
for defense**]{.underline}, agreeing to \$700 billion for national
defense in 2018 and \$716 billion in 2019. That's nearly [\$165 billion
more than]{.underline} the military had [anticipated]{.underline} prior
to this year. The United States is back to defense spending, in constant
dollars, that is higher than the peak spending levels under Ronald
Reagan. Only in 2010, at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
was defense spending higher. It's worth thinking about why defense
spending is about to explode. It's not because of some revolutionary
change in the global security environment --- aside from those pesky
North Koreans and their nukes, America has never been so secure. It's
not because the U.S. military's effectiveness has declined; it remains
the most powerful force in the world, highly capable and very ready. The
reason the Pentagon's budget is now on a long-term upswing is because
[the military has spent years **loudly lobbying** for]{.underline} such
[an increase while complaining about an alleged "readiness crisis."
Complaining works]{.underline}, at least [when the military does it,
because politicians]{.underline} in both parties **[fear the military's
wrath]{.underline}**. Partisan gridlock can still impede efforts to bump
up the military's resources, but now that Republicans are in control of
Congress and the White House, there are no more hurdles standing in the
way. None of this is to suggest, however, that the congressional
generosity will buy Americans more security or a better force than the
one they have today. [Every military leader in history]{.underline} has
[wanted more resources]{.underline} at his or her disposal. U.S.
secretaries of defense have been especially adamant since 2011, when the
Budget Control Act first set limits on both defense and domestic
spending. The tears shed by the Pentagon went beyond complaining about
those pesky budget caps. They also touched on declining military
readiness, units that weren't combat ready, Chinese military expansion,
and just about anything else that defense officials thought might put
the spending train back on the tracks. All [the Pentagon's complaints
**ignored**]{.underline} the **[reality]{.underline}** that [since 2001
the military has been receiving]{.underline} tens, and sometimes even
[hundreds]{.underline}, [of billions]{.underline} of dollars [in
additional funding --- above and beyond the budget caps --- thanks to a
**special slush fund, the O**]{.underline}verseas
**[C]{.underline}**ontingency **[O]{.underline}**peration[s
account]{.underline}. That money is supposed to be designated for
emergencies, but both the Pentagon and the Congress have routinely used
this budget for nonemergency purposes, such as paying, training, and
supporting existing troops (all normally in the Pentagon's base budget)
and buying equipment already in the long-term defense plan.
Nevertheless, the military has complained that its readiness is in
tatters. And after all those years of deployments, military officials
testifying to Congress could always come up with a sad anecdote about
planes being cross-decked to an outgoing carrier, fighters not ready to
fly, or missing pilots. U.S. policymakers have seen this movie many
times before. I experienced it myself in the 1990s, when the brass was
displeased with the budget levels set by the Bill Clinton administration
and whined about readiness problems to the Office of Management and
Budget, where I worked. My follow-up with the Pentagon's civil servants
made it clear that the measures they were using were rigged to show low
levels of readiness; they set standards that called units "ready" only
if they had every capability imaginable to fight a major ground war, and
they counted as "unready" units that were back from deployments and had
missed a training slot for that big war, one they would soon be
scheduled to receive. We knew [the Pentagon was using **manipulated
numbers to bludgeon us**]{.underline} with demands for more funding.
Nevertheless, we caved: In 1994, we added more than \$20 billion to the
defense budget, not really to fix readiness but to try to make the issue
go away before the midterm elections that year. (It didn't work, by the
way.) Four years later, we did it again, busting previous budget
commitments to add billions of dollars more. (For an excellent analysis
of that fight, read This War Really Matters: Inside the Fight for
Defense Dollars by the late George C. Wilson, once the premier Pentagon
correspondent for the Washington Post.) Plus ça change, plus c'est la
même chose --- the more things change, the more they stay the same ---
as military parade leaders in France might say. Today, once again, [the
U.S. military stands on the brink of **an alleged readiness
crisis**]{.underline}, and more money is needed, pronto. **[The trail of
tears became so deep]{.underline}** that it caught up Republicans and
Democrats (always eager to portray themselves as "tough on national
security"). It caught up in the lachrymose flow virtually all of the
think tank preachers at the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage
Foundation, the Center for a New American Security, and large panels of
bipartisan heavyweights reviewing the Pentagon's four-year defense
studies. Everyone in Washington seems to have been swept up in the tide;
even some of the most careful, independent analysts are on board. As
Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies
noted, "We are stretched too thin.... We are trying to do too much with
the size force that we have all around the world." All [this
hand-wringing is]{.underline} happening [about a ground force
that,]{.underline} after nearly two decades of war, [is **highly
experienced** and **primed**]{.underline} --- and largely back at home;
[a Navy that is larger than any other]{.underline} navy in the world and
the only one with global reach; [an Air Force]{.underline} that is
[**larger** and **more technologically advanced** than any
other]{.underline}, flying, bombing, tanking, airlifting [globally.
**America's is the only military** that has **global basing**,
**logistics**, **communications**, **transportation**, and
**intelligence**; **nobody else**]{.underline}, not the Chinese and
certainly not the Russians, **[comes even close]{.underline}**. But this
is Washington, where the policy and analytical sheep gather under one
tree to be safe from the storm of political criticism. The British
novelist Lawrence Durrell comes to mind: "How nugatory and how glum /
The endomorphs of scholarship / Like hippos on a sinking ship / Stand
bum to silly bum." (Just replace scholarship with politics and the
comparison is apt.) So, on what will the Pentagon spend this largesse?
The last time the Pentagon got this kind of fiscal bump-up --- in
1981-1982 under Reagan --- bureaucrats and military officers were
reaching into desk drawers to dust off plans they never thought would be
funded. As Reagan might have said, "There they go again." There is now a
lot of discussion of funding going into training, equipment maintenance,
and repair personnel. But the big bucks, according to the Pentagon's own
briefing, will go into conventional military equipment. That means more
F-35s and F-18s than planned, a new presidential helicopter, Navy
surveillance planes and destroyers, Marine helicopters, space launch
rockets, tank modifications, another Army multipurpose vehicle, and a
joint tactical vehicle the Army, Marines, and Air Force can all use.
Basically, the services will soon have shiny new hardware. There will
also be a push to modernize the country's nuclear arsenal. This will be
done under the guise of "enhanced deterrence," but really this amounts
to a game of maintaining appearances and "keeping up with the Joneses"
--- or the Russians, Chinese, and North Koreans. The strategic reasons
for this effort are meager; the reality is that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has **more than enough deterrent force
today**]{.underline} and all the additional nuclear forces in the world
will only undermine deterrence and stimulate even more arms racing. All
this will be combined with accelerated investments in sea- and
ground-based missile defense systems, which have yet to prove
themselves, despite decades of testing and billions of dollars invested.
The [contribution of]{.underline} all this [spending to solve an alleged
"readiness crisis" is not obvious]{.underline}. It's worth heeding what
Defense Secretary James Mattis promised after the deal was signed: "I am
very confident that what the Congress has now done, and the president is
going to allocate to us in the budget, is what we need to bring us back
to a position of primacy." **[An unobtainable primacy]{.underline}**, of
course, [is not the same]{.underline} thing [as readiness]{.underline}.

#### No impact\-\--American power isn't key to global stability.

Studies, 26:3, 423-451, 5-8-2017,

Conflict and Hegemony by Region Even the most ardent supporters of the
hegemonic-stability explanation do not contend that US influence extends
equally to all corners of the globe. The United States has concentrated
its policing in what George Kennan used to call "strong points," or the
most important parts of the world: Western Europe, the Pacific Rim, and
Persian Gulf.64 By doing so, Washington may well have contributed more
to great power peace than the overall global decline in warfare. If the
former phenomenon contributed to the latter, by essentially providing a
behavioral model for weaker states to emulate, then perhaps this lends
some support to the hegemonic-stability case.65 During the Cold War, the
United States played referee to a few intra-West squabbles, especially
between Greece and Turkey, and provided Hobbesian reassurance to
Germany's nervous neighbors. **[Other]{.underline}**, equally plausible
**[explanations exist for stability]{.underline}** in the first world,
[including]{.underline} the [presence of a common enemy]{.underline},
[democracy]{.underline}, [economic interdependence]{.underline},
[general war aversion, etc]{.underline}. The looming presence of the
leviathan is certainly among these plausible explanations, but only
inside the US sphere of influence. Bipolarity was bad for the nonaligned
world, where Soviet and Western intervention routinely exacerbated local
conflicts. [Unipolarity has]{.underline} generally [been]{.underline}
much [better]{.underline}, [but whether or not this was due to US action
is again **unclear**]{.underline}. Overall [US interest in]{.underline}
the affairs of [the Global South]{.underline} has [dropped
markedly]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, as has the level of
violence in almost all regions. [There is less US
intervention]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the political and military
affairs of [Latin America]{.underline} compared to any time in the
twentieth century, for instance, [and]{.underline} also [less
conflict]{.underline}. [Warfare in Africa is at an all-time
low]{.underline}, as is relative US interest outside of counterterrorism
and security assistance.66 [Regional peace and stability exist where
there is US active intervention]{.underline}, [as well as where there is
not]{.underline}. **[No direct relationship seems to exist across
regions]{.underline}**. If intervention can be considered a function of
direct and indirect activity, of both political and military action, a
regional picture might look like what is outlined in Table 1. These
assessments of conflict are by necessity relative, because there has not
been a "high" level of conflict in any region outside the Middle East
during the period of the New Peace. Putting aside for the moment that
important caveat, some points become clear. The great powers of the
world are clustered in the upper right quadrant, where US intervention
has been high, but conflict levels low. [US intervention is
**imperfectly correlated** with stability]{.underline}, however. Indeed,
it is conceivable that the relatively [high level of US]{.underline}
interest and [activity]{.underline} has [made]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} security situation in the **[Persian
Gulf]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} broader **[Middle East
worse]{.underline}**. In recent years, substantial [hard power
investments]{.underline} ([Somalia]{.underline},
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}), [moderate
intervention]{.underline} ([Libya]{.underline}), [and reliance on
diplomacy]{.underline} ([Syria]{.underline}) [have been **equally
ineffective**]{.underline} in [stabilizing states torn by
conflict]{.underline}. While it is possible that the region is
essentially unpacifiable and no amount of police work would bring peace
to its people, [it remains hard to make the case]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} the [US presence]{.underline} has [improved
matters]{.underline}. In this "strong point," at least, **[US hegemony
has failed to bring peace]{.underline}**. In much of the rest of the
world, the United States has not been especially eager to enforce any
particular rules. Even rather incontrovertible evidence of genocide has
not been enough to inspire action. [Washington's intervention choices
have at best been erratic]{.underline}; Libya and Kosovo brought about
action, but [much more blood flowed uninterrupted]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [Rwanda]{.underline}, [Darfur]{.underline},
[Congo]{.underline}, [Sri Lanka]{.underline}, [and Syria]{.underline}.
[The US record of peacemaking is not exactly a long uninterrupted string
of successes]{.underline}. During the turn-of-the-century conventional
war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, a highlevel US delegation containing
former and future National Security Advisors (Anthony Lake and Susan
Rice) made a half-dozen trips to the region, but was unable to prevent
either the outbreak or recurrence of the conflict. Lake and his team
shuttled back and forth between the capitals with some frequency, and
President Clinton made repeated phone calls to the leaders of the
respective countries, offering to hold peace talks in the United States,
all to no avail.67 The war ended in late 2000 when Ethiopia essentially
won, and it controls the disputed territory to this day. [The Horn of
Africa is hardly the only region where states are free to
fight]{.underline} one another today [without fear of]{.underline}
serious [US involvement]{.underline}. Since they are choosing not to do
so with increasing frequency, [something else is probably affecting
their calculations]{.underline}. Stability exists even in those places
where the potential for intervention by the sheriff is minimal.
Hegemonic stability can only take credit for influencing those decisions
that would have ended in war without the presence, whether physical or
psychological, of the United States. [It seems hard to make the case
that]{.underline} the [relative peace]{.underline} that has [descended
on]{.underline} so many [regions]{.underline} is primarily [due
to]{.underline} the kind of heavy hand of the
[neoconservative]{.underline} [leviathan]{.underline}, or its lighter,
more liberal cousin. **[Something else appears to be at
work]{.underline}**.

[But while a strong Republican performance in 2022 might influence
Biden's thinking on 2024, **it's a mistake to expect the midterm result
to predict how the country will vote in the ensuing presidential
election**]{.underline}. As the chart below shows, [there's **little

the U.S. House **in a midterm** election **and** the national popular
vote margin **in the next presidential contest**]{.underline}. [So
whatever happens in the House this November, don't expect it to forecast
the results of the next presidential race]{.underline}. [More often than
not, **midterm and presidential results have been miles
apart**]{.underline}. For instance, in 1994, the GOP captured Congress
in the midterm "Republican Revolution" amidst then-President Bill
Clinton's poor approval ratings, winning the House popular vote by about
7 percentage points. But in 1996, Clinton ended up claiming a sleepy
reelection victory by 8.5 points over Bob Dole --- a swing of more than
15 points. In fact, on average, there's been a swing of about 12 points
from the midterm to the subsequent presidential contest. That said,
midterm elections and their following presidential races have sometimes
run close together: Democrats swept back into power in the
[2006]{.underline} midterm election with an 8-point edge in the House
vote, for instance, and then-President Barack Obama won by a similar
7-point margin nationally in 2008. [In fact, midterm and presidential
elections have run closer together in recent years --- but importantly,
there is still not much of a relationship despite this]{.underline}.
Rather, this seems to be happening because landslide presidential wins
are increasingly a thing of the past. [Instead, lopsided midterm results
for the party not in the White House are increasingly becoming the norm,
then followed by highly competitive presidential races.]{.underline}

In the aftermath of the 2020 Presidential election and President Trump's
attempt to subvert its results, there has been an increased focus on the
oft overlooked statewide position of secretary of state[. During his
attempts to subvert the results of the election, President Trump put
pressure on secretaries of state across the country to undermine the
results in their respective states. As the midterm elections draw near,
and with **many Secretary of State positions on the ballot**, the
**former President is endorsing candidates** in key battleground states
**who agree with his claims of fraud in the 2020 Presidential
election**. If they are appointed to office, these candidates could
**undermine the nation's free and fair elections in 2024**.]{.underline}
The secretary of state responsibilities include the management and
oversight over elections within their respective state. While they run
with the affiliation of a political party, the office tends to act in a
bureaucratic sense and does not get involved with partisan conflicts.
The position had very little spotlight until the aftermath of the 2020
presidential election when former President Trump attempted to overturn
the results of the election. This is most evidently seen in his call to
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to "find"
about 11,000 ballots needed to flip the results in the state from a
Trump loss to a win. Raffensberger refused President Trump's demand, and
the election in Georgia was certified as a Biden victory, supported by
several recounts that reinforced the same result. [With current
officials across both parties refusing to help President Trump overturn
the election, he has begun to endorse candidates for Secretary of State
who support his claim of fraud. With the 2022 midterm elections
approaching, 27 secretary of state seats are up for election across the
nation. Within these races there are **21 candidates in 18 states who
deny the validity of the last Presidential election's results**. Of
these, Trump has endorsed three candidates for the position in Arizona,
Georgia, and Michigan: three competitive states from the last election
cycle.]{.underline} One such example is Arizona state Representative
Mark Fincher, who attended the January 6 riot and has introduced a bill
to decertify Arizona's 2020 election. Even in Georgia, Raffensperger
faces a primary challenge from U.S Rep Jody Hice, who is seeking the
position to "aggressively pursue voter fraud." [While these candidates
actively sow doubt about the previous election, they are **attempting to
be elected to control the next ones**. If elected, they can use their
office to skew and **manipulate election results in Trump's favor** if
he runs again in 2024. If elected, Secretaries of State who support
baseless claims of election fraud will **weaken U.S democracy** by
undermining the country's free and fair elections.]{.underline}
[President Trump's current attempt to put supporters of his claims of
fraud into secretary of state offices across the country would enable
him to **politicize election institutions, decrease faith in the
stability of elections, and potentially overturn unfavorable
results**.]{.underline} If these hyper-partisan candidates are elected,
it would mark a stark change in the office of secretary of state, making
it a much more political body. [Instead of acting in a nonpartisan
manner, these new secretaries would be able to use the powers of their
office for the benefit of Trump's election attempts]{.underline}. While
there are concerns that these candidates could take action against
election results, they would also diminish faith in America's democracy
and electoral system. A January 2022 poll from Quinnipiac found that 58
percent of Americans believe that the country's democracy is under the
threat of collapse. [Since the Secretary of State leads elections in
each state, if there is not faith in them to properly fulfill their
duties, there is little chance that the public would believe that
elections are free and fair. With a majority of Americans believing that
democracy is under threat, it is **important that the people in charge
of elections are able to instill the public's trust in the electoral
system's ability to uphold democracy**]{.underline}. It would be a hard
task to strengthen democracy while those in charge of elections are
actively supporting notions of fraud. [Furthermore, if Trump runs once
again in 2024, supporting Secretaries of State in key states could
potentially help undermine election results, in the guise of security,
in their states to reverse results in favor of Trump.]{.underline}
Altogether[, these factors demonstrate the threat that these candidates
can potentially have to U.S democracy.]{.underline}

The crushing defeat of David Perdue in Tuesday's Republican
gubernatorial primary in Georgia likely delighted Donald Trump's
adversaries, who have been keeping scorecards to measure the performance
of election candidates backed by the former U.S. president. [**Trump has
weighed in on November's midterm elections like no former president,
announcing more than 190 endorsements and holding rallies with his
proteges**.]{.underline} [The success of his endorsees is seen as a key
sign of his continued influence over the party as he hints at another
run for the White House in 2024. But political analysts and Republican
strategists caution that any jubilation among Trump's enemies over
Perdue's loss to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is short-sighted, and that any
scorecard is a poor barometer for the state of **Trumpism in the United
States in 2022.** While Trump's candidates have had mixed success so far
this year in party primaries, **many Republican voters still embrace
Trump's false claims** of voter fraud in the 2020 election, as well as
his right-wing]{.underline}, [**"America First" populist
ideology**.]{.underline} [And failure to win Trump's endorsement has not
stopped some Republican candidates from going hard-right to try to win
over his base.]{.underline} "In 2016, Trump was really the only
candidate running as that sort of populist. Now it's increasingly what
most Republican primary candidates sound like," said Republican
strategist Alex Conant. [That underlines the continuation of the
Trump-led metamorphosis of the Republican Party since he was voted out
of the White House in 2020, even as some party leaders seek to move the
party away from Trumpism, the strategists and analysts said. "I think
the No. 1 thing **Trump has absolutely changed in the party** is that
**Republicans don't even try playing nice anymore.** My side has become
more angry," said Republican strategist Chuck Warren]{.underline}. The
people's 'Make America Great Again' Trump's kingmaker status was put to
the test this month when several high-profile, [Trump-backed candidates
faced Republican primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and
Georgia. Around two-thirds of high-profile candidates backed by Trump
triumphed in their contests in May, although some were running unopposed
or against weak challengers. One race, the Republican senate contest in
Pennsylvania between television personality Mehmet Oz, who received
Trump's endorsement, and former hedge fund executive David McCormick,
has yet to be decided. In lobbying for the former president's
endorsement, both men **cast aside their elite backgrounds to espouse
the Trump-style populism that now resonates with
Republicans.**]{.underline} The primary was shaken up by Kathy Barnette,
a conservative political commentator, who came from nowhere at the 11th
hour to tighten a race that had until then appeared to be a two-man
contest. [While she finished a distant third in the primaries, analysts
said she was emblematic of how Trump's Make America Great Again movement
has expanded beyond his control. "MAGA does not belong to President
Trump," Barnette said during a Republican debate last month, even as
Trump spoke out against her. "Although he coined the word, **MAGA
actually belongs to the people**."]{.underline} Republican voters in
Pennsylvania also backed Trump-endorsed far-right candidate Doug
Mastriano for governor, who supports abortion bans with no exceptions
and backs Trump's false claims of election fraud. Mastriano won his
contest. In North Carolina[, Republican voters powered Trump-backed
Representative Ted Budd, who voted to overturn Joe Biden's election win,
to victory in the state's Republican Senate nomination. Georgia's
governor's race, where Perdue was pummeled on Tuesday by Kemp, shows how
the Republican Party has shifted to the right, irrespective of how
Trump-endorsed candidates perform in these primaries.]{.underline} While
Kemp did not entertain Trump's conspiracy theories of 2020 election
fraud, he did enact sweeping voting restrictions, limited abortions and
expanded gun rights. But voters were only willing to follow Trump so far
in backing flawed candidates in May's nominating contests. In another
race on Tuesday, for Georgia's secretary of state position, some experts
had forecast neither securing a majority, triggering a run-off. Instead,
incumbent Brad Raffensperger narrowly defeated Trump-endorsed Rep. Jody
Hice, who amplified Trump's baseless claims that he actually won the
Georgia presidential vote in 2020. In North Carolina, voters ousted
scandal-plagued congressman Madison Cawthorn despite Trump's last-minute
plea to give him "a second chance." And in Nebraska, Trump's choice for
governor, Charles Herbster, lost amid accusations that he had sexually
harassed several women. But what is already clear, analysts say, is that
[Trump's winning 2016 strategy to seize on the issues **bitterly
polarizing** Americans is increasingly being emulated by Republican
candidates this year and enthusiastically embraced by party supporters.
**The spread of this right-wing populism**]{.underline} may ultimately
open the door for more challengers to Trump's vice-like grip on the
party ahead of the next presidential election, said Conant, the
Republican strategist.
