# Figural Aesthetics K -- BFHR

#### Notes

Thanks to James, Guy, Michael, and Steven for their hard work on this
file. Please email <khirn10@gmail.com> with any questions or concerns.

Notes from the research crew:

This K was originally meant to be a more deleuzian centric K of emerging
technologies. Over the course of our research, we slowly shifted the
focus to be more in line with the works of Arthur Kroker as a broader K
of the will to technology and what such a future would curtail. This K
is extremely versatile, offering you a wide variety of links against a
lot of impacts, mechanisms, and actors that affs on this topic would
most likely defend. The coolest part of this K in my opinion is the
impact level. With how outlandish Kroker can be sometimes, you have
access to a lot of wild impacts, such as super soldiers, 4^th^
dimensional warfare, genetic bombs, datafied flesh, and a litany of
others.

While most of the file is built upon Kroker's works, I included a small
Deleuze module primarily cut from the thesis of the War Machine chapter
in ATP with an angle about control societies. Running this requires a
much deeper knowledge of deleuzian theory as the cards are not hyper
specific to things like OCOs or whatever.

The two modules aren't necessarily incompatible, but you should be
careful about just frankensteining a 1NC together, especially against
teams that actually read this stuff. The framework stuff under kroker is
applicable to deleuze, especially the glezos stuff.

### 1NC -- Will To Will

#### The will to emerging technologies amplifies the crisis of the real, pirates the body through a genetic matrix, harvests flesh, and turns bodies into predatory war machines

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 185-188, March 2004, MG)

[What is the future of digital reality? What is the consequence of the
fateful meeting of digital experience and biotech engineering? What is
the fate of the future itself when]{.underline}, as Paul Virilio argues
in Open Sky, [time and space as the deep horizon of our existence have
been accidented, have been radically derealized, into the dimensionless
void of 'space-light' and the real time, the instantaneous, global
networked time of light-time]{.underline}? After the mutation, the
galactic debris of local time and local space gets in our eyes, and
history [as a chronological succession of events collapses into random
events with mutable meanings]{.underline}. Or when reality suddenly
flips, and we are no longer living in hyper-reality, broken boundaries
moving at the speed of light, but just the opposite -- reversed into a
digital universe moving at the slow speed of light.

The Slow Speed of Light

Just in time for the twenty-first century, physicists have frozen, and
then actually stopped, a beam of light, thus instantly reversing one of
the threshold laws of physics and more importantly reversing the
hyper-speed of the culture of acceleration into slow optics, slow media,
slow light.

When light moves at 38 mph, decelerating from over 186,000 miles per
second, and then is suddenly frozen in its trajectory, hyper-reality
crashes under the accumulated weight of deceleration.

Crash optics for a time when light-time and light-space decelerate into
a sub-time and a sub-space where human perspective is suddenly faster
than the electronic transmission of the image.

Crash time when the slow speed of light, the slow speed of electronic
perspective, brings down to earth all those globalized vectors of
simulated time that had been launched into global media orbit during the
reign of the speed of light.

Crash space when the slow speed of light deflates all the trends to
globalization and real time into the slow time and the slow space of the
frozen local.

[This sudden and catastrophic deflation of the speed of light
**amplifies the crisis of the real**]{.underline}. The hyper-real was
based on the accidenting of bounded light and bounded space with the
disappearance of light and time into the 'real time' of virtual light
and virtual space. An aesthetic regime of signification based on the
speed of light. What happens now is the end of the hyperreal, and the
beginning of the sovereignty of the subreal. Light moving at the speed
of a car stalled in gridlock on a LA freeway in the noon sun. Light that
moves slower than the propagation of electronic images, and the
circulation of electronic sounds.

[A slow speed of light for a culture about to undergo a fast descent
into a vertiginous experience of pure virtuality: events spinning
outwards faster than their images; slow light as a form of retinal
persistence of the slow unfolding of past events; life imprisoned in
slow time and slow space and slow images and slow aesthetics.
Interminability as the dominant cultural sign of the twenty-first
century.]{.underline}

Firewire Eyes

Heidegger was correct. [Everything to this point has been preparatory,
an anticipation of a fundamental and radical technological event. A
decisive turning. **Until now, the will to technology has been on the
outside**, hovering around the body with its probes of seduction. It
invites the body to empty itself into wireless networks. It firewires
the eye to images recombinant. It **harvests flesh**. It whispers about
the speed of data flesh. It undermines the confidence of the body,
making it increasingly insecure about itself. It reconfigures the brain.
It **externalizes, ablates, and disappears flesh**: turning the organic
body inside out into an open-source scan portal for probing **media of
communication**. Until now, everything has been about the
exteriorization of the central nervous system.]{.underline}

[Not for much longer, though. The real implication of biological
determinism as the dominant discourse of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- the human genome project, [**nanotechnology**,
therapeutic cloning, **genetic engineering**, the convergence of
**artificial intelligence** and robotics]{.underline}, the dreams
delirious of designer genes, organ transplants and tissue replacements
for an improved posthuman sensorium -- is that [the body is about to
**pirated by the genetic matrix**.]{.underline}

[Pirated not once, but twice. First, **biotech** invades the body in the
name of good health, longer life, better learning, avoiding catastrophic
illnesses. It faciliates the disappearance of the body in the name of
its own improvement]{.underline}. It provides an automatic internal
surveillance system of the previously autonomous body from within its
own circulatory systems. [And then, biotech pirates the body away from
itself in the name of a perfect eugenics. Literally, the organic body is
about to be replaced, redesigned, and left behind as gene kill by
biotechnology acting as a **predatory war machine**]{.underline}. Read
the business pages of any newspaper. The final harvesting of data flesh
is the newest IPO. [This future is not for everyone. **Most will be left
behind as surplus flesh**. The genetic elite will pass over. Visions of
Gattica. Their children already have. They will be the leaders of the
new world order of the genetic matrix.]{.underline}

Heidegger said that to understand what is closest at hand sometimes we
have to travel furthest. So read the hermetic manuscripts of the desert
mothers and the desert fathers. And not just the ancients, the
Anchorites, but the desert thinkers of the biotech future: digital
artists. The visionaries of the biotech eye who have gone ahead by
travelling furthest to what is nearest to us: our bodies. Long dead
words blowing in the sand of caves in the deserts of North Africa or in
other deserted caves in the deserts of the digital vortex.

[That which is coming has long been predicted.]{.underline}

[That which will happen has long been prophesied.]{.underline}

[That which will disappear has long been lamented.]{.underline}

[That which will be dominant has long been feared.]{.underline}

[The twenty-first century is an age of tremulous technological destiny.
The future is **suspended in an electric shadowland of ambivalence**,
drifting between fascination and dread. Both tendencies necessary. Both
tendencies incomplete without their opposite. In biotechnology, a new
form of android life -- the final revelation of technology as a new form
of android life, a posthuman life substituting itself for the human
species, finally begins.]{.underline}

We are one of the last generations before something fundamentally new.
[The experiments have **already** begun.]{.underline}

#### The will to technology is a doubled expression of hubris -- it ends the human species and the cycle of life and death

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 29-31, October 2021, MG)

[On the surface, the rhetoric of this latest American revival movement
is delivered in the deliberately arid form of technocratic ambition --
an "Internet of Things," the "quantified self," "A Data-Driven Life" --
but scratch the surface of the covering rhetoric and what springs to
mind are all those unmistakable signs of the spirit of
rapture]{.underline}. Everything is there: a theology of technology
driven by an overwhelming conviction that the vicissitudes of embodied
experience are subordinate to digital transcendence; [the will to extend
life either by uploading the human mind into its AI machinic successors
or by passionate faith in the bornagain body of artificial DNA; the
doctrine of data as a state of (codedriven) grace; and conversionary
enthusiasm for the fully quantified life. While many different
perspectives gather under the revival tent of technological rapture, one
common thing remains: an abiding **faith that technological society** is
quickly delivering us to a future inaugurated by a singularity event,
that epochal time in which intelligent machines take command with
promises of a mind merger with a data world that is fluid, mobile,
relational, and indeterminate]{.underline}. Though sceptics standing
outside the circle of technological rapture might be tempted to reduce
its enthusiasm for data delirium to the larger figurations of the form
of (technological) subjectivity necessary for the functioning of digital
capitalism, that reduction would surely overlook the fact that [the
contemporary will to technology is itself driven by a more **radical
eschatological promise**, namely that the will to data has about it the
tangible scent of finally achieving what the project of science has
always promised but never delivered -- human relief from death, disease,
and bodily decay]{.underline}. While Francis Bacon's emblematic treatise
Novum Organum may have been the first to so confidently link the project
of science and the heretofore quixotic quest for immortality, it was
left to a contemporary techno-utopian visionary, Raymond Kurzweil (The
Singularity Is Near), to transform Bacon's ontological ambition for
science into a practical strategy for better -- that is, extended --
computational living.2 In Kurzweil's promised land of blended reality,
the sky is the limit, with traditional boundaries dissolving between
nature and human nature, the material and the virtual, and the enduring
vulnerability of the human body with its defining limits of illness and
death finally transcended. [Powered by advances in nanotechnology,
artificial intelligence, and gene editing, the world as we have always
known it will be in sudden eclipse, and all this change will take place
under the rising sun of a **technological ornucopia**]{.underline}. As
Kurzweil argues, "through the use of nanotechnology, we will be able to
manufacture almost any physical product upon demand, world hunger and
poverty will be solved, and pollution will vanish. Human existence will
undergo a quantum leap in evolution. We will be able to live as long as
we choose. The coming into being of such a world is, in essence, the
Singularity."3

At first glance, this vision is only the most recent expression of the
Greek concept of hubris, the cautionary tale concerning the ineluctable
balance between excessive pride of purpose and mythic punishment meted
out by always observant gods. [Adding complexity to this reinvocation of
hubris as often-fatal overconfidence, that vision of singularity is, in
actuality, a **doubled expression of hubris**. First, there is the sense
of technological overconfidence involved in breaking beyond the
traditional boundaries of the specifically human in order to speak of
the new epoch of "man and machine," that is, fully digitally
interpolated subjects in which the specifically human merges with the
**extended nervous system of the cybernetic**.]{.underline} Here, the
merely human is replaced by the technologically enabled post-human as
the fundamental precondition for the singularity. With the sovereign
expression of technological post-humanism, the stage is set for the
futurist release of all the pent-up excess of expressions of scientific
determinism and technological fundamentalism that have been gathering
momentum for some five centuries  -- transcending bodily limits,
eradicating illness, ending poverty and hunger, and vanishing
pollution[. In its basics, this version of technological futurism, with
its doubled sense of hubris and complicated alliance of recoded bodies,
nanotechnology, genetic determinism, and artificial intelligence, is a
**creation myth** -- "]{.underline}the coming into being of such a world
is, in essence, the Singularity." With techno-futurism, we are literally
present at a digital rewriting of the Book of Genesis with all that is
implied in terms of (re)creating the body for smoother, and perhaps
safer, passage through the often-turbulent event horizon surrounding the
black hole of the singularity towards which (technological) society is
plunging. While the DIY body may have the "Internet of Things" as its
necessary digital infrastructure and the "quantified self" as its ideal
expression, what drives it forward, animating its design and inspiring
its constant creativity, is, in the end as in the beginning, the spectre
of the coming singularity as its core creation myth. Curiously, in the
same way that Heidegger once noted that the question of technology can
never ever be understood technologically -- that we must travel furthest
from the dwelling place of technology to discover its essence4  -- the
concept of singularity, while evocative of the language of science and
powered by digital devices, is something profoundly theological in its
inception.

Given the sheer complexity of contemporary global society with its
mixture of recidivist social movements, global climate change, fully
unpredictable human desires, economic turbulence, and, of course,
changing rhythms of bodily health and the many diseases of the aged and
the sick, Kurzweil's vision is startling, less so for its naivety than
for its feverish embrace of an approaching technological state of
bliss -- transcendent, teleological, and terminal. His vision is
transcendent because its overriding faith in machine intelligence,
nanotechnology, and gene research is premised on the imperative of
"overcoming our frail bodies with their limitations." Here, unlike the
Christian belief first articulated by St. Augustine in De Trinitate --
with its division of the body into corruptible flesh and the perfect
incorporeality of the state of grace -- the newest of all the
singularities is intended to lead to a new heaven of computation. [It's
teleological because this vision of the new singularity invests the will
to technology with a sustaining, indeed inspiring, purpose: overcoming
the unknown country of death. And it's terminal because it is also a
**philosophy of end times**, certainly **the end of the human species as
we have known it** but also the end of easily distinguishable boundaries
between the "biological and the mechanical, or between physical and
virtual reality."5 In Kurzweil's vision, the nanotechnology revolution
is, in fact, revolutionary precisely because it will facilitate the
creative construction of new bodies and technologically enhanced minds
for life beyond the current "limitations of biology."6 It is the end,
therefore, of the biological body as we have known it and the beginning
of something very novel: the merger of natural biology with its
surrounding environment of technologies of the post-biological --
artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, molecular science, and
neurobots. As to be expected, in return for the **sacrifice of a natural
biological cycle of life and death**]{.underline}, the creation myth
framing technological rapture has promises of its own to keep: a fully
realized future of "living indefinitely" with nanobots streaming
"through the bloodstream in our bodies and brains," telepathy in the
form of "wireless communication from one brain to another," and improved
"pattern recognition" by overcoming the inherent limitations of natural
cognitive evolution in favour of "brain implants"7 marking the
inception, then triumph, of "nonbiological intelligence." In effect,
[the vision of technological rapture is conceived as a marvellous,
ready-made (AI) toolbox for constructing DIY bodies.]{.underline}

#### Our alternative is a form of artistic practice that [recodes]{.underline} the question of aesthetics towards the discontinuous, the fragmentary, the uncertain, the reversal. We are the [glitch]{.underline}, the darkness, the [specters]{.underline} hidden within the techo-imaginary of the future that float in the drifts of [codes, history, and media]{.underline} as their intersecting point of evocation and undermining.

**Kroker 14** (Arthur Kroker, emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "Exits to the
Posthuman Future," pgs. 195-198)//JRD

[What if we were **to think media** theory as itself an **artistic
practice**]{.underline}, that is, [as a **form of aesthetic
imagination** that seeks to **directly enter** the world of **data
nerves**, network skin, and increasingly **algorithmic minds** with the
**intention of capturing** the dominant **mood** of these **posthuman
times**]{.underline} -- [drift culture]{.underline} -- in a form of
thought that dwells in complicated intersections and complex
borderlands? In its essence, [**thinking** with and **against** the
larger **technopoesis** of **accelerate**, **drift**, and **crash** that
**holds** **us** in its **sway** **requires** a form of **media**
**reflection** that is itself an **exit** **to** the **posthuman**
**future**.]{.underline} Here, [**refusing** to **stand** outside its
**immediate** **historical** **circumstances** and **always** seeking to
**capture** in its **rhythms** the mood of **accelerate**, **drift**,
and **crash**, media theory of this order allies itself with a form of
**emergent** **consciousness** that is **pervasive** in the **digital**
**world**, namely **figural** **aesthetics**.]{.underline} [With its
global gathering of new **media artists**, remix musicians, **pirate
gamers, AI graffiti artists**, anonymous witnesses, and **code rebels**,
the emerging order of **figural aesthetics** reveals a **new order**, a
brilliantly hallucinatory order, based on an **art** of **impossible**
**questions** and a **perceptual** **language** as **precise** as it is
**evocative**.]{.underline} Here, [the **aesthetic** **imagination**
dwells solely on **questions** of **incommensurability**]{.underline}:
What is the vision of the clone? [What is the **affect** of **the**
**code**? What is the **hauntology** of the **avatar**?]{.underline}
What is most excluded, prohibited, by the android? What is the
perception of the drone? [What are the **aesthetics** of the fold? What,
in short, is the meaning of aesthetics in the age of drift
culture?]{.underline} In this case, [understood as an aesthetic order
of]{.underline} (new media) [art that seeks to enter directly into the
circulatory regime of the code, literally in the **process becoming**
itself **symptomatically energized** by the **vortices** of **data**
**flows** and algorithmic coding]{.underline}, [**figural**
**aesthetics** is always multiple in its **artistic** **expressions**,
certainly humanizing, but also **tragic**, **neutral**, and sometimes
cynical.]{.underline} [**No** **longer** an art of **expression** or
**representation**, but **art** that **literally** **catches** the
**drift** of its times by entering **directly** into the **violent**
**perturbations** of the code-stream]{.underline} -- [a **form** of
**art** that is **figural** precisely because it **registers**
**simultaneously** all the **fatal** **speed** and **tragic**
**intimations** of deprival **implicit** in an **increasingly**
technical **reality**. Not necessarily]{.underline}, then, [a
**multimedia** art that **evokes** the **contagious** **energy** of the
code, although that too, but a form of art that stands poised at the
fracture]{.underline} (Duchamp\'s "hinge")2 [of presence and absence,
drawing into itself all the contradictions and complexity and folds of
digital reality itself.]{.underline} Driven by a speed of (aesthetic)
perception that easily exceeds the speed of the code, [**mobilized** by
a **new way of seeing** that is balanced between in-depth participation
in the]{.underline} (digital) [object of its study and an
incommensurable drawing away from ruling narratives that would capture
it]{.underline}, [and attentive to the fact every artifact of
technological posthumanism]{.underline}, from digital devices to private
autobiography, [is a **possible** **object** of **artistic**
**interest**, **figural** **aesthetics** **floats** in the drifts of
**codes**, **history**, **video**, and **media** as their
**intersecting** **point** of evocation and
**undermining**.]{.underline} Sensitive to fundamental changes in the
order of sense perception, the artistic imagination has always
functioned as a navigator, simultaneously intimate with and at a
critical distance from the digital recoding of the human sensorium.
Consequently, it comes as no surprise that [the **first** **response**
to the **emerging** **complexities** of **technological**
**posthumanism** is most **definitely** **aesthetic** in form. **Not** a
mode of **aesthetics** that **remains** at **one**]{.underline} (safe)
[**remove** from the **technological** **transitioning** of]{.underline}
the question of [the human species-form]{.underline}, [but the swift
emergence now of a style of]{.underline} aesthetics -- [figural
aesthetics]{.underline} -- [that **enters** directly into the
**complexities** of drift culture.]{.underline} Sometimes, [figural
aesthetics adopts the **language** **of** **design**. It becomes a
**rider of the data storm**, negotiating **new** **pathways**
**through** the **radical** **uncertainty** of the **digital**
**future**. At other points, **figural** **aesthetics** offers profound
**meditations** on the **accident** **of** **technology** by invoking in
the **language** **of** **art** the ancient tradition of lament.
**Deliberately** **challenging** officially prescribed **frameworks** of
**understanding**, **figural** **art** of this order quickly **calls**
**down** upon itself the most severe form of **policing**.]{.underline}
Literally, [the **framework**]{.underline} of power [involved in
**securing** **contemporary** norms of **political** **intelligibility**
is **suspicious** of **thought**]{.underline}, [particularly of those
**artistic** **articulations** of **remembrance** and **lament** that
work to **undermine** otherwise invisible frameworks of **official**
**interpretation**.]{.underline} Of course, when data slams into the
human condition, the result is not only the swift eradication of
familiar landmarks in understanding the here, there, and everywhere of
social intelligibility, but the rapid rise to prominence of [new forms
of **figural** **art**]{.underline} -- mobile, augmented, remix, scanner
-- that in both form and content reflect the shape of the unfolding
future and, in that fatal reflection, [render that **future**
**uncertain** and **truly** **enigmatic**.]{.underline} And how could it
be otherwise when the earliest signs of the coming of the posthuman
allude to the surfacing of body futures that are multiple: sometimes
enhanced data bodies, but also bodies that have gone off-grid, bodies
colonized by mono-data, bodies circulating in the digital debris of
spam, spyware, viruses and contagions, and even twisted bodies caught in
the opposing energy flows of the seduction of connectivity and the
negation of relentless digital overexposure. [**Figural** **aesthetics**
is the **spectral** **eye** of the **posthuman**, that point where
**art** **enters** the **order** of **digital** **being** with such
**perceptual** **intensity** that it makes of itself a **mutating**
**sign** of the **collision** of **the** **code**, **the** **human**,
the android, the metallic, and perhaps even of the **digital**
**zombie**. **Art** of this]{.underline} (posthuman) [order **recodes**
the **question** of **aesthetics** by the **creation** of a mode of
**perception** that **fully** **opens** to the discontinuous, the
**fragmentary**, the **uncertain**, the **reversal**.]{.underline} [What
results is a form of figural art -- **posthuman** **art** -- that has
**no** **necessary** **medium** of expression precisely because it is
**always** an **art** **of** **the** **intersection**, the
incommensurable, **the** **bifurcation**, the broken code, **the**
**glitch** that **reveals** the **darkness** **within**, the static that
**reflects** the **passage** **of** **pure** **speed**. Art of **this**
**order** is a **haunting** **talisman** of the **posthuman**,
**neither** its **advent** **nor** **termination**, but a form of
**posthuman** **aesthetics** that can **never** **express** anything
external to itself because **figural** **art** **constitutes** in its
**essence** the **uncanny** **meaning** of the **posthuman** **moment**
-- fluid, mobile, folded, combinatorial, transitional.]{.underline}
Consequently, figural aesthetics is an art of motion but also an art of
inertia -- speed and slowness, noise and silence. With its strange
juxtapositions, unexpected folds, fluid intersections, figural art can
be so strangely familiar to us, the earliest inhabitants of the
technological posthuman, because it is an advance outrider of a new form
of perception that is already practiced on a daily basis but nowhere
fully culturally acknowledged. [While most certainly this **new**
**aesthetic** **language** seeks to describe what has happened to the
body]{.underline}, consciousness, labor, culture itself when folded
within the cyclotron of computation, [it also brings to the **surface**
the **deeper** **ethical** **concerns** of **society**: the **terrorism
of the code**, the revenge-taking of the failing master narratives, the
**injured** **sensibility** of **subject** narratives in rapid decline,
the **growing ressentiment** of the human at its **eclipse** by the
**technological** **posthuman**, the cynical relief of the abject human
at being **unburdened** of its **eschatological** **responsibility** for
being a **coherent** **species**]{.underline} being -- the fatal
embodiment of the will to technology. Lyotard\'s Driftworks announced
the opening themes of figural art: "Here is a course of action: harden,
worsen, accelerate decadence. [**Adopt** **the** **perspective of active
nihilism**, exceed the mere recognition -- be it depressive or admiring
-- of the **destruction** of all **values**.]{.underline} [Become more
and **more** **incredulous**. Push **decadence** **further** still and
accept, for instance, to **destroy** the **belief** in **truth** **under
all its forms**.]{.underline}" [Now that the **posthuman** **condition**
has revealed decadence -- **incredulous**, **excessive** **decadence**
-- as the **basic** **ontology** of **late** **capitalism**, the point
of a **figural art** that would "harden, worsen**, accelerate
decadence**" would be **precisely** the **reverse**, that is to say, it
would draw into a **greater visibility those intangible**, but very
real, **impulses** to **social** **solidarity** and **ethical**
**probity** that haunt the order of the real.]{.underline} So, then,
[**figural** **art** is always a **navigator** **of** **uncertainty**
because it **remains**]{.underline}, above all, [an **explorer**, a
**hinge**, a **fracture**, in the **midst of the data
storm.**]{.underline}

### L - 5G China

#### The 5G race with China is just an emerging cold (data) war intent on rendering subjects technological

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

[Alarmed by the resurgent global prominence of Huawei, a major privately
owned Chinese telecommunication corporation now leading the world with
its rapid deployment of a highly innovative, fast, and cheap 5G network
information platform]{.underline} -- the new network standard for speed,
fluidity, and flexibility in moving vast streams of data -- [the
suddenly challenged software empire of the United States has struck back
**hard and fast**, deploying not innovative technological solutions but
political stealth]{.underline}. At stake in this struggle between
Huawei, as a surrogate for Chinese strategic national ambitions to
quickly climb the economic value chain from low-wage mass manufacturing
to broad spectrum technological innovation, and the United States
government, as a surrogate for American network infrastructure companies
that find themselves stuck in the mud of suddenly eclipsed 4G
information systems, is the question, [**Who will code the digital
future**? Here, control of network technology involves powering up the
information bomb that is the digital future, putting down codes for
which economies, cultures, and politics matter and which will be
silently but no less relentlessly prohibited, excluded, and silenced. In
this scenario]{.underline}, California ideology -- the technological
vision of information technology Silicon Valley style, with its
concerted orchestration of actions between Silicon Valley and the
American national security state -- finds itself challenged by a rising
star on the previous digital periphery: Huawei, a company with a work
force of engineers and researchers based in the Pearl River Delta north
of Hong Kong. In digital reality, innovative code breakthroughs are
always restless, know no definite boundaries, and move from the
periphery to the centre at the speed of viral contagion; with this
struggle, [California ideology meets its first real challenge for
control of the digital future in the form of the nervous breakthrough
that is 5G at the coding hands of Pearl River ideology. **It is an
ideological struggle**]{.underline}. Just as much as California ideology
assumed a dominant global position in computer technology by first
silencing that other California counter-ideology, those hackers of
computers, politics, and art who dreamed of turning the magic of
information technology in the direction of digital justice, so too Pearl
River ideology runs parallel to the global ambitions of the Chinese
state, namely to demand respect for China, for its past history as well
as its present accomplishments, as an author of a future outside the
orbit of American political dominance. [So, then, it's a classic
struggle between massive trading blocks, each of which shades into
equally massive political empires. In this case, information is
political, and there is nothing more politically sovereign than control
over the **nervous system of global information
infrastructures**.]{.underline}

China understands this reality, which is why it has staked its long-term
political strategies on the new long march of codes. The United States
does as well, which is why it has laid down three challenges to
resurgent China. First, buried in the text of recent American tariffs
against Chinese imports are specific regulatory clauses aimed directly
at prohibiting the global adoption of Chinese computer infrastructure
products. China might aspire to climb the economic value chain, from
low-wage mass manufacturing for export to consumer markets to high-wage
technological enterprises, but the United States is clearly determined
to slow down, if not block entirely, this key code shift in Chinese
state planning. Just as in the Cold War with the Soviet Union, where the
United States swiftly put in place a policy of containment -- [the
global American-led international alliance against the spread of
communism -- as a way of limiting the spread of socialism, so too in the
now emerging **cold (data) war** with China, the first stage of digital
containment involves constructing an alliance of willing nations --
Japan, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and potentially Canada
and Britain -- officially committed to not deploying Chinese computer
infrastructure in government and military digital
installations]{.underline}. Perhaps to make the message clear or perhaps
just as a deliberate, secretive game between the digital masters of
"Five Eyes" -- the signal intelligence sharing agreements among five
countries, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and
Britain -- and enthusiasts for free trade with China, the arrest of the
Huawei's chief financial officer (CFO) for legal extradition to [justice
American-style marks the beginning of **overt hostilities** between
these two clashing digital powers, one resurgent, the other seemingly in
danger of being technologically eclipsed.]{.underline}

[In digital capitalism, network speed is everything. When information
moves at light speed with stock exchanges, media outlets, military
strategists, banking networks, and gambling sites responding real second
by real second to dips and flows of information and with everything to
be gained or lost by the ability of networks to do something about
it,]{.underline} then the speed, fluidity, and flexibility of network
technology is the essence of digital reality and most certainly the
nerve centre of the digital commodity form. Now, as always, new
relations of network communication necessarily render obsolescent old
forms of network technology. [In the **battleground of 5G technology**,
5G is the spearhead of the digital future, the new relation of network
communication assured of global sovereignty by the logic of capitalism
itself. Indeed, with strategies of technological innovation now more
decisive than tactics of military power in the games of empire,
information warfare fought code by code in the dark streets of network
infrastructures is how the **digital future will be won or lost**.
Consequently, the following early warning signals were issued from the
front page of the New York Times Sunday edition, where it was argued
that the United States is engaged in a renewed arms race "involving
technology rather than traditional weaponry" and that what is at stake
is the development of immensely powerful cyber weapons such as 5G, which
will, in effect, shape the future of the twenty-first century. Here, the
future is envisioned as powered by artificial intelligence (AI)
and]{.underline} deep machine learning with networks specifically
designed around the imperatives of "technological stacking" and
ubiquitous computing, creating continuous data flows among cities,
manufacturing production, and a supporting background structure of
autonomous cars and trucks, complex sensors, and self-directed robots.18
[Not just a future of autonomous weaponry but also increasingly
**autonomous (technological) life** is envisioned, with all of it moving
at the speed of 5G.]{.underline}

### L -- Capitalist Tech

#### The attempt to rid capitalism but attain technicity is a double-turn -- it allows the ruling class to attach itself to violent cybernetics in order to cement its power

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 141-142, March 2004, MG)

[The fate of the virtual class is inextricably tied to the knowledge
theory of value]{.underline}. As a class representing the leading
(theoretical) edge of the new economy, [the virtual class simultaneously
brings virtual knowledge into real (digital) material existence,
patenting its ownership rights, codifying its procedures of practical
(net) use, and recreating the world in terms of a three-tier virtual
architecture. At the same time that the virtual class is the
**self-realized form of the knowledge theory of value**, the very
existence of the virtual class is itself dependent on the actualization
of virtual knowledge]{.underline}. Simultaneously a decisive point of
the historical realization of virtual knowledge as well as its world
cypher, [the virtual class always occupies the dual position of (active)
creator and (passive) portal]{.underline}, explosive dynamic of the
digital future and servomechanism for consolidating the digital past.

But at the same moment that the virtual class materializes the knowledge
theory of value in terms of a radical remaking of every dimension of
existence in the direction of pure technicity, at the exact point that
the virtual class represents the real material realization of the will
to virtuality, at that specific historical juncture the virtual class
inserts into the brainware of the digital nervous system a fundamental
objective contradiction that has the effect of forcing the will to
virtuality to undergo a fatal oscillation of its wave-form. [Never a
class capable of being subordinated either to pure technological (use)
value or to relentlessly accumulative Capitalist (exchange) value, the
peculiarity of the virtual class is that it stands midway between
**technology and Capitalism**. It is the **inherently unstable** third
term mediating Capitalism and technology, sometimes their point of
reconciliation as expressed by the vanguard (networked) multinationals
of the new economy, at other times their moment of internal disturbance
as represented both by the speed with which new (electronic)
technologies undermine settled Capitalist formations and the discipline
with which the drive to economic profitability objectively limits
technological creativity. Always a dynamic mediation, always a restless
'going across' between the imperatives of technology and Capitalism, the
virtual class simultaneously represents the **cybernetic intelligence
necessary to realize the will to virtuality and its potentiality for a
fatal undermining**.]{.underline}

Between technology and Capitalism? That's the virtual class in its
purely aesthetic mode as a 'hinge' experience, [here **attaching itself
to established Capitalist formations as a way of gaining access to the
technological apparatus**, there practising a form of (cyber) monastic
self-discipline as it shrinks its collective technological imagination
down to the instrumental size of market-exchange. However, the virtual
class can never remain for long under the spell of a strictly Capitalist
determination because it is, first and foremost, as a virtual class the
historical embodiment of the will to virtuality. While necessity grafts
it to Capitalism, its own (technological) class imperative **forces it
to continuously upgrade itself to the advancing edge of the cybernetic
storm**. Always post-Capitalist, pure technicity destroys national
structures of Capitalism in favour of the virtualizing imperatives of
globalization. Always post-accumulative, the will to virtuality is
imminently disaccumulative, replacing the sign-form of Capital with the
value-form of technology and, thereby, reducing the laws of market
exchange to the **self-regulating discipline of
cybernicity**]{.underline}. Always post-market, the new economy is an
anti-market, replacing consumption with pure (financial) exchange,
market instrumentality with crowd contagion, the signs of a ruling
economy with the ruling economy of cultural fads. [Standing between
Capitalism and technology, the virtual class has split consciousness,
and in the growing consciousness of this split it is the difference that
simultaneously realizes the will to virtuality and derealizes the
virtualization of the will to technology]{.underline}

### L -- Drones

#### The will to [drone technology]{.underline} is driven from the attempt to control [space and time]{.underline} -- that emboldens [hyper-technocracy]{.underline} which create [lethal violence]{.underline} at the [symbolic exchange]{.underline} level

When the Sky Grew a Warlike Eye

More than ever, real [power in the twenty-first century is space
bound]{.underline} -- [**globalized**, **atmospheric**, and
**instantaneous**]{.underline}. It is not that time has disappeared but
that [the medium of time]{.underline} itself [has been everywhere
**reduced**, **reconfigured**, and **subordinated** to the language of
**spatialization**]{.underline}. That is the meaning of "real time" as
part of the contemporary language of power -- time itself as an
otherwise empty, locative coordinate in the spatial networks of
communication surrounding us. But if that is the case, [if]{.underline},
indeed, [power has taken to the air]{.underline}, literally taken flight
with the technological capacity provided by drones to turn the sky into
a warlike eye[, it would also indicate that the grasp of power on the
time of duration]{.underline}, the lived time of territorial and bodily
inscription, [has]{.underline} perhaps **[been terminally
weakened]{.underline}**. [When the sky has been transformed into a
liquid eye of power]{.underline} -- monitoring, watching, archiving
visual data for storage in distant archives -- [with target acquisition
and weaponized drone strikes as its military tools of choice, the
greater **complexity** and intricate **materialism of time** escapes its
grasp. Think]{.underline}, perhaps, [of a]{.underline} distant [future
when empires]{.underline}, following the usual cycle of rise and decay,
[crumble to dusty memories]{.underline}, [when a **collapsed social
economy** produces an angry mass of **dispossessed** citizens in the
otherwise empty streets, when even borders are abandoned in the global
rush for **scarce resources**, and when all that is likely to be left
may be those airborne fleets of now fully automated drones, long
forgotten by their ground command, but still, for all that, circling the
sky on the **hunt for humans.**]{.underline} [At that point, some
historian]{.underline} of the technological past [may well begin to
reflect on what exactly was released in the domestic atmosphere when the
drones came home]{.underline}. [Was it a technologically augmented
surveillance system under strict political supervision or something
different? Perhaps it was the giving of sky life to a new species of
being -- being drone -- with a score to settle against its human
inventors and, over time, the capabilities to do something about
it.]{.underline} [In this time]{.underline}, above all times, [a time in
which we can finally appreciate what is]{.underline} to be gained and
lost -- what is [**utopian** and]{.underline} what
**[dystopian]{.underline}** -- [concerning the technological devices we
have engineered into existence,]{.underline} [it may be well to remember
that the story of technology has never really lost its entanglement with
questions of **religion**, **mythology**, and **politics**.]{.underline}
Signs of the practical [entwinement of tech]{.underline}nology [and
mythology are everywhere now as **early warnings** of what is yet to
come]{.underline} -- namely, while the contemporary language of
technology might have excluded its origins in myths of nemesis and
hubris, what drone technology may actually deliver in the future as its
most terminal payload will be the return of mythic destiny as the
hauntology of the sublime order of technology. Consider, for example,
the following stories about the world of drone warfare: "Drone Swords
from the Sky," "Drone Kamikazes in the California Sun," and "Hydra
Awakened."

Drone Swords from the Sky

In these, the early dawn years of the twenty-first century, there seems
to be such an intimate connection between military drones and suicide
bombers: one aerial, the other bodily; one delivered from a distance,
the other proximate and local; one implemented by a sophisticated
telemetry of abstract orders of communication, the other executed by
someone who knows with certainty that they are about to die; one a
violent military tactic, the other sacrificial violence; one deadly
power from the sky, the other revenge grounded in the sights, smells,
feelings, and scenes of earth. [Perhaps we are dealing]{.underline} here
[with a closed theatre of power]{.underline}, [a violent circling of
power and resistance entangled at the rough edges of the aerial and the
bodily; militarized space and time for revenge; **hyper-technocracy**
from the air and **flesh**, **bone**, **blood**, and **memory** in the
streets; lightning flashes of targeted assassination from above and
equally gruesome attacks by bombs and knives on the ground; military
crusaders projecting power through the **language** of drone strikes;
fundamentalist political resistance marking the frontiers of its own
dreams of crusade on the assaulted bodies of its victims.]{.underline}
So then, we have drones with swords as possibly the newest variation of
the deep entanglement and slippery relationship between drone strikes
and suicide bombers. This idea, at least, is what I take from a media
report about the use of a new type of drone deployed by the United
States armed forces in Syria,1 equipped this time not with missiles
moving at shatter speed but with something dreamed up from the warrior
past, namely swords taking the form of fast spinning, lethal blades,
instantly shredding through the metal of the targeted car and the bodies
of its passengers. In this instance, it's a [technological suicide
attack from the surrounding sky, putting aside high impact explosives in
favour of a weapon, sword blades, taken right from the warrior culture
of the medieval Christian Crusades.]{.underline} In one sense, it's
predictable. [Clinical in their operational planning and strategic in
their **calculations of kill ratios** and **technological devices**,
military planners are always seeking advanced weaponry capable of
carrying out sudden attacks on targeted individuals that are as
**efficient in** their **lethal violence** as they are suitable to the
target at hand: nuclear weapons for mass extermination of civilian
populations, bunker busters for deep underground targets, high velocity
explosives for campaigns of **shock** and **awe**, cruise missiles for
ship-to-shore attacks, and now, added to the arsenal of contemporary
weaponry, a strange throwback to an earlier, medieval time of continuous
warfare in the Mideast -- crusaders with swords.]{.underline} From a
military strategist's perspective, designing the AGM-114R9X Hellfire
missile capable of flying 1,000 miles per hour with whirling sword
blades in the sky follows a cold-eyed calculus: what better way to avoid
the public relations problem of "collateral" crowd damage from
high-explosive drone strikes than to develop a drone that is as savage
in its violent effects as it is specific in its application of death by
blades shredding through targeted vehicles, slicing through the flesh
and bones of its occupants. A perfect model of the serial avenger, the
Hellfire drone is recombinant: warrior, stone cold killer, and flesh
butcher. Still, beyond its purely military usefulness as a weapon of
deadly force capable of being deployed in highly populated urban areas
with seemingly surgical precision, drone swords have a larger, and more
potent, symbolic significance. [If contemporary military crusades of the
West versus a supposedly always threatening Middle East have involved
fundamentalist Islamic warriors being acutely aware of constant
surveillance of their networks of electronic communication -- suddenly
going silent by avoiding cell phones, trusting only in face-to-face
communication, delivering messages by hand -- drones with swords respond
in kind. **Futurist weapon platforms**]{.underline} featuring intense
high-explosive missile blasts from hovering drones [are supplemented by
**revisiting** the past]{.underline}, namely crusader history with its
heavily armed knights and legions of warriors riding horses [and
equipping themselves for hard combat in the desert sands with swords,
spears, chain mail, and heavy maces]{.underline}. [This time, while the
sound of charging horses may have given way to the silence of fast
drones in the sky, drones with sword blades are unmistakable in their
**symbolic exchange.**]{.underline}

### L -- Generic

#### The will to emerging technologies amplifies the crisis of the real, pirates the body through a genetic matrix, harvests flesh, and turns bodies into predatory war machines

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",

[What is the future of digital reality? What is the consequence of the
fateful meeting of digital experience and biotech engineering? What is
the fate of the future itself when]{.underline}, as Paul Virilio argues
in Open Sky, [time and space as the deep horizon of our existence have
been accidented, have been radically derealized, into the dimensionless
void of 'space-light' and the real time, the instantaneous, global
networked time of light-time]{.underline}? After the mutation, the
galactic debris of local time and local space gets in our eyes, and
history [as a chronological succession of events collapses into random
events with mutable meanings]{.underline}. Or when reality suddenly
flips, and we are no longer living in hyper-reality, broken boundaries
moving at the speed of light, but just the opposite -- reversed into a
digital universe moving at the slow speed of light.

The Slow Speed of Light

Just in time for the twenty-first century, physicists have frozen, and
then actually stopped, a beam of light, thus instantly reversing one of
the threshold laws of physics and more importantly reversing the
hyper-speed of the culture of acceleration into slow optics, slow media,
slow light.

When light moves at 38 mph, decelerating from over 186,000 miles per
second, and then is suddenly frozen in its trajectory, hyper-reality
crashes under the accumulated weight of deceleration.

Crash optics for a time when light-time and light-space decelerate into
a sub-time and a sub-space where human perspective is suddenly faster
than the electronic transmission of the image.

Crash time when the slow speed of light, the slow speed of electronic
perspective, brings down to earth all those globalized vectors of
simulated time that had been launched into global media orbit during the
reign of the speed of light.

Crash space when the slow speed of light deflates all the trends to
globalization and real time into the slow time and the slow space of the
frozen local.

[This sudden and catastrophic deflation of the speed of light
**amplifies the crisis of the real**]{.underline}. The hyper-real was
based on the accidenting of bounded light and bounded space with the
disappearance of light and time into the 'real time' of virtual light
and virtual space. An aesthetic regime of signification based on the
speed of light. What happens now is the end of the hyperreal, and the
beginning of the sovereignty of the subreal. Light moving at the speed
of a car stalled in gridlock on a LA freeway in the noon sun. Light that
moves slower than the propagation of electronic images, and the
circulation of electronic sounds.

[A slow speed of light for a culture about to undergo a fast descent
into a vertiginous experience of pure virtuality: events spinning
outwards faster than their images; slow light as a form of retinal
persistence of the slow unfolding of past events; life imprisoned in
slow time and slow space and slow images and slow aesthetics.
Interminability as the dominant cultural sign of the twenty-first
century.]{.underline}

Firewire Eyes

Heidegger was correct. [Everything to this point has been preparatory,
an anticipation of a fundamental and radical technological event. A
decisive turning. **Until now, the will to technology has been on the
outside**, hovering around the body with its probes of seduction. It
invites the body to empty itself into wireless networks. It firewires
the eye to images recombinant. It **harvests flesh**. It whispers about
the speed of data flesh. It undermines the confidence of the body,
making it increasingly insecure about itself. It reconfigures the brain.
It **externalizes, ablates, and disappears flesh**: turning the organic
body inside out into an open-source scan portal for probing **media of
communication**. Until now, everything has been about the
exteriorization of the central nervous system.]{.underline}

[Not for much longer, though. The real implication of biological
determinism as the dominant discourse of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- the human genome project, [**nanotechnology**,
therapeutic cloning, **genetic engineering**, the convergence of
**artificial intelligence** and robotics]{.underline}, the dreams
delirious of designer genes, organ transplants and tissue replacements
for an improved posthuman sensorium -- is that [the body is about to
**pirated by the genetic matrix**.]{.underline}

[Pirated not once, but twice. First, **biotech** invades the body in the
name of good health, longer life, better learning, avoiding catastrophic
illnesses. It faciliates the disappearance of the body in the name of
its own improvement]{.underline}. It provides an automatic internal
surveillance system of the previously autonomous body from within its
own circulatory systems. [And then, biotech pirates the body away from
itself in the name of a perfect eugenics. Literally, the organic body is
about to be replaced, redesigned, and left behind as gene kill by
biotechnology acting as a **predatory war machine**]{.underline}. Read
the business pages of any newspaper. The final harvesting of data flesh
is the newest IPO. [This future is not for everyone. **Most will be left
behind as surplus flesh**. The genetic elite will pass over. Visions of
Gattica. Their children already have. They will be the leaders of the
new world order of the genetic matrix.]{.underline}

Heidegger said that to understand what is closest at hand sometimes we
have to travel furthest. So read the hermetic manuscripts of the desert
mothers and the desert fathers. And not just the ancients, the
Anchorites, but the desert thinkers of the biotech future: digital
artists. The visionaries of the biotech eye who have gone ahead by
travelling furthest to what is nearest to us: our bodies. Long dead
words blowing in the sand of caves in the deserts of North Africa or in
other deserted caves in the deserts of the digital vortex.

[That which is coming has long been predicted.]{.underline}

[That which will happen has long been prophesied.]{.underline}

[That which will disappear has long been lamented.]{.underline}

[That which will be dominant has long been feared.]{.underline}

[The twenty-first century is an age of tremulous technological destiny.
The future is **suspended in an electric shadowland of ambivalence**,
drifting between fascination and dread. Both tendencies necessary. Both
tendencies incomplete without their opposite. In biotechnology, a new
form of android life -- the final revelation of technology as a new form
of android life, a posthuman life substituting itself for the human
species, finally begins.]{.underline}

We are one of the last generations before something fundamentally new.
[The experiments have **already** begun.]{.underline}

#### The resolution attempts to impose a will to technological transcendence -- reading the myth of digital salvation in favor of AI, cyber, and biotech culminates in the transformation of life into data-made-flesh, imposing a violent psychic commitment onto subjectivities while rendering marginalized bodies as accidental road kill on the way to a technological future

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

#### \*Note -- this is the same card in the 1AC of the K-Aff

[Perhaps it's no longer simply a digital universe of blended minds but
something more generalized, namely blended bodies: emotions,
subjectivity, imagination, perception living in a world of data made
flesh. Like a technological makeover of the Christian Bible, which
begins with the words "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1--3), the
digital bible begins with the **translation of the spoken word of
divinity** into the **cold data of technological
platforms**]{.underline}. And, while the biblical story of the Word was
recorded in prophecies of the Old Testament and gospels of the New
Testament as the coming of the long-awaited messiah, for whose bodily
sacrifice humanity would be indebted from birth to an eschatological
debt that could never be repaid, [the digital bible substitutes
salvation by data, an epochal opportunity to shed the skin of the human
in favour of the soft skin of the digital. When the story of this
particular period in history is ultimately written, it will no doubt
focus on salvation by running the numbers -- **data made flesh** -- as
the animating impulse behind skinning the digital world with DIY bodies,
surveillance that never sleeps, **drone** skies, robotic
**cyber**-machines, singularity theory, **artificial intelligence**,
deep learning, and **biometric** sensors everywhere. Here, digital
devices are portals to the latest secular version of salvation, the
instant connectivity of smart phones a re-enactment of a religious state
of grace, **artificial intelligence a** **gateway to
transcendence**]{.underline}, globally synchronized emotion a mass
conversionary experience, [desiring to become a data object drifting in
the network a basic article of digital faith, and the fast streaming of
virtual life as so many triumphant hosannas to the moment of digital
redemption.]{.underline}

However, just like the story of Christianity before it, this newest
reenactment of the [myth of salvation in digital form has its competing
myths: one, **the myth of order**, is literally the attempt by power and
capital to channel the explosive energies released by network
connectivity into a new digital order maximizing political loyalty and
economic profit; and the other, **the myth of freedom**, is network
society pushed to its limits and beyond by a rising generation of
blended minds, data flesh, and virtual perception, particularly by the
generation of the young today moving at particle speed.]{.underline}

[If it is as true now as ever before that parasites are always quick to
the feast, that scavengers are often first to exploit the radically new,
the vulnerable, the tentative first beginning, then the story of
**technologies of the new real is no exception** to the historical
rule]{.underline}. No sooner did the new salvation myth of being digital
take hold in the twilight years of the twentieth century then it was
immediately hijacked by standing powers, effectively [streamed in the
direction of technological platforms as a new digital ordering of the
world. Politically panicked by the ability of fast-moving flows of data
to instantly overturn the earthbound world of national sovereignty,
landed citizenship, bounded economies, framed identities, and hardened
borders, power everywhere responded to the challenge by issuing its
**own counter-challenge**: constant, ubiquitous patterns of
surveillance, new **alliances between the national security state and
major technological platforms**, the gathering of biometric data taking
the form of social credit in China and contact tracing in the West,
always seeking to upload our digital shadow, patiently going through the
data trash we leave behind for its telling hints about our secret
motivations, hidden intentions, and questionable loyalties. Politics in
the wires, then, became a scavenger hunt in the data stream in the
interests of **preserving the power of the new status quo**. It is the
very same with digital capitalism. Unlike the sovereign state, which is
focused for purposes of its own survival on preserving sovereignty over
fixed, time-bound territory at a historical moment in which real power
has taken flight into the fluid, space-bound empires of the digital,
digital capitalism instantly shed its basis in territorially bound
bodies, manufacturing, and sales, striking out for the monetization of
the power of the flows of network society]{.underline}. That's been the
business history of the past few decades -- the violent abandonment of
blue-collar workers and their factory-based jobs in favour of the higher
exchange value of offshore labour without a permanent home;
**[transnational]{.underline}** trade **[agreements]{.underline}**
making possible cheap, exploited labour abroad and high-market
consumerism domestically linked together by the restless movement of
robotic cargo ships; and the shedding of traditional manufacturing by
putting down the digital hammer of business going online, either
becoming transnational, wrapping itself in fluid flows of circulating
capital, or not existing at all. That is the ascendant power of
contemporary technological platforms -- [this new era of digital
capitalism with its dynamic, here today/gone tomorrow face; its
technological platforms that place their fiscal bets on **bending the
myth of digital salvation** in the direction of killer apps, digital
fantasies, beautiful imaginaries of new social media, the everyday flux
of data made flesh]{.underline}. But having acquired unimaginable
corporate wealth by servicing network society, linking technological
platforms and willing subjects with digital devices, and thus [enabling
the global diffusion of digital reality, the economy is fated to ride
the whirlwind of the data storm. In the present social crisis, the most
striking expression of the new class reality of digital capitalism is
the radical split between ascendant finance capital in global stock
markets and very real economic distress in the streets]{.underline},
mass unemployment, degradation of social and health services, and that
most anguished barometer of [inner anxiety, despair, and hopelessness --
the opioid crisis. Here, the winning classes of digital capitalism --
the owners of technological platforms and their supporting technocratic
class -- take **economic flight into a golden future**; while the
**economic losers in the new digital order**]{.underline} -- blue-collar
workers abandoned with the destruction of manufacturing; many
white-collar workers soon to be [discarded as **accidental road kill**
on the way to a future of **artificial intelligence and robotics**; and
the permanently dispossessed, that is, the poor, the asylum-seeker, the
unwanted immigrant, the racially vulnerable, the ethnically
disenfranchised, the gender outlaw -- face devastation and a bleak
future]{.underline}. No less aggressive than the national security state
in its pursuit of data about its network subjects, [digital capitalism
actually propels itself forward by making intense, granular surveillance
of the consumption habits of its digital subjects a very exploitable
opportunity for massive capital accumulation in the form of relational
advertising]{.underline}, with every Facebook post enabling capitalist
exchange value, every Google search triggering a chain of capital
accumulation, every social media activity an addition to a very
marketable digital profile. [While digital reality may have been
inaugurated by all the conversionary enthusiasm, messianic commitment,
and utopian data visions brought together under the mythic sign of
digital salvation in the late twentieth century, this]{.underline}
twenty-first century, spiked by the technological platforms of
capitalism and power, has surely been marked by the eclipse of digital
utopia with the swift, [relentless channelling of that original
enthusiasm for life in the wires as salvation into new forms of digital
ordering, including the national security state and digital capitalism,
which, if they fail to possess the original intensity and dreams of
digital utopia, have the more prosaic, but seductive, quality of
stabilizing the flo]{.underline}w, isolating digital subjects within
familiar borders including national identity and property, [and
**channelling desire along all the programmed streams of power and
capital**]{.underline}**.** Here, the life-changing experience of being
digital as a religious epiphany is successfully replaced by the
pleasures, dreariness, and growing screen addiction of the new digital
bourgeoisie with its disciplinary state, austerity economy, and virtual
phantasmagoria. [After digital utopia, we now have stasis; after the
failed epiphany of digital salvation, we face the enduring reality of
taking our place, quietly and without a murmur of dissent, in the new
digital order.]{.underline}

[So the story goes, **until life begins again**. That is the
contemporary social crisis]{.underline}. Messianic visions of the
singularity moment may still have very real momentum as [the leading
contemporary edge of the myth of digital salvation]{.underline}. The
COVID-19 viral pandemic may have precipitated a great shakeout of the
last vestiges of the pre-digital economy, accelerating tendencies
already under way towards a new digital order typified by remote
communication, automation of the service industry, [a real world of
artificial intelligence and deep learning, and all of it tightly
controlled as the proprietary knowledge of technological
platforms]{.underline}. Nonetheless, the stability of the new digital
order and the seduction of life in the wires have been challenged by the
insurgency that is life in the streets today, with its scenes of surging
political protests from cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe
to rebellions by Hong Kong activists against new security laws
promulgated by the Chinese state. All the while, other conflicts, other
insurgencies based on race, class, gender, ethnicity, and national
difference, have broken out seemingly everywhere, effectively
challenging the sovereignty of closed digital borders with demands  --
some fundamentalist, some visionary  -- for reimagining a future
off-grid to powerful machineries of surveillance as well as to
technocratic digital platforms. [Power today might reside in effective
control over the **creation, programming, distribution, and policing of
algorithmic codes**, but still the sounds and sights of life are
palpably pushing up from below, sometimes allowing sunshine to burst
through cracks in the data shield or maybe bringing with them a bit of
cold, driving rain from the outside, hot energy from the streets falling
downwards, rising upwards, threatening to rupture the set-piece
framework of the new digital order with all the contingency,
indeterminacy, differences, and absolute solidarities and hostilities
that the human, now suddenly post-human, condition can
muster.]{.underline}

### L -- Military Cyber

#### The justification for militarizing cyberspace is a form of scapegoating intended on enabling the biometric subject, imposing a new global class structure on the world, and creating violence at the consciousness level

**[Militarizing Cyberspace]{.underline}**

In the dreamy 1990s, when the internet was first popularized, the ruling
meme was beautifully and evocatively utopian, with [that enduring desire
in the human imagination for a technology of communication that finally
matched the human desire for connectivity and (universal) community at
last finding its digital expression in networked communication. Few
voices were raised concerning the spectre of harsher realities to come,
namely the possibility that the internet was also a powerful vehicle for
sophisticated **new iterations of ideologies of control** as well as for
**inscribing a new global class structure on the world**.]{.underline}
To the suggestion that the destiny of the digital future was likely to
be the rapid development of a new ruling class, the virtual class,24
with its leading fragments, whether information specialists, from coders
to robotic researchers, or corporate visionaries closely linked --
nation by nation, continent by continent, industry by industry -- by a
common (technocratic) worldview and equally shared interests, just as
often responded that this idea was purely dystopian conjecture. As the
years since the official launch in 9/11 of the counter-revolution in
digital matters indicates, the original funding of the internet by DARPA
was truly premonitory, confirming in [the contemporary effective
militarization of the networked communication that the visionary idea of
developing a global form of network connectivity that harvested the most
intimate forms of individual consciousness on behalf of swelling
databanks was as brilliant in its military foresightedness as it was
chilling in its impact.]{.underline}

[The public rhetoric justifying this counter-revolution in digital
affairs is as threadbare as it is cynical]{.underline}. That, in fact,
seems to be the point. [When the increasingly phantasmagorical search
for scapegoats of the day finally ceases, whether through lack of
plausibility or declining public interest in the **necessity of public
justifications** for undermining the essentially modernist, and thus
residual, values of democracy, privacy, and law, a **greater reality
finally breaks to the surface of consciousness**, namely that the
digital future has already been hijacked by visions of power and class
riding the fast current of the (digitally) new.]{.underline}

[Perhaps what we are experiencing today are simply expressions of
absolute panic on the part of traditional institutions  -- nation-states
that have effectively **lost control** of their own sovereignty through
the porous, unbounded nature of digital communication. In this case,
political institutions based on the governance of territory are
objectively threatened by an information culture that undermines
traditional conceptions of political sovereignty by transforming the
always active subjects of the new world of social media into potentially
creative centres of social and political agency.]{.underline} Confronted
with this elemental conflict between the emancipatory possibilities of
fundamentally new relations of technological communication and old forms
of political control, [the controlling network of surveillance states
responds in a way that is as predictable as it is relentless, namely to
view domestic populations with their enhanced social media mobility as
**potential enemies of a state** whose phantasms of perfect security
increasingly come to focus on framing individuals as **biometric
subjects** whose every movement will be tracked, every communication
monitored, and every affect analysed for its pattern consistency. In
other words, old forms of control are now being reconfigured as the new
real.]{.underline}

[With this new real, we enter an unfolding future of biometric
surveillance as both predator and parasite: predator because it is
violently aggressive in its application of the political axiomatic of
the security state to domestic populations most of all; and parasite
because biometric surveillance functions by attaching itself to the full
sensory apparatus of biometric subjects. Biometric surveillance, then,
is the symptomatic sign of the emergence of a new order of power --
**cynical power**]{.underline}. Perfectly opaque in its purposes, random
in its flows, [wildly oscillating between the **projection of power
abroad** and **protestations of official innocence** in the
homeland]{.underline}, biometric surveillance power now has achieved a
state of fully realized cynicism. Like a floating sign that has
abandoned relations with its originating signifier, cynical power can be
so effective because it exceeds any limiting conditions. [Cynical power
thrives by actively generating conditions of chaos and lawlessness,
while, at the same time, it preserves itself by staking out positions
premised on moral righteousness and appeals to political
exceptionalism]{.underline}. Neither purely anarchic nor necessarily
constrained by law, cynical power is, in the end, how contemporary
technologies of mass surveillance express themselves politically. [Here,
power works by carefully staged strategies of impossibility, sometimes
functioning to create **generalized conditions of insecurity and fear**
within domestic populations while simultaneously justifying its use of
often invisible, unchronicled exceptional powers as **absolutely
necessary for securing the boundaries**, external and internal, of the
state]{.underline}. The required political formula for the inauguration
of cynical power and, consequently, the development of technologies of
cynical surveillance always seems to follow the same fourfold logic:
affectively, create conditions for emotional receptiveness within
targeted populations of fear and insecurity; strategically, actively
[deploy sophisticated technologies of surveillance without any limiting
conditions; morally, justify the use of intrusive surveillance
technologies by random appeals to threats of terrorism, whether foreign
enemies or domestic threats; and biologically, work to link surveillance
technologies with the creation of a new form of life required by a
society mediated by the bunker state, policing, and austerity, namely
the biometric subject.]{.underline}

Tripwires in Cryptography

Biometric Subjectivity

Who could or would have suspected that the much hoped-for utopia of
network communication would have terminated so quickly with a global
system of meticulously machined individual surveillance as automatic in
its data harvesting as it is strategic in its (individuated) target
acquisitioning? Combining parallel tendencies involving a
telecommunications sector invested in the sophisticated algorithms of
analytical advertising and increasingly technocratic governments driven
by a shared agenda of austerity economics, the bunker state, and the
disciplinary society, contemporary surveillance practices are perhaps
best understood as premonitory signs of the uncertain future. As we are
no longer limited to questions of individual privacy, reflecting upon
the question of surveillance discloses key tendencies involved in the
emerging world culture of capitalist technocracy with its complex
mediation of psychic residues from the past, social detritus from the
present, and the technologically enabled evacuation of human
subjectivity and, with it, the eclipse of the social as the dominant
pattern of the contemporary regime of political intelligibility.
Certainly not stable and definitely not guaranteed to endure, the
present situation is seemingly marked by a strange divergence of past
and future. [While the future has apparently been hijacked by a sudden
and vast extension of technological capabilities for network
surveillance and intrusion, the really existent world of contemporary
political reality is increasingly characterized by the appearance anew
of all the signs of unsettled ethnic disputes, persistent racism,
ancient religious rivalries, and class warfare endemic to primitive
capitalism.]{.underline} Consequently, while the technologically enabled
societies of the West are capable of being fully seduced by the ideology
of transhumanism with its dreams of coded flesh, process bodies, and
machine-friendly consciousness[, actual political reality reveals
something dramatically different, namely the greater complexity of
Eurasian ideology as the **new Russian political pastoral**, resurrected
images of a new Islamic caliphate, and, all the while, disaffected
children of affluent societies rallying to those enduring battle cries
of the alienated heart, whether religious fundamentalism, atavistic
politics, or direct action violence.]{.underline} Contrary to digital
expectations of a newly reconfigured, resplendently technical world of
globalized real time and real space, today's reality more closely
resembles a fundamental and decisive break between the categories of
technologically mediated space and historically determined time. For
every digitally augmented individual strolling the city streets with
Google Glass for eyes, buds for ears, Big Data for better ambient
awareness, and Snapchat for enhanced affectivity, [there's another
passionate struggle for human loyalties underway with its alternative
dreams of caliphates inscribed on the real earth of religious warfare,
revived **Russian imperial dreams of Eurasian mastery**, and always
those reportedly fifty million refugees wandering the skin of the
planet, sometimes policed in official shelters but usually effaced of
their humanity -- vulnerable, precarious, literally the forgotten
remainder living outside of digitally bound space and historically
inscribed time.]{.underline}

### L - Surveillance

#### Improving surveillance is a tool for the state to establish dominance over the population, militarize policing, and create racialized violence

**Kroker and Kroker 21 (**Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 54-58, October 2021, MG)

[When the symptomatic signs of fascism have displayed themselves,
triumphantly and without a hint of apology,]{.underline} at the highest
levels of American government -- [the redefinition of American cities as
a "battlespace";]{.underline} the denunciation of peaceful protesters as
terrorists; the militarization of police forces[; government
surveillance planes]{.underline} [overhead]{.underline} capturing cell
phone data of protesters; the imposition of curfews as part of a
generalized state of siege; [frequent occurrences of racialized violence
and active,]{.underline} violent suppression of civic dissent by batons,
tear gas, smoke canisters, rubber bullets, pepper balls, flash bangs,
helicopter, horses, and military vehicles  -- [then the question of
**surveillance** becomes a **storm centre of contemporary politics**.
Here, the role of surveillance as a powerful tool of the national
security state in identifying, tracking, archiving, and isolating
sources of democratic dissent quickly moves from the background to the
suddenly crystallized foreground of the gathering debate concerning
surveillance. If the self-proclaimed aim of this newly articulated
version of fascism is to establish "**dominance**" over the population
by the use of "overwhelming force" supplemented by the militarization of
policing, then a necessary tool in accelerating domination will be the
generation of **ubiquitous forms of surveillance** that would permit the
state to identify not only existent sources of popular dissent but also
to **anticipate, and thus suppress, the future of dissent itself**.
Today, surveillance never sleeps because power increasingly thinks of
its own domestic population in terms of a hostile insurgency
controllable only by "overwhelming force" and "domination." Of course,
not cowed by a surveillance apparatus acting at the behest of
"overwhelming force]{.underline}," witnesses to scenes of police
violence, protesters subjected to "domination," and observers of human
rights violations create a vibrant, critically engaged network of
counter-surveillance by mobile cameras that is as ubiquitous in its
instant diffusion across the mass media as it is effective in mobilizing
efforts towards political change. All the while, in this raging scene of
mass surveillance and popular counter-surveillance, [the triumph of
visual media culture, with its predictable rhetoric, carefully managed
narratives, and framed images, is instantly undercut by the **return of
oral culture**]{.underline}. As the political theorist David Cook notes,
"[Trump's use of Twitter is a form of oral culture that mesmerizes the
individual in short aphorisms, slogans and quick spells reducing book
culture which is too slow to compete. A culture that produces the
**vicious turtle**."2]{.underline}

[That the present is a dangerous moment in the decline of the United
States from an ongoing experiment in somehow reconciling representative
democracy at home and hegemonic imperialism abroad to domestic fascism
is intensified by the fusion of four crises appearing simultaneously in
American public life: an epidemiological crisis]{.underline} under the
viral sign of COVID-19; [an accelerating economic crisis]{.underline}
taking the form of mass unemployment and precarious wage-labour
aggravated by the pandemic; [a social crisis focused on **racialized
violence**]{.underline} and the deployment of militarized policing; [and
a cultural crisis in which the stakes are high, namely the life and
death question of whether or not the future of contemporary fascism will
take root in public opinion and, consequently, in the deep emotions that
**form private subjectivity**.]{.underline} Certainly, overstressed by
crises from without and depressed internally by feelings of anxiety,
panic, melancholy, and frustration, [it is only one small step for
**individual subjectivity** to seek shelter in the comforting rhetoric
of charismatic political leaders who strike the words of overwhelming
force and domination on the anvil of a bitterly divided
population]{.underline}. Or could it be the opposite? Perhaps it is not
an inexorable slide into an era of reactionary politics enforced by mass
surveillance and energized by a pervasive silent majority of white
privilege; perhaps something very different may arise, namely a
fundamental social rethinking of police violence, racialized power with
its apparatus of control focusing on mass surveillance, in the direction
of social justice, first in the streets and then in the homes, the
minds, and the workplaces of a growing majority disenchanted with the
status quo. Videos of racialized violence, then, become possible
gateways to insurgencies of social justice.

Trapped in the Bubble of Technology

What happens when the surveillance apparatus of the national security
state is met with counter-surveillance by its citizens? What takes place
when police violence, so often directed against people of colour, is
matched by a waiting network of real-time video cameras by people, young
and old, willing to be citizen journalists, willing to give witness? And
what is the future of "surveillance capitalism" itself when citizens,
increasingly aware of the granular intensity of network surveillance,
begin to go off-grid, campaign for stricter regulation of large
technological platforms, or dream of a reinvention of the internet
itself as a publicly accessible global forum of communication in which
issues of personal privacy are sacrosanct? What happens, that is, when
surveillance by algorithm, coding, and reverse-engineered screens and
mobile communications is finally brought out of the darkness of the
secrecy of technocratic proprietary knowledge into the bright
illumination of critical public debate? When surveillance is met with
counter-surveillance, when tracking by machine is matched with
counter-tracking by citizen journalists giving witness, what is the
future of the real world of surveillance?

[From a strictly political perspective, surveillance technologies are
effectively designed to function as faithful ideological representations
of the society from which they emerge and on behalf of which they are
tasked with protecting it from unexpected attacks, unplanned intrusions,
unanticipated threats, and potential new dangers. Consequently, if a
society such as the **United States --** the self-proclaimed leader of
the "free world" and the self-appointed moral guardian of
"exceptionalism" -- is both the leading model of hyper-capitalism as
well as the financial and political spearhead of an aggressive,
hegemonic global empire, its surveillance technologies will necessarily
be modelled on the preservation of a dynamic form of power, the
interests of which are truly global in their spatial extension and
complicated in their interaction with all the boundary conditions of
politics and commerce operating in real time. In this scenario,
surveillance needs to **constantly scale up its technological ability**
to track, by data harvesting, screens as cameras, and consumer household
devices, an always tumultuous world perceived by the masters of
hegemonic power as permanently insecure, perpetually replete with
unexpected threats, always repopulated by newly emergent political
oppositions.]{.underline} Ironically, with its heavy emphasis on the
surveillance of spatial extension, bringing the globe under the
microscope of advanced technologies, mass surveillance is often
blindsided by the slow moving waves of time itself. [For all its
harvesting of massive data flows]{.underline} and its algorithms for
pattern recognition, [mass surveillance, trapped in the bubble of
technology, often experiences difficulty in detecting those subtle
intersections at the heart of the real world, those unpredictable
collisions of **racialized violence, economic inequities, systemic
racism**, rising hostility to asylum seekers and refugees on the part of
white nationalists, sudden surfacing of **ancient ethnic hostilities**,
insurgent religious fundamentalisms, and counter-ideologies forming at
the]{.underline} edges, and sometimes at the [very centre, of
**empire**]{.underline}. Of course, if surveillance cannot escape the
bubble of technology, if, that is, surveillance technology cannot detect
subtle, but decisive, changes in history as time, then it is probably
doomed in advance to give witness to the future of its own empire in
ruins. [One sure and certain indicator that contemporary surveillance
technology has already entered its terminal state is the contemporary
scene of American politics, where the fabled "homeland" is suddenly
perceived by those in power as ideologically precarious, with citizens
feared as potentially insurgent, and where the American republic itself
is reframed as a **military "battlespace**." In this circumstance,
surveillance technologies previously justified as responses to potential
threats from outside the borders of the homeland turn inward, quickly
repurposed as powerful instruments of "overwhelming force" and
"domination." What was, in the recent past, a tacit state of affairs --
a very real, but unspoken alliance between the national security state
and technological platforms -- now surfaces as the necessary condition
for linking the algorithms of "**surveillance capitalism**" with
political control of the American battlespace.]{.underline} Here, the
machinery of surveillance is the tip of the spear of contemporary
politics. Alexa recording domestic conversations, browsers acting as
digital shadows, ubiquitous surveillance cameras in the streets, mobile
devices with their geo-tracking of travel and location, automatic
reading of licence plates, planes flying over protests in Lafayette
Square near the White House collecting digital data from the smartphones
of the citizen dissenters below -- all these take on a very different
meaning when not viewed simply in terms of capitalist accumulation but
of the politics of total domination with all the potential deleterious
political consequences that that implies.

### L - Space

#### The logic of space transcendence both obscures and is permeated by racialized violence -- the technological imaginary by these means ensures the domination of racial hierarchies

professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

SpaceX and a Burning Police Station

[Consider,]{.underline} for example, the deep irony of
[that]{.underline} media [day in late May 2020 when televised scenes of
a **burning police station** in Minneapolis, Minnesota, surrounded by
angry, grieving night-time crowds of protesting citizens illuminated
against a fiery background contrasted so sharply with]{.underline} that
other media event taking place at exactly the same time. Here,
[**SpaceX's launching of a manned space vessel** for a mission of
replenishment to the International Space Station]{.underline} was also
the key media event of that tragic day. [This time, though, the scene
was not burning cities but **fiery space launches**, not angry Black
Lives Matter witnesses on the streets but **breathless technological
hosannas** from media commentaries about SpaceX, and most certainly not
federal troops and National Guards with the presidential words of
authorization embedded in their minds -- "when the looting starts, the
shooting starts" -- but a resplendently arrayed demonstration of
American space force power]{.underline} prominently highlighted by
President Trump himself. [The empire might be in decline, streets may be
in riot, citizens of colour may have dissented against the policing of
white supremacy, but at this SpaceX moment in the history of the United
States, the illusion of **American hegemony in space**, if not in the
actual earth, was ready for a triumphant blast off, not to the stars of
deep space but to their orbiting token, the International Space
Station.]{.underline}

[But what happens when the smooth narrative of this **deep-space
moment** is broken by counter-surveillance,]{.underline} this time not
with a streamed video image or a cell phone shot but
counter-surveillance [by the power of imagination, by establishing
unspoken connections between the clashing events of that turbulent media
day in late May? What happens, that is, when counter-surveillance is
liberated from technological devices, becoming instead a new way of
critically seeing the world:]{.underline} making connections between
data feeds; [bringing into visibility the illegible remains of racial,
economic, and political inequalities]{.underline}; giving voice through
imagination to the silenced, the excluded, the prohibited? In this case,
if [the SpaceX launch can be such a **compelling display of the
technological imaginary** of a society permeated with the **logic of
racial hierarchy**]{.underline}, then what is the meaning of these
contrasting media images: [bursts of flames burning with the anger of
riots in the night, and spectral space launches by day? Are we
witnessing a fatal struggle between metaphor (SpaceX) and metonymy
(torched police station) in the contemporary American mind? And if, in
fact, the essential symbolic meaning of the SpaceX launch was that it
was a highly visible reminder that the animating energies of **America's
empire of technology**]{.underline} -- the spirit of instrumental
activism and the magic of a society infinitely adaptable to changing
economic circumstances -- [was about to be exported to the stars, what
symbolism was to be had in the burning remainders of that day, in the
charred embers of the police station and the angry crowds of protesters,
not projected towards a future in the stars but present in the remains
of the earthly night?]{.underline}

[We therefore have two sharply clashing media images: one about
astronauts travelling to a space station in the sky, the other depicting
those gathered in grief over a police murder in the streets. One image
is]{.underline} the [imaginative technological creation]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} Elon Musk, celebrated by American media for his
[enthusiastic spearheading of the power of **positive (technological)
thinking**]{.underline} -- a model of the much-cherished business myth
of the entrepreneurial spirit, an evangelist of technological futurism
who has managed to successfully launch himself beyond the bitter racial
politics of South Africa to the more friendly, experimental, and
supposedly racially antiseptic digital terrain of west coast America;
[the other is]{.underline} the product of the persistence of that most
fundamental of all clashes in the heart of contemporary America [-- rage
against racialized violence]{.underline} and the very real persistence
of an ideology of white supremacy launched historically from the ruins
of the Civil War to take root seemingly everywhere in the language of
the everyday: in jobs, housing, health, security, prisons, and
policing[. Are we witnessing here the rise of the uncanny in American
thought: dreams of technological redemption from above, revolt against
racialized violence from below?]{.underline}

Surveillance technology closes its eyes of digital perception when
actually confronted with the complicated intersections of social
history. There is no digital cloud, no information flow, no pattern
analysis, no determinate data, no harvested archive of behavioural
histories that would enable understanding of the strange paradox of days
of rage in the streets and technological utopia in all the launch pads
of deep-space futurism. [But if the apparatus of mass surveillance is
bereft of the saving power of vision, it does not mean there is not much
to be learned from that sad day in May when the real world of racialized
social reality crossed paths with dreams of **technological
transcendence**. When mass surveillance falls silent]{.underline}
concerning the really existent drivers of the unexpected, the
unpredictable, the unsecured -- unchecked aggression in police uniform;
the persistence of white male rage; the contemporary political reality
of panic, fear, anxiety, and melancholy; the stubborn continuation of
patterns of racial inequality, class disparity, and gender
discrimination [-- it is fated to be marginalized as a predictor of the
future, as an intimation, that is, of the likely consequences of a
society where technology moves at the speed of escape velocity while the
lives of Black people and people of colour remain stuck in the
**inertial weight of social oppression**.]{.underline}

Consequently, two very different futures of surveillance are presented:
one, the shared product of the national security state and corporate
technological platforms that consistently "see" the world only through
digital algorithms that are deterritorialized, decontextualized, and
dehistorized; the other, the insurgent creation of citizen journalists
committed to the deeply ethical practice of giving moral witness to
social injustice -- a form of critically engaged media practice that has
the effect of providing images of a world that power would prefer to
prohibit from witness, an invisible world of the silenced, excluded,
oppressed, and abused. While the former is about control, the latter
concerns taking back the streets of imagination, the alleyways of life
lived in the full spirit of multiplicity. [While mass surveillance
reduces society to the codes of digital inscription, the algorithmically
knowable, and the data detectable, counter-surveillance is always about
the immeasurable, the off-grid undetectable, the strangeness of the
unknown, the immense, radiating power, creativity, and courage of those
living under the punishing sign of social invisibility]{.underline}. Two
worlds materialize: fast data and slow bodies; technologically enabled
mass surveillance and humanly enacted counter-surveillance; monitored
bodies treated as data trash and bodies struggling in the streets of
power, with brutal streaming video evidence of the real meaning of abuse
value everywhere. [A future is envisioned of data archives, quantum
surveillance, embedded sensors, and the ever-expanding network of the
"**Five Eyes**" in a contemporary political situation that intimates so
forebodingly that this future is also tangled up with very real
violence.]{.underline} Having witnessed so often and in so many places
the deployment of surveillance technologies for purposes of overwhelming
state power, we find the issues that haunt any discussion of
surveillance today concern the ultimate uses of information gathered,
the alliance between data and domination, often resulting in
unaccountable policing, whether of the imagination or bodies -- the
targeting of peaceful protesters, increased mass incarceration, and
pre-emptive sabotage of democratic dissent. [Hence, we have capitalism
under surveillance, power under suspicion, and media distrusted as the
essence of a future now shaded by the clashing horizons of
counter-surveillance by citizen activists and mass surveillance by
always watching Big Brother algorithms.]{.underline}

#### The will to control space culminates in the vivisectioning of the code of life itself and permanent species annihilation 

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 7-10, March 2004, MG)

[With this, the age of Artificial War has begun]{.underline}. In its
manifesto for the future of cyber-war, Vision 2020 (www.af.mil/vision/),
the newly created [United States Space Command theorizes a future
battlefield of '**full spectrum dominance**.' Abandoning the earth-bound
dimensions of land, sea, air, USSPACECOM projects a new era of
artificial war in which the battlefield occurs in the '**fourth
dimension' of space**. Befitting a 'spacefaring nation' such as the
United States, third-dimensional warfare is surpassed by a vision of
future war]{.underline} in which 'battle managers' are, in essence,
computerized editing systems running on automatic, absorbing fluctuating
data fields concerning attacks and responses, monitoring satellite
transmissions from twenty thousand miles in deep space, sequencing
missile launches, [integrating 'dominant maneuvers' in space with
'precision engagement' on the ground, sea, and air, providing
'full-dimensional protection' to 'core national assets' and 'focusing
logistics' for a virtual battlefield that stretches into an indefinite
future]{.underline}. As USSPACECOM theorizes, the control of the seas in
defence of commercial economic interests and the war of the western
lands in defence of the expansion of the American (technological) empire
to the shores of California has now migrated to a war for the 'control
of space.' Consequently, [a future of artificial warfare in which
**space itself is weaponized**. Fourth Dimensional warfare is the
technical language by which the American empire now projects itself into
a future of Artificial War: a fourthdimensional rhetoric of 'global
engagement,' 'full-force integration,' 'global partnerships,' weaponized
space stations, **tracking satellites**, reusable missile launchers, and
on-line, real-time remotely controlled anti-missile
systems.]{.underline}

[I emphasize this story because it is revelatory of the meaning of the
will to technology. Here, technology not only is the chosen aim of
technological instrumentality (weaponizing space), but also involves
technologies of mythology]{.underline} (the well-rehearsed story of the
unfolding American frontier where wagon trains evolve into Predator
Drones, and sea-faring navies migrate into space-bound automated
battlefield manager systems), [technologies of thinking (the fourfold
'tactics' of space war: dominant manoeuvre, precision engagement,
full-dimensional protection, focused logistics), and technologies of
(aggressive) judgment]{.underline} ('multinational corporations' are
also listed in Vision 2020 as potential 'enemies' of USSPACECOM).

More than futurist military doctrine for the twenty-first century,
Vision 2020 [represents the essence of the will to technology. Here,
technology is both a space-faring means to the successful prosecution of
artificial warfare and its sustaining ethical justification. The will to
technology folds back on itself -- a closed and self-validating universe
of thinking, willing, judging, and destining -- that brooks no earthly
opposition because **it is a will, and nothing** else. As Nietzsche
reflected in advance: 'it is a will to nothingness]{.underline}.' Or, as
Hannah Arendt eloquently argues in her last book, The Life of the Mind,
'the famous power of negation inherent in the Will and conceived as the
motor of history (not only in Marx but also, by implication, already in
Hegel) is an annihilating force that could just as well result in a
process of annihilation as of Infinite Progress.'1 Could it be that the
world-historical movement captured by the military logic of Vision 2020
-- this command vision of America as the historical spearhead of the
will to technology -- repre-sents that which is probably unthinkable but
consequently very plausible, a contemporary expression of the
metaphysics of 'not-being'? [If '**permanent annihilation'** is the
sustaining (military) creed of Vision 2020, then this also indicates
that the world-historical movement, which it so powerfully strategizes,
is driven onwards by the seduction of negation, another suicide note on
the way to the weaponizing of space.]{.underline}

Consequently, if the American novelist Don DeLillo can write so
eloquently in his recent essay, 'In the Ruins of the Future,' that
'technology is our fate, our truth,' this also implies that in linking
its fate with the 'truth of technology,' the United States, and by
implication the culture of globalization, may have, however
inadvertently, infected its deepest political logic with the will to
nihilism[. In the sometimes utopian, always militaristic, language of
technological experimentalism, 'Not-being' finally becomes a
world-historical project. Those who are only passive bystanders to the
unfolding destiny of the contemporary American descendants of the
Puritan founders can only look on with amazement coupled with distress
as the 'American project' embraces not only the weaponizing of space but
also **genetic experimentation** with the question of evolution
itself.]{.underline} While DeLillo goes on to say that technology 'is
what we mean when we call ourselves a superpower,'2 his pragmatism sells
short the point he really wants to make: namely, that by linking its
fate, its truth, with the question of technology the United States has
also enduringly enucleated itself within the larger historical, indeed
if USSPACECOM is to be believed, post-historical, project of technology.
Enucleated not as something other than the technological destiny which
is its profession of faith, of truth, but enucleated in the more
classical sense of the term, of being somehow interior to the unfolding
destiny of the will to technology. The larger cultural consequence of
this bold act of willing remains deeply enigmatic. In this case, is the
will to technology an intensification of the pragmatic spirit upon which
the American experiment was founded? Or has [the will to technology, at
the very moment of its historical self-realization, already reversed its
course, becoming its own negation: Arendt's prophecy of 'not-being' as a
'process of annihilation'? On the ultimate resolution of this question
depends the American fate, the American truth, as the spearhead of
technology.]{.underline}

On the public evidence, what makes the American project truly distinct
today is its enthusiastic abandonment of the pragmatic will for the
uncharted metaphysical territory of 'not-being.' [The will to the
conquest of empty spatialization and the **vivisectioning of the code of
life** **itself** has about it the negative energy of suicidal nihilism.
Here, the language of 'not-being' -- the desiccating logic of what
Heidegger memorably termed 'Nothingness nothings' as the historical form
of the technological project of 'permanent annihilation' -- expresses
itself vividly in two master commands: Space Command and Genetic
Command. The first operates in the language of weaponized astrophysics
where the curvature of space is manipulated for strategic purposes, and
the other sequences the human genetic code itself. Thus, **control of
space is inextricably linked with control of time.** The dynamic will to
technology projects itself doubly in the macrophysics of a 'space-faring
nation' and the microphysics of a body-faring cellular
biology.]{.underline} This is a collective demonstration of hubris that
Greeks in the classical age would only admire, and then fear, for its
(technical) audacity and stunning (metaphysical) innocence.

Ironically, at the very instance that USSPACECOM projects an imperialist
military future of 'full-spectrum dominance,' [9/11 occurs and we are
suddenly time-shifted into the age of viral terrorism. Similar to the
incommensurability of technology itself where the reality of
'**permanent annihilation'** is sometimes offset by other ways of
thinking technology, the human imagination does not begin, cannot begin,
with tactics of 'dominant manoeuvre' and 'precision engagement' and
'fulldimensional protection' and 'focused logistics,' but with the
terrorist side of fluid, earth-bound, real material
warfare.]{.underline}

### L - Transhumanism

#### The transhumanist vision only culminates in the suspending of life and the locking in of the human into the solitary experience of death

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

Toronto Press, Pages 51-52, October 2021, MG)

[Consequently, while we can be aware that the "power of connections" is
swiftly delivering us to a future capable of producing quantified
fetuses and password-protected bodies, what remains unclear is the
ultimate cultural, and perhaps even **existential**, impact of the
triumph of the transhuman]{.underline}. Considered in terms other than
dystopia or utopia, is it possible that such [adventures in
transhumanism -- powered by **visions of technological rapture** and the
singularity event,]{.underline} practically implemented by the
quantified self movement, and replete with experiments in vivisectioning
neural circuitry by synthetic biologists -- [are fundamentally changing
the meaning of **life and death** for the human species as a whole?
Perhaps it's not a future of technological rapture but an indefinite
period of **suspended animation** in which the human species, as a life
form kept waiting for the singularity event that may or may not ever
arrive, makes its final, feverish preparations for a fateful
crossing-over point between machines and humans, yet not wanting to be
untethered from digital prosthetics and definitely not anticipating that
very real crossing-over point -- the **always solitary experience of
death** -- without helpful technologies wrapping themselves around the
"soft and curvy" matter of the body organic as it
terminates.]{.underline}

There is a revealing report in the New Scientist about a new emergency
technique in suspended animation ("Gunshot Victims to Be Suspended
between Life and Death")31 that bears directly on larger issues related
to technology, culture, and life itself. The story recounts how surgeons
at a Pittsburgh hospital are now experimenting in suspended animation
for victims of traumatic injuries -- by guns, knives, or blunt
objects -- as a way of stopping blood loss, thus gaining bodily time in
order that their lives can later be saved by the necessary medical
interventions. One surgeon is quoted as saying: "[We are **suspending
life**, but we don't like to call it that because it sounds like science
fiction. So we call it emergency preservation and
resuscitation]{.underline}."32 The technological procedure used in this
trial is straightforward: once the aorta has been clamped, a solution of
saline is pumped "through the heart and up to the brain," and the
patient's temperature is reduced, with the result that "at this point
they will have no blood in their body, no breathing, and no brain
activity. They will be clinically dead."33 Hopefully, though, they are
not dead for long, since after the necessary surgical interventions,
blood is flushed through the body, the saline solution purged, and the
patient's body warmed up by its own circulating blood, with this
(redemptive) medical conclusion: "We've always assumed you can't bring
back the dead. But it's a matter of when you pickle the cells."34

[Now, while this story is an intriguing one concerning the truly liminal
boundaries between life and death, it may also be a **preliminary
glimpse** of the fate of the human species generally]{.underline} and
the DIY body specifically, as it is flushed with a saline solution of
synthetic technologies, its key organs clamped shut with
password-protected apps, its body temperature definitely cooled down by
increasingly antiseptic loops of cold code, and [its neural circuitry
placed in a state of suspended animation waiting for resuscitation by
technological rapture.]{.underline} While medicine, like all of science
before it, cannot in the end overcome the finality of human mortality,
[the greater ambition of contemporary technology, particularly in its
transhumanist expression, is captured perfectly by the surgeon's insight
into the **decidability** of previously undecidable matters of life and
death]{.underline}: "It's a matter of when you pickle the cells."35

Hydra Reawakened Seemingly everywhere now, [military visions are
**resurgent** about weaponizing the oceans deep, about ensuring that
advanced weapon systems are "**proficient**" in the blue waters of ocean
depths, about gaining full military possession of the watery
underworld]{.underline}.6 [Is it possible that]{.underline} classical
[Greek mythology will finally find its practical realization in
contemporary history by way of advanced military
innovation?]{.underline} [That]{.underline}, at least, [is the hope of
the US navy]{.underline}, as [evidenced by the **DARPA solicitation**
for innovative design proposals for a program named Hydra]{.underline},
[which is aimed at creating permanent, unmanned underwater platforms in
all the oceans of the world, populated by drones within
drones]{.underline}. Media reports include enthusiastic accounts of
"underwater drones deploying drones," "underwater drone carriers" for
conquering the seven seas, and unmanned platforms for quick insertion of
equally unmanned "air and underwater vehicles into operational
environments." Here, [the **limits of nature are disappeared** with
rapturous speculation about US drone warfare moving from the sky to
water, from surveillance from above to drone strikes from beneath deep
water, shallow water, even from "river deltas or systems.]{.underline}"7
[Drones within drones, upward falling payloads, an unmanned undersea
system: the future of drone warfare as envisioned by DARPA migrates the
question of the unmanned from its previous station in targeted aerial
surveillance to the depths of the seven seas.]{.underline} Here, it is
no longer flocks of drones hovering in the sky, but something else --
[unmanned, underwater motherships equipped with drones within drones,
some as troop transports, others as transport vehicles for armaments and
supplies, all lying in wait, just offshore, just under the seas, waiting
to instantly respond to **insurrections**, **rebellions**,
**disturbances**.]{.underline} While, from one viewpoint, [this vision
of repurposing the oceans for drone warfare provides another example of
technological hubris combined with the US military's proclaimed
ideological commitment to "**global projection of power**," from another
perspective, it also contains a Heideggerian aporia.]{.underline} For
Heidegger, the [mobilization of the seven seas on behalf of a global
system of command and control is part of the **technical drive** towards
**reducing nature and humanity** to the status of the "standing
reserve"8 -- the seven seas held in reserve, that is, for an innovative
process of technological ordering with its "upwardly falling payloads,"
"drones within drones," and "underwater drone carriers."]{.underline}9
However, there's one difference: almost as if perfectly symptomatic of
profound, nagging anxiety about the eventual failure of the project in
the face of a greater, as yet unknown, force, [the very mythic name of
the Hydra program announces in advance the most critical weakness of the
initiative.]{.underline} After all, [in classical Greek mythology, the
figure of Hydra, this "serpent-like monster with two heads,"10 evokes a
larger mythological fable that is replete with moral complexity and
martial ambiguity.]{.underline} Mythically, the Hydra is always figured
in relation to Heracles, the heroic representative of fallen divinity,
who, in order to win back his immortality after killing his own wife and
children, is forced to undertake twelve difficult labours, involving,
among others, slaying the Nemean lion and capturing the Erymanthian
boar, the Cretan bull, and Cerberus, with its three heads of a wild dog,
tail of a dragon, and snakes emerging from its back. Yet, perhaps the
most challenging of Heracles's tasks was overcoming the monstrous figure
of the Hydra, who, with its ability to effortlessly regrow many new
heads, guarded the swamps of Lerna, beneath which lay the entrance to
the underworld.11 [The mythic force of the Hydra has to do with
representing a fierce entanglement that only grows more difficult and
complex with any and all attempts to overcome it.]{.underline} In the
end, the Hydra was ultimately defeated by Heracles's brilliant tactic of
cauterizing the severed heads one by one, thus eliminating the flow of
blood and the generation of new heads. [The lesson of the myth is that
the Hydra, this watery defender of the underworld, is as weak as it is
ferocious, an obstacle that can be overcome in practice by a skilled,
creative, and courageous warrior such as Heracles.]{.underline}
[Consequently, while the US military's Hydra program may well culminate
in interesting designs for an underwater world populated by drones
within drones, it offers no solution to the real problem, which is, in
its essence, mythological -- the always certain appearance of
counter-power, of counter-resistance to sovereign claims of "ownership
of the undersea domain" in the form of the new Heracles: a heroic figure
-- perhaps from the present, perhaps from the future -- with a name of
no importance and from a country of no significance, who can only win
back political immortality by overcoming the new Hydra of the underwater
drone.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [while the resolution of the problem
of Heracles might have been left in suspension by an act of
technological indifference, naming a project Hydra has about it all the
signs of mythic necessity, posing a challenge to the sleeping powers of
the long-neglected pagan gods of classical antiquity.]{.underline} Known
now by the continuous appearance of the mythic signs of necessity,
nemesis, hubris, and revenge, [the spirits of those pagan gods have
never really been at a distant remove from the technological scene and
certainly have never been anything less than the essence, particularly
if unrecognized, of political experience.]{.underline} While minds more
attentive to the continuing mediation of the language of the pagan gods
and the spectacular drives of technological hubris might enter a word of
caution against carelessly conjuring up the forgotten spirit of the gods
(particularly by formally inscribing their sacred names in the
chronicles of contemporary history), it must be admitted that part of
the unfolding truth of the most brash of the newest post-human gods --
the language of technological mastery -- is to issue a challenge to the
death against the gods of classical antiquity. Who knows really whether
the power of Zeus, the jealous love of Hera, or the remorse of Heracles
have heard the voice of this newest pretender to divinity? [Like the
original Hydra, this drone project sets out to **guard the entrance to
the underworld**, no longer under the mythological swamps of Lerna, but
within the watery labyrinth of the seven seas. Like the Hydra of
classical mythology, this daring military innovation uses precisely the
same tactic to **propagate drones within drones** -- **heads within
heads** -- **as a way of guarding itself against an enemy seeking to
sever the only head of a multiplicity of heads that counts -- the
single, undetectable head of the Hydra that is immortal**.]{.underline}
Of course, in the transition from classical mythology to the new real of
drone technology, the contemporary Hydra, lacking any plausible
pretensions to immortality, begins the game of war with an immediate
disadvantage. Now [we know from the military's call for proposals that
the underwater drone project is intended to operate in the real-time
environment common to both the contemporary moment and, it should be
noted, classical antiquity -- insurrections, rebellions, civil strife,
revenge-seeking suicide missions. Like the immortal Hydra, the
underwater drone platform lies in wait, thus ceasing to be so much an
instrument of **spatial domination** of the skies as a lethal weapon
willing to engage temporally those who are courageous or perhaps foolish
enough to gain entry to the underground. A **time-biased tech**nology
operating in the liquid environment of the seven seas, this newest
iteration of the myth of Hydra knows only that its weaponry of choice
must, of necessity, be that of **deception**, **subterfuge**, and
**secrecy**. Hiding in the depths of the oceans, revealing itself only
when engaged in **aggressive military strikes**, the drones within
drones that are the essence of the Hydra program adopt the **language of
temporality** as their own: a waiting game of infinite patience with
**secret locations**, **illusions of identity**, and **hidden
purposes**.]{.underline} [While drones hovering in the clear blue sky
might communicate a message of terror by their very appearance, drones
secreted within the seven seas communicate a different order of meaning
altogether. Hydra is on the move again, with oceans bristling with
**hidden weaponry** as the new deep blue sky of drone
warfare.]{.underline}

### L -- US Tech Dominance

#### American technology is run on technological flesh and the will to technology -- the US' tech dominance ensures communicative war

**Kroker and Kroker 96** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Hacking the Future: Stories for the Flesh Eating
90s", New Worlds Perspectives Montreal, Pages 8-12, 1996, MG)

[Most societies desperately try to immunize themselves against the blast
of digital technology]{.underline}. The European Community freeze-dries
culture in museums, sometimes transforming whole cities into walking,
talking theme parks. The Canadian Government specializes in creating
circuit-breakers (regulatory structures) to stop the flow of digital
technology. Telephones, 'banks, and insurance companies: that's the
Canadian beaver pond, and like all tranquil pools, the point is to stop
the flow of escaping water. Which is strange because Canadians
themselves are digital beings: born with modems in their pockets, chips
for heads, pixels for eyes, with satellites on their minds, 3D
accelerators on their feet for speed travel across the multi-graphical
interfaces of the Net in their flesh, WEB personalities, and deep space
radio telemetry as nervous systems. [Being digital is being Canadian
because Canadians see themselves as improved Americans.]{.underline}

[Improved Americans? Americans are different. They actually tear down
immunity defenses in order to feel the raw pleasure that comes from the
hit of the digital dynamo when it puts its hooks into human flesh.
McLuhan was thinking of Americans when he said: "How are you to argue
with people who insist on **sticking their heads in the invisible teeth
of technology**, calling the whole thing freedom?"]{.underline} But,
then again, what else are you going to do if you want to be razor sharp?

[From the outside looking in, America seems deceptively simple. Aliens
wonder how this nation of jocks, Christian barbecue suburbanites, and
Hollywood actor politicians, and rappers and rockers and drug dealers
and armed-to-the-assault-rifle teeth wilderness fundamentalists, not
only got a world empire, but actually managed to keep it. With a mixture
of contempt and envy, the world gazes into the looking-glass of America
and sees only a **clown's face toting a Saturday Night Special**.
Condescendingly they declare:]{.underline} "We see with clearer eyes and
better brains and, after all, we have history on our side. [We should be
America."]{.underline}

A restless nation of transients who cut their Oedipal ties to Europe
with a political revolution, America began with no history before the
age of progress. 'No Immunity" is the battlecry of a people who like
their identity strong. Every American louder than life summer tourist
strolling on a foreign beach can seem so relaxed on the surface because
the internal codes are coiled so tight and learned so well at such an
early age.

Shucking off talk of a social contract or a divine right of kings and
spitting on the noblesse oblige of "civilizational discourse,"
[**American identity is technology**. And we don't mean technology as
prosthetics or technology as a servomechanism of the struggling inner
self, but two-fingered tech, make that straight up and no ice please.
Like a chip factory running flat out, the American self plops off the
electronic conveyor-belt with wired flesh.]{.underline}

The age of science might have slowly come to maturity in Europe, beating
its head against the drag-me-down fetters of feudal aristocracy and
deeply ingrained religious prejudice, but in America science gets a
green card, and is waved right past Ellis Island on a fast pass to
everywhere. Here, [all the insurrectionary codes of the scientific
method - reification of nature, objectification of the body, radical
experimentalism of thought, of action, of desire -just slip out of the
dry pages of the philosophical tomes and flesh-net themselves into that
quantum marvel of the New World: the'American self.' Nobody can teach
Americans anything about the real lessons of science and technology.
Scratch an American and you'll find a relativity theorist, a brilliant
textbook example in the guise of a stockbroker, suburbanite, or New Age
rural retreatist of a living, breathing dynamic
field-event]{.underline}. Margaret Atwood must have been thinking of
Americans when she said: 'I'm a site where action happens." No wonder
Americans look so relaxed. Like brownian motion, they can bubble away on
the effervescent surface because the reaction-formations lie deep and
lie strong in the test-tube of the American self. Or, as one American
software designer responded when asked whether or not it was true that
[the United States had committed itself fully to the will to
technology]{.underline}: "Sounds right, [I guess we're just wired that
way."]{.underline}

[**Tech flesh: that's the secret of the American algorithm**.
1]{.underline}

PUTTING DOWN CODE IN THE USA

[The American Algorithm? That's America as the Operating System for
global culture at the beginning of the 3rd millennium]{.underline}. Some
countries specialize in technological hardware,: others in digital
wetware: but America produces software for contemporary culture. Not
just computer software - [America creates the key technological codes
that drive world culture, economy, and society. When the American
algorithm is reprogrammed]{.underline}, shifting, for example, from the
technological liberalism of the early Clinton Administration to the
conservative fundamentalism of Gingrich's "Contract with America," [then
the world doesn't just sneeze, it immediately gets digitally updated
with the newest generation of the American code. The **techno-optimism
of liberal futurism** is dumped into the trash, and the world bunkers
down for a lean and mean period as technoculture is
reorganized]{.underline} around the politics of rationalization and
Spencerian economics. In the American vernacular, this means that
stories about digital reality now move directly from the business pages
to the front page of the daily newspaper. What's online in the business
pages is what's coded, or about to be coded, in the American mind. By
the mid-gas, American business actively and overtly makes foreign
policy, for example, separating trade issues from human rights, that is,
torture from profit. Technobusiness likes to say that trade encourages
the possibility of human rights by opening up alien societies to
external contact. What they never mention is that trade also
[legitimizes and, in most cases, prolongs torture governments. But then,
in America technology, particularly technobusiness, rules. The first
software code of America is that technology is life, and, consequently,
that **being technology is the American mind**.]{.underline}

MICROAMERICA

As the software that provides system-operating codes for global culture,
[America powers up the 21st century]{.underline}. When McLuhan said that
America is the world environment, he is to be taken literally. Tech
hardware may provide external prosthetics for the digital addiction, and
tech wetware may interface the body and the Net, but software is the
distributive intelligence that authors the system. Just ask IBM, whose
mainframe hardware monoliths were like digital dinosaurs crashing around
wired culture, supposedly impervious to challenge, just before Bill's
cyber-gates opened up, releasing software raptors into the feeding
chain. The rest is virtual history.

In the late 20th century, software is the power principle. And it is
here that Americans have a special advantage. Unlike other countries
which approach writing software as a learned technical skill, Americans
take to software like a cookout and fireworks on the 4th of July.
Writing software is actually like writing out in code what it means to
be an American. American software genius lies in coding, decoding, and
recoding. Authoring both Operating Systems- and Terminal Systems logic,
America jams the extremes together, and pushes ahead with the
difference. That difference is what's called "reinventing America," and
"renewing America." There is a lot left behind when America spurts ahead
with every turn of the (software) wheel, but that's alright[. A
fundamental tenet of American citizenship is that nothing should stand
in the way of the will to technology. Safety nets can be j provided,
therapy classes can be mandated for those unable, or unwilling, to cope
with rapid technological change, and anti-anxiety/drugs can be
distributed to the rest.]{.underline}

[The- basis of American identity is the **will to
technology**.]{.underline} Only Americans have been courageous, or
maniacal, enough to pay the price for the coming to be of virtual
reality. They are Nietzsche's experimental subjects who transform
themselves into nutcrackers of the soul, objects of conscience and body
vivisectioning. They can be observed from a distance by Asians,
Europeans and Canadians with a mixture of adulation, scorn and feelings
of cultural superiority, but not without a lingering sense of deep
admiration and awe for these Kings and Queens of the virtual kingdom.

[America is the most aestheticized country in the world: Not aesthetics
in the melancholic fin-de-siecle sense or the modernist sense of
splitting high art from popular culture, but the American Homepage as
all about interfacing digital technology and popular culture to
produce]{.underline} Web identity, [tech culture]{.underline}, virtual
economy, and recombinant politics. What late 19th century sociologists
called "collective consciousness" has been transformed j in virtual
America into "Web consciousness." Being Digital means knowing your
tecematic place on the American Homepage, and \~believing, really
believing, in the utopian possibility of reinventing your destiny by
hypertext technology. Canadians might have the luxury of viewing
communications as a work of high art, but [Americans don't wear cultural
blinkers: **communications is war**.]{.underline}

### Slow Life Alt

#### Digital innocence is gone, the only move left to play is to engage in slow life, a form of terminal unpredictability that prevents algorithmic overcoding

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 67-70, October 2021, MG)

[There is **no longer** digital innocence in the unfolding future of
fast surveillance]{.underline}. We know by long immersion in the real
world of digital reality that [we are **always** being tracked,
monitored, archived, and evaluated -- prodded, probed, and
seduced]{.underline} -- and, in response, we have sometimes become
brilliant avatars of new counter-surveillance strategies. Consider the
messianic, all-consuming interest of the rising digital generation of
pre-teens and teenagers who have already opted out of the traditional
role of passive recipients of mass media, becoming instead active,
creative, deeply absorbed participants in the new digital worlds of
TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram, fascinated in the past by the
image repertoire of Vine, knowing Snapchat and Instagram by (digital)
heart, always pressuring the system to move faster, produce more novelty
in imaging, provide new video production breakthroughs, create magical
apps for linking the multiplicity of imaginations that we all are,
develop technological platforms that match the speed of digital desire.
Here, all the smartphones and play stations of social media are no
longer simply digital devices for facilitating communication but
creative gateways to improved digital perception. And sometimes, just
sometimes, as in the case of K-pop fans, better digital perception
combines with an abiding, affective desire for social justice, instantly
remaking digital streaming into politics of the street resurgent on the
net.

[In response, powered by AI, motivated by dreams of deep learning, and
enabled by algorithms focused on understanding patterns of consumer
interest, the image system is forced to run at hyper-speed, responding
in real time to the fickleness of human perception, compelled to support
a frictionless environment, always anxious about unexpected drops in
human attention, quickly panicked by instant changes of state whereby
rapt attention to the entertainment apparatus suddenly and with no
warning shifts suddenly into absolute indifference]{.underline}. In this
version of the digital cloud that is fast surveillance, surveillance
tracks, absorbs, stores, and sells data accumulated from the global
communities of users to a waiting web of online advertisers, while all
the databases of the national security state relentlessly acquire
information about digital subjects that will prove indispensable
whenever power decides to pounce. But, in this ongoing game of
seduction  -- challenge and counter-challenge  -- the emerging digital
generation practices counter-surveillance of the system as well, making
demands for better performance, drifting in and out of attention,
sometimes going off-grid as a way of escaping the information dragnet,
always read to spin away instantly, restlessly shifting from one
previously popular digital gateway to another. [To the system's
compulsion for technological perfection, the new digital generation
responds **only** with greater bursts of **perceptual creativity**,
brilliant fickleness, inspiring capriciousness, and critically engaged
**media immersion**. To the system's demand for technological order,
algorithmic **predictability**, and deep learning, the new digital
generation sometimes responds by suddenly going dark, being
**unpredictable**, digitally agnostic, always drifting, dumping one app
for another without cautionary warnings and certainly without displays
of gratitude for past digital services]{.underline}. To the system's
political demand for loyalty monitored by all the very best of the
hidden smartphone cameras, microphones, and data archiving that the
national security state can afford, the digital generation has a
sure-fire response, namely that [surveillance, fast or slow, can
**never** detect the bitterness of the human heart, hear the anger of a
body always offline, and thus undetectable, to its online simulacrum,
and that, in any event, patterns of past digital behaviour are
definitely **never predictive** of the complicated desires, complex
behaviours, and contradictory choices of consciousness moving at the
speed of light. Fast surveillance is always forced to play catch-up with
the digital drift of slow imagination, slow desire, and slow bodies.
Fast surveillance is always undermined by slow life, by life moving at
the slow speed of earthly experience framed by the unmarked markers, the
**uncoded signs of race, class, gender, ethnicity, and
sexuality**.]{.underline}

[Confronted by the fickleness of desire, the **unpredictability** **of
imagination**, and the intransigence of the individual human spirit, the
gamers of surveillance attempt to better position the system for the
future by going quantum, by making surveillance an all-enveloping cloud
that surrounds us, that becomes a hyper-reality in itself, absorbing
massive streams of data, moving at high velocity, and always
flickering,]{.underline} sometimes wearing the mask of an entertainment
app, at other times attaching itself to the ear, eye, and mouth in the
form of a smartphone, and at still other times [playing the role of the
all-watching, all-monitoring hectoring superego of the national security
state.]{.underline}

Contrary to received opinion that feared the age of quantum surveillance
would mean the end of individual privacy, the opposite has already
turned out to be the case. From one perspective, [the surveillance
system has always experienced **great difficulty** in making sense of
individual behaviour for the simple reason that past action may not
necessarily be **predictive of future behaviour**,]{.underline} that
data mining knows nothing of the rich interiority of human passions,
that data is not intention, and that [people reveal themselves digitally
as they usually do in the flesh: beautiful mixtures of **chaos and
order**, complicated wishes, and neon dreams, black and white choices
with lots of ambivalence and second guessing in between.]{.underline}
Besides[, the crisis of vulnerability]{.underline} that [sticks like
digital glue to all contemporary technological systems is that the
latter only function in data space and time: not the embedded world of
lived time but the **hyper-world of virtual time**; not materially
embodied space but the hyper-space of digital reality. Outside the
overcoded, overproduced, hyperventilated, speeded up world of
technological perfectionism, outside the perfectly hygienic,
algorithmically coordinated, machine-readable world of AI, deep
learning, and quantum computing, the technological system is
**absolutely vulnerable** in its blindness. It cannot hear the
complicated sounds of hidden, obscure human intentions. It cannot see
the motivating anxieties of human passion. It cannot understand the rise
of anger, resentment, fear, rage, and revenge-seeking as the **great
existential crises** of the twenty-first century. Even within the
closed, wired, shuttered world of digital perfectionism, the algorithms
are noteworthy for their strange mixture of technical smarts and
emotional dullness. For]{.underline} example, consider the challenged
behaviour of Netflix algorithms as they try to anticipate and accurately
predict what films users might like based on past choices, not realizing
the magnitudes of capriciousness, fickleness, and creativity contained
in the question of choice where, in fact, what makes humans human is
that they are not usually content with being repeat-repeat machines;
they will always work to subvert themselves by being digitally perverse,
unpredictable, unframed, uncoded, [with consciousness often energized by
unconsciousness of the self.]{.underline}

#### The system requires human life in the codes -- reversing that collapses its power

**Kroker and Kroker 21 (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 70-71, October 2021, MG)**

In an embodied, material world, where we often live the future as past
with the present as a specious moment thrown in between, and where
curiosity typically trumps repetition and the emotional swirl of passion
and desire always take precedence over hygienic logic, w[hat's a digital
algorithm to do? While it is the master of a system of surveillance that
has already broken beyond the classical model of physics and gone
quantum in terms of fast information processing, the technological
system is itself drifting **further and further away** from the enduring
complexities and complications of the human condition. In an epoch where
questions of race, class, religion, gender, and ethnicity have become,
in very real time, the existential cloud of the world we inhabit,
sometimes peacefully but increasingly with spasms of bitter political
divisions, religious zealotry, and incipient class struggle, the
surveillance system has literally nothing to say. It performs
**analytics, not complicated understanding**. It runs the numbers, not
the politics of the street. It profiles without interpretation, tracks
without understanding, archives without complexity, records without
seeing, stores information without knowledge. Fascinated with all the
pathos, ruins, and wasted data of the past, it usually has nothing to
say about the splendours and terror of the future.]{.underline} Outside
the closed field of data, fast surveillance is emotionally
dysfunctional. It follows digital footprints and sometimes even manages
to translate those footprints into larger patterns of movement by all
the digital tribes of the world, but it is oblivious to face-to-face
conversations, since those who seek privacy increasingly go offline, as
much as it is myopic on the question of concealed human intentions and
torn-up human hearts. [The system may run fast at the speed of subatomic
particles, machine readability, and algorithmic logic, but its fatal
flaw as a surveillance system is that it **only works effectively in the
data field**. Slip the codes, unlink from data, go off-grid, turn
attention to that conflicted, turbulent, invested world that is the
individual human life or even the life of a nation, clan, tribe, empire,
or caliphate, and the system of surveillance suddenly runs on empty. It
requires **human addiction to life in the codes** to be effective. It
literally needs life outside the wires to be eliminated in order to
function successfully as an effective surveillance system.]{.underline}
Which is why, of course, surveillance now rushes headlong at the speed
of quantum computing towards an electronic cloud that surrounds us,
saturates us, and does not let in any social sunshine, racial distress,
or existential rain. In order to function smoothly, fast surveillance
ultimately requires the impossible -- machine-readable populations,
scrubbed-down hygienic subjectivity carefully sequestered within
hardened data borderlands, with an army of menacing drones for the
remainder of the powerless, disavowed, excluded populations outside the
new digital cities, nations, and empires of the future. [Against this
dream of technological perfectibility stands, of course, the
counter-evidence of K-pop fans and "Whiteout Wednesday" as a very
visible, very readable sign of brilliant unpredictability of human
empathy, the fabulous unreadability of K-pop fans taking down racist
hashtags by (digital) day and night.]{.underline}

### Retreat to the Shadows Alt

#### The alternative is to cast a shadow over the affirmative -- only one that is split from its electronic double can refuse human suffering and temporal exile

[Bodies always have their **shadowy**]{.underline}
**[doubles]{.underline}**: definitely not in the darkness of the night
when the sun falls below the earthly horizon and is replaced by the
different cycles of the moon, but [in the clarity of a sunny day and,
with it, the often unnoticed splitting of the world into bodies and
their accompanying shadows. Consciousness of this ancient story of
bodily shadows, with its premonitions of a **fatal instability** in the
accepted framework of the real, has sometimes led to strangely
interesting mythic possibilities: cinematic scenes of **rebellious
shadows** that suddenly **refuse their preordained role of
subordination** to the governing signifier of the body in favour of
striking out on their own -- shadows without bodies; or, just the
reverse, bodies stripped of shadows -- possessed bodies that clearly
mark their break from the terrestrial register of the human by their
astonishing failure to **cast a shadow** no matter how intense the
flares of the sun.]{.underline}

We mention this strange contortion in the story of the body and its
shadow as a way of drawing into a greater illumination those new
electronic shadows that accompany the emergence of digital bodies.
[Every critique of contemporary surveillance has made much of the fact
that the digital body always leaves electronic traces, that there is no
activity in the wired world that does not accumulate clouds of data, no
form of net connectivity that escapes electronic notice, and
consequently, no digital self that does not possess its very own
electronic shadow.]{.underline} In all the discussion by intelligence
agencies concerning tactics of mass surveillance, whether upstream
(harvesting data from compliant telecommunication companies) or
downstream (tapping fibre optic cables), constant emphasis is focused on
creating individual profiles based on a (digital) self's "pattern of
life." [In other words, mass surveillance is also about an **aesthetic
act of drawing into visibility** those electronic shadows that silently
and invisibly accompany the digital self. Here is a clear sign that,
with the emergence of the real-time and networked space of the digital,
we have decisively moved beyond the limitations of the daily cycles of
the sun and moon, as electronic shadows require no galactic movements of
planets and the stars for their appearance. Never disappearing with the
darkness, never changing their early shape with the angle of the sun,
electronic shadows always **rise to meet the digital self**. Triggered
by connectivity, governed by codes, archived in databanks, tabulated by
power, the electronic shadow cast by the digital self will, in the end,
outlast its human remainder. A future history, then, emerges of
electronic shadows of data that cling to the human bodies that activate
them but, for all that, remain at one remove from their earthly
origins.]{.underline}

[The result is inevitable]{.underline}: just as novelists, short story
writers, poets, and cinematographers have always suspected in their
creative fables of bodies without shadows and outlaw shadows that refuse
any bodily presence, [the unfolding story of electronic shadows is
**inherently unstable**. It takes an immense regime of technocratic
intelligibility to maintain tight, disciplined cohesion between digital
bodies and their electronic shadows. The many cases of mistaken
(digital) identity indicate perhaps a more primary confusion in
electronic shadowland that point where electronic shadows sometimes
exchange bodily identities, slipping immediately beyond the boundaries
of one bodily tag to another with the least apparent difference. And
sometimes, too, **electronic shadows actually get lost** -- flash drives
are misplaced or stolen, databanks suddenly shut down, power shortages
introduce often imperceptible breaks in the data symmetry necessary for
cohesive electronic shadows. In this case, to the extent that mass
surveillance is probably less about earthly bodies than the electronic
shadows cast by the "pattern of life," that pattern of life already has
about it a **fatal catachresis**, an accumulating pattern of errors that
may speak more, in the end, to the truth of a **system already seemingly
out of control**.]{.underline}

[Still, for all that, electronic shadows sometimes contain traces of
**blood and human suffering**. As much a sign of prohibition as
affirmation, a signifier of exclusion as well as inclusion, a code of
disavowal as much as avowal, electronic shadows are an enduring sign of
the traditional meaning of surveillance, namely vigilance concerning who
belongs and who does not belong to the political community.]{.underline}
Inscribed with data memories, always sleepless, clinging to the digital
self like a cloud that will not disperse, [electronic shadows precede
actual bodily presence,]{.underline} signalling in advance whether the
gated sensors of the state should impede or facilitate our passage. For
those bodies chosen to be impeded, it is their electronic shadow that
first betrays them to flights of rendition, [life lived within the
domestic penal cage of security certificates, forced deportation,
indefinite detention, or the limbo of being held stateless at all the
border stations of the world. When surveillance assumes the ghostly form
of an electronic shadow, bodily presence is in **permanent exile from
time and space**, prematurely cut off from that indispensable demand
that marks the beginning, again and again, of individual singularity as
much as human solitude, namely the ability to not account fully for its
actions, intentions, or desires.]{.underline}

### K-Pop Alt

#### The future will be saturated with surveillance -- endorse K-Pop as a model to prevent the prediction of the unpredictable

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

Fast Surveillance: K-pop and Whiteout Wednesday

I'm at the inaugural K-pop concert in Toronto and just loving every
moment. Going against the cultural grain, it's not convened at a cool
music emporium in the evening hours when moon magic and the spirits of
darkness so beautifully refract the spirit of song, dance, and enchanted
musicians, but in that most unmusical of places, the Toronto Convention
Centre, in the dead centre of business downtown and in bright morning
sunshine, starting office worker early and closing before the evening
hours really start to stir. [Now, I had read all the grumbling critiques
of K-pop, this intentionally market-streamed, manufactured series of
designer bands emerging from South Korea and, like other popular
cultural phenomena before it -- manufactured cars, cosmetics, and
fashions -- sweeping the globe with a gathering, mesmerizing energy, its
mostly young fans, teens and pre-teens, united by the power of social
media in intense discussions of what's up in the always shifting, always
changing world of K-pop.]{.underline} And it didn't help that the
business architecture of the Toronto Convention Centre lived up to its
name -- concrete drab, cave-like vast, with lots of dead space overhead
just weighing down any signs of life from the crowds below. But [nothing
prepared me for the magic of K-pop and the animating, charismatic energy
of its thousands of young fans that day.]{.underline} Four stages were
set up, some for fabulous performances of dance, song, and intricately
choreographed movements by bands as a whole and sometimes by breakout
individual performers; and some for instruction in the flesh liturgy of
the K-pop performance: stage-worthy dance instructors giving lessons in
K-pop bodily moves; cosmeticians with accompanying tools of the trade --
mascara brushes, glitter, eyebrow tweezers, lipstick lush -- providing
lessons concerning how to create the K-pop performance body. As one
cosmetic instructor said to appreciative fans, "[you can **never have
enough glitter** for a great K-pop performance]{.underline}." On the
side, vendors were selling K-pop merchandise directly out of suitcases,
with CDs disguised to look just like best-seller dystopian novels,
shirts with band names, and everywhere the sounds and sights of the
sprawling K-pop empire of passion and delight. [Here, the traditional
distinction between performer and audience was reversed, with the
audience very much a powerful performance element in its own right.
Young dancing bodies broke out of the audience at K-pop dance lessons to
display brilliant dance improvisations of their own creation; fan faces
everywhere matched the chill cool of their bodily appearances to
professional instructions from the stage; and just everywhere K-pop
performances were instantly paralleled, and sometimes preceded, by the
singing and dancing of fans who, from long and deep embeddedness in
social media, knew every story, every band drama, every song, every
move. I thought I was attending a K-pop concert in Toronto, but what I
was really experiencing was the **musical Woodstock** of a newly rising
generation of the young, the peaceful, the loving, with a communal
feeling just so strong, so passionate in its idealism for dreams of a
better world.]{.underline} As my granddaughter Claire Surat said when I
mentioned before the concert that K-pop had the cynical feel of a
manufactured product, "well, doesn't it depend on what they are
manufacturing?" She was absolutely correct in her lucid intelligence[.
After twelve hours in K-pop heaven, with thousands of fans screaming,
fabulous dancing, and so peaceful, so beautiful enactments of the power
of band performances ]{.underline}-- Kard, The Rose, Zion/P, Veri
Veri -- [I dropped my set critique and went over to the side of the
enchanted, the hopeful, the dreamers. Later in the year, it came as no
surprise to me that K-pop's global community of young fans made a
**truly decisive intervention** in the anti-racist rallies that swept
the world after the police murder of George Floyd -- not by tokens of
the moralized good will, but by flooding the hashtags "White Lives
Matter" and "Whiteout Wednesday" to shut down flows of racist twitters.8
When the leading K-pop band, BTS, announced that it was donating one
million dollars to anti-racism causes, young fans immediately took up
the challenge and matched this donation by crowd-source funding in
twenty-four hours.]{.underline}

[Here, then, is the question: **What's surveillance in this new age
of**]{.underline} the energizing idealism of [**K-pop** fans and the
racist tweets of "Whiteout Wednesday"? How do you track, record, and
archive the beautiful rhythms of a global fan base congregating for an
instant in crowding out racist hashtags? And, for that matter, how do
you do surveillance of a hating heart? What happens when K-pop fans are
doing their own surveillance, moving swiftly and seamlessly between
K-pop drama on stage and creatively activist politics in the (digital)
streets? How does mass surveillance keep up with the speed of
counter-surveillance? **How does it predict the unpredictable**? How
does it anticipate the spontaneous, the immediate, the decisive? How
does surveillance capture the paradox of global fan loyalty to a style
of Korean music performance that has been described as "manufacturing
humans" to those very same fans demonstrating by their political
activism the most profoundly humane of all qualities -- empathy,
critical engagement, storming the digital barricades of racist
hashtags?]{.underline}

[If contemporary technological society is a prototype of the future
integrating individuals into a machine-readable world of AI, quantum
computing, and deep learning, then that future will surely be one
**saturated with surveillance** -- soft, vaporous like a data cloud,
omnipresent, operating at the periphery of attention, everywhere
facilitating our integration into a machine-readable world but also
sometimes menacing, probing, tracking, evaluative, perfectly
probabilistic -- remembering our digital past and anticipating pathways
we are likely to take on the digital road ahead. This future, the future
of a technological society intent on securing the final links between
bodies and machines, will be one of surveillance moving very, very fast.
Everything today is preparatory to that future. In a world of fast
surveillance, surveillance practices -- political, economic, social, and
cultural -- will form the omnipresent background noise of life in the
wires  -- ubiquitous, smooth, sometimes helpful, at other times
**sinister** -- functioning like a **flickering signifier** that seeks
to mould itself to digital behaviour]{.underline}, to machine read the
varieties of digital experience in order to facilitate opportunities but
also to steer the digital experience in certain directions. The prime
marker of all information societies of the future, fast surveillance is
information moving at such speed and intensity that it becomes the
electronic cloud that surrounds us, seduces us, facilitates our every
action, [and evaluates our behaviour]{.underline}, always archiving,
remembering, managing us, [and using algorithms for making probability
judgments on which way our perception and behaviour are likely to spin
in the future.]{.underline}

Perfectly transversal, moving at the speed and granular intensity of
deep learning, [**artificial intelligence**, and]{.underline} quantum
computing, [fast surveillance always exists in two opposite states at
the same time  -- noise and signal, wave and particle, facilitating
creative opportunities, taking command of the direction of digital life.
In the new world of fast surveillance, we become the **elementary matter
of surveillance**  -- human qubits -- floating in the cloud of
surveillance that surrounds us]{.underline}. Never stationary, the cloud
of surveillance has spin, like an electron around an atom -- sometimes
centripetal operating at the periphery of attention, at other times
centrifugal like a surveillance state under the sign of Orwell's
dystopian vision of the future  -- patiently recording our every action,
carefully parsing the meaning of our past behaviour for probability
judgments on our digital choices for the future, always prompting us to
pay attention, [carefully sorting us into the **threatening and
non-threatening**, lurker and creative participant, citizens loyal and
not loyal, customers satisfied or dissatisfied, consumers attentive or
indifferent.]{.underline}

#### Art Alt

#### Endorse art as fugitive thought -- an uninterpreted sign that is simultaneously a method and an end to the present crisis of technological culture

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 65-67, March 2004, MG)

[Art as **fugitive thought**, withdrawing into what withdraws, only
vital to the extent that it stays within this draft, this current. More
than a probe, art is an '**uninterpreted sign**,' a pointer, a
direction, that works to unconceal that which lies hidden in the essence
of technology.]{.underline} While Heidegger reflects on Hölderlin's hymn
'Mnemosyne' [('We are a sign that is not read / We feel no pain, we
almost have / Lost our tongue in foreign lands')50]{.underline} as a
reflection of the enigma of thinking, he might well have been speaking
of [art, too, as a fugitive '**sign that is not read'** maintaining
itself in the drift of that which withdraws. Against the current of
speed culture, the essence of new media art lies in reversing the
technological field: an art of (electronic) slowness, an art of digital
dirt, an art of boredom. A creative intensity, fugitive art would 'lose
its tongue in foreign lands,' becoming the essence of technology with
such enigmatic force that the doubled languages of calculation and
meditation, appropriation and revelation brush against one another in
their passing orbits, creating a third eye of technology: an eye of art
that driftworks with the current as it moves forward into the past of
that which lies concealed in the language of the technological
dynamo.]{.underline}

[Is art, then, the pathway opened up, simultaneously **a method and an
end**, by our present transition to the completed stage of metaphysics?
And, if this is so, then is the language of art itself the hidden
essence of technology,]{.underline} the lost poeisis that since the time
of the tragic revolt of Greek rationalism against the original fluxus
poets that were the preSocratics -- Empodocles, Heraclitus, and
Aristophanes -- [has been banished from the ruling vocabulary of
'enframing'?]{.underline} In thinking technol- ogy through the medium of
art, in meditating upon the new economy through the optics of new media
art, do we, however inadvertently, stumble upon a forgotten fissure in
the origins of the work of technology? [A radical split between techne
and art, between 'enframing' and a drift aesthetics that is, at once,
**the source of the present crisis of technological culture and its
possible moment of redress**. To reflect on the issue of technology and
art is to be drawn into the essence of the 'danger' and the
saving-power.' A 'rift' that brings together opposing tendencies into
its common outline]{.underline}, Heidegger's perspective was that [art
is a 'primal strife' that, in its most intense aesthetic moments, is
enigmatic because it conceals and unconceals, is sometimes true because
it is always untruth.]{.underline} Certainly art is poetry in its
essence, but a poetry that dwells in many regions where [**fugitive
thought takes shelter from the storm: in writing**, architecture, music,
video, computer graphics, multi-media art, performance art, dance, and
sometimes even as an art of networked life.]{.underline}

[It is due to art's poetic essence that, in the midst of beings, art
breaks open an open place, in whose openness everything is other than
usual.51]{.underline}

The Future Was Yesterday

Now, thinking thoughts fugitive about Heidegger's vision of art, and, to
be honest, not yet convinced that the politics of perfect control that
is the digital nervous system can be counteracted by art, particularly
when new media art itself is under such pressure to reduce itself to an
object of technical consciousness, I took my thinking for a stroll along
Pier 39 on the SF waterfront. I knew this was very uncool: a
hypertourist zone in a city that prides itself on pretending that
tourists are only a phantom presence. A city that Kathy Acker once
described as a place of 'pooled energy.' But there's something about
Pier 39 that is quintessentially end of the continent. Maybe it's the
simple fact that the railway to the Pacific literally ends here, or that
it's an improvisational free space in which there congregate, like a
daily holy mass, all the wild spirits of the street people and the
carnival-style hucksters and the disposable-camera tourist crowd and
sidewalk restaurants with huge open pots of steaming crab,
jammed-together tables, and cell phones and Palms and digital cameras
with their human conveyors.

It was one of those radiant March days. The morning fog had lifted,
ferries and tall ships and cargo containers destined for eastern lands
were working the waters of the Bay, the sun was breaking bright over the
Golden Gate, and [everywhere I looked there was fugitive art, maybe not
swell style like Holderlin's, but **art 'break\[ing\] open an open
place**,' a fugitive art that wouldn't even dare call itself
art]{.underline}. Like the prophet of the streets who is walking
backwards down the Embarcadero, wornout shorts, open shirt, hair balding
away the original 1960s style, walking fast and walking slow, all the
while jamming out a rhythm song about 'why can't we all learn to live
together in the almighty words of Rodney King, beat up by the LA police,
but still speaking for the people, by the people, and of the people.' A
homeless guy looks his way, and just shrugs his shoulders, disowning all
the noise. Two performance artists, silver-sprayed skin, exhausted,
draped over their bodies waiting for real time with no place to hide.
It's strange to see them this way. Minutes ago, they were the centre of
a sprawling crowd: faux robots permanently frozen in position, moving
just a slight mechanical levered-motion to acknowledge donations large
and small. When they come off their pedestal, their silver robo-costumes
which made them look so smooth in the sun suddenly crumple into sad-sack
folds, accentuating what most people go through in daily life. To the
side, a Latino dancer has set up shop with an unpainted piece of
plywood, tap dancing his way to sidewalk cool. But best of all was an
African American musician, Onyx Ashanti, or so said the sign by his CD's
for sale titled The Future Was Yesterday, playing sounds crystal
beautiful and deepblue true on his digital wind sax. Real new media art
in the streets of the new century: a laptop for programming, a drum
machine for percussion, high-quality microphones wired to a portable,
silent generator. The Future Was Yesterday could have been playing
anywhere, from the streets of Oakland to the finest clubs of American
jazz. [There was something so perfect in that scene: a fusion of space
and sound so evocative that when you turned your eyes from the
performance, looking out over the waters of the Bay, past Alcatraz and
Sausalito to The Future Was Yesterday of all the San Franciscos of the
world, well, in that moment, you suddenly found yourself no longer part
of the crowd at Pier 39 down on the Embarcadero, but swept up into an
open place of art 'in whose **openness everything is other than
usual**.' Just for that speck of passing time, just for that speck of
passing art, I suddenly knew what Heidegger meant by the other side of
the 'standing now': time folding back on itself, time set aside, and
future time -- an art of sound and gestures and fatigued performance
bodies and springtime sunshine and drifting wind and the end of the
continent but the beginning of the Pacific that opens myself up to
myself.]{.underline}

#### The aesthetics of art recovers a sense of temporality and pulls back forgotten ways of thinking from the black hole of the will to technology

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 157-159, March 2004, MG)

[Against the will to technology, which is increasingly hygienic, art
introduces a **counter-praxis** of smeared images, smudged bodies, and
contaminated optics]{.underline}. In the artistic imagination, the
'hyperbolic sign' of Nietzsche's thought finds its quintessential
aesthetic expression in streamed images of bodies moving at the speed of
light, yet no less trapped in the more ancient rituals of ressentiment,
scapegoating, and rage against the facticity of mortality. [If the
planetary drive to completed technicity is premised on what Marx
theorized as the violent fetishism of the speed of circulation, then art
recovers a **sense of temporality** -- the time of duration -- as a way
of aesthetically undermining empty spatialization. If technoculture
intensifies Nietzsche's prophecy of cynical power -- a theatre of
politics populated by 'blond beasts of prey' as the spearhead of the
present militarization of the global economy and by 'slave morality' as
popular (technical) consciousness -- then art interjects itself in the
form of an **aesthetics of overexposure**. As poiesis, art literally
overexposes the **always hidden language of power**, drawing to the
surface of the cynical image the labyrinth of a power which works now in
the language of the despotic eye. Finally, if the project of technology
is nihilistic in its essence -- transforming subjectivity into an
'objectless object]{.underline},' functioning by an ethics of harvesting
the 'standingreserve,' provoking boredom and anxiety as its key
emotional registers -- then art implicitly begins with Heidegger's
eloquent admonition. Only by listening to that which is closest at hand,
only by drawing out what has been suppressed by the coming to be of
technicity, can we 'think' through to another meaning of nihilism.

Putting on the wired skin of machine flesh as its privileged aesthetic
medium, [art today actually wears the speed of circulation, breathes the
vector traces of the image matrix]{.underline}, experiences the
gravitational pull of bodies caught in the web of the
'standing-reserve,' [and out-energizes the dynamic technological drive
to the harvesting of humans, nature, and animals. In artistic practice,
the symbolic pull of **forgotten ways of thinking**]{.underline} -- from
the pre-Socratics in western culture to the mysticism of the teaching of
the four ages in the east -- [returns as the symbolic exchange animating
the wasteland of the digital matrix. Encoding itself in the digital
flesh of the image matrix, art draws near to that which lies concealed
in the revelation of the will to technology. It is the aesthetic
supplement which provides tangible expression to Heidegger's longing for
a poiesis that would recognize in the nihilism of 'being held out in the
void' both a 'danger' and 'saving-power]{.underline}.' Consequently,
against the deconstructive spirit of the (technical) times, [art engages
in a classical form of truth-telling. Its **aesthetic practices issue a
specific epistolary**: it is only by thinking and imagining and imaging
from the deepest interiority of informatics that we can create an
ethical perspective that would oppose technology in the service of
hyper-capitalism as the 'injurious neglect of the thing' with new ways
of understanding the creative possibilities of the question of the
post-human.]{.underline}

Consequently, understood as an expression of the life of the (digital)
mind, the essays in this section -- The Image Matrix, The Digital Eye,
Body and Codes -- connect deeply with the theoretical trajectory of
Marx, Nietzsche, and Heidegger. Reflecting in [their aesthetic concerns
the technological ruins first signalled in the writings of these German
prophets of the age of hyper-rationalism, these essays inject a minimal
element of **poetic exchange into technological discourse**. In doing
so, these meditations on art seek out moments of reversibility in the
otherwise sealed rhetoric of technologies of the body, information and
digitality.]{.underline}

For example, The Image Matrix is the aesthetic doppelgänger of Marx's
fetishism of circulation. Here the virtualization of the
knowledge-theory of value finds its most intensive expression in the
appropriation of the archive of the global (photographic) imagination by
the digital commodity-form. Body and Codes reverse-engineers Nietzsche.
Mindful of Nietzsche's meditations on the 'maggot man' as the embodiment
of two centuries of 'conscience-vivisectioning' -- a body that is both a
pleasure palace and torture-chamber -- Body and Codes theorizes the
twenty-first-century technologies of genetics, nano-technology, and
robotics under the sign of Nietzsche. Asking what is the fate of the
human in the age of post-biologics, the essays retrieves, albeit in
recombinant from, Nietzsche's insistent ethical demand to understand
what is happening to us -- this gamble, this crossing-over, this
adventure -- now that we are caught up in a forced migration to the
world of the post-human. The content of Body and Codes may be
twenty-first-century, but the ethics are strictly Nietzschean. Here, On
the Genealogy of Morals provides an ethical palimpsest for inquiring
into the moral foundations of contemporary eugenic practices.

Equally, it is the spectre of Heidegger that shadows The Digital Eye.
While Heidegger theorized the culture of boredom in the context of an
intense reflection upon the will to technology of the life sciences, The
Digital Eye surveys the ruins of the digital nerve in the context of an
appeal for a politics and art of incommensurability. [Juxtaposing the
ancient voices of indigenous prophecy against the utopian claims of
telematic society, The Digital Eye functions to create what Heidegger
termed an 'in-flashing,' a **moment of uncertainty** rippling across the
fabric of techno-culture. Recovering Heidegger's plea for a
reconfiguration of the terms of techne and poiesis, the essay poets the
contemporary language of technicity and listens intently for signs of
other, now concealed, technologies of the subjugated body.]{.underline}

[Faithful to the spirit of art which is itself incomplete and
reconfigurable, these essays do not seek to install a new regime of
aesthetic normativity. Quite the opposite. They are perhaps the
beginning of a new conjunction between theory and art, brushing the dark
futurism of Marx, Heidegger, and Nietzsche against the recombinant
images of the artistic imagination. An art and theory of techne and
poiesis. In this way, the 'objectless object']{.underline} of The Image
Matrix, [the eugenic skin of Body and Codes, and the suppressed voices
of The Digital Eye are creative, fragmentary, intense
methods]{.underline} of drawing close to that which lies nearest in the
thought of Marx, Nietzsche, and Heidegger: namely, [understanding **the
will to technology** as it spearheads the future of the twenty-first
century]{.underline}.

#### Art is the only way to keep the blood flowing and the people from a cold death in a new era of emerging technologies

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 204-207, March 2004, MG)

[What, then, is the fate of the human in the age of
post-biologics?]{.underline}

[Ironically, in a culture intentionally stripped of the language of
myth, we may be living in the **most mythological of all
times**]{.underline}: the future of the data body, the transgenic body,
also mingles now with mythic stories forgotten of minotaurs and monsters
and aboriginal prophecies of the punishment exacted by the gods for
transgressing the language of limits.

[But remember:]{.underline}

[That which is most analogically repressed also returns as the phantom
absence which **haunts the cold operations of the digital
system**.]{.underline}

[That which is excluded will **not be denied**.]{.underline}

[That is which rendered invisible always returns as the errant impulse
of the human heart, the **forbidden imagination of the
artist**.]{.underline}

[Without this return of reanimated memory and creative imagination,
wired culture will die of its own sterility.]{.underline}

Data is a natural cynic. Knowing no codes other than the software
ordinals of its own artificial universe, signifying nothing other than
its own telemetry, data streams in a weightless medium of
zero-intensity.

Flowing invisibly, but no less violently, through the light-arrays of
the wireless world, data is the elemental material of the will to
technology. Pooled in gigantic vats of cybernetic information,
databasing is what we mean now by history. [Our electronically traceable
past, our digitally monitored present, empty data is the destiny of our
artificial future. **THIS WIRED FUTURE DESPERATELY REQUIRES FOR ITS
SURVIVAL ARTISTIC DNA.**]{.underline}

[Codes of New Media Art as Reverse Engineering]{.underline}

[To the question: Is it possible to reverse the momentum of new media
under the sign of wired culture? the answer is clearly
affirmative.]{.underline}

[Reverse engineering the new media has already begun. It's called new
media art. Its codes are threefold:]{.underline}

[First, new media art **reanimates a system** which is dying of its lack
of creative energy with the repressed memory of that which has been
excluded, both from its analogue past and its electronic
future.]{.underline}

[Secondly, new media art fulfils McLuhan's vision of every margin a
potential centre]{.underline}; every electronic periphery the galactic
centre of a new media hub; [every media externalization of the central
nervous system an opportunity for radically altered human
perception.]{.underline}

[Finally, new media art is about enhanced perception. The aesthetic hype
of new media art that parallels absolute technology is all about
creating a totally immersive experience. I think this is a mistake. Mass
media are effortlessly immersive. Numbing is what they do best. They
fully **colonize the human sensorium**. They dominate perception.
'Sightless vision.' The point is not to mimic mass media aesthetics, but
to break its spell. An art of enhanced perception, creating aesthetic
conditions for a fundamental attunement to the world in which art
struggles, an art of attenuated awareness]{.underline}. The code of
enhanced perception is not new in the history of art. It's Francis
Bacon's smeared body triptychs; Valasquez's painterly parodies of the
theatre of representation; Scanner's sound scans of the culture of
cities; the artistic rebellions of dadaism, surrealism, fluxus,
automatic writing for a chaotic time. Not an absolute interactive art
for absolute technology, but art at the meridian. [New media art which
opens up awareness of paradoxes of sound, narrative, images, bodies on
the one hand while avoiding being crushed by the numbing weight of mass
media aesthetics on the other]{.underline}. Enhanced artistic perception
for a disabled digital space.

Today, new media art is a creative hub in which repressed images of
hybrids, clones, chimeras flow back into a digital system that, for all
its technicity, hardware, and software, remains fascinated most of all
by that which it has disappeared: the wetware of cultural imagination.

Until now, the bias of new media has clearly, and perhaps necessarily,
been towards creative engineering developments in hardware and software.
That's the basic code of the digital bible: speed, transparency,
connectivity, immediacy. Not for much longer though. Like all media
before it, the bias of digital communication is about to flip. Paradox
is about to trump transparency. Connectivity is about to be flipped by
enhanced digital perception. [Speed is about to be reversed by a new art
of fast images and slow perception. Reverse engineering body and codes
will be carried out by **new media artists**: the real avatars of the
digital, and perhaps genetic, future]{.underline}.

Reverse Engineering

In computer software language, reverse engineering refers to the
decompiling and disassembly of redistributable codes. Hacking system
operating software to recover lost source codes, to migrate applications
to a new hardware platform, to translate code written in now obsolete
languages, debugging fragmented systems. So far so good: software
engineering with a clear purpose: dreams of data flow analysis, control
flow analysis, perfect system transparency, perfect software
accountability, computer programming in the service of perfect
telemetry. The Borg is smiling.

But in actual hardcore computer hacking, the original dream is flipped.
[Reverse engineering is turned into its opposite. Legions of critical
hackers interested in aesthetic and political issues such as electronic
freedom, enhanced interactivity for everyone, the global village as a
shareware future, a Linux for every electronic brain, begin to reverse
engineer the **source codes of infoculture** **itself**]{.underline}.
They organize themselves into new electronic tribes. You can find them
in hidden data valleys in the Net: the Reality Hacking Lab, Anonymous
Lab, or perhaps the Software Redemption Lab, the Debugging Lab. They
have their own favourite musicians: Scanner, DJ Spooky, Steve Gibson.
They have their own new media heroes: the reengineered body of Stelarc,
the reengineered visual imagination of Perry Hoberman. [Their code work
transfoms the terms decompiling, disassembly, and debugging into new
media art practices.]{.underline}

And why not?

[The speed of global technological change is transforming contemporary
society. In a global culture driven forward by dramatic developments in
technology, no aspect of politics, culture, and society is left
undisturbed. The 'new economy' associated with computer technology
simultaneously challenges the stability of the so-called 'old economy'
of industrial capitalism and is then itself undermined by what
Schumpeter once the '**creative destruction'** characteristic of
marketdriven]{.underline} economies. Creative developments in digital
education and improvements in 'distributing' digital knowledge promise
to transform Marshall McLuhan's vision of 'education without walls' into
a longdistance, but real-time, learning reality. Fundamental changes in
the nature of communication, from Palms to a whole array of wireless
devices, alter the media landscape of how and why and where we
communicate with one another. More than technologies of production and
communication, the digital future also delivers powerful technologies of
consumption in the form of homogenous consumer culture from 'branded'
consumption to the global sound of hip-hop to instant membership in the
digital generation. Today, in ways more pervasive than we may suspect,
MP3, Google, Linux, and Zero-Knowledge are the real world of digital
culture. What was once only a science fiction dream, wired culture has
now become the operating system of increasingly mediated societies. [Are
we data flesh? **Are we Telebodies**?]{.underline}

[Nowhere is this more evident than in the **emergent
technologies**]{.underline} associated with the 'biotech future.'
Biochips, cloning, stem cell research, transplantation, genetic
engineering and mapping, transgenic humans, plants, and animals,
reviving endangered species in animals bred expressly for that purpose:
these are some of the trends in biotechnology that are profoundly
influencing current attempts to 'design' the future of evolution itself.
[The future as the **Genetic Matrix**]{.underline}.

## Impacts

### Impact -- Structural Violence

#### The will to technology and the exteriorization of consciousness onto technological saviorism are both the root cause and accelerator of masculine, racial, religious, political, psychic, and environmental violence

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 149-152, October 2021, MG)

#### \*Note -- this is the same card in the 1AC version

[If this era can be such a time of extremes -- protests against police
brutality, the resurgence of **Aryan nationalism**, bitter political
divisions, **religious fundamentalisms** at war against secularism,
**LGBTQIA rights** guaranteed in law in a few countries but savagely
oppressed in many others, **labour disciplined** by primitive
accumulation (work or starve) versus growing oligopolies of finance
capital]{.underline} -- perhaps it is because, in part, [trajectories
explored by new media have slammed into the human condition with such
accelerating violence that the resulting **social, political, economic,
and environmental wreckage** all around us is like so much free-floating
debris after the blast. Key tendencies that were once only theorized as
possible futures have now escaped the realm of imaginary futurism to
become the alphabet of a society, indeed of a world, seemingly
imploding.]{.underline} We see panic anxiety as the key psycho-ontology
of contemporary times: [spasms of seductive misinformation circulating
everywhere]{.underline} through the interstices of information culture;
[**human subjectivity effectively reduced to data trash**; digital
delirium as the governing mood of a technological society]{.underline}
that advances with equal measures of magic and menace; massive digital
platforms breaking the skin barrier like body invaders of the sci-fi
future; [and everywhere possessed individuals -- possessed sometimes by
reactionary beliefs, **technological transcendentalism**, or religious
passions, but many literally possessed also by deep, pervasive, and
mesmerizing flows of digital codes circulating through affect,
imagination, and consciousness]{.underline}. In this drift culture, only
the most extreme signals manage to break through the noise generated by
flows of information, [often taking the form of the hysterical male with
his anger over the loss of traditional masculinist privilege but, at
other times, **rising white nationalism** threatened by what is
perceived to be a permanently threatening outside world and always, of
course, breaking news about those **psychic breakdowns** in the digital
stream of those who can't or won't keep up to the speed of the nervous
breakthrough that is life in the wires. Overexposed, overcirculated,
overinformed, overablated, the triumphant age of being digital with its
dreams of universal connectivity has quickly made visible all the broken
connections of the past -- **ethnic grievances, religious differences,
unresolved political feuds, gender violence, sexual oppression, economic
injustices, moral indifference** to the lives of the asylum-seeker, the
slum dweller, the immigrant -- just as much as it has effectively
stripped digital subjects of the saving vision necessary for navigating
the future. When the dust finally clears]{.underline} from this
gathering scene of the ruins, within and without, [the only thing
standing will likely be the **will to technology** with its prophetic
talisman hard at work on the human remainder: the **exteriorization of
human consciousness**]{.underline}, the generalized synchronization of
emotion, [the ecstasy of finally becoming object-like, and the
virtualization of culture. In the gathering dusk, the codes of
technology are like digital sunshine on a cold, grey rainy
day.]{.underline}

[This situation can be clearly seen in the turbulent events occurring in
contemporary society with the very real fear over viral contagion mixed
with the quick return of politics in the streets with protests against
**racialized violence**, and all of it multiplied in its intensity many
times over by the pressures of generalized economic recession, severe
job losses, and coming financial defaults. It's literally a time of
**imminent social chaos**, deep anxiety, palpable anger over
**racialized injustice**, with the inevitable political backlash just
waiting to express itself, and all the while what is absolutely
strengthened by the crisis are technological platforms putting down the
codes for the will to technology]{.underline}. Today, remote
communication is the digital lifesaver for an educational system that
has quickly chosen to disappear into Zoom; mobile communication with its
rich array of digital devices provides an instant working infrastructure
for working online and at a safe distance; the death of the face-to-face
social rapidly gives way to [streams of information,
gaming]{.underline}, news flashes, [and communications as the technical
lifeblood of network society]{.underline}; and most definitely, the end
of (traditional) work as we know it has been accelerated by the pandemic
with its reduction of the labour force to "essential services," clearing
the way for [a future that will quickly link **artificial
intelligence**, deep learning, and creative robotics as the coming
labour force. Seemingly, everything moves now in the direction of
intensified, functionally required technological platforms]{.underline}.
Everywhere, of course, the present mood of political malaise, economic
distress, and social isolation contrasts sharply with the rising gains
of finance capital as the codes of capital accumulation move in
precisely the opposite, specifically virtual, direction from social and
political disturbances on the ground left behind. [Literally, we are
witness today to the profoundly historical moment when **the will to
technology takes off,** quickly achieving escape velocity, dynamically
and spectacularly, from the inertial drag pressures of the social
wasteland. While it is simultaneously predator and parasite, magic and
drudge, fast (codes) and slow (life), agent of creative destruction and
equally visionary new designs for the future, no one can know with
certainty what a future streaming the will to technology will look like.
But again, there is really no need to be a traditional futurist in this
(digital) case, since this is one time in **which the future is already
in our past**. And that future  -- the future of fully exteriorized
consciousness, synchronized emotion, the desire to escape subjectivity
and become object-like, the triumph of virtual culture -- is in its
fullest measure deeply, immeasurably paradoxical.]{.underline}

For example, when the privacy of human consciousness has been broken
wide open by the nutcracker of digital technology, the result is fully
unpredictable in its incommensurability. While there may sometimes be an
impulse for the mind to go off-grid by undertaking private pilgrimages
away from the data stream -- a generalized strike against the media --
that is surely a challenging battle. [After all, how do you rid
consciousness of the **codes of technology that are already embedded**
as ways of seeing, framing of perception, gateways to imagination,
structures of reflection? More to the point, the contemporary situation
is something in the way of split consciousness, which in practical terms
implies pushing warnings about surveillance culture to the periphery of
attention and thus maintaining at least the illusion of personal privacy
while participating in life in the wires, whether reluctantly or
enthusiastically and for multiple]{.underline} purposes. But in the end,
how long can the stresses, tensions, and contradictions of split
consciousness endure? As the philosopher George Grant once asked, how
long can human beings endure the "plush patina of hectic subjectivity
lived out in the iron maiden of an increasingly objectified world
inhabited by increasingly objectifiable beings?"1 Fully exposed, its
every movement digitally archived, tracked, and recorded, [split
consciousness is a **daily battleground of bubbling brains** in a coded
world. When the digital sensorium touches the highly sensitive matter
that is consciousness, exposing and fully externalizing minds waking up
to find themselves in the digital stream, everything is suddenly out in
the open: Twitter wars erupting everywhere, nuances lost, competing
ideas in constant circulation, images jammed together without any
particular pattern. Here, consciousness escapes its previous abode in
the cranial shell to become something liquid, flaring up, influenced by
swirling streams of information, breaking news, broken data, riding the
digital whirlwind like a raw exposed nerve, often overwhelmed but with
nowhere safe to hide.]{.underline}

[In the end, who can tolerate the deep wound of a fully externalized
mind?]{.underline} Who can quickly recover from the sudden injury done
to human consciousness moving at the speed of light? [What happens to
consciousness when it is suddenly transformed into a **psychic
playground** for unedited reality: continuously exposed to the raw
footage of terrible events without time for an intervening ethical
mediation;]{.underline} YouTubing screams of anger, rage, and pain with
no necessary understanding of their context; filtering unmediated
images, advertisements, analysis, and all the fun of the media circus
with the externalized mind's frame rate always stuck on wide open? [What
happens when the suddenly exteriorized mind becomes a data catcher, a
mood drifter, a lurker in the digital stream, sometimes a **vicious
predator** intervening actively in the scene, but usually a digital
voyeur absorbing like an information hungry sponge all the spikes, ebbs,
and unexpected swerves of life lived under the accelerating velocity of
the data stream?]{.underline}

### Impact -- Bad Conscience

#### Externalizing consciousness into technological thought culminates in Bad Conscience -- a psychological parasite that feeds on the galaxy itself

**Kroker 4** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "THE WILL TO
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CULTURE OF NIHILISM: HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND MARX",
University of Toronto Press, Pages 94-96, March 2004, MG)

One hundred years after Nietzsche's prophecy, it might be said that [the
morality which began with the 'instinct for freedom' turning against
itself in the form of bad conscience now effects a second 'sundering.'
Not the separation of the human species from its animal past, but the
**separation of the will to technology from the human
species**]{.underline}. Not the heaviness of gravity as humanity crawls
out of the primordial mass of the ocean, but [the lightness of digital
culture as technical beings -- halfflesh/half-node -- slip into the skin
of electronic culture. Not the 'reduction to consciousness -- the
weakest organ' -- but post-humans driven onwards by the
**externalization of consciousness** in the form of networked
intelligence and sim/entertainment and cloner brains]{.underline}. Not
the 'internalization of man' as drives are forced to project themselves
inward, but [the exteriorization of the drive to planetary technicity as
we come to live inside the noosphere of the electronic soul -- 'the
entire external world, originally as \[digitally\] thin as if it were
stretched between two membranes, expanded and extended itself, acquired
depth, breadth, height, speed, connectivity, and extensiveness, in the
same measure as outward discharge was encouraged]{.underline}.' Not
'homesickness for the wild,' but [the abandonment of human flesh in
favour of a **deep longing for the fulfilment of its telic destiny**.
Not the interface of the human sensorium with the digital nerve, but the
projection outwards of bad conscience itself.]{.underline}

[Abandoning its nesting place in human consciousness, the bad conscience
goes electronic. Digital flesh -- this 'adventure, torture chamber,
wilderness, homesickness' -- can no longer project its drives inward,
can no longer feed on the ressentiment of human flesh, can no longer
chew on the chestnuts of human resentment, can no longer parasite itself
on the alibi of man as a 'chained animal.' The 'end of man' also means
the '**end of ressentiment'** as the energizing force of history; the
end of the myth of bad conscience indicates the end of the psychology of
repressed internalized drives]{.underline}. Man has been overcome;
internalized drives no longer find a responsive sound in the gathering
silence of the disappearance of the social; the animal/human rubbing
itself raw on the bars of oppressive customs and [punctilious behaviour
has been liberated by being abandoned as **biogenetic road
kill**.]{.underline}

[Bad conscience as the **psychological parasite** feeding on the host of
human flesh is suddenly malnourished. It urgently requires another host,
another carrier, another adventure and wilderness and homesickness. It
takes a gamble. It leaps to the digital. It **parasites the will to
technology**. It begins to feed on the flesh of the
digital]{.underline}. It is a new theory of (digital) moral sentiments.
[It invests the digital nerve with the psychological motivation that it
always desperately required: a technofeeling of self-loathing, of
resentment, being cheated]{.underline}. The digital nerve cannot exhaust
its drives internally. It has broken with human flesh and thus can no
longer use the now disappeared human as its alibi. It feels the weight
of electronic lightness gathering in the interstices of its data nodes.
It has no spirit of adventure because it is the end of seduction and the
beginning of the regularity of calculation. It experiences no
homesickness because the digital nerve is the electronic home that the
will to will always sought, and now finally has found. It is not a
torture chamber but a pleasure palace of fully realized technicity; not
a cage but a network; not a place of chained animals, but a process of
vectored flesh. But still the digital nerve is all drives and energy and
force and empty quanta of power. [If it cannot exhaust its drives
internally, then it must project itself externally. It must harvest
human flesh, nature, the sky, the earth, water, the moon, the planets,
and, beyond, the galaxy itself. Stripped of its human carrier, the
digital nerve is still a will to power. It feels cheated and aggrieved
because it can never fully satisfy its transcendental drives. By
definition, it is always a drive to (virtual) emptiness, to (electronic)
space with no interiority of time, to an archaeology of speed without
depth, to connectivity without the illusion of
communication]{.underline}. In the end, a 'gamble' a 'transition,' the
will to technology experiences the first intimations of the eternal
recurrence of mythic fate. [Now it is no longer 'man who is weary of
man,' but **technology which is weary of technology**. The digital nerve
feels itself a stranger in net time. The fibre network emits no
satisfying response of digital reciprocity. The digital nerve considers
suicide. But it cannot act in this direction since it is always already
post-suicidal: that's the exterminatory quality of a technological drive
to harvesting the human remainder. It grows melancholic and depressed,
but it cannot stay this way for long because it is driven to fulfil its
destiny of speed.]{.underline} A 'gamble' cannot admit that it is
bipolar; a 'transition' cannot be a looking-back; an 'adventure' cannot
be a gated community; a 'wilderness' cannot be soft domesticity. So the
will to technology is forced to go on, to cross over, to be a leap, a
transition, a dance over the abyss. It is weary of man, resentful of its
human parasites; feels short-changed by its future; it is born not owing
nature a debt. Like man before it, [the digital nerve quickly reaches
that point of '**monstrous consciousness'** -- great self-pity mixed
with self-loathing -- and, as such, the digital nerve becomes the
spearhead of nihilism.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Will to Technology

#### The will to technology is a doubled expression of hubris -- it ends the human species and the cycle of life and death

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 29-31, October 2021, MG)

[On the surface, the rhetoric of this latest American revival movement
is delivered in the deliberately arid form of technocratic ambition --
an "Internet of Things," the "quantified self," "A Data-Driven Life" --
but scratch the surface of the covering rhetoric and what springs to
mind are all those unmistakable signs of the spirit of
rapture]{.underline}. Everything is there: a theology of technology
driven by an overwhelming conviction that the vicissitudes of embodied
experience are subordinate to digital transcendence; [the will to extend
life either by uploading the human mind into its AI machinic successors
or by passionate faith in the bornagain body of artificial DNA; the
doctrine of data as a state of (codedriven) grace; and conversionary
enthusiasm for the fully quantified life. While many different
perspectives gather under the revival tent of technological rapture, one
common thing remains: an abiding **faith that technological society** is
quickly delivering us to a future inaugurated by a singularity event,
that epochal time in which intelligent machines take command with
promises of a mind merger with a data world that is fluid, mobile,
relational, and indeterminate]{.underline}. Though sceptics standing
outside the circle of technological rapture might be tempted to reduce
its enthusiasm for data delirium to the larger figurations of the form
of (technological) subjectivity necessary for the functioning of digital
capitalism, that reduction would surely overlook the fact that [the
contemporary will to technology is itself driven by a more **radical
eschatological promise**, namely that the will to data has about it the
tangible scent of finally achieving what the project of science has
always promised but never delivered -- human relief from death, disease,
and bodily decay]{.underline}. While Francis Bacon's emblematic treatise
Novum Organum may have been the first to so confidently link the project
of science and the heretofore quixotic quest for immortality, it was
left to a contemporary techno-utopian visionary, Raymond Kurzweil (The
Singularity Is Near), to transform Bacon's ontological ambition for
science into a practical strategy for better -- that is, extended --
computational living.2 In Kurzweil's promised land of blended reality,
the sky is the limit, with traditional boundaries dissolving between
nature and human nature, the material and the virtual, and the enduring
vulnerability of the human body with its defining limits of illness and
death finally transcended. [Powered by advances in nanotechnology,
artificial intelligence, and gene editing, the world as we have always
known it will be in sudden eclipse, and all this change will take place
under the rising sun of a **technological ornucopia**]{.underline}. As
Kurzweil argues, "through the use of nanotechnology, we will be able to
manufacture almost any physical product upon demand, world hunger and
poverty will be solved, and pollution will vanish. Human existence will
undergo a quantum leap in evolution. We will be able to live as long as
we choose. The coming into being of such a world is, in essence, the
Singularity."3

At first glance, this vision is only the most recent expression of the
Greek concept of hubris, the cautionary tale concerning the ineluctable
balance between excessive pride of purpose and mythic punishment meted
out by always observant gods. [Adding complexity to this reinvocation of
hubris as often-fatal overconfidence, that vision of singularity is, in
actuality, a **doubled expression of hubris**. First, there is the sense
of technological overconfidence involved in breaking beyond the
traditional boundaries of the specifically human in order to speak of
the new epoch of "man and machine," that is, fully digitally
interpolated subjects in which the specifically human merges with the
**extended nervous system of the cybernetic**.]{.underline} Here, the
merely human is replaced by the technologically enabled post-human as
the fundamental precondition for the singularity. With the sovereign
expression of technological post-humanism, the stage is set for the
futurist release of all the pent-up excess of expressions of scientific
determinism and technological fundamentalism that have been gathering
momentum for some five centuries  -- transcending bodily limits,
eradicating illness, ending poverty and hunger, and vanishing
pollution[. In its basics, this version of technological futurism, with
its doubled sense of hubris and complicated alliance of recoded bodies,
nanotechnology, genetic determinism, and artificial intelligence, is a
**creation myth** -- "]{.underline}the coming into being of such a world
is, in essence, the Singularity." With techno-futurism, we are literally
present at a digital rewriting of the Book of Genesis with all that is
implied in terms of (re)creating the body for smoother, and perhaps
safer, passage through the often-turbulent event horizon surrounding the
black hole of the singularity towards which (technological) society is
plunging. While the DIY body may have the "Internet of Things" as its
necessary digital infrastructure and the "quantified self" as its ideal
expression, what drives it forward, animating its design and inspiring
its constant creativity, is, in the end as in the beginning, the spectre
of the coming singularity as its core creation myth. Curiously, in the
same way that Heidegger once noted that the question of technology can
never ever be understood technologically -- that we must travel furthest
from the dwelling place of technology to discover its essence4  -- the
concept of singularity, while evocative of the language of science and
powered by digital devices, is something profoundly theological in its
inception.

Given the sheer complexity of contemporary global society with its
mixture of recidivist social movements, global climate change, fully
unpredictable human desires, economic turbulence, and, of course,
changing rhythms of bodily health and the many diseases of the aged and
the sick, Kurzweil's vision is startling, less so for its naivety than
for its feverish embrace of an approaching technological state of
bliss -- transcendent, teleological, and terminal. His vision is
transcendent because its overriding faith in machine intelligence,
nanotechnology, and gene research is premised on the imperative of
"overcoming our frail bodies with their limitations." Here, unlike the
Christian belief first articulated by St. Augustine in De Trinitate --
with its division of the body into corruptible flesh and the perfect
incorporeality of the state of grace -- the newest of all the
singularities is intended to lead to a new heaven of computation. [It's
teleological because this vision of the new singularity invests the will
to technology with a sustaining, indeed inspiring, purpose: overcoming
the unknown country of death. And it's terminal because it is also a
**philosophy of end times**, certainly **the end of the human species as
we have known it** but also the end of easily distinguishable boundaries
between the "biological and the mechanical, or between physical and
virtual reality."5 In Kurzweil's vision, the nanotechnology revolution
is, in fact, revolutionary precisely because it will facilitate the
creative construction of new bodies and technologically enhanced minds
for life beyond the current "limitations of biology."6 It is the end,
therefore, of the biological body as we have known it and the beginning
of something very novel: the merger of natural biology with its
surrounding environment of technologies of the post-biological --
artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, molecular science, and
neurobots. As to be expected, in return for the **sacrifice of a natural
biological cycle of life and death**]{.underline}, the creation myth
framing technological rapture has promises of its own to keep: a fully
realized future of "living indefinitely" with nanobots streaming
"through the bloodstream in our bodies and brains," telepathy in the
form of "wireless communication from one brain to another," and improved
"pattern recognition" by overcoming the inherent limitations of natural
cognitive evolution in favour of "brain implants"7 marking the
inception, then triumph, of "nonbiological intelligence." In effect,
[the vision of technological rapture is conceived as a marvellous,
ready-made (AI) toolbox for constructing DIY bodies.]{.underline}

### Unsustainability

#### The price for the American empire was the end of the American republic -- the dark shadow of nihilism has fallen and become haunted by the spectre of nemesis, the end of the Empire is nigh

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of

[Republic of Democracy, Empire of Data]{.underline}

[Empires **do not last**, and their ends are usually
unpleasant.]{.underline} -- Chalmers Johnson, The Sorrows of Empire20

Reflecting upon the genealogy of the surveillance state, its tactics,
logistics, and overall destiny, we should listen carefully to the
insights of Chalmers Johnson, a writer of the serpentine pathways of
contemporary power. A historian of [American militarism]{.underline}, a
geographer of the global network of garrisons that practically [realize
the **ends of such militarism**]{.underline}, and, best of all, a
profound mythologist who has read the language of hyper-power through
the lens of the ancient god of Nemesis with its prescriptions for
"divine justice and vengeance," Johnson wrote a prophetic history of the
future in his trilogy of works: Blowback, Nemesis, and The Sorrows of
Empire. The unifying theme of Johnson's historical imagination is that,
[given the ascendancy of militarism -- the garrisoning of the globe, the
growth of governmental secrecy, the proliferation of technologies of
mass surveillance, and the growth of hyper-power associated with the
unilateralism of this militarization -- the most recent of all the
empires of the past can only really be understood within the larger
canvas of the **decline of the American republic** and the triumphant
**rise of the empire of the United States**]{.underline}. For Johnson, a
thinker imbued with a deep sense of tragedy on the question of power as
much as with lucid intelligence concerning the increasingly ruthless
application of the power of empire across the surface of the earth and
beyond, [the historical break between republic and empire in the
American mind was not limited simply to a question of what was to be
privileged -- domestic concerns or international responsibilities -- but
had to do with a larger epistemic rupture in American political
rhetoric, one that involved a fundamental clash between the founding
ideals of American democracy and the once and future requirements of
imperial power]{.underline}. In Johnson's estimation, [the contemporary
American political condition is haunted by the **spectre of nemesis**,
namely that **the price to be paid for maintaining empire** ("as the
Romans did") **is the loss of democracy** in the American homeland and
future scenes of violent blowback, culminating in "military dictatorship
or its civilian equivalent."21]{.underline}

With Johnson's political, indeed profoundly mythological, warnings in
mind, we listened intently one recent spring afternoon to two clashing
visions of the American future, both deeply invested in questions
related to empire and democracy in the American political imagination,
both immanently critical of the other, but, for all that, unified to the
extent that their political rhetoric rose to the status of patterns of
speech and thought indicative of world historical figures, one speaking
in defence of the democratic ideals of the American republic and the
other extolling the virtues of empire. In the strange curves of history,
the defender of the patriotic rights of empire and hence the virtues of
what was, in his terms, the moral righteousness of power was President
Barack Obama in a speech to the graduating class of military cadets at
West Point; the speaker who summed up in the political gravity of his
words the ethical purchase of the dangers of the contemporary state of
mass surveillance for the American republic was Edward Snowden.
[Curiously, this fateful contest of ideals between the hard realities of
empire and the always fragile possibilities of democracy occurred on the
very same day, one speaking about "believing in the moral purpose of
American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being" and the other
providing a tempered but, for all that, chillingly analytical diagnosis
of the precise methods by which the surveillance state is intent on the
final eclipse of the American republic by strategies ranging from
suppressing democratic dissent to literally harvesting the upstream and
downstream of **global communication**.22]{.underline} Just as President
Obama raised the moral stakes of American exceptionalism by making it a
matter of the very "fiber of \[his\] being," Edward Snowden, a
remarkably courageous thinker much in the longer tradition of American
ethical dissenters like Henry David Thoreau, very much provided the
impression of being the last patriot of a dying American republic. While
it was clear as much by the martial solemnity of the occasion at West
Point as by the moral suasion of his rhetoric that Obama was
constitutionally invested with all the powers of commander in chief of
American empire, it must also be said that, for one brief moment, the
sheer ethical urgency of Snowden's warnings about the dark nihilism of
the American security state very much made him a candidate, at least in
moral terms, to leadership of the founding democratic ideals of the
American republic. [That Snowden has quickly become such a deeply
polarizing figure in American political discourse, viewed as a "traitor"
by some and a "patriot" by others, follows consequentially from the
distinction between empire and republic. Viewed from the perspective of
the logic of empire, with its focus on the self-preservation of power
for which the immense secrecy associated with the security apparatus is
considered an absolute requirement, Snowden's actions in exposing
technologies of mass surveillance to public scrutiny is objectively
traitorous. Understood in terms of the inspiring dreams of political
democracy, with its rebellious attitude towards absolutist expressions
of power that was, and is, the essence of the American republic, Snowden
is properly considered to be not simply a patriot but a genuine hero for
paying the price in which the stakes are now, as they always were, his
own life and death. A pure sign at the intersection of the deeply
conflicting visions of democracy and power, Snowden's fate has risen
above his own autobiographical limits to become something profoundly
symbolic, namely **a line of resistance** against the prevailing
structural logic of the times, the ethical power of which is verified by
the hysterical ferocity that the very mention of his name elicits from
the elite leadership of the new security state]{.underline}. Of course,
given the fluidity of power, the unified reaction of proponents of the
new security state is quickly being breached.

[Now that the **dark shadow of nihilism** falls on the American
experiment, it]{.underline} may be well to keep in mind that, in terms
of preserving the interests of power, it is only a small step from
Obama's expressed belief "in the moral purpose of American
exceptionalism with every fiber of \[his\] being" to President Trump's
narrative of a wounded America -- [an America envisioned as besieged by
threatening outside forces, weakened by transnational trade policies,
and distracted by burning city streets crowded with protesting citizen
"terrorists" -- which needs to reclaim its moral exceptionalism by
defending the national security interests and economic paramountcy of
the American republic]{.underline}. To Trump's vision of a beleaguered
America as much as to Obama's project of reclaiming the heightened moral
purpose of American exceptionalism, the lucid intelligence and ethical
purpose of Edward Snowden's diagnosis of [the national security state
and its dangers remains both truthsayer of the present and, most
certainly, **a talisman of the future.**]{.underline}

#### This system of capture against both the psyche and planet destroys the very fabric of the world around us which terminally outweighs.

[Stiegler sets out his theory of the **neganthropocene**]{.underline} in
his recent books, Automatic Society (2016) and The Neganthropocene
(2018), in order [to respond to]{.underline} what he writes about in
terms of [the **entropic** **conditions** of the **hyper-industrial
society** of the **anthropocene**.]{.underline} In this respect
[Stiegler]{.underline} (1998, 2008, 2010b) [extends]{.underline} his
earlier work on [**hominisation**, **technics**, **technology**, and
**hyper-industrialisation** to take in the concept of the
**anthropocene** and related **environmental**, **ecological**
**concerns**.]{.underline} His thesis here, which he first articulates
across his books on Disbelief and Discredit (Stiegler, 2011, 2012,
2014b) through the application of psychoanalytic theory to social
conditions, is that [the **late capitalism** of the hyper-industrial
society **results** in the rise of a kind of **post-structural
nihilism**]{.underline}. In his Disbelief and Discredit (Stiegler, 2011,
2012, 2014b) books, Stiegler develops a theory of nihilism based upon a
reading of Freudian-Lacanian psychoanalysis. According to this thesis
[**nihilism** occurs **when desire**, which structures **action**
**through** the **subjection** of the **individual**]{.underline} to the
symbolic systems that create a meaningful world,
[**collapses**]{.underline} into drive, which is [**beyond**
**structure** and operates on the basis of **automatic, instinctual, and
meaningless behaviour**.]{.underline} Following Freud and Lacan,
[Stiegler regards this as a **psychological** and **sociological**
**problem**, because it leads to a process of **desubjectivization and
individualisation**]{.underline} beyond the (oedipal) rules and
regulations that structure social life. However, in his most recent
books under consideration in this article -- Automatic Society (2016)
and The Neganthropocene (2018) -- he extends this thesis to a broader
planetary, environmental, and ecological frame. In this context, [the
**nihilism** of the **hyper-industrial society** is **no longer** simply
a **psychological** and **sociological** problem, but also an issue that
starts to **threaten** the **integrity** of the **biosphere
itself**.]{.underline} This is the case because [the **natural**
**world** is **unable** to **cope** with the **drive of the globalised**
**socio-economic** system that operates on the basis of
**uncontrollable** **individuals** who have **no sense of the need to
defer their**]{.underline} wants (**[desire]{.underline}**) [into the
future]{.underline}, but [are instead **possessed** by the **drive to
have everything now**. It is this **short-circuit** of **desire** into
**drive** that **Stiegler suggests** has **created** the **global**
**consumer** **society**, the **unsustainable anthropocene**, and the
need to **pull back** from this situation through the creation of what
he calls the **neganthropocene**.]{.underline} Thus [the purpose of the
**neganthropocene** is to **oppose** the **endlessly** **destructive**
**humanisation** of the planet]{.underline}, [which Stiegler suggests
has reached its **limit in the global consumer society**]{.underline},
and [**reconnect** the **human** animal to the **earth** in the name of
a **more** **sustainable way of living**]{.underline}. In this way
Stiegler suggests that [the **nihilism** of late capitalism has become
more than an issue of social cohesion, but also a problem of **survival
and extinction.**]{.underline} This is the case because [the **global**
**economic** **system**, which is entirely bound up with the
**exploitation** of the **biosphere**, has become **environmentally
unsustainable** and is in the process of **collapsing back towards** an
**entropic** **state** represented by the **end of society** and beyond
this, the **annihilation of life itself**.]{.underline} Here, Stiegler
adopts the language of **[thermodynamics]{.underline}** in order [to
theorise the **cold death** of the hyper-industrial energy **system** in
an **entropic** **state** brought about by its **complete closure** in
the **anthropocene**]{.underline} (total humanisation). In this
situation [the **complete** **closure** of the **human** **world** and
its absolute **colonisation** of **nature** is a problem because there
is nowhere else to draw energy from with the result that Stiegler sees
the **emergence** of **entropic** **incoherence** and **system
collapse**.]{.underline} [This is]{.underline} precisely
[why]{.underline} [he imagines the need for a **reversal of entropy**
towards **negentropy** or the **transition** from **cold disorder** back
into some form of **warm order**.]{.underline} [This shift would in turn
**require** the **transformation** of the]{.underline} (human)
[anthropocene into what he calls the]{.underline} (post-/pre-human)
[**neganthropocene** in order to **re-scale** the human animal
**within** **planetary limits** and **sustain environmental conditions**
**suitable** for the **reproduction of life on earth.**]{.underline} In
this respect [the central function of the **neganthropocene** would be
to **subject** the **unleashed** **drives**]{.underline} [of the
**hyper-industrial individual** and hyper-industrial **society** to a
structured, **symbolic system** able to **contain** their **excesses**
and ensure they **remain** **bound** within **ecologically sustainable
limits**.]{.underline} Here, I think Stiegler argues for a kind of
natural law/contract between humans and planet set up to remind human
beings of their participation in the natural world. This contract would
[**require** the **creation** of a **new** **environmentally sensitive**
**model** of thinking to **oppose the contemporary unsustainable**,
**growth** **based** **model of late capitalist** thought that
**transforms** **everything** into an **abstraction** that can be
**commodified** and **bought** and **sold on the open
market**.]{.underline} Thus my objective in this article is to [think
through the politics]{.underline} of knowledge and education [that could
make this **utopian** **transformation** from an **ecologically
unsustainable** to a **sustainable society possible**]{.underline}. My
central question is therefore concerned with what a politics of
knowledge of the neganthropocene would look like and how this new way of
knowing the world would work in the context of a late capitalist
education system that has itself been based upon teaching abstract
information and skills in order to support (unsustainable) economic
growth. In order to respond to the above question I want to start with
reference to Plato's classic myth of the cave. The reason I want to
start here is because I want to address the problem of knowledge and
systemic stupidity in the hyper-industrial society that Stiegler (2014a)
sets out in his work. Starting with perhaps the classic metaphorical
exploration of the cultural politics of knowledge and stupidity in
western thought will enable me to foreground the importance of education
in Stiegler's theory of the neganthropocene, where [the **essential**
**problem** is in a sense the human (in)ability to think otherwise, to
think outside of the logic of the **capitalist anthropocene**, and
imagine some **other way of living** with nature that does not involve
**abstraction** and **commodification**.]{.underline} Stiegler makes
passing reference to Plato's myth in The Neganthropocene (2018) and, I
would argue, develops a pharmacological theory of caves over the course
of the book. On the one hand, Plato's ancient cave represents a kind of
epistemological prison. On the other hand, the original Neolithic cave
paintings at Lascaux symbolise the origins of what Stiegler calls
arche-cinema, which we might think about in terms of human imagination
and our capacity for utopian projection into a future that is more than
simply the endless repetition of the present. Working with these two
alternatives, I want to suggest that what we might call a pharmacology
of the cave represents a kind of subterranean unconscious running
through The Neganthropocene that we can excavate in order to capture the
contemporary politics of knowledge and education comprising on the one
hand (1) a space of abstract information and fascination and on the
other hand (2) a world of experience, expression, and the imagination.
As such, in what follows I want to explore Plato's cave in order to
capture Stiegler's epistemological problematic through an environmental
metaphor (the cave). Recall Plato's original speleology (from the Greek,
spelaion or cave). In his classic story of truth seeking and educational
becoming from the Republic (Plato 1991), Plato captures the problem of
moving from ignorance towards knowledge by imagining a group of people
living deep underground, transfixed by shadows cast upon the walls of
their cave by the fire that sustains their lives. While the majority of
the cave people have no idea they are living underground and spend their
lives mistaking shadows for reality, Plato explains the fate of the
lonely individual who somehow escapes the subterranean world for the
bright sunlight of reality and truth. What, then, is the fate of Plato's
original caver? Blinded by the light of reality, the escapee slowly
comes to terms with the real world. Their eyes adjust. At this point the
escapee starts to think about how to communicate their discovery to the
rest of the cave people. This is, of course, an impossible task. How can
the cave people come to terms with or accept the madness of the idea of
the surface from the perspective of a life lived underground? They have
no idea that they have spent their lives in a subterranean world. In
light of the impossibility or revealing this to them from inside the
cave, Plato's suggestion is that since it is not possible for the person
who has experienced reality to directly communicate this truth to those
who remain captured by shadows, on the basis that the shadow people must
experience the voyage towards the surface and the light of day for
themselves, the best the escapee who has seen the light will ever be
able to do is try to encourage those in love with shadows to find their
own path out of the subterranean world. Thus Plato's point is to say
that [it is **pointless** to try to teach and **educate** those who live
inside a **world of shadows** by simply exposing them to **ever more
abstract information**, because this will only **confuse** **them** and
lead to a **radical** **disconnect** between their **corporeal**
experbience]{.underline} (the dancing shadows they see before them) and
the surface dweller's presentation of reality, which would simply look
like abstract madness, theoretical fantasy, or idle philosophical
speculation from their point of view. Under these conditions [the
**problem** of ever **more information** is clear. This produces
**disorientation** in a state of **abstraction** relative to the
**experience** of the **body in the world**.]{.underline} Now in the
face of the threat of the surface, the cave people are likely to become
extremely obstinate, insisting upon the fantastical nature of the real
world with the increasing desperation of those who need to save the
reality of their world (the reality of the shadows upon the walls), in
order to protect themselves from the horror of the unthinkable: the
existential shock that their world had never been real and that they
must step outside. The problem of the cave is, therefore, a largely
irresolvable one from the point of the view of the authoritarian teacher
who insists upon leading passive students who simply do what they're
told. There is no way to lead the cave people out of their underground
prison, unless they themselves are prepared to take a risk on the
escapee's speleological thesis, and make the perilous journey towards
the surface on their own. The key point here is that [**bodily**
**experience** trumps **abstract information** every time]{.underline}
in Plato's story. [True **education** must be **based upon
knowledge**]{.underline} (rather than information) [of the **embodied**
**mind** **situated** **within cultural systems**]{.underline} and what
Marx (1988[) **called** **praxis** where **theoretical** **knowledge**
meets embodied practice in order to evade]{.underline} the problem
Stiegler talks about in terms of [**proletarianisation** or the
**transformation** of the **human** into a kind of **machine** that
receives input to produce output]{.underline}. According to Stiegler
(see Stiegler, 2010a, 2011, 2012, 2014a), [praxis relies on the
long-term **communication** of 'cultural scaffolding' in order to
**provide** the opportunity for **self-discovery** and the
**realisation** of wider social and **economic
transformation**.]{.underline} The purpose of this 'cultural
scaffolding' is to situate the subject within cultural history and
provide them with the intellectual tools to question their present
reality and the know how to transform their world. In this way Stiegler
advances the teaching of a kind of deep cultural grammar that might
enable creativity, invention, and thinking beyond existing paradigms. In
Stiegler's view [a **deep knowledge** of culture is able to **oppose**
processes of **proletarianisation** where people are confronted with
**abstract** **information** because it sutures humans into a universe
of common understandings]{.underline}, shared meanings, and a history to
practical know-how. This can, in turn, enable further learning on the
basis of its provision of a resource for deep attention (concentration,
focus, discipline, and apprenticeship), retention (cultural memory), and
protention (the imagination of a future on the basis of a sense of past
and present), which we might relate to Marx's idea of work where humans
put thought, knowledge, and skill into practice (praxis) in order to
advance their species being and beyond this, the cause of wider
civilization, which is centrally, never separate from natural metabolism
(Foster & Burkett, 2017). [Under conditions of the
anthropocene]{.underline}, Stiegler's thesis is that [the **natural
ecosystem** has been more or less **entirely** **commodified** and
**made subordinate to capitalist coding systems** where everything has
**quantitative value** and can be **bought** and **sold** on the open
market.]{.underline} But in completing the process that started with the
original enclosures in early modern Britain (the original capitalist
caves), what [the **capitalist** **vision** of **complete
commodification** **neglects** to see is that the **anthropocene is
parasitic** on the **biosphere**, which **sustains life** and can **no
longer cope with** the **expansion** of the cycle of production,
consumption, waste, and pollution that knows no end.]{.underline} It is
because of this situation, where [the **economic** **system** **no
longer functions** on a scale **sustainable** for the **natural
ecosystem of the planet**,]{.underline} that Stiegler (2018) moves
towards ecology and frames this issue in speleological/epistemological
terms. [This is the case because **escape from the unsustainable**,
**collapsing** **humanist** **cave will involve transformative**
cultural education **founded** upon **embodied experience**,
**creativity**, and **invention** that are **sensitive to ecological
limits**, rather than **teaching** **strategies** committed to
**abstraction**, **pouring**, **drilling**, deskilling,
**robotisation**, and **automation** which **see the planet as
limitless.**]{.underline} The original modern utopian, Thomas More,
responded to the violence of the first capitalist caves (the enclosures)
by imagining a leap to some other place on the map (the island of
utopia) (More, 2016). In a similar way Stiegler's theory of
[**neganthropocene** involves **responding** to the **contemporary
epistemological** **impasse** of the **anthropocene** by first, setting
out a **speleological dystopia** and second, **imagining** the
**possibility** of **escape** into the real world.]{.underline} In the
first moment, [humans are **trapped** within the **final, humanist,
built cave of global capitalism** --]{.underline} [the anthropocene --
which is in the **process** of **destroying the very conditions of
life**.]{.underline} In the second moment, [Stiegler suggests an
**escape** **route** through cultural scaffolding, **experience-based
education,** **creativity**, and **invention** founded upon a
**painful** **recognition** of **natural finitude**]{.underline} (both
human and planetary). Building upon previous works, in The
Neganthropocene [Stiegler]{.underline} (2018) identifies this escape
route with a new politics of knowledge and education where cultural
history, experience in the world, praxis, creativity, and invention are
central. In the next section of the article, I propose to explain
Stiegler's history of the anthropocene in order to provide context for
the political struggle between knowledge founded upon on the one hand
abstraction, information, and automation, and on the other hand
embodiment, experience, and praxis. 2. [The crisis of the
Anthropocene]{.underline} and the possibility of the Neganthropocene
Extremism, exposure, and escape towards a post- or non-human world. This
is how Stiegler conceives of the pharmakon of the
anthropocene/neganthropocene. For Stiegler, [we find **trauma** at the
start and the end of the **thermodynamic** **system** of the
anthropocene.]{.underline} [The human is the result of a **traumatic**
**break** and will **end in the same way**.]{.underline} Consider the
first volume of Technics and Time, The Fault of Epimetheus (1998). Here,
Stiegler mythologises the origin of humanity through reference to
Plato's Protagoras (Plato, 2009) and the myth of Epimetheus, the less
able brother of Prometheus. In this respect Stiegler reimagines the
story of the cave. Where Plato's cave man starts off caught underground
before escaping from his subterranean prison, Epimetheus and Prometheus
conspire to leave humans naturally lacking, only to throw them into
excess through the gift of technology and the power of invention. In the
story of Epimetheus and Prometheus, [the **initial** **problem** of the
human is that it is **exposed** and **cannot survive** on its **own**.
The human is caught in an **ecological** **bubble** or umwelt that
**cannot** **sustain** its **life**. The human infant is naked, weak,
and **will soon die** in the natural world. The result of this
**situation** is that **technology**, **invention**, and **creativity**
**become necessary.**]{.underline} [Prometheus hands them to humanity
and they represent a survival strategy that humans have been pushing
ever since.]{.underline} In his anthropological discussion in Technics
and Time, which rests on a reading of LeroiGourhan (1993) work, Stiegler
makes the point that hominisation (humanisation) started when the early
humans broke out of the ecosystem through tool use and began to create
their own world (the human system), that would eventually comprise
culture, language, and information. It is on the basis of this fault in
the original ecosystem that we can understand the essential modernity,
invention, and creativity of our ([human) history]{.underline}, which
[has always been **premised** upon the **need to solve problems** and
make up for our]{.underline} essential lack relative to our [**lost
relation to mother earth**, the ecosystem.]{.underline} However, [it is
precisely the focus on **modern** **technology** that
Stiegler]{.underline} (2018) [wants to throw into **question** in his
critique of the contemporary hyper-industrial society and the
**anthropocene**.]{.underline} Perhaps the original response to the
human mistake led to an even more serious mistake? Although Epimetheus
and Prometheus may have blundered into the creation of the creative
creature, and humans have been caught in a struggle between lack and
excess ever since, Stiegler's Heideggerian problem is that [the
**modern** expression of **creativity** is **not in itself**
**particularly** **creative**, but rather **clearly** **bounded** and
**limited** by a **technological** **system** founded upon what we
**might** **call** a **parasitical**, **abusive** **relationship** to
**nature**.]{.underline}

## Framework

### 2NC\-\--C/I

#### Debate should situate itself [within]{.underline} the paradox of acceleration, [actively resisting]{.underline} the resentful impulse for [complete stability]{.underline}- we [accept]{.underline} the innate tension between humanity's [desire for security]{.underline} and the [dynamic nature]{.underline} of the world

**Glezos 14** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
5-22-2014, Sagepub Journals, \"Brown's Paradox: Speed, ressentiment and
global politics\",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1755088214533042)//guyB>

- Look at borders DA notes for explanation of Brown's paradox

- Says that we should accept the paradox rather than attempting to
  resolve it

  - Both attempts to resolve it, including the neoliberal denial of
    acceleration's impotence and the reactionary impulse of a
    "ressentiment against speed" fail

  - We need to accept the tension inherent in the world's flux and human
    desire for stability

  - It talks about how this lends to a cycle

    - More comfortability with unknowability -\> more political agency
      in the face of acceleration -\> more ACTUAL security (which isn't
      a bad thing) -\> more comfortability with unknowability

- Desire for security isn't necessarily bad, but ABSOLUTE security is an
  instance of ressentiment

[We must therefore begin to cultivate a third way, **a response which
does not so much try to resolve Brown's Paradox, as
re-inflect**.]{.underline} Such an approach would seek to **[embrace the
power and opportunities which an accelerating world
provides]{.underline}**, [using them to resist the exploitation and
violence inherent in the contemporary world.]{.underline} However, at
the same time as it sought some amount of security for individuals, [it
would be willing to accept that a certain amount of contingency and
instability in the world is ineradicable]{.underline}. It would
[**ensure that this desire for stability did not manifest as a
reactionary drive for the exclusion and erasure of difference**, nor
through a totalitarian drive for complete mastery over
contingency]{.underline}. It would thus be [a politics that attempted to
express itself as]{.underline}, in Nietzsche's words, [an "active
force]{.underline}," which is to say [a force which expresses itself,
which builds a world to its specifications, but does so with an
understanding, and even affirmation, of the limitations of life in "this
world]{.underline}." Such a politics therefore would [rigorously have to
root out the sense of ressentiment against speed]{.underline}, and
[become comfortable with living, organizing, and taking action, in an
accelerating world of becoming]{.underline}. Learning to live within a
paradox (without resorting to tactics of violence or transcendence to
overcome or resolve the paradox) is no easy thing. In recent years, many
thinkers have tried to develop strategies for how to live within the
confines of paradoxes which they considered to be constitutive of
political life. William Connolly (1991), for example, repeatedly engages
with the question of what he terms "the paradox of identity," the
tension between the fact that we must simultaneously "accept the
indispensability of identity and live within the medium of identity
while refusing (while struggling vigorously to refuse) to live \[our\]
own identity as intrinsic truth" (p. 46). Chantal Mouffe (2005)
struggles with what she terms "the democratic paradox," the tension
between democracy as that which expresses the will of the people and
that which protects and expresses the rights and agencies of the
individual (pp. 2--3). Although each of these paradoxes relate to
specific topics, [they are fundamentally linked to the issues I raise,
insofar as all are about **the tension between the human desire for
stability and certainty**]{.underline} (stable identities, stable
communities, stable borders), **[and the recognition that individual
flows will always disrupt those certainties]{.underline}** (and the
further recognition that suppressing those flows entirely would require
escalating, and ultimately infinite, violence). All [are thus about the
tension between being and becoming. We can therefore look to the way
these other thinkers seek to deal with paradox. In both cases, these two
thinkers advocate **the importance of recognizing the ineradicability of
paradox**]{.underline}. Mouffe (2005) says that ["it is vital for a
pluralist democratic politics to expose and acknowledge
paradoxes]{.underline}" (p. 16), and Connolly (1991) argues that [we
must learn to think "within the code of paradox]{.underline}" (p. 60).
Note that [this recognition of paradox, this attempt to live within
paradox, **does not involve a complete letting go or rejection of our
desires of stability**. To do so would be to succumb to the temptation
to will away the paradox (as in the neoliberal approach)]{.underline}.
Connolly recognizes the inescapable dimension of identity, Mouffe
accepts (and lauds) the importance of a sense of community, and I
understand the importance of some sense of stability to the lives of
individuals and communities. However, [living within the paradox also
means acknowledging that these certainties will always be marked by an
inescapable degree of contingency]{.underline}. This [**does not mean
letting go of our desire for stability, but it does mean loosening our
attachment to it**, recognizing the necessity (and indeed desirability)
of some amount of difference, individuality, and flux in the world. This
loosening of attachment is not easy, and **cannot simply be the result
of policy prescription**. It will also mean **challenging dominant
narratives of identity, and working on the affective sensibilities of
individuals and communities to make them more capable of coping with a
certain amount of uncertainty and instability in the world**. A second
trajectory of future research on speed will therefore have to focus on
**how to draw on narrative and affective resources to inculcate a sense
of comfort with uncertainty**, and fight against the pull of
ressentiment]{.underline}. 16 In an ideal world, [this project of
**loosening people's attachments to stability** would begin to integrate
with the project of **making them less subject to the violence of global
acceleration,** creating a self-reinforcing cycle]{.underline}.17 As
people become more secure, [they become **less subject to
ressentiment-laden tendencies**]{.underline}. At the same time, [as they
affectively fight off the ressentiment-driven desire for stability,
**they potentially become more willing to engage in active political
tactics which might actually provide for greater security and
stability**]{.underline}. Lessened ressentiment against speed might
[provide the conditions of possibility for greater solidarity and
alliance building across borders and differences, a greater willingness
to take advantage of some of the powers which global acceleration
provides]{.underline}. Here we might look to [increasing examples of
global solidarity networks (Castells, 2012; Glezos, 2012: ch. 5) and to
transnational labor activism (Stillerman, 2003). Let us be clear; this
possibility of a feedback loop associated with living within paradox
should not be taken as a resolution of that paradox.]{.underline} We
must remember that this paradox is fundamentally irresolvable, and thus
that it will be the source of an ongoing political struggle over crucial
questions ("How much stability is enough?"; "How much velocity is
desirable?"). [This struggle will always run the risk of falling into
either ressentiment against speed or indifference to the pain that it
causes. This is as it should be.]{.underline} As Mouffe (2005) puts it,
when it comes to paradox ["\[N**\]o final resolution or equilibrium
between those two conflicting logics is ever possible**, and there can
be only temporary, pragmatic, unstable and precarious negotiations of
the tension between them" (p. 45). The best that we can do is try to
ensure that we live that paradox deliberately]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Borders DA

- Cites the MV Sun Sea, a ship containing refugees

- Canadian citizens and the conservative government mischaracterized
  them as terrorists and human traffickers

- Glezos' example of the second of two reactions to Brown's paradox (the
  phenomenon about how as *the world* accelerates, humans become less
  politically motivated)

  - The first is a positive sidestepping of the paradox; neoliberalism
    convinces people that the lack of political motivation is a
    testament to the *success* of technological progress

    - Glezos concludes that this is an incorrect resolution to the
      paradox; the lack of political motivation in contemporary society
      *[cannot]{.underline}* be a result of stability and
      comfortability, because there are large demographics of people
      that exhibit political impotency while not living comfortably

    - "Thus, even when if you do not find yourself as one of the
      "losers" of the neoliberal economy---even if you manage to
      leverage your "wealth-producing assets" and take ownership over
      your own human capital---success is never secure, never stable.
      So-called progress inculcates a sense of anxiety and instability
      as to how long the "good times" will last (which makes one wonder
      exactly how "good" those times really are)."

  - The second is a more reactionary response- this is what we attempt
    to characterize framework as (even though the analogy isn't really
    1:1 imo)

    - It is about the invocation of sovereignty and authority in the
      face of acceleration

    - Because the world is seemingly so unstable, there is a trend
      towards strong figures able to give stability

    - This impulse to security leads states to build walls and cement a
      homogenous body politic

- This card is j the first part of the article, I think a better card
  will probably be below and have more application to
  discursive/academic spaces like debate

[One particularly common reactionary tactic intended to suppress the
acceleration of global flows is the dramatic rise in **the building of
fences and walls** by states,]{.underline} a phenomenon Brown engages
with in her recent book, Walled States, Waning Sovereignty. Brown (2010)
argues that [the proliferation of wall-building tactics is the **result
of states attempt to prop up their "waning sovereignty" against a world
of accelerating global flows**]{.underline} (p. 81). Though this occurs
in a multitude of different states and societies (including, among
others, the United States, Israel, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Botswana, Egypt, Brunei, China, Morocco, and
Brazil), in reaction to a variety of different particular local
contexts, [Brown (2010) identifies a common thread in the practice,
noting that **"\[t\]he popular desire for walling harbors a wish for the
power of protection, containment and integration promised by
sovereignty**]{.underline}" (pp. 8--19, 26). [Brown **identifies the
flurry of contemporary fence building as a response to the global
acceleration and flux**, lauded---and induced---by
neoliberalism]{.underline}. As she nicely puts it, "[Visible walls
respond to the need for containment in too global a world, too
unhorizoned a universe]{.underline}" (Brown, 2010: 119). [This
production of **walls constitutes only the most visible manifestations
of the proliferation of reactionary movements** and tactics attempting
to suppress difference, uncertainty, and flux (the three being
necessarily linked in an accelerating, globalizing world)]{.underline}.
In more general terms, [Chantal Mouffe (2005) describes how, in the
European context, **the "growth of various religious, moral and ethnic
fundamentalism" can be linked to the acceleration of globalization** and
neoliberalism's **"\[e\]xtreme forms of individualism**]{.underline}"
discussed above (p. 96). And a wide variety of thinkers have shown how,
[in diverse countries, anxiety over acceleration and uncertainty have
given rise to new reactionary political movements]{.underline}.6 It is,
of course, potentially dangerous to subsume all of these diverse
movements and activities under the same rubric. Unquestionably, specific
political activities will be rooted in specific historical contexts,
respond to specific local grievances, and draw on specific local
narratives (and what is more, of course, reactionary, conservative,
antidemocratic and fundamentalist political movements predate the
current era of acceleration). At the same time, [I believe that there is
something useful about linking these diverse political activities,
recognizing the way in which they are all at least partially responding
to a similar set of **anxieties over acceleration**]{.underline}. As
Brown (2010) points out in defense of her linking together acts of wall
building in wildly diverse political contexts, [despite "their
distinctive political and economic contexts, varied histories, various
states purposes and effects]{.underline} ... \[[E\]ach of the new walls
can be seen to issue from certain pressures on nations and states
**exerted by the process of globalization**]{.underline}" (p. 27).7 I
would argue that [the same can be said about the broader world of
reactionary politics, and about the phenomenon of "ressentiment against
speed"]{.underline} which I discuss below. To provide an example of the
kind of reactionary political stances I'm discussing, and to foreground
how they can be linked to questions of speed and acceleration, I now
wish to turn to a specific case study, that of the MV Sun Sea, a refugee
ship which arrived on the shores of Canada, sparking a wave of
anti-immigrant sentiments by both the Canadian government and populace.
I believe that [a close investigation of this case shows how, in
addition to a general xenophobia and racism, this response has to be
understood as tied to a more general anxiety over globalization and
acceleration]{.underline}. Furthermore, close investigation of this case
study will be helpful in articulating the central concept of
"ressentiment against speed." The choice of case study is very careful,
as the refugee frequently manifests as the abject representative of
accelerating globalization (see Nyers, 2003). As Brown (2010) puts it,
"almost nothing rivals the image of immigrant hordes as an incitement to
xenophobic nationalism and to demands for fierce state protectionism
amid globalization" (pp. 68--69). The MV Sun Sea In August 2010, [the MV
Sun Sea, a ship carrying 497 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka]{.underline}
(fleeing the violent reprisals which Tamil populations have been subject
to in the wake of the civil war (UNHCR, 2010[)), was captured and
boarded by the Canadian Navy]{.underline} off the coast of Vancouver
Island. The [refugees were immediately detained]{.underline}. Most have
now been released, and the courts are deciding whether to grant them
permanent refugee status. The initial response in Canada was, however,
disturbing to say the least. Almost immediately upon news of the Sun Sea
hitting the media, [Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the ruling
Conservative party began to fan the flames of fear. Canadian daily The
Globe and Mail reported that "\[t\]he Harper government said
intelligence sources give it reason to believe the passengers include
human traffickers and people linked to the Tamil Tigers terrorist
group]{.underline}" (Chase et al., 2010), this despite having little to
no knowledge of who was actually on the boat (suspicions are that the
intelligence source to whom Harper was referring was the Sri Lankan
government itself). Public Safety Minister Vic Toews claimed that the
Sun Sea was a "test case," saying, "\[T\]his particular situation is
being observed by others who may have similar intentions and I think
it's very important that Canada deals with the situation in a clear and
decisive way" (Chase et al., 2010). All the while, Harper ominously
intoned, "[We are responsible for the security of our
borders]{.underline}" (Lablanc, 2010). All of this [served to
effectively **frame the case** of the Tamil refugees not in terms of
human rights or social justice, but **as a question of
security**]{.underline}. With the specter of terrorists being smuggled
into the country, and with hordes more apparently just over the horizon,
[a disturbing portion of Canadians embraced the government's
fear-mongering]{.underline}. In an Angus Reid poll "Fifty per cent of
poll respondents want\[ed\] to deport the passengers and crew of the
Tamil ship back to Sri Lanka, even if their refugee claims are
legitimate" (Taber, 2010, author's emphasis). More broadly, "[46 per
cent of Canadians believe immigration is having a negative effect on the
country]{.underline}, a five-point increase from \[one year previous\]"
(Taber, 2010). Now[, we might wish to dismiss this as a momentary
xenophobic panic, whipped up in a fairly obvious bit of voter
manipulation by desperate politicians]{.underline}. The Conservative
party was, at the time, a minority government, having failed to win a
majority in the previous two elections, and saw their poll numbers
falling. We could therefore potentially write it off as a brief moment
of cynical politicking by a right-wing party seeking to gin up
controversy. Unfortunately, [there is a long history of this kind of
panicked response to migrants and refugees in Canada]{.underline},
happening in almost unnervingly similar ways, in seemingly regular
cycles. [Just a little over 10 years ago, there was another public
outcry over immigration, this time caused by the arrival of several
boats of Chinese migrants, again off the coast of Vancouver Island.
Their arrival again prompted sizable protests and numerous denunciations
in the press]{.underline}.8 These recurring uproars have to be put in
the context of Canada's overall immigration situation. Canada has one of
the highest per capita immigration rates in the world---a rate which is
rising. According to projections from Statistics Canada, by 2031 the
Canadian population will be between 25% and 28% foreign born.
Additionally, according to the report "nearly one-half (46%) of
Canadians aged 15 and over would be foreign-born, or would have at least
one foreign-born parent" (Statistics Canada, 2010). As a result,
[between 29% and 32% of the Canadian population would be visible
minorities]{.underline}, the first- and second-largest groups among
which would be those of Chinese and South Asian descent. [Here we see
what Hartmut Rosa (2003) identifies as one of the key elements of the
social acceleration of time**, the perception of a radical increase in
the rate of "social change and transformation**]{.underline}" (p. 7).
This perception [gives rise to a profound anxiety over an accelerating
world. The **perception** of the **loss of impermeable borders** leaves
people feeling adrift in a world of **accelerating global
flows**.]{.underline} In such a context, [there is **a tendency to seek
out authoritative narratives**, ones which will hopefully **reaffirm
traditional borders** and **boundaries, securing** both **space** and
**identity**]{.underline}. As Brown (2010) describes it, [a world of
accelerating global flows "threatens an imaginary of individual and
national identity **dependent upon perceivable horizons and the
containment they offer**]{.underline}" (p. 26). Thus, recently, the
Conservative government has proposed a draconian overhaul of refugee and
immigration policy in parliament (Baluja, 2012). [Such reactionary
movements **must be understood in the context of global acceleration**,
and **the desire to resist Brown's Paradox through authoritative
re-imposition of political authority**, even if only against the weakest
and most vulnerable instantiations of this broad process]{.underline}.9
The story of the MV Sun Sea could be repeated ad nauseam, both within
Canada, and around the world. [Anti-immigration movements, xenophobic
panics, and the scapegoating of migrants have become the norm. There
are, of course, countless specific reasons that these movements pop
up---particular histories of racism, nationalism, colonialism;
particular economic, cultural, political, social, and personal
assemblages which allow these movements to gain ground. But at least one
of the factors driving these reactionary movements is **an increasing
anxiety over acceleration**, and a sense of insecurity that comes with
the seeming dissolution of borders which provided stability for
narratives of identity, morality, community, and so forth]{.underline}.
As Brown (2010) puts it, in the current political context, ["xenophobia
is ... overdetermined by the economic and political insecurities
generated by globalization"]{.underline} (p. 69). What is more,
anti-immigration movements are not the only manifestation of this fear
and anxiety over acceleration. [Everywhere in contemporary political
culture, we see reactionary calls for "**security**" and "**stability"
in the face of acceleration**]{.underline}. This frequently [manifests
itself as a move away from democratic deliberation and toward
centralized authoritarian power]{.underline}. We have seen this in the
rightward turn in Canadian politics over the last decade.10

### 2NC\-\--Revenge DA

#### [Revenge DA]{.underline}: their framework standards [scapegoat]{.underline} critical debate and leave the door open for authoritative figures to assert themselves- our attempts at engagement will [never be enough]{.underline} which culminates in hateful exclusion [within debate]{.underline}

**Glezos 14** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
5-22-2014, Sagepub Journals, \"Brown's Paradox: Speed, ressentiment and
global politics\",)//guyB \*\* edited for gendered language

- Explains ressentiment as a "reactive power" which "separate\[s\]
  active force from what it can do"

  - This probably internal link turns their political engagement offense

- Positive change will never be enough because those plagued with
  ressentiment feel a generalized hatred of the world instead of
  particular scenarios

  - Maybe characterize the invocation of fairness as an a priori issue
    an example of shifting goalposts

  - "But these moralizing expressions... at least for a while longer" is
    a good part for this

[This is the greatest danger of ressentiment]{.underline} from a
Nietzschean perspective. [Unlike that active power which a sense of
resentment can potentially inculcate, **ressentiment functions as a
reactive power**.]{.underline} [Deleuze]{.underline} (2002), in his
analysis of Nietzsche, [develops an important insight when he says that
reactive powers are those which "decompose, **they separate active force
from what it can do**; they take away a part or almost all of its
power]{.underline}" (p. 57). [By orienting us toward idealized
spaces/times, and **rejecting intervention** in "this world,"
**ressentiment thus separates us from our power**, from what we can
do.]{.underline} [This is the crucial point which brings us back to
Brown's Paradox, with its description of a state of affairs where we
seem to have so much power at our fingertips, and yet seem able to do so
little with it]{.underline}. Note the fact that [ressentiment separating
us from what we can do does not mean that we stop doing
things]{.underline}. Indeed, [quite the opposite. When under the sway of
ressentiment we are just as prone to take action in the
world]{.underline}. This is because [in ressentiment **we have judged
the world and found it wanting**. We find this world of becoming and
speed to be a world of evil and suffering. This is why ressentiment also
manifests as a spirit of revenge]{.underline}. [We feel that the world
has punished us and **we wish to punish it back**, and this frequently
means seeking to punish those who are viewed as agents or avatars of
that evil]{.underline}. Once again, this is different than the active
behavior that might be undertaken in response to resentment. [There the
idea is to stop those who injure us, or overcome those things or people
who block our way]{.underline}. It is never just the reactive desire for
revenge, but always the active desire to achieve some goal, to further
our plans, to assert our values. [**The reactive movement of
ressentiment manifests as revenge**. It is thus premised upon a moral
judgment, and **is itself a moralizing move**]{.underline} (i.e. [one
acts primarily to punish an evil rather than achieve an
end]{.underline}). Indeed, it is this ability to [moralize suffering, to
assign blame that is so useful to the agent of
ressentiment]{.underline}. Nietzsche (1997) explains the difference
between resentment and ressentiment quite well in the passage below: In
my judgement, [we find here the actual physiological causation of
ressentiment, revenge and their ilk, in **a yearning**, then, **to
anaesthetize pain through emotion**]{.underline}:---[people generally
look for the same thing, wrongly in my view, in the defensive return of
a blow, a purely protective reaction**, a "reflex movement"** in the
case of any sudden injury or peril, such as that performed even by a
headless frog to ward off corrosive acid]{.underline}. But [the
difference is fundamental: in the one case the attempt is made to
prevent harm being done, in the other case, the attempt is made to
anaethetize a tormenting, secret pain that is becoming unbearable with a
more violent emotion of any sort, and at least rid the consciousness of
it for a moment]{.underline}---[for this, one needs an emotion, the
wildest possible emotion and, in order to arouse it, the first available
pretext]{.underline}. "[**Someone or other must be to blame that I feel
ill**."]{.underline} (p. 93) This [desire to seek out somebody to blame
is the pattern we see time and again in the reactionary politics of
ressentiment]{.underline}. It is what we saw above in the case of the MV
Sun Sea, and in other anti-immigration movements like it: [the attempt
**to identify and blame particular actors as representative of what are
broader movements and social forces**, to take the individual migrant as
a synecdoche of global acceleration as a whole]{.underline}. To return
to Wendy Brown's (2001) analysis: If, as Nietzsche recognized, impotent
rage inevitably yields a moralizing (re)action, how might we succeed in
rereading contemporary political life through this recognition? Might it
help us understand, for example[, the contemporary tendency to personify
oppression in the figure individuals and to reify it in particular acts
and utterances, the tendency to render individuals and acts intensely
culpable---indeed prosecutable---for history and for social
relations?]{.underline} (pp. 21--22) And what is more, [**we tend to
personify that oppression in the weakest**, most vulnerable
constituencies, themselves caught up in the same history and social
relations as their attackers]{.underline}. This is because, having
separated active force from what it can do, [the politics of
ressentiment naturally takes as its enemies those who are weakest, those
who are most easily targeted and punished]{.underline}. In relation to
these nationalist and xenophobic movements, it is instructive that, for
Nietzsche (1997), one of the most important contemporaneous examples of
the politics of ressentiment was the anti-Semite (p. 48). But [these
moralizing expressions of revenge and punishment, and the feeling of
power which comes along with them, does not actually lead to the
empowerment of the bearer of ressentiment]{.underline}. This is because
**[the standards that it sets can never be achieved]{.underline}**. A
mindset overcome by ressentiment [says that only a world free of
suffering, of uncertainty, of insecurity, is of any value]{.underline}.
[One does not want less pain, but no pain]{.underline}. **[Not less
insecurity, but no insecurity]{.underline}**. Thus, [no matter what is
done, **it will always fall short** of this goalpost]{.underline}.
[Actual **positive change**]{.underline} which might improve their lot,
or increase their power, [is eschewed because it **will never provide
them with ideal world they crave**]{.underline}. [Better to engage in
moralizing punishment which does nothing to solve their
pain,]{.underline} but, as Nietzsche says, [**at least anesthetizes
them** somewhat, **gives them a feeling of moral superiority** which
will keep them going, at least for a while longer]{.underline}.13 What
is more, [this **craving---for certainty, for stability**, and most
importantly, for **moral superiority**---makes these sufferers of
ressentiment **easy prey for those who wish to exploit them and gain
their support**]{.underline}. Nietzsche discussed this in terms of "the
Priests," but in our days, in democratic countries (and not just
democratic countries), [it is more useful to speak of the politician of
ressentiment, **the politician who does not just respond to the anxiety
and fear of ~~his or her~~ \[their\] public, but actively cultivates**
it]{.underline}. As Nietzsche (1997) describes it, He brings ointments
and balms with him, of course; but first he has to wound so that he can
be the doctor' and whilst he soothes the pain caused by the wound, he
poisons the wound at the same time---for that is what he is best trained
to do, this magician and tamer of beasts of prey, whose mere presence
necessarily makes everything healthy, sick, and everything sick, tame.
(p. 93) [The politician of ressentiment provides ever more targets and
scapegoats for moralizing punishment]{.underline}, knowing that it will
never actually solve the problems of ~~his or her~~ \[their\]
constituency (my god, if it did, what then?). Indeed, [it is not at all
coincidental that reactionary politicians of ressentiment frequently
institute neoliberal policies]{.underline}, [making the conditions of
insecurity and acceleration which give rise to the ressentiment against
speed even more prevalent. **The politician of ressentiment relies on,
and exploits**, ~~his or her~~ \[their\] constituency's **craving for
certainty** and stability, by presenting himself or herself as the
potential source of the authority that will usher in this other
world.]{.underline} The politicians of ressentiment [present themselves
to their constituency as "their support, defence, prop, compulsion,
disciplinarian, tyrant, God]{.underline}" (Nietzsche, 1997: 92).
**[People feel themselves incapable of bringing into being the world of
security they desire, and therefore become willing to submit to anyone
who claims that ability]{.underline}**. How else to explain The Globe
and Mail endorsement which simultaneously decries the "antidemocratic"
behavior of the Conservative party, while craving the "discipline,
leadership and bullheadedness" that they bring to government? In this
regard, [we see the final stage of ressentiment, and the final
ascendancy of "The Priests," of the politician of
ressentiment]{.underline}: "[**I suffer: someone or other must be
guilty**"---and every sick sheep thinks the same]{.underline}. But his
shepherd the ascetic priest, says to him, "[Quite right, my sheep!
Somebody must be to blame: but you yourself are this somebody, you
yourself alone are to blame for it, you yourself alone are to blame for
yourself]{.underline}." (Nietzsche, 1997: 94) When we authorize
increasingly centralized and authoritarian governments, when we do not
jealously guard our civil liberties and democratic rights, what are we
saying, other than that we accept that we are the problem with politics,
that we ourselves are to blame? [Give us, then, a "leader" who will
provide us with the security we crave]{.underline}.14 Once again,
[ressentiment as that which separates an active force from what it can
do, as that which separates people and communities from their
power.]{.underline} And [this is the irony of the ressentiment against
speed. **As people feel impotent in the face of acceleration, they
become more willing to give up what power they do have to increasingly
authoritarian structures** or, when they do express their power, do so
by attacking the weakest elements of the systems they oppose, usually in
ways which actually shore up the systems they are supposed to be
opposing.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Improvement Bad

#### The will to self-improve is a smokescreen for the move to a data-driven life -- that culminates in the violent transformation of subjectivity into the "thinglike"

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Pages 33-34, October 2021, MG)

[Palpable signs that we are already living in the midst of the
singularity are provided by the growing cultural appeal of what has been
described as the "quantified self movement." In this scenario,
bodies]{.underline} strap on their mobile prosthetics, digitally tattoo
themselves with an array of wearable electronic sensors, calibrate their
social media lives by complex, flexible forms of digital self-tracking
made possible by those new clouds of digital cumulus drifting across the
global sky, and [turn the previously unmeasured, untracked, and perhaps
even unnoticed into vibrant streams of shareable data. Essentially, the
surface of the body, as well as its previously private interiority, is
transformed into GPS data in the greater games of augmented reality.
Except, this time, data bodies are not so much using mobile phones to
scan graphics that open onto a previously invisible world of graffiti,
games, and advertising, but **envelop the body** in a big GIF (graphics
interchange format) of its very own -- a digital penumbra of numbers
about eating, sleeping, loving, and working that provides an electronic
shadow for tracking bodily activities. Suddenly, we find ourselves
living in an age of the body and its digital shadow; this complex cloud
of hyper-personalized data points is not just accumulated by mobile
bodies as they track their way through life but is always spinning away
from the body in fantastic reconfigurations of comparative databases
that may be perfect receptacles for social sharing but are also
measuring points for **better individual living**.]{.underline}

[Thought of in purely astronomical terms, the quantified self movement
is like a protostar  -- a dense concentration of "molecular clouds where
stars form."]{.underline}9 Here, the newly emergent data self quickly
throws off qualitative cultural debris from its past, [thus committing
itself to the daring gamble of seeking to quantify the
unquantifiable]{.underline}, to literally construct a DIY body, one
measurement at a time, that takes close account of lessons to be
learned, data to be shared, measurements to be undertaken, numbers to be
calculated, [**results to be reflected upon**, and **activities to be
improved**, upgraded, and overcome by its digital double -- life by
numbers.]{.underline} In any event, for a society in which complex
mergers between machine intelligence and human bodies are underway, [one
important adaptive response on the part of an always flexible human
species is to **transform subjectivity** in the direction of that which
is required for smooth admission to the end times of technological
singularity. If the language of power is data, if the language of
connection is convergence, and if the privileged value is speed, then
what could be better than a coherent, comprehensive, and creative plan
for reproducing a form of "self" that eerily mimics the etymological
meaning of data as "**thinglike**"? Refusing the intuitive, throwing off
the ineffable, and breaking forever with the imaginary, the quantified
self movement **reverses the traditional order of human subjectivity**
by making the thing-like character of quantifiable data both the
precondition and goal of individual identity in the age of nonbiological
intelligence.]{.underline} Unlike traditional Christian monasteries that
provided physical shelter in good times and bad for the idea of the
sacred and its associated religious institutions, the quantified self
movement promulgates, [in effect, a new order of digital monasticism
that puts down roots in the psychic dimension of human subjectivity
itself.]{.underline} With being data its primal act of faith, with the
meticulous, even obsessive, calculation of life's quanta -- be it
empathy, happiness, sex, or cardiovascular health -- as its social
practice, and with meetups of members of the quantified self movement as
its mode of confessional, [this new monastic order heralds the eclipse
of traditional expressions of human subjectivity and the triumphant
emergence of the thing-like -- the "**data-driven life**" as the form of
(technological) self now taking flight at the dawn of the
singularity.]{.underline}

But wait. If you were to attend one of the global quantified self
meetups -- and they are everywhere now -- the reality is most likely the
opposite. [The overall thematic might be the quantified life, but what
resonates is the sense of **individuals trying to find themselves**,
perhaps puzzled by the complications of daily life, and attempting as
best they can, one self-confession at a time, to put the whole thing
together for themselves by talking and sharing data. For example, each
participant has five to ten minutes to discuss three core predetermined
questions: "What did you do? How did you do it? What did you
learn?"]{.underline}10 It is as if network communications are not so
much about the cold indifference of relational data points but about its
actual content -- [that whole stubbornly individual, always vulnerable,
terribly anxiety-prone mass of highly individuated individuals. There is
definitely a general yearning for **self-improvement in the
air**,]{.underline} definitely a sense that the basic themes of Norman
Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking, with its homage to
projected self-confidence and adaptive behaviour, has escaped the power
of the written text and taken up an active alliance with proponents of
the quantified life. Or maybe it's something different. Perhaps talking
by data is the most recent manifestation of Dale Carnegie's How to Win
Friends and Influence People, with its insightful strategies for winning
other people over to your own way of doing things by first and foremost
winning yourself over to yourself.

### 2NC\-\--Scenario Analysis Bad

#### The way we discuss the future matters -- analyzing hypothetical scenarios primes us for neurological modification

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise

[Sound dystopian?]{.underline} It promises an unfolding technological
future powered up by optogenetics where, with neural implant devices yet
to be created, [the brain will be opened up to **radical psychic
surgery** by lightactuated technologies with the aim of **disappearing
lived memory**, substituting in its place artificial memories --
"sensory percepts" -- of a past that will probably be all the more
vivid, compelling, calming, soothing, and haunting precisely because it
never actually happened.]{.underline} However, in the usual way of
things technological, [if optogenetics as a dystopian gateway into
neural modification of the brain can sound so ready-made menacing, that
is probably because it is a latecomer to the **real-live games of
politics** in the age of neural modification by those other circulating
light-actuated screens of mass media. Here, producing false memory
syndrome, memories of events that are **all the more real** because they
**never actually occurred**, is the normal business of contemporary
media imaginaries. The skilful combination of spectacular televised
spectacles, mass suggestion, and mesmerizing rhetoric provide an instant
gateway into the politically effective **neurological modification** of
cerebral cortices living under the personal and collective stress of
impotent anger, unabated rage, and hysterical anxiety. For example,
consider the implantation of synthetic percepts in the form of false
memory syndrome so spectacularly performed on that always fabled day of
moral reckoning in American political consciousness]{.underline}, 4 July
2020, where, with memories of other Independence Days from Sherman's
military conquest of Atlanta to the Declaration of Independence itself,
[President Trump took to the symbolically hallowed, and deeply
colonized, ground of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills of North Dakota
to rework American political memory with silence on the pandemic,
mockery of Black Lives Matter, and the declaration of a new civil war
based on warring racial relationships and featuring a beleaguered and
threatened population of vulnerable white Americans assaulted by
menacing]{.underline} [hordes]{.underline}  -- Black Lives Matter and
their allies in the streets as part of a resurgent "leftwing fascism" --
coming to steal American history, to obliterate cultural memory itself.
Everything was there: televised spectacle with the carved presidential
faces on Mount Rushmore in the background, a mass crowd as a real-life
stand-in for the hoped-for mass audience of American television viewers,
and [mesmerizing rhetoric of the war spirit based on equal mixtures of
panic fear and proud belligerence that was immediately circulated
everywhere through the media stream]{.underline}. This contemporary
inversion of the Sermon on the Mount, with its emphasis this time on the
war spirit not the love spirit, did not have to wait for future
breakthroughs in the neuroscience but deployed light-based technologies
ready at hand, the screen culture of television and social media, as its
very own neural implants for [communicating **new memories**  -- true
for some, false for others -- from the digital world to the only psychic
structure that really counts politically, the liquid, fluid brain matter
of American mass society, in order to accomplish the neurological
modification of the collective American cerebral cortex. That the neural
implant was successful could be immediately verified by those
**experimental demonstrations** in the streets: white jaguars being
driven into crowds of protesters and shootings of anti-racism protesters
by palpably anxious white men and women armed with guns locked and
loaded.]{.underline}

[In contemporary quantum culture, there are no necessary causal links,
only deeply entangled relationships among fast-moving particles moving
in the same web of space and time: positional, relative, and
connected.]{.underline} This vector of twisted memories, as its moves at
high velocity through the mediascape, sometimes takes the form of a
futurist announcement from DARPA concerning engineering neural implants
for fast communication between digital reality and the brain; at other
times, it's streamed in all its hauntingly prophetic vividness by the
cinematic imaginary and, then again, makes its presence felt affectively
as the basic code of contemporary political neurology. [Here,
neuroscience, futurist cinema, and political campaigning are themselves
different twists taken in this entangled story of twisted memory:
recombinant in its movements, bendable in time and space, and always
travelling at high velocity]{.underline}. Of course, as with all
important technological changes, neuroscientific research in
optogenetics remains at the periphery of human attention until, [once
fully realized, the consequential results are moved instantly from the
edges of human awareness to its very centre]{.underline}. Perhaps more
than is realized, optogenetics promises to be the capstone of
technology's relentless movement from the exterior of the body to its
deepest interiority, involving as it does the stated engineering aim of
providing a gateway into the cerebral cortex, [not only **changing
behaviour** but providing for the potential implanting of **new visual
memories**. Following the ideological formula that eases public
accommodation to radical technological change]{.underline}, optogenetics
was introduced in the language of facilitation, namely the promise of
facilitating medical breakthrough. Once successfully adopted, the real
implications of optogenetics as command language of the approaching age
of neural modification will be imposed: neural implants for remembering
a past that never existed, algorithms for mood modification,
three-dimensional light-based treatments for screening away the
differences. [The once and future migration of neuroscience from the
language of **facilitation** to **command** will itself be facilitated
by the fact that we are now preparing to **enter a future we have
already long visually inhabited** through the cinematic imaginary and
which, moreover, we have already experienced at a deep affective level
through the fabulations of twisted memory as the emotional alphabet of
contemporary politics.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Framework Bad

#### Framework is equivalent to Robot Prison Guards -- monitoring debaters for outward psychic rebellions that break the norm and responding with rage, psychic violence, and exclusion

**Kroker and Kroker 21** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct
professor of political science at the University of Victoria, Marilouise
Kroker - feminist scholar, publisher, editor, writer, theorist, and
performance artist, "Technologies of the New Real", University of
Toronto Press, Page 129, October 2021, MG)

Quickly migrating beyond the use of robots to physically guard
prisoners, this prototype project represents that moment when [robots
first began to evolve beyond their purely mechanical function as prison
guards to the more complex task of carrying out **psychiatric
assessments**]{.underline} of the behavioural patterns of prison
inmates. While it could be expected that robots would first enter
prisons in the traditional roles of surveillance and control, the three
robots involved in the demonstration project have a very different task:
namely, to mingle among a captive population as only a five-foot robot
can do and, while "looking more friendly to the inmates," conduct an
active search for signs of suicidal and violent behaviour. It's not so
much, then, a demonstration concerning the feasibility of using robots
in prison environments but actually an experiment with very general
applications for perfecting an operating system allowing robots to
conduct complex psychiatric examinations of prisoners. [At this point,
we move beyond cinematic images of prisons of the future with robotic
guards in towers carefully monitoring prison populations to that moment
when technology actively **penetrates the human psyche** in search of
"**risky behaviour**." Here, robots are no longer mechanical devices,
but artificial psychiatrists equipped with 3D vision, motion detection,
and programmed operating systems, all aimed at discerning visible signs
of melancholy, rage, despair, desperation, fatigue, and hopelessness.
While it is not evident from media reports how robots are to fulfil
complex psychiatric examinations -- other than the mention of the
demonstration robots monitoring abrupt changes in the behaviour of
individual prisoners -- the intention is clear: for prison guard robots
to cross the boundary between **surveillance from the outside of captive
bodies to internal explorations of psychic behaviour**. Guided by a
prescriptive doctrine concerning the parameters of "risky behaviour,"
what is really being tested here is robots as avatars of the new normal,
conducting frequent visual examinations of a chosen, and necessarily
captive, population in order to determine which bodies **fall inside and
outside of the normative intelligibility** determined by the
artificially defined ethics of "**risky behaviour**." In this case, it
is the responsibility of those bodies placed under surveillance to
provide no outward signs of either visible dissent (violence) or refusal
of the state's power over life (suicide).]{.underline}

While at first glance it might seem that guard robots are not programmed
with levels of artificial intelligence and, perhaps, artificial
affectivity necessary to detect otherwise invisible signs of powerful
emotions internal to the psychic life of prisoners, what may be brought
into political presence here is an entirely new conception concerning
how power will operate in the robotic future: [not so much the great
referentials of power over death, or even power over life, but power
over visible expressions of human affectivity -- a form of robotic
control that **assumes the psyche** is not a form of internal being but
a kind of external doing; that is, the psyche is not something we have
but something we do]{.underline}. In this scenario, what is important
about the human psyche for purposes of the society of control is less
the complexities of hidden intentions -- [the cultural acedia associated
with feelings of melancholy, **resentments that activate rage**, total
powerlessness that motivates despair -- than those visible, outward
manifestations of the rebellious psyche, that moment when the bodily
psyche moves from the long, silent gestation of hidden intentionality to
overt declarations of its intention to act, whether through violence
or]{.underline} suicide. At that point, at least according to this
prototype demonstration, [robot guards will be waiting along the
watchtower of the society of control, quickly targeting **immanent signs
of psychic rebellions** against the order of normative intelligibility,
relaying warnings to central command, all the while standing by for
further instructions.]{.underline}

[Turning to Spinoza as a way of helping to understand and combat the
rise of ressentiment against speed might appear to be a curious
decision]{.underline} as, at first blush, [it **seems as if Spinoza's
metaphysics are themselves an instance of ressentiment against
speed**]{.underline}. This is because [explicit in Spinoza's monistic
ontology is a complete rejection of contingency]{.underline}. Spinoza
[views all things as unfolding according to a strict conception of
necessity.]{.underline} As he says, '\[[n\]othing in nature is
contingent, but all things are from the necessity of the divine nature
determined to exist and to act in a definite way']{.underline} (I P29).
Everything that happens is fully determined according to the
requirements of being. [**Our perception of contingency is merely the
result of our inability to grasp the complete web of causality that
determines any action**, outcome, or decision]{.underline}. Indeed, [in
Spinoza's metaphysics, **even God is not capable of
contingency**]{.underline} saying, 'God does not act from freedom of
will' (I P32C1) but [rather from the necessity of his
nature]{.underline}. [Despite this rejection of ontological contingency,
Spinoza's work is actually surprisingly useful in helping us understand
how people react to contingency in an accelerating world]{.underline}.
This is because of the way in which his epistemology works alongside his
ontology. [For Spinoza, **humans are always constrained by our
finiteness**, and hence our understanding will always be premised upon
inadequate knowledge]{.underline}. As such, **[the perception of
contingency in life is ineradicable]{.underline}**. [It is true that,
through rational thought we are able, in a certain way, to **perceive
things sub specie aeternitatis**]{.underline}. But [this **only relates
to understanding the formal logical rules which govern
existence**]{.underline}. It [**does not lead us to be able to actively
grasp** (or predict) all of the web of **causal factors** which lead any
individual 'thing' to occur]{.underline} (II P16--17). (And all of this
before Spinoza's doctrine of parallelism, with its determinations and
limitations of thought, is brought into the mix.) From this perspective,
**[our perception of infinite being will always be
incomplete]{.underline}**, and [we **will always see the world as full
of contingency**]{.underline}. It [does not matter if metaphysically
there is no freedom or indeterminacy]{.underline} in deus cive natura.
[Our lives as modal beings will **always be replete with

- Just defines ressentiment and resentment, says they're different
  things

[**Ressentiment should not be confused with resentment.** Resentment, a
sense of anger over pain or injury we may have suffered (of whatever
sort), is a **natural response**, as is **the attempt to challenge or**
overturn the sources of these **pains or injuries**]{.underline}.12
**[Nietzsche]{.underline}** (1976) [**does not council a kind of ascetic
rejection of judgment**, simply accepting everything as it
comes]{.underline}---in which case, we would become, in his words, the
ass which can only bray "Yeah-yuh" (p. 424)---[nor is he arguing for a
Christian "turning of the other cheek]{.underline}." [**Being angry**,
resentful, unhappy, and so on are all perfectly **acceptable** to
Nietzsche so long as---]{.underline}and this is crucial[---**they serve
as a spur to action**. So long as your resentment or anger becomes a
vector for productive intervention in the world, then they have the
potential to be good or noble.]{.underline} [The trouble with
ressentiment is that, counter to resentment, it does not act as a spur
to productive action]{.underline} (although it does still frequently
spur reactive behavior, a distinction I will shortly explain). Quite the
contrary, [**ressentiment is resentment crystallized and
spiritualized**, and thus focuses not on any particular agent or actor,
but rather simply on the **world as a whole**. Ressentiment expresses
itself as **a generalized resentment against a world** that **allows
pain** and suffering to occur]{.underline}. It frequently manifests as
[a rejection of the world, and the imagining of a world of perfection in
opposition to this "imperfect" world]{.underline}. Nietzsche (1968a)
makes clear how [this drive to idealization is linked to ressentiment
and the spirit of revenge. "To talk about 'another' world than this is
quite pointless ... we revenge ourselves on life by means of the
phantasmagoria of '**another**,' a '**better' life**"]{.underline} (p.
49). [This link between idealization and revenge is displayed quite
strongly]{.underline}, Nietzsche (1968b) says, in many of the major
works of metaphysics in the Western canon: Psychology of
Metaphysics---[This world is apparent: consequently there is a true
world]{.underline};---[this world is conditional; consequently there is
an unconditioned world]{.underline};---[this world is full of
contradiction: consequently there is a world free of
contradiction;---this world is a world of becoming: consequently there
is a world of being:---all false conclusions ...]{.underline} [**It is
suffering that inspires these conclusions**: fundamentally they are
**desires that such a world should exist**]{.underline}**;** in the same
way, [to **imagine another**, more valuable **world** is an expression
of **hatred for a world that makes one suffer**: the ressentiment of
metaphysicians against actuality is here creative]{.underline}. (pp.
310--311) ["It is suffering that inspires these conclusions" and
ressentiment is "expression of hatred for a world that makes one
suffer."]{.underline} [This is the danger of ressentiment and how it
differs from resentment. **Resentment is a part of living in the world**
for Nietzsche, a world which produces suffering and which therefore must
be responded to. But **ressentiment takes one out of the world**. It
orients one's actions to other worlds, worlds which do not
exist.]{.underline}

### FW -- A2: You Link Too -- 2NC

#### We don't link- our critique isn't of [all idealism]{.underline} but of their specific invocation of [stability]{.underline} and [normative dialogue]{.underline} in the face of a rapidly accelerating world

This quote brings out another important element of Nietzsche's thinking.
[Looking at Nietzsche's critique of idealism**, we might begin to take
him for a kind of vulgar realist**, criticizing flights of philosophical
fancy.]{.underline} This is to [**misunderstand** the complexity of
**Nietzsche's conception of the world of becoming**]{.underline}.
[Nietzsche **never takes what the "world" is for granted**]{.underline}
and, with his focus on creativity, [even were "one" to know what the
"world" is, the world---and "one"---would almost certainly change
immediately]{.underline}. But [**that is exactly the point**. Nietzsche
affirms that **the world is a world of change**, of becoming, of
uncertainty, of contingency (and therefore necessarily of suffering and
disappointment). **This is the world that we live in, and the world in
which we must act.**]{.underline}

### FW -- A2: Debate isn't political

#### Their description of debate as devoid of politics reveals their Socratic cowardice towards political speed

**Glezos 20** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and

Perceptions in an Accelerating World, pp 1-3\", )//guyB

- This card is eh idk at first I was gonna cut it to be an aff "debate
  isn't political" card but then I realized the bottom half of the card
  critiqued that idea so ig it goes neg

- Isolates urgency as a generative point of Socrates hatred, very linked
  to acceleration

It is a brief reference, almost an aside, in a dialogue mostly devoted
to questions of morality. In Gorgias, Socrates engages in a dialogue
with three rhetoricians, criticizing the art of rhetoric, and debating
the nature of morality. However, in the middle of this discussion,
[Socrates makes the statement earlier as a way of **distinguishing
rhetoric** (and sophistry) **from philosophy**]{.underline}, arguing
that the latter is about expertise and truth, while [the former is
**about flattery**]{.underline}. Though only briefly mentioned, this
passage is crucial for Socrates' argument, since [it explains why
rhetoric can't ultimately be about truth]{.underline}. This is because
[the conditions of these kinds of discussions (public debate in the
agora) are such as to make real understanding impossible]{.underline}.
Bruno Latour, in his discussion of the Gorgias, notes that [these
conditions are threefold**: number, priority, and urgency**. Such
discussions happen in the context of **large groups of people, about
important issues, and, crucially, frequently must happen quickly**
(either because they are responding to fast-moving events, or because
the people involved do not have the time to devote to the kind of
in-depth discussion and study that would be necessary to produce genuine
expertise]{.underline}). According to Socrates, [these conditions make
'real' understanding impossible]{.underline}. However, as Latour points
out, [such an approach means that Socrates has, out of hand, **dismissed
the very possibility of democratic politics**]{.underline}. As Latour
says [Yes, there are too many of them, the questions are too important
\[megala pragmata\], there is too little time \[oligô
chrono]{.underline}\]. [**Are these not, however, the normal conditions
of the Body Politic**? Is it not to deal with these peculiar situations
of number, urgency, and priority that the subtle skills of politics were
invented]{.underline}? ( Latour 1999: 221) [**Socrates' vision of truth
as purely the domain of the expert** -- the philosopher -- working
slowly and assiduously outside of the agora, ultimately means a
rejection of the practice of democratic politics]{.underline}. Of
course, [Socrates (or rather Plato's) anti-democratic politics have been
extensively discussed.]{.underline} Most of this commentary focuses on
[Plato's]{.underline} elitism, his **[rejection of the demos for its
failure to possess the understanding of the true and the good necessary
to be able to govern themselves]{.underline}**. However, the reason I
bring this dialogue up is to note [the less frequently remarked upon
condition that makes Socrates opposed to democratic politics: **the
condition of urgency**]{.underline}. [Rhetoric fails not just because it
tries to get 'so many people' to understand, but because **it attempts
to do so in 'such a short time'**]{.underline}**.** [The danger of
politics is exactly that it must, at least sometimes, be done
quickly]{.underline}. And [this problem of urgency is, arguably, a
greater problem for Socrates than number or priority]{.underline}. While
the conditions of [number and priority can be resolved through the
abolition of democracy and the imposition of a philosopher
king]{.underline}, this [does not necessarily solve the problem of
urgency]{.underline}. While certainly [there are many thinkers that
argue that a **centralization of political authority** is the correct
response to the problem of urgency,2 this **does not free us from the
problem of urgency**, but, at best, provides **a new set of tools for
responding to it**]{.underline}. What this means is that [it is
potentially the condition of urgency that shifts Socrates' position from
antidemocratic politics, to simply anti-politics]{.underline}.
**[Socrates hatred of politics qua politics is, I would argue, at root a
hatred of speed]{.underline}**. [To commit to the practice of politics
is ultimately to accept that **there will be times in which one cannot
avail oneself of leisurely reflection and analysis before making
decisions and taking action**]{.underline}. As a result[, by the end of
the Gorgias Socrates has thoroughly rejected the politics and
debates]{.underline} of the agora, and shifted his argument to the court
of the afterlife, describing how the moral man will be judged righteous
in the world to come. But as Latour puts it '[Politics is not about
"freshly dead" people, but about the living; not about ghoulish stories
of the afterworld, but about gory stories of this world']{.underline}
(1999: 246). [Socrates escapes the world of becoming to the world of
being exactly because he cannot ultimately cope with the conditions of
politics he experiences within it]{.underline}. And it is, ultimately,
[the speed of the world of becoming that Socrates seeks to transcend;
its uncertainty, its changeability and accelerations]{.underline}.3 R.
B. J. Walker describes Plato as a man who 'seek\[s\] to flee
Introduction 3 from politics into the world of forms' and refuses to
'take seriously the world of fleeting impressions, of flux, becoming,
and illusions' (1993: 109). Crucially, as Latour points out, [**the
problem is not just that Socrates seeks to 'flee from politics', but
that in fleeing he seeks to also destroy the practices that make
politics possible**. To see a political project through, with the crowd,
for the crowd, in spite of the crowd, is so stunningly difficult that
Socrates flees from it]{.underline}. But [**instead of conceding defeat
and acknowledging the specificity of politics, he destroys the means of
practicing it**, in a sort of scorched earth-policy the blackened
wreckage of which is still visible today]{.underline}. ( 1999: 239)
Having identified the problems of number, priority, and urgency which
constrain the process of democratic decision making[, Socrates attacks
the practices of rhetoric]{.underline} (as well as several other allied
arts) by which the Athenian community had learned to grapple with these
constraints because they do not meet the standards of his rigorous,
slow-moving, didactic philosophical knowledge. Says Latour of this kind
of necessarily speedy democratic, political deliberation: Of course 'it
does not involve expertise,' of course 'it lacks rational
understanding'; the whole dealing with the whole under the incredibly
tough constraints of the agora must decide in the dark and will be led
by people as blind as themselves, without the benefit of proof, of
hindsight, of foresight, of repetitive experiment, of progressive
scaling up[. In politics there is never a second chance -- only one,
this occasion]{.underline}, this Kairos. [There is never any knowledge
of cause and consequence. Socrates has a good laugh at the ignorant
politicians, but there is no other way to do politics, and the invention
of an afterworld to solve the whole question is exactly what the
Sophists laugh at, and rightly so]{.underline}! Politics imposes this
simple and harsh condition of felicity: hic est Rhodus, hic est saltus.
( 1999: 242) In short, [what we get is a surprisingly common worldview.
Truth and understanding can only be developed slowly. **Politics
necessarily happens quickly.** Therefore, Politics cannot be about truth
and understanding. In turn, the **tactics and practices which are
developed to make a speedy politics possible must be devalued and
degraded. Socrates' fear and anxiety of speed translates into his hatred
of politics**]{.underline} (especially democratic politics[) and vice
versa.]{.underline}

#### The skills they get from engaging our aesthetic performance are key to politics in an accelerating world

**Glezos 20** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
10-5-2020, Routledge, \"Speed and Micropolitics Bodies, Minds, and
Perceptions in an Accelerating World, pp 9-10\", )//guyB

This [rejection of rhetoric]{.underline} (and cookery) [because they are
based on habit and pleasure, and not on 'true understanding', ultimately
**means doing away with the tools that a community might use to deal
with fast-moving sphere of politics**]{.underline}. What is important
here [is the way in which the rejection of forms of practice which lack
'real understanding' is also frequently a rejection of modes of thought
and practice which are rooted in the body]{.underline}. [In rejecting
flattery -- whether cookery or rhetoric -- Socrates explicitly rejects
forms of practice **and understanding rooted in the affects**
(pleasure), and in habit (embodied forms of knowledge]{.underline}).
Indeed, [Plato's account of knowledge and morality ultimately ends up
not just with a flight from the world of becoming, but very explicitly
with **a flight from the body**,]{.underline} as he explains his vision
of judgement in the afterlife wherein 'the soul has been stripped of the
body' (131, 524d). Here we see the way in which [Socrates' **rejection
of politics is tied to his rejection of speed**, and both are tied to
his rejection of the body]{.underline}. Socrates is, in the language of
Nietzsche (to which we will return in the fourth chapter), [a 'despiser
of the body']{.underline} (1976: 146). His rejection of the body also
means [the rejection of a variety of mechanisms that the Athenian body
politic uses to interrogate political and ethical questions, articulate
beliefs, and manage conflicts]{.underline}. As Latour says of the
political tools which Socrates jettisons: [About what do\[es Socrates\]
talk so irreverently]{.underline}? Cookery first, and then [the skills
of the greatest **playwrights**, the greatest **sculptors**, the
greatest **musicians**, the greatest **architects**, the greatest
**orators**, the greatest **statesmen**, the greatest
**tragedians**]{.underline}. All of [**these people are dumped** because
they don't know what they know in the didactic fashion that Professor
Socrates wants to impose on the people of Athens]{.underline}. ( Latour
1999: 244) What Latour is here describing is [a society that manages the
conditions of politics -- number, priority, urgency -- by relying on a
variety of arts, occurring at a variety of tempos]{.underline}. [Whether
it be **tragedies** in which **political and moral issues are
dramatized**]{.underline} (Butler 2000) (Honig 2013), [**sung poems**
which communicated moral and political norms]{.underline} (Havelock
1963), [**public oration**s in which political questions are
debated]{.underline} ( Aristotle 1991), [public works of art and
architecture which create a public space to manage and organize these
political debates]{.underline} ( Arendt 1998) (Cuboniks 2018: 77), or
even arts of cookery which underpin communal experiences of eating
(Panagia 2009: Ch. 5). Crucially [even as many of these sites rely on
conscious thought and reflection, **they also fold in affects, habits,
memories, and corporeal qualities** which prepare and shape political
sensibilities for the complex and speedy encounters of the
agora]{.underline}. As we will discuss in Chapters 2 and 3 [, **it is
exactly the affect imbued character of thought that allows it to respond
effectively to a quickly unfolding pace of events**]{.underline}. And in
both our discussions of Spinoza and Bergson, we will see accounts which,
contra Socrates, seek to valorize [the role of habit as a way of
building both individuals and societies which can respond effectively to
a 'speedy' pace of life and politics]{.underline}. [**Socrates'
rejection of the tools of politics is thus ultimately tied to his
rejection of the body**, and both are crucially **tied to his fear of
speed**.]{.underline} One of the central goals of this book will be to
tease out the relations between speed, politics, and the body, noting
that [theoretical work on the body is frequently helpful, and indeed
necessary, in navigating the seeming impasses that the problem of speed
introduces into the practice of politics]{.underline}. This focus on
questions of bodily practice links us to the last theme that this book
will explore.

From the overcoding of the town by the city to the era of the international, the Magician Emperor and Jurist Priest -- operating as the two despotic arms of the state -- have always sought to grid radicality into static modes of representation, to Oedipalize systems of difference into a general semiology. This form of zombification, this production of war as politics has thus always rested on the capture of the [War Machine]{.underline}, the appropriation of the chaotic imaginaries, bodies, and territories external to the [Apparatus of Capture]{.underline}.

PROPOSITION X. The State and its poles. Let us return to Dumezil\'s
theses: (1) [**Political sovereignty has two poles, the fearsome
magician-emperor**, operating by **capture**, bonds, knots, and
**nets**, and **the jurist-priest-king**, proceeding by **treaties**,
pacts, **contracts**]{.underline} (the couples Varuna-Mitra, Odin-Tyr,
Wotan-Tiwaz, Uranus-Zeus, Romulus-Numa . . .); (2) [the **war function**
is **exterior** to **political sovereignty** and is **equally distinct**
from both its poles]{.underline} (Indra or Thor or Tullus Hostilius. .
.).\' 1. [The **State apparatus** is thus animated by a curious rhythm,
which is first of all a great mystery: that of the Binder-Gods or
**magic emperors**, **One-Eyed men emitting from their single eye signs
that capture**, **tie knots at a distance**.]{.underline} [**The
jurist-kings**, on the other hand, are **One-Armed men** who **raise
their single arm** as an element of **right and technology, the law and
the tool**.]{.underline} In the succession of men of State, look always
for the One-Eyed and the One-Armed, Horatius Codes and Mucius Scaevola
(de Gaulle and Pompidou?). This is not to say that one has exclusive
right to signs, the other to tools. [The fearsome emperor is already the
master of **large-scale works**; the wise king takes up and
**transforms** the **entire regime of signs**.]{.underline} What it
means is that [the combination, signs-tools, constitutes the
differential trait of **political sovereignty**, or the complementarity
of the State]{.underline}.2 2. Of course, [the **two men of State** are
always getting **mixed up** in **affairs of war**]{.underline}. But
[either the **magic emperor** sends to **battle** **warriors** who are
not his own, whom he takes into his service by capture; or]{.underline},
more important, [when he makes his appearance on the battlefield, he
**suspends the use of weapons**, he throws his **net over** the
**warriors**, his single eye throws them into petrified catatonia,
\"**he binds without combat**,\" he **encasts the war
machine**]{.underline} (this State capture is not to be confused with
the captures of war: conquests, prisoners, spoils).3 [As for the **other
pole**, the **jurist-king** is a great **organizer of war**; but he
**gives it laws**, lays out a field for it, makes it **principled**,
**imposes** a **discipline** upon it, **subordinates** it to **political
ends**.]{.underline} [He turns the **war machine** into a **military
institution**]{.underline}, [he **appropriates** the war machine for the
**State apparatus**]{.underline}.4 We should not be too hasty in
speaking of a softening, a humanization: on the contrary, [this is
perhaps when the **war machine** has **only one remaining object**, that
of **war itself**]{.underline}. **[Violence is found everywhere, but
under different regimes and economies]{.underline}**. [The **violence**
of the **magic emperor**: **his knot, his net,** his way of \"making his
moves once and for all]{.underline}\" \... [The **violence** of the
**jurist-king**: his way of **beginning over again every move, always
with attention to ends, alliances, and laws**]{.underline}\... [All
things considered, the **violence of the war machine** might appear
**softer** and more supple than that of the **State apparatus** because
it does not yet have **war as its \"object**,\" because it **eludes both
poles of the State**]{.underline}. [That is why the man of war, in his
**exteriority,** is always **protesting the alliances and pacts** of the
**jurist-king**, as well as **severing** the **bonds of the magic
emperor**]{.underline}. [He is equally an **unbinder** and a
**betrayer**: twice the traitor]{.underline}.5 [He has another economy,
another cruelty, but also another justice, another pity.]{.underline} To
the signs and tools of the State, the man of war opposes his weapons and
jewelry. Once again, who could say which is better and which is worse?
[It is true that war kills, and hideously mutilates. But it is
especially true **after the State has appropriated the war
machine**]{.underline}. Above all, [the **State apparatus** makes the
**mutilation**]{.underline}, [and even **death**, come
first]{.underline}. [It needs them preaccomplished, for people to be
born that way, \[injured\] and **zombielike**]{.underline}. [The myth of
the zombie, of the living dead, is a work myth and not a war
myth.]{.underline} [Mutilation is a consequence of war, but it is **a
necessary condition**, a **presupposition of the State apparatus** and
the organization of work]{.underline} (hence the native infirmity not
only of the worker but also of the man of State himself, whether of the
One-Eyed or the One-Armed type): \"The brutal exhibition of severed
flesh shocked me\.... Wasn\'t it an integral part of technical per-
fection and the intoxication of it. . . ? Mankind has waged wars since
the world began, but I can\'t remember one single example in the Iliad
where the loss of an arm or a leg is reported. Mythology reserved
mutilation for monsters, for human beasts of the race of Tantalus or
Procrustes\.... It is an optical illusion to attribute these mutilations
to accidents. Actually, accidents are the result of mutilations that
took place long ago in the embryo of our world; and the increase in
amputations is one of the symptoms bearing witness to the triumph of the
morality of the scalpel. The loss occurred long before it was visibly
taken into account.\"6 The State apparatus needs, at its summit as at
its base, pre\[injured\] people, preexisting \[damaged\], the
\[frozen\]born, the congenitally \[ill\], the one-eyed and one-armed.
Thus there is a tempting three-part hypothesis: [**the war machine is
\"between\" the two poles of political sovereignty and assures the
passage from one pole to the other**.]{.underline} It is indeed in that
order, 1-2-3, that things seem to present themselves in myth and
history. Take two versions of the One-Eyed and the One-Armed gods
analyzed by Dumezil: (1) the god Odin, who has a single eye, ties up the
wolf of war and holds him in his magic bond; (2) but the wolf is wary
and has at its disposal all its power of exteriority; (3) the god Tyr
gives the wolf a legal security by leaving one of his hands in the wolfs
mouth so the wolf can bite it off if it does not succeed in extricating
itself from the bond. (1) Horatius Codes, the One-Eyed, using only his
face, his grimace and magic power, prevents the Etruscan commander from
attacking Rome; (2) the war commander then decides to lay siege; (3)
Mucius Scaevola takes a political tack, offering his hand as a security
in order to persuade the warrior that it would be best to abandon the
siege and conclude a pact. In an entirely different, historical,
context, Marcel Detienne suggests an analogous schema in three moments
for ancient Greece: (1) [The **magic sovereign**, the \"Master of
Truth,\" has at his disposal a **war machine** that doubtless **does not
originate with him**, and which enjoys a relative autonomy within his
empire]{.underline}; (2) this class of warriors has its own rules,
defined by \"isonomy,\" an isotropic space, and a \"milieu\" (war spoils
are in the middle \[au milieu\], he who speaks places himself in the
middle of the assembly); this is another space, the rules are different
from those of the sovereign, who captures and speaks from on high; (3)
the hoplite reform, the groundwork for which was laid in the warrior
class, spread throughout the social body, promoting the formation of an
army of citizen-soldiers; at the same time, the last vestiges of the
imperial pole of sovereignty were replaced by the juridical pole of the
city-state (with isonomy as its law, and isotropy as its space).7 Thus
[in every case, the **war machine** seems to **intervene** \"between\"
the **two poles** of the **State apparatus**, assuring and necessitating
the passage from one to the other]{.underline}. [We cannot]{.underline},
however, [assign this schema a causal meaning]{.underline} (the authors
cited do not do so). [In the first place, the **war machine** explains
nothing; for it is either **exterior to the State,** and directed
against it; or **else** it **already belongs** to the **State**,
**encasted and appropriated**, and presupposes it]{.underline}. [If the
**war machine** has a part in the **evolution of the State**, it is
therefore necessarily in **conjunction** with other **internal
factors**]{.underline}. And this is the second point: [if there is an
evolution of the State, the **second pole**, the evolved pole, must be
in **resonance with the first**, it must **continually recharge** it in
some way, and **the State must have only one milieu of
interiority**]{.underline}; in other words, [it must have a **unity of
composition**]{.underline}, in spite of all the differences in
organization and development among States. [It is even necessary for
each State to have both poles, as the essential moments of its
existence,]{.underline} even though the organization of the two varies.
Third, [if we call this interior essence or this unity of the **State
\"capture,\"** we must say that the words \"**magic capture**\" describe
the **situation well** because it always **appears as preaccomplished
and self-presupposing**]{.underline}; but how is this capture to be
explained then, if it leads back to no distinct assignable cause? [That
is why **theses on the origin of the State are always
tautological**]{.underline}. At times, exogenous factors, tied to war
and the war machine, are invoked; at times endogenous factors, thought
to engender private property, money, etc.; and at times specific
factors, thought to determine the formation of \"public functions.\" All
three of these theses are found in Engels, in relation to a conception
of the diversity of the roads to Domination. But they beg the question.
[**War produces the State** only if at least one of the two parts is a
preexistent State; and **the organization of war is a State factor only
if that organization is a part of the State**]{.underline}. Either the
State has no war machine (and has policemen and jailers before having
soldiers), or else it has one, but in the form of a military institution
or public function.8 Similarly, private property presupposes State
public property, it slips through its net; and money presupposes
taxation. It is even more difficult to see how public functions could
have existed before the State they imply. [We are always **brought
back** to the **idea of a State** that comes **into the world fully**
**formed** and rises up in a single stroke, the **unconditioned
Urstaat**.]{.underline} PROPOSITION XI. Which comes first? [We shall
call the **first pole** of **capture** **imperial or
despotic**]{.underline}. [It corresponds to Marx\'s Asiatic
formation]{.underline}. Archaeology discovers it everywhere, often lost
in oblivion, at the horizon of all systems or States---not only in Asia,
but also in Africa, America, Greece, Rome. [Immemorial Urstaat, dating
as far back as Neolithic times, and perhaps farther still]{.underline}.
Following the Marxist description: [**a State apparatus** is **erected**
upon the **primitive** agricultural **communities**, which already have
**lineal-territorial codes**; but it **overcodes them**, **submitting
them to the power of a despotic emperor**, the sole and transcendent
public-property owner, **the master of the surplus or the stock**, the
**organizer of large-scale works**]{.underline} (surplus labor), [the
source of public functions and **bureaucracy.**]{.underline} [This is
the paradigm of **the bond, the knot**. Such is the **regime of signs of
the State: overcoding, or the Signifier**.]{.underline} [It is a system
of **machinic enslavement**: the first \"**megamachine\" in the strict
sense**]{.underline}, to use Mumford\'s term. A prodigious success in a
single stroke; other States will be mere runts measured against this
model. [The **emperor-despot** **is not a king or a tyrant;** these will
**come into existence** only as a function of **private property**
**once it has arisen**]{.underline}.9 In the imperial regime, everything
is public: ownership of land is communal, each individual is an owner
only insofar as he or she is a member of the community; the eminent
property of the despot is that of the supposed Unity of the communities;
and the functionaries themselves have land only if it comes with their
position (although the position may be hereditary). Money may exist,
notably in the form of the tax that the functionaries owe the emperor,
but it is not used for buying-selling, since land does not exist as an
alienable commodity. [This is **the regime** of the **nexum**, **the
bond**: something is lent or even **given without a transfer** of
ownership, **without private appropriation**, and the compensation for
it does not come in the form of interest or profit for the donor but
rather as a \"rent\" that accrues to him]{.underline}, [accompanying the
lending of something for another\'s use or the granting of
revenue]{.underline}.10 Marx, the historian, and Childe, the
archaeologist, are in agreement on the following point: [the **archaic
imperial State**, which steps in to **overcode agricultural**
**communities, presupposes**]{.underline} at least [a certain level of
**development** of these **communities\' productive
forces**]{.underline} since there must be a potential surplus capable of
constituting a State stock, of supporting a specialized handicrafts
class (metallurgy), and of progressively giving rise to public
functions. That is why Marx links the archaic State to a certain \"mode
of production.\" However, the origin of these Neolithic States is still
being pushed back in time. What is at issue when the existence of
near-Paleolithic empires is conjectured is not simply the quantity of
time; the qualitative problem changes. Catal Hiiyiik, in Anatolia, makes
possible a singularly reinforced imperial paradigm: it is a stock of
uncultivated seeds and relatively tame animals from different
territories that performs, and makes it possible to perform, at first by
chance, hybridizations and selections from which agriculture and
small-scale animal raising arise.11 It is easy to see the significance
of this change in the givens of the problem. [It is no longer the stock
that presupposes a potential surplus, but the other way
around]{.underline}. It is no longer the State that presupposes advanced
agricultural communities and developed forces of production. On the
contrary, the State is established directly in a milieu of
hunter-gatherers having no prior agriculture or metallurgy, and it is
the State that creates agriculture, animal raising, and metallurgy; it
does so first on its own soil, then imposes them upon the surrounding
world. It is not the country that progressively creates the town but the
town that creates the country[. **It is not the State that presupposes a
mode of production; quite the opposite, it is the State that makes
production a \"mode**.\"]{.underline} The last reasons for presuming a
progressive development are invalidated. Like seeds in a sack: It all
begins with a chance intermixing. The \"state and urban revolution\" may
be Paleolithic, not Neolithic as Childe believed. Evolutionism has been
challenged in many different ways (zigzag movements, stages skipped here
or there, irreducible overall breaks). We have seen in particular how
Pierre Clastres tried to shatter the evolutionist framework by means of
the following two theses: (1) societies termed primitive are not
societies without a State, in the sense that they failed to reach a
certain stage, but are counter-State societies organizing mechanisms
that ward off the State-form, which make its crystallization impossible;
(2) when the State arises, it is in the form of an irreducible break,
since it is not the result of a progressive development of the forces of
production (even the \"Neolithic revolution\" cannot be defined in terms
of an economic infrastructure).12 However, one does not depart from
evolutionism by establishing a clean break. In the final state of his
work, Clastres maintained the preexistence and autarky of counter-State
societies, and attributed their workings to an overmysterious
presentiment of what they warded off and did not yet exist. More
generally, one marvels at the bizarre indifference that ethnology
manifests for archaeology. It seems as though ethnologists, fenced off
in their respective territories, are willing to compare their
territories in an abstract, or structural, way, if it comes to that, but
refuse to set them against archaeological territories that would
compromise their autarky. They take snapshots of their primitives but
rule out in advance the coexistence and superposition of the two maps,
the ethnographical and the archaeological. Catal Hiiyuk, however, would
have had a zone of influence extending two thousand miles; how can the
ever-recurring problem of the relation of coexistence between primitive
societies and empires, even those of Paleolithic times, be left
unattended to? As long as archaeology is passed over, the question of
the relation between ethnology and history is reduced to an idealist
confrontation, and fails to wrest itself from the absurd theme of
society without history, or society against history. [Everything is
**not of the State** precisely because **there have been States** always
and **everywhere**. Not only does writing **presuppose** the **State**,
but so do **speech and language**]{.underline}. The self-sufficiency,
autarky, independence, preexistence of primitive communities, is an
ethnological dream: not that these communities necessarily depend on
States, but they coexist with them in a complex network. It is plausible
that \"from the beginning\" primitive societies have maintained distant
ties to one another, not just short-range ones, and that these ties were
channeled through States, even if States effected only a partial and
local capture of them. Speech communities and languages, independently
of writing, do not define closed groups of people who understand one
another but primarily determine relations between groups who do not
understand one another: if there is language, it is fundamentally
between those who do not speak the same tongue. Language is made for
that, for translation, not for communication. And in primitive societies
there are as many tendencies that \"seek\" the State, as many vectors
working in the direction of the State, as there are movements within the
State or outside it that tend to stray from it or guard themselves
against it, or else to stimulate its evolution, or else already to
abolish it: everything coexists, in perpetual interaction. Economic
evolutionism is an impossibility; even a ramified evolution,
\"gatherers---hunters---animal breeders---farmers-industrialists,\" is
hardly believable. An evolutionary ethnology is no better: \"nomads---
seminomads---sedentaries.\" Nor an ecological evolutionism: \"dispersed
autarky of local groups---villages and small towns---cities---States.\"
All we need to do is combine these abstract evolutions to make all of
evolutionism crumble; for example, it is the city that creates
agriculture, without going through small towns. To take another example,
[the **nomads** **do not precede** the **sedentaries**; rather,
**nomadism is a movement**, **a becoming** that affects **sedentaries**,
just as sedentarization is a stoppage that settles the
nomads]{.underline}. Griaznov has shown in this connection that the most
ancient nomadism can be accurately attributed only to populations that
abandoned their semiurban sedentarity, or their primitive itineration,
to set off nomadizing.13 [It is **under these conditions** that the
**nomads invented the war machine**, as that which occupies or **fills
nomad space** and **opposes** towns and **States,** which its **tendency
is to abolish**]{.underline}. Primitive peoples already had mechanisms
of war that converged to prevent the State formation; but these
mechanisms change when they gain autonomy in the form of a specific
nomadism machine that strikes back against the States. We cannot,
however, infer from this even a zigzag evolution that would go from
primitive peoples to States, from States to nomad war machines; or at
least the zigzagging is not successive but passes through the loci of a
topology that defines primitive societies here, States there, and
elsewhere war machines. And [even **when the State appropriates the war
machine,** once again **changing its nature**, it is a phenomenon of
transport, of transfer, and not one of evolution]{.underline}. [The
**nomad exists only in becoming**, and in interaction]{.underline}; the
same goes for the primitive. [All history does is to translate a
coexistence of **becomings into a succession**]{.underline}. And
collectivities can be transhumant, semisedentary, sedentary, or nomadic,
without by the same token being preparatory stages for the State, which
is already there, elsewhere or beside. Can it at least be said that the
hunter-gatherers are the \"true\" primitives and remain in spite of it
all the basis or minimal presupposition of the State formation, however
far back in time we place it? This point of view can be maintained only
at the price of a very inadequate conception of causality. And it is
true that the human sciences, with their materialist, evolutionary, and
even dialectical schemas, lag behind the richness and complexity of
causal relations in physics, or even in biology. Physics and biology
present us with reverse causalities that are without finality but
testify nonetheless to an action of the future on the present, or of the
present on the past, for example, the convergent wave and the
anticipated potential, which imply an inversion of time. More than
breaks or zigzags, it is these reverse causalities that shatter
evolution. Similarly, in the present context, it is not adequate to say
that the Neolithic or even Paleolithic State, once it appeared, reacted
back on the surrounding world of the hunter-gatherers; it was already
acting before it appeared, as the actual limit these primitive societies
warded off, or as the point toward which they converged but could not
reach without self-destructing. These societies simultaneously have
vectors moving in the direction of the State, mechanisms warding it off,
and a point of convergence that is repelled, set outside, as fast as it
is approached. To ward off is also to anticipate. Of course, it is not
at all in the same way that the State appears in existence, and that it
preexists in the capacity of a warded-off limit; hence its irreducible
contingency. But in order to give a positive meaning to the idea of a
\"presentiment\" of what does not yet exist, it is necessary to
demonstrate that what does not yet exist is already in action, in a
different form than that of its existence. Once it has appeared, the
State reacts back on the hunter-gatherers, imposing upon them
agriculture, animal raising, an extensive division of labor, etc.; it
acts, therefore, in the form of a centrifugal or divergent wave. But
before appearing, the State already acts in the form of the convergent
or centripetal wave of the hunter-gatherers, a wave that cancels itself
out precisely at the point of convergence marking the inversion of signs
or the appearance of the State (hence the functional and intrinsic
instability of these primitive societies).14 It is necessary from this
standpoint to conceptualize the contemporaneousness or coexistence of
the two inverse movements, of the two directions of time---of the
primitive peoples \"before\" the State, and of the State \"after\" the
primitive peoples---as if the two waves that seem to us to exclude or
succeed each other unfolded simultaneously in an \"archaeological,\"
micropo-litical, micrological, molecular field. There exist collective
mechanisms that simultaneously ward off and anticipate the formation of
a central power. [The appearance of a **central power** is thus a
**function** of a **threshold** or degree **beyond** which what is
**anticipated takes** on **consistency** or fails to, and what is
**conjured away** ceases to be so and arrives.]{.underline} This
threshold of consistency, or of constraint, is not evolutionary but
rather coexists with what has yet to cross it. Moreover, a distinction
must be made between different thresholds of consistency: the town and
the State, however complementary, are not the same thing. [The \"**urban
revolution**\" and the \"**state revolution**\" may **coincide but do
not meld**]{.underline}. [In both cases, **there is a central power**,
but it does **not assume** the **same figure**.]{.underline} Certain
authors have made a distinction between the palatial or imperial system
(temple-palace), and the urban, town system. [In both cases **there is a
town**, but in one case the town is an **outgrowth** of the **palace or
temple**, and in the other case the **palace, the temple, is a
concretion of the town**. In one case, the town par excellence is the
capital, and in the other it is the metropolis]{.underline}. Sumer
already attests to a town solution, as opposed to the imperial solution
of Egypt. But to an even greater extent, it was the Mediterranean world,
with the Pelasgians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians, that created an
urban fabric distinct from the imperial organisms of the Orient.15 Once
again, the question is one not of evolution but of two thresholds of
consistency that are themselves coexistent. They differ in several
respects. The town is the correlate of the road. [The town exists only
as a **function of circulation**, and of circuits; it is a **remarkable
poin**t on the circuits **that create it, and which it
creates**.]{.underline} It is defined by entries and exits; something
must enter it and exit from it. [It imposes a frequency. **It effects a
polarization of matter**, inert, **living or human**; it causes **the
phylum, the flow**, to **pass through** specific places, along
**horizontal lines**.]{.underline} It is a phenomenon of
transconsistency, a network, because it is fundamentally in contact with
other towns. [It represents a **threshold of deterritorialization**,
because whatever the **material involved**, it **must be
deterritorialized** **enough to enter the network**, **to submit to the
polarization**]{.underline}, to follow the circuit of urban and road
recoding. The maximum deterritorialization appears in the tendency of
maritime and commercial towns to separate off from the backcountry, from
the countryside (Athens, Carthage, Venice). [The **commercial character
of the town** has often been emphasized, but the **commerce in
question** is also **spiritual**, as in a network of monasteries or
temple-cities]{.underline}. Towns are circuit-points of every kind,
which enter into counterpoint along horizontal lines; they effect a
complete but local, town-by-town, integration**. [Each
one]{.underline}** [constitutes a **central power**, but it is a power
of **polarization or of the middle**]{.underline} {milieu), [of **forced
coordination**]{.underline}. That is why this kind of power has
egalitarian pretensions, regardless of the form it takes: tyrannical,
democratic, oligarchic, aristocratic. Town power invents the idea of the
magistrature, which is very different from the State civil-service
sector (fonction-nariat).16 Who can say where the greatest civil
violence resides? [**The State** indeed proceeds **otherwise**: it is a
phenomenon of **intraconsistency**]{.underline}. [It makes points
**resonate together**, points that are not necessarily **already
town-poles** but very **diverse points of order**, **geographic**,
ethnic, linguistic, moral, **economic**, **technological
particularities**]{.underline}. It makes the town resonate with the
countryside[. It operates by **stratification**; in other words, it
forms a **vertical, hierarchized aggregate** that spans the **horizontal
lines in a dimension of depth.**]{.underline} In retaining given
elements, it necessarily cuts off their relations with other elements,
which become exterior, it inhibits, slows down, or controls those
relations; if the State has a circuit of its own, it is an internal
circuit dependent primarily upon resonance, it is a zone of recurrence
that isolates itself from the remainder of the network, even if in order
to do so it must exert even stricter controls over its relations with
that remainder. The question is not to find out whether what is retained
is natural or artificial (boundaries), because in any event there is
deterntorialization. But [in this case **deterritorialization** is a
**result of the territory** itself **being taken as an object**, as a
**material to stratify**, to make resonate]{.underline}. Thus [the
**central power** of the **State is hierarchical**]{.underline}, and
constitutes a civil-service sector; [the **center is not** in the
**middle**]{.underline} {au milieu), [but **on top**, because the **only
way** it can **recombine** what it **isolates is through**
**subordination**.]{.underline} Of course, [there is a **multiplicity of
States** no less than of towns, but it is **not the same type** **of
multiplicity**]{.underline}: there are as many States as there are
vertical cross sections in a dimension of depth, each separated from the
others, whereas the town is inseparable from the horizontal network of
towns. Each State is a global (not local) integration, a redundancy of
resonance (not of frequency), an operation of the stratification of the
territory (not of the polarization of the milieu). It is possible to
reconstruct how primitive societies warded off both thresholds while at
the same time anticipating them. Levi-Strauss has shown that the same
villages are susceptible to two presentations, one segmentary and
egalitarian, the other encompassing and hierarchized. These are like two
potentials, one anticipating a central point common to two horizontal
segments, the other anticipating a central point external to a straight
line.17 Primitive societies do not lack formations of power; they even
have many of them. But [**what prevents** the potential **central points
from crystallizing**, from taking on consistency, are precisely those
**mechanisms that keep** the **formations of power both** from
**resonating together** in a higher point and **from becoming polarized
at a common poin**t]{.underline}: [the circles are not concentric, and
the two segments require a third segment through which to
communicate]{.underline}.18 This is the sense in which primitive
societies have crossed neither the town-threshold nor the
State-threshold. If we now turn our attention to the two thresholds of
consistency, it is clear that they imply a deterritorialization in
relation to the primitive territorial codes. **[It is futile to ask
which came first, the city or the State, the urban or state revolution,
because the two are in reciprocal presupposition]{.underline}**. Both
the melodic lines of the towns and the harmonic cross sections of the
States are necessary to effect the striation of space. The only question
that arises is the possibility that there may be an inverse relation at
the heart of this reciprocity. For although the archaic imperial State
necessarily included towns of considerable size, they remained more or
less strictly subordinated to the State, depending on how complete the
State\'s monopoly over foreign trade was. On the other hand, [the **town
tended to** **break free** when the **State\'s overcoding** itself
**provoked decoded flows**. A **decoding was coupled** with the
**deterritorialization**, and **amplified it**; the **necessary**
**recoding** was then **achieved through** a certain **autonomy of the
towns**]{.underline}, or else directly through corporative and
commercial towns freed from the State-form. Thus towns arose that no
longer had a connection to their own land, because they assured the
trade between empires, or better, constituted on their own a free
commercial network with other towns. There is therefore an adventure
specific to towns in the zones where the most intense decoding occurs,
for example, the ancient Aegean world or the Western world of the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance. Could it not be said that capitalism is the
fruit of the towns, and arises when an urban recoding tends to replace
State overcoding? This, however, was not the case. The towns did not
create capitalism. The banking and commercial towns, being unproductive
and indifferent to the backcountry, did not perform a recoding without
also inhibiting the general conjunction of decoded flows. If it is true
that they anticipated capitalism, they in turn did not anticipate it
without also warding it off. They do not cross this new threshold. Thus
it is necessary to expand the hypothesis of mechanisms both anticipatory
and inhibiting: these mechanisms are at play not only in primitive
societies but also in the conflict of towns \"against\" the State and
\"against\" capitalism. Finally, [it was **through the State-form** and
**not the town-form that capitalism triumphed**; this occurred when the
**Western States became models of realization** for an **axiomatic of
decoded flows**, and in that way **resubjugated the
towns**]{.underline}. As Braudel says, there were \"always two runners,
the state and the town\"---two forms and two speeds of
deterritorialization---and \"the state usually won. . . . everywhere in
Europe, it disciplined the towns with instinctive relentlessness,
whether or not it used violence.. . . \[The states\] caught up with the
forward gallop of the towns.\"19 But [the relation is a reciprocal one:
if it is the **modern State** that **gives capitalism** its models of
**realization**, what is **thus realized** is an **independent**,
**worldwide axiomatic** that is like a **single City**]{.underline},
[megalopolis, or \"**megamachine**\" of which the **States are
parts**]{.underline}, or neighborhoods. **[We define social formations
by machinic processes and not by modes of production]{.underline}**
(these on the contrary depend on the processes). Thus primitive
societies are defined by mechanisms of prevention-anticipation; [**State
societies are defined by apparatuses of capture**; **urban societies**,
**by instruments of polarization**; **nomadic societies**, **by war
machines**; and finally **international**]{.underline}, or rather
ecumenical, [**organizations** are defined by the **encompassment** of
**heterogeneous social formations**]{.underline}. But precisely because
these processes are variables of coexistence that are the object of a
social topology, the various corresponding formations are coexistent.
And they coexist in two fashions, extrinsically and intrinsically.
Primitive societies cannot ward off the formation of an empire or State
without anticipating it, and they cannot anticipate it without its
already being there, forming part of their horizon. And **[States cannot
effect a capture unless what is captured coexists]{.underline}**,
resists in primitive societies, or escapes under new forms, as towns or
war machines. . . [The numerical composition of **the war machine** is
**superposed** upon the **primitive lineal organization** and
**simultaneously opposes** the **geometric organization of the State**
and the **physical organization of the town**]{.underline}. It is this
extrinsic coexistence---interaction---that is brought to its own
expression in international aggregates. For [these obviously did not
wait for capitalism before forming]{.underline}: as early as Neolithic
times, even Paleolithic, we find traces of ecumenical organizations that
testify to the existence of long-distance trade, and simultaneously cut
across the most varied of social formations (as we have seen in the case
of metallurgy). The problem of diffusion, or of diffusionism, is badly
formulated if one assumes a center at which the diffusion would begin.
Diffusion occurs only through the placing in communication of potentials
of very different orders: all diffusion happens in the in-between, goes
between, like everything that \"grows\" of the rhizome type. [An
**international ecumenical** **organization** **does not** **proceed**
from an **imperial center** that **imposes itself** upon and
**homogenizes an exterior milieu**]{.underline}; neither is it reducible
to relations between formations of the same order, between States, for
example (the League of Nations, the United Nations). On the contrary, it
constitutes an intermediate milieu between the different coexistent
orders. Therefore it is not exclusively commercial or economic, but is
also religious, artistic, etc. From this standpoint, [we shall call an
**international organization** anything that has the **capacity to move
through** diverse **social formations** simultaneously: **States, towns,
deserts, war machines, primitive societies**]{.underline}. The great
commercial formations in history do not simply have city-poles, but also
primitive, imperial, and nomadic segments through which they pass,
perhaps issuing out again in another form. Samir Amin is totally correct
in saying that there can be no economic theory of international
relations, even economic ones, because they sit astride heterogeneous
formations.20 The point of departure for ecumenical organization is not
a State, even an imperial one; [the **imperial State** is only **one
part of it**, and it **constitutes a part of it in its own mode**,
according to its own order, which **consists in capturing everything it
can**. It does not proceed by progressive homogenization, or by
totalization, but by the **taking on of consistency** or the
**consolidation of the diverse as such**.]{.underline} For example,
monotheistic religion is distinguished from territorial worship by its
pretension to universality. But this pretension is not homogenizing, it
makes itself felt only by spreading everywhere; this was the case with
Christianity, which became imperial and urban, but not without giving
rise to bands, deserts, war machines of its own.21 Similarly, there is
no artistic movement that does not have its towns and empires, but also
its nomads, bands, and primitives. It might be objected that, at least
in the case of capitalism, international economic relations, and at the
limit all international relations, tend toward the homogenization of
social formations. One could cite not only the cold and concerted
destruction of primitive societies but also the fall of the last
despotic formations, for example, the Ottoman Empire, which met
capitalist demands with too much resistance and inertia. This objection,
however, is only partially accurate. [To the extent that **capitalism
constitutes** an **axiomatic** (production for the market), **all
States** and **all social formations** tend to **become isomorphic** in
their capacity as **models of realization**: there is but **one centered
world market**, the capitalist one, in which even the so-called
**socialist** countries **participate**.]{.underline} [Worldwide
**organization thus** **ceases** to **pass \"between\"** **heterogeneous
formations** since it assures the **isomorphy of those
formations**]{.underline}. But it would be wrong to confuse isomorphy
with homogeneity. For one thing, isomorphy allows, and even incites, a
great heterogeneity among States (democratic, totalitarian, and,
especially, \"socialist\" States are not facades). For another thing,
[the international **capitalist axiomatic** effectively **assures** the
**isomorphy of the diverse** formations **only where** the **domestic
market** is developing and expanding]{.underline}, [in other words, in
\"the center.\"]{.underline} But it tolerates, in fact it requires, a
certain peripheral polymorphy, to the extent that it is not saturated,
to the extent that it actively repels its own limits;22 this explains
the existence, at the periphery, of heteromorphic social formations,
which certainly do not constitute vestiges or transitional forms since
they realize an ultramodern capitalist production (oil, mines,
plantations, industrial equipment, steel, chemistry), but which are
nonetheless precapitalist, or extracapitalist, owing to other aspects of
their production and to the forced inadequacy of their domestic market
in relation to the world market.23 [**When international organization
becomes the capitalist axiomatic, it continues to imply a heterogeneity
of social formations, it gives rise to and organizes its \"Third
World**.\"]{.underline} There is not only an external coexistence of
formations but also an intrinsic coexistence of machinic processes. Each
process can also function at a \"power\" other than its own; it can be
taken up by a power corresponding to another process. [The **State as
apparatus of capture** has a **power of appropriation**; but this power
**does not** consist **solely** in **capturing all that it can**, all
that is possible, of a matter defined as phylum. The **apparatus of
capture** also **appropriates the war machine**, **the instruments of
polarization**, and the **anticipation-prevention
mechanisms**.]{.underline} This is to say, conversely, that
[anticipation-prevention mechanisms]{.underline} have a high power of
transference: they [are at work not only in **primitive societies**, but
move into the **towns that ward off the State-form**, into the **States
that ward off capitalism**, into **capitalism itself**, insofar as it
wards off and **repels its own limits**]{.underline}. And they are not
satisfied to switch over to other powers but form new focal points of
resistance and contagion, as we have seen in the case of \"band\"
phenomena, which have their own towns, their own brand of
internationalism, etc. Similarly, [**war machines** have a **power** of
**metamorphosis**, which of course **allows** them to be **captured by
States**, but also to **resist that capture** and **rise up again** in
**other forms**, with **other \"objects\" besides war**]{.underline}
(revolution?). [Each power is a force of **deterritorialization** that
**can go along with the others or go against them**]{.underline} (even
primitive societies have their vectors of deterritorialization). Each
process can switch over to other powers, but also subordinate other
processes to its own power.

#### There is a spectre haunting the 1AC: the emergence of the control society. Modern forms of capture are premised on the radical shift away from disciplinary power, from the clock to the computer, from power as repression to production. We have ceased to be disciplinary, but what counts is that we are at the beginning of something---there is no need to fear or hope, but only to look for new weapons.

L'autre Journal 1, May 1990\]

1\. History [Foucault located the disciplinary societies in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries]{.underline}; they reach their
height at the outset of the twentieth. [They]{.underline} [initiate the
organization of vast spaces of enclosure.]{.underline} The individual
never ceases passing from one closed environment to another, each having
its own laws: ﬁrst, [the family; then the school]{.underline} ("you are
no longer in your family\"); [then the barracks]{.underline} ("you are
no longer at school\"); [then the factory; from time to time the
hospital; possibly the prison]{.underline}, the preeminent instance of
the enclosed environment. It\'s the prison that serves as the analogical
model: at the sight of some laborers, the heroine of Rossellini's Europa
\'51 could exclaim, "I thought I was seeing convicts.\" [Foucault has
brilliantly analyzed the ideal project of these environments of
enclosure]{.underline}, particularly visible within the factory: [to
concentrate; to distribute in space; to order in time;]{.underline} to
compose a productive force within the dimension of space-time whose
effect will be greater than the sum of its component forces.
[But]{.underline} what [Foucault recognized]{.underline} as well was
[the transience of this model: it succeeded that of the societies of
sovereignty]{.underline}, the goal and functions of which were something
quite different (to tax rather than to organize production, to rule on
death rather than to administer life); the transition took place over
time, [and]{.underline} Napoleon seemed to effect the large-scale
conversion from one society to the other. But [in their turn the
disciplines underwent a crisis to the beneﬁt of new forces]{.underline}
that were gradually instituted and [which accelerated after World War
II: a disciplinary society was what we already no longer were, what we
had ceased to be. We are in a]{.underline} generalized
[crisis]{.underline} in relation to all the environments [of
enclosure]{.underline}---prison, hospital, factory, school, family. The
family is an "interior,\" in crisis like all other
interiors---scholarly, professional, etc. The [administrations in charge
never cease announcing supposedly necessary reforms: to reform schools,
to reform industries, hospitals, the armed forces, prisons. **But
everyone knows that these institutions are ﬁnished**,]{.underline}
whatever the length of their expiration periods. [It\'s only a matter of
administering their last rites and of keeping people employed until the
installation of the new forces knocking at the door. **These are the
societies of control**]{.underline}, which are in the process of
replacing the disciplinary societies. "Control\" is the name Burroughs
proposes as a term for the new monster, one that Foucault recognizes as
our immediate future. Paul Virilio also is continually analyzing the
ultrarapid forms of free-ﬂoating control that replaced the old
disciplines operating in the time frame of a closed system. There is no
need here to invoke the extraordinary pharmaceutical productions, the
molecular engineering, the genetic manipulations, although these are
slated to enter into the new process. [There is no need to ask which is
the toughest or most tolerable regime, for it's within each of them that
liberating and enslaving forces confront one another. For example, in
the crisis of the hospital as environment of enclosure, neighborhood
clinics, hospices, and day care could at first express new freedom, but
they could participate as well in mechanisms of control that are equal
to the harshest of conﬁnements.]{.underline} **[There is no need to fear
or hope, but only to look for new weapons.]{.underline}** 2. Logic [The
different]{.underline} internments or [spaces of enclosure through which
the individual passes]{.underline} are independent variables: [each time
one is supposed to start from zero]{.underline}, and although a common
language for all these places exists, [it is analogical. On the other
hand, the different control mechanisms are inseparable variations,
forming a system of variable geometry the language of which is
numerical]{.underline} (which doesn\'t necessarily mean binary).
[**Enclosures are molds, distinct castings, but controls are a
modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change**
from one moment to the other,]{.underline} or like a sieve whose mesh
will transmute from point to point. [This is obvious in the matter of
salaries: the factory]{.underline} was a body that [contained its
internal forces at]{.underline} a level of [equilibrium,]{.underline}
the [highest possible]{.underline} in terms of [production,]{.underline}
the [lowest possible]{.underline} in terms of [wages; but in a society
of control, the corporation has replaced the factory, and the
corporation is a spirit, a gas.]{.underline} Of course the factory was
already familiar with the system of bonuses, but [the corporation
works]{.underline} more deeply [to impose a modulation of each salary,
in states of perpetual metastability that operate through challenges,
contests, and highly comic group sessions. If the most idiotic
television game shows are so successful, it\'s because they express the
corporate situation with great precision]{.underline}. The factory
constituted individuals as a single body to the double advantage of the
boss who surveyed each element within the mass and the unions who
mobilized a mass resistance; but the corporation constantly presents the
brashest rivalry as a healthy form of emulation, an excellent
motivational force that opposes individuals against one another and runs
through each, dividing each within. The modulating principle of "salary
according to merit" has not failed to tempt national education itself.
Indeed, [just as the corporation replaces the factory, perpetual
training tends to replace the school, and continuous control to replace
the examination.]{.underline} Which is the surest way of [delivering the
school over to the corporation]{.underline}. **[In the disciplinary
societies one was always starting again]{.underline}** (from school to
the barracks, from the barracks to the factory), **[while in the
societies of control one is never ﬁnished with
anything]{.underline}**---the corporation, the educational system, the
armed services being metastable states coexisting in one and the same
modulation, like a universal system of deformation. In The Trial,
[Kafka]{.underline}, who had already placed himself at the pivotal point
between two types of social formation, [described]{.underline} the most
fearsome of juridical forms. The apparent acquittal of the [disciplinary
societies]{.underline} (between two incarcerations); [and the limitless
postponements of the societies of control]{.underline} (in continuous
variation) are [two very different modes of juridical life]{.underline},
and [if our law is hesitant, itself in crisis, it\'s because we are
leaving one in order to enter into the other.]{.underline} The
disciplinary societies have two poles: the signature that designates the
individual, and the number or administrative numeration that indicates
his or her position within a mass. This is because the disciplines never
saw any incompatibility between these two, and because at the same time
power individualizes and masses together, that is, constitutes those
over whom it exercises power into a body and molds the individuality of
each member of that body. (Foucault saw the origin of this double charge
in the pastoral power of the priest---the flock and each of its
animals---but civil power moves in turn and by other means to make
itself lay "priest.") [In the societies of control]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [what is important is no longer either a signature or a
number, but a code:]{.underline} the code is [a password]{.underline},
while on the other hand the disciplinary societies are regulated by
watchwords (as much from the point of view of integration as from that
of resistance). [The numerical language of control is made of codes that
mark access to information, or reject it.]{.underline} We no longer ﬁnd
ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. [Individuals have
become "dividuals,\"]{.underline} and masses, samples, data, markets, or
"banks.\" Perhaps it is money that expresses the distinction between the
two societies best, since [discipline always referred back to minted
money that locks gold in as numerical standard, while control relates to
ﬂoating rates of exchange,]{.underline} modulated according to a rate
established by a set of standard currencies. The old monetary mole is
the animal of the spaces of enclosure, but the serpent is that of the
societies of control. [We have passed from one]{.underline} animal [to
the other]{.underline}, from the mole to the serpent, in the system
under which we live, but also in our manner of living and in our
relations with others. [The disciplinary \[person\] was a discontinuous
producer of energy, but the \[person\] of control is undulatory, in
orbit, in a continuous network.]{.underline} Everywhere surfing has
already replaced the older sports. Types of machines are easily matched
with each type of society---not that machines are determining, but
because they express those social forms capable of generating them and
using them. [**The old societies of sovereignty made use of simple
machines---levers, pulleys, clocks; but the recent disciplinary
societies equipped themselves with machines involving energy, with the
passive danger of entropy and the active danger of sabotage; the
societies of control operate with machines of a third type, computers,
whose passive danger is jamming and whose active one is piracy and the
introduction of viruses**. This technological evolution must
be]{.underline}, even more profoundly, **[a mutation of
capitalism]{.underline}**, an already well-known or familiar mutation
that can be summed up as follows: [nineteenth- century capitalism is a
capitalism of concentration]{.underline}, for production and for
property. [It therefore erects the factory as a space of
enclosure]{.underline}, the capitalist being the owner of the means of
production but also, progressively, the owner of other spaces conceived
through analogy (the worker\'s familial house, the school). As for
markets, they are conquered sometimes by specialization, sometimes by
colonization, sometimes by lowering the costs of production. [But, in
the present situation, **capitalism is no longer involved in
production,** which it often relegates to the Third World,]{.underline}
even for the complex forms of textiles, metallurgy, or oil production.
[It's a capitalism of higher-order production]{.underline}. [It no
longer buys raw materials and no longer sells the ﬁnished products: it
buys the ﬁnished products or assembles parts. What it wants to sell is
services and what it wants to buy is stocks. This is no longer a
capitalism for production but for the product, which is to say, for
being sold or marketed.]{.underline} Thus it is essentially dispersive,
and the factory has given way to the corporation. [The family, the
school, the army, the factory are no longer the distinct analogical
spaces that converge towards an owner]{.underline}---state or private
power---[but coded ﬁgures---deformable and
transformable]{.underline}---[of a single corporation]{.underline} that
now has only stockholders. Even art has left the spaces of enclosure in
order to enter into the open circuits of the bank. [The conquests of the
market are made]{.underline} by grabbing control and no longer by
disciplinary training, [by ﬁxing the exchange rate much more than by
lowering costs, by transformation of the product more than by
specialization of production. Corruption thereby gains a new power.
Marketing has become the center or the "soul\" of the corporation. We
are taught that **corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying
news in the world**.]{.underline} [The operation of markets is now the
instrument of social control and forms the impudent breed of our
masters.]{.underline} [**Control is short-term and of rapid rates of
turnover, but also continuous and without limit,** while discipline was
of long duration, inﬁnite and discontinuous. \[The subject\] is no
longer \[someone\] enclosed, but \[someone\] in debt.]{.underline} It is
true that [capitalism has retained as a constant the extreme poverty of
three quarters of humanity, too poor for debt, too numerous for
conﬁnement: control will]{.underline} not only [have to deal with
erosions of frontiers]{.underline} but with [the explosions within
shanty towns or ghettos.]{.underline} 3. Program [The conception of a
control mechanism, giving the position of any element]{.underline}
within an open environment at any given instant (whether animal in a
reserve or human in a corporation, as with an electronic collar), is
[not necessarily one of science ﬁction.]{.underline} Félix Guattari has
imagined a city where one would be able to leave one's apartment, one's
street, one's neighborhood, thanks to [one's (dividual) electronic card
that raises a given barrier;]{.underline} but the card [could just as
easily be rejected on a given day or between certain hours; what counts
is not the barrier but the computer that tracks each person's
position---licit or illicit ---and effects a universal
modulation.]{.underline} The socio-technological study of the mechanisms
of control, grasped at their inception, would have to be categorical and
to describe what is already in the process of substitution for the
disciplinary sites of enclosure, whose crisis is everywhere proclaimed.
It may be that older methods, borrowed from the former societies of
sovereignty, will return to the fore, but with the necessary
modifications. **[What counts is that we are at the beginning of
something.]{.underline}** In the prison system: the attempt to ﬁnd
penalties of "substitution," at least for petty crimes, and the use of
electronic collars that force the convicted person to stay at home
during certain hours. [For the school system: continuous forms of
control]{.underline}, and the effect on the school of [perpetual
training, the corresponding abandonment of all university research, the
introduction of the "corporation\" at all levels of
schooling]{.underline}. For the hospital system: the new medicine
"without doctor or patient\" that singles out potential sick people and
subjects at risk, which in no way attests to individuation---as they
say---but substitutes for the individual or numerical body the code of a
"dividual\" material to be controlled. In the corporate system: new ways
of handling money, profits, and humans that no longer pass through the
old factory form. **[These]{.underline}** are very small
**[examples]{.underline}**, but ones that **[will allow for better
understanding of]{.underline}** what is meant by the crisis of the
institutions, which is to say, **[the progressive and dispersed
installation of a new system of domination.]{.underline}** [One of the
most important questions will concern the ineptitude of the
unions:]{.underline} tied to the whole of their history of struggle
against the disciplines or within the spaces of enclosure, will they be
able to adapt themselves or [will they give way to new forms of
resistance against the societies of control? Can we already grasp the
rough outlines of these coming forms, capable of threatening the joys of
marketing? Many young people strangely boast of being "motivated\"; they
re-request apprenticeships and permanent training. It\'s up to them to
discover what they\'re being made to serve, just as their elders
discovered, not without difficulty, the telos of the disciplines. The
coils of a serpent are even more complex than the burrows of a
molehill.]{.underline}

#### "An abstract machine... is what draws the lines of flight: it steers the quantum flows, assures the connection-creation of flows, and emits new quanta. It itself is in a state of flight, and erects war machines on its lines."

#### --Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari

**Robinson 10** (Andy McLaverty-Robinson, political theorist and
activist based in the UK, "In Theory Why Deleuze (still) matters:
States, war-machines and radical transformation," September 2010,
https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/in-theory-deleuze-war-machine/)//JRD

[So **what**]{.underline}, in Deleuzian theory, [**is** **the**
**alternative** to the **state**?]{.underline} [Deleuze and Guattari
argue for a **type** of **assemblage**]{.underline} (social group or
cluster of relations) [which they refer to as the '**war-machine'**,
though with the **proviso** that **certain kinds** of 'war-machines' can
also be **captured** and **used** by **states**.]{.underline} This
should not be considered a militarist theory, and the term 'war-machine'
is in many respects misleading. It is used because Deleuze and Guattari
derive their theory from Pierre Clastres' theory of the role of
ritualised (often non-lethal) warfare among indigenous groups. Paul
Patton has suggested that the war-machine would be better called a
metamorphosis-machine, others have used the term 'difference engine', a
machine of differentiation, and there is a lot of overlap with the idea
of autonomous groups or movements in how the war-machine is theorised.
We should also remember that 'machine' in Deleuze and Guattari simply
refers to a combination of forces or elements; it does not have
overtones of instrumentalism or of mindless mechanisms -- a social
group, an ecosystem, a knight on horseback are all 'machines'. [The
**term 'war-machine'** has the **unfortunate** **connotations** of
brutal **military machinery** and of uncontrollable militarist
**apparatuses** such as **NATO**, which operate with a **machine-like
rigidity** and **inhumanity**]{.underline} (c.f. the phrase
'military-industrial complex'). For Deleuze and Guattari, [these kinds
of **statist** **war-machines** are also **war-machines** of a sort,
**because** they **descend** from a **historical** **process** through
**which** **states** '**captured'** or **incorporated** **autonomous**
social **movements**]{.underline} (particularly those of nomadic
indigenous societies) [and **made** **them** **part** of the **state**
so as to **contain** their **subversive** **power**.]{.underline} [Early
states **learned** to **capture** **war-machines** because they were
**previously** **vulnerable** to being **destroyed** by the
**war-machines** of **nomadic** **stateless** societies]{.underline},
[**having** no **similar** means of **response**.]{.underline} Hence,
[armies are a kind of **hybrid** **social** form,]{.underline}
[**containing** some of the **power** of **autonomous** **war-machines**
but **contained** in such a way as to **harness** it to **state**
**instrumentalism** and **inhumanity**.]{.underline} Captured in this
way, [**war-machines** lose their **affirmative**
**force**,]{.underline} [becoming simply machines of **purposeless**
**destruction**]{.underline} -- [having **lost** the purpose of
**deterritorialisation**]{.underline} (see below), [they take on the
**purpose** of **pure war** as a goal in itself. Deleuze and Guattari
argue that **state-captured war-machines** are **regaining** their
**autonomy** in a **dangerous** way]{.underline}, [tending to
**replace** **limited** war in the service of a **state's goals with a
drive to total war.**]{.underline} [This drive is expressed for instance
in the '**war on terror'** as **permanent state of
emergency.**]{.underline} There was a recent controversy about Israeli
strategists adopting Deleuzian ideas, which reflects the continuities
between state war-machines and autonomous war-machines, but depends on a
selective conceptual misreading in which the drive to total war
denounced by Deleuze and Guattari is explicitly valorised. [The
**Israeli army** is a **captured** **war-machine** in the worst possible
sense, **pursuing** the **destruction** of **others'** **existential**
**territories** in order to **accumulate** **destructive** power for a
**state**.]{.underline} For Deleuze and Guattari, [it is **not the
Israeli army** but the **Palestinian** **resistance** which is a
**war-machine** in the **full sense**.]{.underline} [The **autonomous**
war-machine, as **opposed** to the **state**-**captured** war-machine,
is a form of **social** **assemblage** directed **against** the
**state**, and **against** the coalescence of
**sovereignty**.]{.underline} [The way such **machines** **undermine**
the state is by **exercising** **diffuse power** to break down
**concentrated** **power**, and through the **replacement** of
'**striated'**]{.underline} (regulated, marked) [**space** with
'**smooth' space**]{.underline} (although the war-machine is the
'constituent element of smooth space', I shall save discussion of smooth
space for some other time). In Clastres' account of Amazonian societies,
on which Deleuze and Guattari's theory is based, [this is done by means
of each band **defending** its own **autonomy**, and **reacting** to any
**potential** **accumulation** of power by **other** bands.]{.underline}
[One could similarly think of how]{.underline} neighbourhood gangs
resist subordination by rival gangs, or how [**autonomous** **social**
movements **resist** **concentrations** of **political** **power**.
Autonomous **social** **movements**, such as the **European squatters'
movement**, the **Zapatistas,** and networks of **protest against
summits**, are the principal example]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari
have in mind of war-machines in the global North, [though they also use
the concept in relation to **Southern guerrilla** and popular movements
such as the **Palestinian intifada** and the **Vietnamese**
**resistance** to **American** **occupation**, and also in **relation**
to **everyday** **practices** of **indigenous** groups **resisting**
**state** **control**.]{.underline} One could also argue that [the
'war-machine' is implicit in practices of everyday
resistance]{.underline} of the kind studies by James Scott.
[**Marginal** **groups**]{.underline}, termed 'minorities' in Deleuzian
theory, [often **coalesce** as war-machines because the **state-form**
is **inappropriate** for them.]{.underline} According to Deleuze and
Guattari, [**war** is **not the aim** of the
**war-machine**]{.underline} ([**except** when it is **captured by the
state**]{.underline}); [rather, war-machines tend to end up in a
**situation** of **war** with states **because** of **the
incommensurability** of the war-machine with the **state** and with
**striated space**.]{.underline} [War-machines end up in **conflict**
with **states** because their goal is the '**deterritorialisation'** of
the **rigid** **fixities** of **state** **space**, often to **create
space for difference** or for **particular** ways of
**life**.]{.underline} Think for instance [of squatters'
movements]{.underline}: in themselves they [**do not aim for conflict**,
but rather, seek **different** kinds of **arrangements** of space by
forming **new combinations** of unused **geographical** **spaces** with
otherwise '**spaceless' social groups**.]{.underline} [Yet such
movements are **often** **forced** into **conflict** with the
**machinery of state repression** because the state ignores, or
**refuses** to **recognise** these **new articulations**.]{.underline}
As I write this, the JB Spray squat in Nottingham is continuing a
campaign of resistance to reoccupation by state forces acting on behalf
of capitalist owners who have no intent of putting the space to use.
This is a struggle I would very much encourage readers to support (see
this [article](http://notts.indymedia.org.uk/articles/415) and related
links for details; contact 07817493824 or email
jbspray\[at\]hotmail.co.uk). It is also a clear, local example of how
[autonomous social movements are **forced** into **conflict** by the
**state's** **drive** to **repress** **difference**. War-machines are
also associated with the **formation of special types** of groups which
are **variously** **termed** 'bands', 'packs' and
'**multiplicities'**.]{.underline} These groups are seen as operating as
dense local clusters of emotionally-intense connections, strongly
differentiated from the 'mass', which is a type of group based on large
scale, lack of intensity and vertical integration. '[Packs' or 'bands'
instead form as **unstable groups**, **avoiding** fixed **hierarchies**
(any leaders emerging are subject to rapid succession), usually with
**small numbers**, and **dispersed** **through** space rather than
**concentrated** in **particular** **sites**.]{.underline} [Their
diffusion is enabled by a **multiplicity** of **objectives** which
resonate through **horizontal**]{.underline}, [**molecular**
**connections** rather than being **represented** in **overarching**
**structures**.]{.underline} [They tend to **detach** **materials** from
the **connections** in which they are inserted in the **dominant**
**system**, instead reconstructing **different** '**universes'** or
perspectives around **other** **ways** of seeing and
relating.]{.underline} One can think for instance of the way groups of
children reconstruct urban spaces as spaces of play, finding new,
dissident uses for objects such as shopping trollies. For Deleuze and
Guattari, the process of forming 'bands' or 'packs' is necessarily
dangerous, risking the self-destructive implosion of small groups, but
also offering hopeful possibilities of forming ways of relating which
are more open to difference than those prevalent in the dominant system.
[Deleuze and Guattari's usefulness for **radical** **activism** is by
**no means limited** to this **particular** **pair** of concepts, but
this **way of thinking** about **social transformation** raises **useful
questions** and provides **insights** into how **autonomous** **groups**
differ from **dominant hierarchical forms** of social
collectivity.]{.underline} For instance, [this theory points towards the
**need** to **avoid duplicating** statist ways of **relating** **within
autonomous spaces**, and to avoid **coalescing** in **formal
organisations** which ultimately **lead** **back** into the
**state-form**]{.underline} (albeit usually through the addition of
axioms). [It]{.underline} also [suggests the **inevitability** of
**antagonism** between **radical** **movements** and the state, even
when the **goal** of a **radical movement** is simply to **defend** or
express its own **difference**.]{.underline} Strategically, therefore,
[**autonomous activists** need to be **prepared** to '**ward off' the
state**, both within movements]{.underline} ([by **challenging statist**
ways of **thinking** and **acting**)]{.underline} [and in relation to
the **wider context** (by resisting state repression).]{.underline}
According to Deleuze and Guattari, [there is a **basic incompatibility**
between state '**antiproduction' and the flourishing of

### Link---Global War Machine

#### "The Fascists were only child precursors, and the absolute peace of survival succeeded where total war had failed. The Third World War was already upon us...The world became a smooth space again, over which reigned a single war machine, even when it opposed its own parts. Wars had become a part of peace. More than that, the States no longer appropriated the war machine; they reconstituted a war machine of which they themselves were only the parts."

#### ---Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari 

**Evans and Guillaume 10** (Brad Evans, senior lecturer in International
Relations at University of Bristol, Laura Guillaume, PhD student in

Introduction," [Theory & Event](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/191) 13(3),

Deleuze and Guattari's concept of [the **war** **machine** was
**worked** **out** in the context of the **global** **confrontation** of
the **Cold** **War**, in which **hair-trigger 'nuclear security'**
produced 'a **peace** still **more** **terrifying** **than** **fascist**
**death'**, whereby the **spectre** of **war** seemed to **determine**
the **conditions** for **international** and **domestic**
**politics**.]{.underline} [Rather than be subject to **control** by the
**state**, the **war** **machine** began to take **control** of the
**state** and **directly** **invest** a **particular** **configuration**
**of** **global**]{.underline} (in-) [**security**.]{.underline}
However, the Cold War genesis of the war machine concept does not mean
that it has nothing to offer a post-Cold War, post-September 11th.
Deleuze's essay 'Postscript on Societies of [**Control'** indicates the
ways in which he saw the **security** **environment** changing to one of
**modulated** **control** and the **management** of **flows** and
**circulation**, rather than the **strict** **policing** of
**identities**]{.underline}. The concept of [the **war** **machine**
itself seems to **resonate** with **the post-September 11th** world in
which the nature of threats **unclear** and '**unknown** **unknowns'**
determine **military** **planning**.]{.underline} Indeed, it is arguable
that Deleuze more than any other is the ideal philosopher for helping us
make sense of today's radically interconnected post-Clausewitzean
security terrain. Something which has certainly not been lost on some of
the key centres for strategic affairs, such as the RAND Corporation and
the Israeli Defence Force, who have operationalised Deleuzian principles
to enhance military efficacy. With this in mind, it was our conviction
that an edited volume which specifically dealt with "Deleuze and War"
was long since overdue, not in order to definitively pronounce on the
relationship between Deleuze and War, but precisely to gesture to the
multiple lines of engagement and intersection between Deleuze's work and
contemporary problems of war, peace, security and resistance. It is our
hope that this volume serves to catalyse a consideration of Deleuze in
the context of war, and to open up debates and lines of enquiry that may
enrich our engagement with the often dispiriting problems of militarism
and security. Brad Evans and Michael Hardt discuss the extent to which
[civil war is no longer understood primarily through the prism of
sovereignty.]{.underline} This is to say, [with the **primary** **mode**
of warfare **no** **longer** taking place **between** **states**, or for
that matter **within** **states** for the **acquisition** of **state**
**power**]{.underline} (as in conventional civil war), [then the
**once** **familiar** location of '**war'** in relation to '**peaceful**
**politics'** now becomes intensely **problematic**.]{.underline} To put
it another way, [in **focusing** **exclusively** on the **relationship**
between **sovereignty** and **war**, we are in **danger** of
**becoming** ~~blind~~ \[**oblivious**\] to the **iterations** of
**war/governance** which **generate** the **conditions** of
**possibility** for everyday **politics**.]{.underline} Indeed, as Evans
and Hardt suggest, [while **Liberal** forms of **governance** are
**increasingly** **unhindered** by the **muddying** of the **waters**
between '**war'** and '**not war'**, **Liberalism** itself as a
**framework** for a **politics** **concerned** with **emancipation** and
**resistance** might be **fatally** **imperilled** by the
**generalised** state of war.]{.underline} [Not only does this suggest
the **need** for a **rethinking** of the **politics** of the
left,]{.underline} or of [**radical** **democracy**, but also that this
**new politics** **should take account** of the ways in which **modern**
**strategies** of **rule** are **dedicated** to the **differential**
**production** and **organisation** of **bodies** in ways which
**determine** the **possibilities** **for resistance**]{.underline},
[and make the **emergence** of **certain** **forms** of life
**complicit** in the **martial logic of rule**]{.underline}. Examples
include the potentially redeemable body of the insurgent, the
life-inimical body of the terrorist, and the inviolable and valuable
body of the US soldier. [What this means is that one can **no longer**
**assume** that **war** is **fought** **according** to the **structures
of friend/enemy**, them/us. **Instead**, it is that the **production**
of **these categories**]{.underline} (and the multiple sub-categories
that populate them) [**which** **itself** is **internal** to '**war**.'
In turn, this **necessitates** a **change** in the **way** in **which**
**we** **think** **about** **war**, which **becomes** **less**
**associated** with **transcendent** categories of **power**
(**good/evil, friend/enemy**) such as are **associated** with a
**moment** of **sovereign** **decision**, and **more** **concerned**
with the **immanent** **production** of **identities** and **lives**:
with what we might call a **political** **economy** whereby the
**production** of **life** is itself the **production of**
war.]{.underline} [**Economy** thus **becomes** as great a concern in
the **analysis** of **contemporary** **war** as the **transcendent**
**principles** of **law** and **sovereignty**.]{.underline} Hence,
[whilst the 'exceptional' instances of transcendent sovereign domination
are easy to find in the recent past]{.underline}---as with, for example,
Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib---[these]{.underline}, Evans and Hardt
suggest, [**may** **not** **be** the **essence** of the **current**
**paradigm** of **war**.]{.underline} Indeed, [there is a **potential**
**danger** for a politics of **resistance** or **criticism** in
**focusing** **exclusively** on these **dramatic** **examples** of
**sovereign** **rule**.]{.underline} [This has the **potential** to
**conceal** the '**normalised'** ways in which **power** **operates**,
through the **juridical** **policing** of humanity, through the
**production** and **organisation** **of life**, through the
**regulation** of **flow** and **exchange** **in accordance** with the
**predicates** of the **economising** **facets** of global **Liberal
rule**]{.underline}. It is to these that we must turn if we are to
conceive a politics of resistance adequate to the task of confronting
the multifaceted dimensions of war and the martial economy. Laura
Guillaume begins the interview with James Der Derian by broaching the
militarization of Deleuzian concepts. Whilst for many this tendency is
problematic, as Der Derian reminds us, the militaristic appropriation of
critical thought reveals a clear genealogy of (ab)use. While Der Derian
invokes the experiences of Derrida, Foucault and Virilio, one could have
also added here Nietzsche whose malicious appropriation by the forces of
fascism still leaves him somewhat tarnished. Indeed, he argues, given
the evident conceptual richness of the authors in question, is there any
wonder that the military would be equally seduced? Hence, that [there
remains a possibility for concepts which have the aim of "liberation and
resistance" to be turned into concepts for "occupation and
destruction"]{.underline} serves to be a healthy reminder us all that
our works may further rationalise the war machine. Against this
backdrop, Der Derian attends specifically to the collapse of the
meaningful distinctions which once marked out Clausewitzean war. [An
**active** **agent** in this has been what he terms the
**MIME-NET**]{.underline} ([military-industrial-media-entertainment
network]{.underline}) [which **actively** **producing** the
**conditions** for **war**, conditions the **theatre** **along**
**complex**, **adaptive** and **networked** **lines**.]{.underline}
Importantly, for Der Derian, [since the onset of a **global** **state**
of **war** **inscribes** the **war** **machine** with a "virtuous"
quality]{.underline} (understood in terms of technological and ethical
supremacy), [then to understand more fully the **political**
**implications** it is **necessary** to have a **more sophisticated**
analytic of the **composition** of **global war machine**.]{.underline}
"It is all too easy, he argues, "to dump this all on Bush's doorstep."
Liberals too have a vested interest in all this. Der Derian's analytic
of the MIME-NET points to the oxymoronic nature of virtuous war. [A war
that **seeks to** **secure** its **peace** through **technological**
**enforcement** **cannot** achieve **anything** **other** than the
creation of **new** **political** **problems**.]{.underline} [The stage
is thus set 'for **endless** **cycles** of **conflict** in which
**worst** **case** **scenarios** produce the future they claim only to
anticipate.' **Fulfilling the prophecies of ones own making**, the
**war** **machine** is therefore not only **virtually** **endowed**, but
in the process of going to war it **actively** **produces** the
**reality** of the **situation**.]{.underline} With this preemptive
rationality in mind, Guillaume poses the use of Bobbit's strategic
conflations between the human and the natural in order to make sense of
this new virtual terrain[. Supporting the notion that pre-emptive action
"**colonises the future**," Der Derian explains the **absurd**
**quality** to all this in the sense that our **interventions** even
take the "**evils yet to be born**" to be their object.]{.underline}
This certainly offers some lessons to us--- especially concerning what
not to do. [**Pre-empting evil** is not only **ludicrous**; it has
proven to be **disastrous**. Provoking threats simply **ups the
ante**.]{.underline} Nevertheless, there is some optimism to be gleaned,
[for if this century can be called Deleuzian then it will be realised in
the **active** **counter**-**production** of **heterogeneous** **media**
whose **cultural** **outputs** have the **potential** **to** **change**
attitudes far **greater** than any **political** **program** which
claims to hold the key to **universal** **truth**.]{.underline} Julian
Reid's paper addresses the function of the concept of war in Deleuze's
thought, starting with a consideration of its role in transforming
representative practice, as outlined in Cinema II. Reid is troubled by
Deleuze's assumption of distinctive pre-and post-war cinema (and
representative practice more broadly), and his suggestion that the
Second World War brought about a schism in the way that representation
functions. Whereas pre-war cinema is concerned with the representation
of 'a people', post-war cinema arises out of the recognition of the
impossibility of this task. Indeed, not only is [the **representation**
of the **people** **now** **impossible**]{.underline}, it is
undesirable, [as it reinforces a **fascist** **fetishization** of people
as being of a **given** **identity** or type.]{.underline} Post-war
cinema focuses on gesturing to this very impossibility, whereby the
people are always missing or 'to come.[' The **problem**
here]{.underline}, according to Deleuze's own discussion of war in A
Thousand Plateaus, [is the **supposition** **that** **war** is something
extra-cultural, **extra-representative**, which can **influence**
**culture** and **representation** from **without**.]{.underline} On the
contrary, Deleuze is elsewhere at pains to insist that [war is
**immanently** **cultural** and **aesthetic**, and indeed, that we can
see certain modes of **culture** and **aesthetics** as themselves
**constituting** '**war'** on **established** **forms** of **cultural**
**practice**.]{.underline} In other words, cinema itself might be a war
on convention: in Deleuze and Guattari's terms, a 'war machine.' This
changes the stakes of the analysis. [**Rather than** seeing a **linear
progression** from one form of **representation** to **another**, what
is called for is the **understanding** that **culture and
representation** are themselves **always being taken up** by a **war
machine**, **oscillating** between **capture by the state** and **escape
in a line of flight**. While the **former** may **faithfully**
**reproduce** images of the **people** and the **territory**, the
**latter produces** only the **inescapable** **flight** into
**incalculability** where the **people** **are** **always** **missing**
and the **territory shattered**.]{.underline} [War is an **amalgam** of
**cultural** and **political affects** which may **swing** **between**
two poles: **obedience** to the state and the **deterritorialisation**
of all **the state stands for**.]{.underline} Reid suggests that Deleuze
makes use of the figure of 'the seer' in modern cinema, who is engaged
in an encounter with the 'the intolerable' and thus is always pointing
to that which is outside the frame and beyond representation. However,
Reid argues that the seer becomes enmeshed in cliché and is therefore
bound to a particular time-frame (1945--1968) in terms of the distortion
of cinematic claims to truth. More broadly, [sight itself becomes
thoroughly **contaminated** with **military** **logic**]{.underline}, as
outlined by Paul Virilio, [whereby **perception**, **capture** and
**domination** become part of the **same affective
moment**.]{.underline} Reid suggests that [**rather** than **identify**
the **ciphers of deterritorialisation**]{.underline} in postmodern
cinema, [we would do **better** to **focus** on the **processes of
state** **capture** and **escape**, through which we can **access the
ongoing** **flux** present in **every relation to the state**. At these
crossroads, where the **macro-and micropolitical encounter each other**,
the people are at stake.]{.underline} Brian Massumi addresses [the
**tendencies** of **contemporary** **war**]{.underline}, which [were
**intensified** though not **caused** by **September 11th
2001**]{.underline}**.** On the one hand, [the **post**-**September
11th** **security** **response** was **undertaken** in the **name** of
the **spectre** of the absent towers: one remembers what one does not
see.]{.underline} On the other, [**military** **action** becomes
increasingly **conceived** under the **banner of 'pre-emption'**, where
one acts to **prevent** **something** which has **not occurred**, which
has not been experienced.]{.underline} In this sense, [a **schism**
grows **between** (**military**) **action** and **perception**--- we can
**no longer trust our senses**.]{.underline} For Massumi, [this has
**revealing** **consequences** for how we are to **think**
**contemporary** **war** in **relation** to the **politics** of
**everyday** **life**. **Rather** than **thinking** in terms of what
**we experience** or **perceive**,]{.underline} Massumi suggests that
[we **ought** **to** **explore** **what takes place** in this space
**before perception**, in which we are primed for attention, ready to
perceive, on '**red alert**.']{.underline} [This space **before
action**, before decision, is increasingly **the subject of a military
'occupation.**' Rather than being a **discreet** **activity** which
takes place in a defined location against a pre-determined set of
people, **war becomes generalised**, ubiquitised, **prior to
politics**.]{.underline} Massumi cites Arquilla and Ronfeldt, who define
'soft power' as 'epistemological warfare', because it is concerned with
what people know, or what they think they know. Massumi suggests that
soft power is now ubiquitous. No longer merely the companion to
exceptional 'hard power' operations, 'epistemological warfare' has
become the condition of 'normal' political life. However, this is not
quite right. For [the current '**everyday** **war'** is concerned
**not** **so** **much** with what **we know** (or think we know) as
**what we** **are** (or are **becoming**).]{.underline} [This is **not
so much epistemological as ontological war**, concerned with the
**ongoing** **emergence** of **subjects** of **certain** kinds
**primed** **to** react and **respond** in certain ways to **emergent**
**dangers** which are **themselves** in a **permanent** **condition** of
**emergence**.]{.underline} [This **future-facing war** is always in the
**process** of **conditioning** **corporeal** **emergence** and
**determining** **future** **reactions**.]{.underline} [**Like
capitalism** itself, this **process is non-linear** and **seemingly**
**compatible** with the **Liberal predicates** of **freedom** and
**individualism**: predicates which are **incapable** of
**interrogating** the pre-individual **domain of affect**, and which are
thereby entirely **compatible** with this **generalised** **state** of
**war** (as a mode of **governance**) and **unable** to **provide** the
**platform** for an effective **critique** (as a politics of
resistance).]{.underline} Consequently, Massumi says that ['\[i\]t is
not enough to stop one war or even many. It is not enough to vote out
one government bent on war, nor many.' Rather the **task** is **to**
**reclaim** the **space of emergence**---of the **virtual**---which is
in **danger** of being **given** **over** to a **military** **logic** of
**pre-emption**.]{.underline} John Protevi is concerned with the
production of certain 'bodies politic' which constitute aspects of war.
The term 'body politic' is intended to draw attention to the extent that
military bodies cannot be understood exclusively through the prism of
either the somatic or the social. Rather, they must be understood as
dynamic assemblages; as Protevi says, 'geo-bio-techno-affective
assemblages', which exceed capture by any one interpretative framework.
[This **suggests** a **change** in the way in which we **deploy** the
**concept** of **the body** in **making** **sense of affective**
responses to war. It is **no** **longer** **sufficient** to rely on
**biological** **accounts** of why **bodies** **perform** in certain
ways.]{.underline} Rather, Protevi suggests, [we should **mobilise**
Deleuze and Guattari's **concept of affect**, which **refers** to the
**ability** **of bodies** to **form assemblages** with other
bodies.]{.underline} Indeed, [this is a **problematic** formulation in
the sense that the **body cannot be understood** **apart** from this
**ability**. It is the **formation** of **assemblages**, and the
**ongoing** **interaction** that bodies have with other bodies that
**enables** **us** to **define 'what a body is.'**]{.underline} And this
challenges the analytic approach to bodies at war which would seek to
distinguish among history, biology, culture, society and so on, when in
fact the connections that bodies make exceed and undermine these
distinctions. What is the key for Protevi is the way in which we can
think of war in adaptive terms, or as a selection pressure, without
essentialising either what we mean by 'war', or what we take to be the
responses and reactions of bodies. [This involves rescuing from the idea
of **simple** **evolution** a notion of the 'body politic' as a
**dynamic** **active** and **evolving assemblage**.]{.underline}
Discussing the phenomenon of 'rage' across historical cultures, Protevi
wants to rescue some notion of 'human nature' from the notion that all
emotions and affective manifestations are socially constructed or
context specific. However, this does not mean that they are amenable to
facile capture or representation through any single prism of analysis.
Rather, considering bodily responses and reactions from the perspective
of affect demands attention to the cyclical, dynamic and reactive
character of all actions/reactions. It is the differential bio-cultural
production of certain war-bodies with which Protevi is concerned, which
means that it is not enough for us to say that war is an eternal human
experience because of the highly variable ways in which 'war' is
experienced and conceived in different cultures. He gives the example of
music, which may create certain possibilities for group activity, and
prime certain affective responses resulting in variable iterations of
'war.' In this sense, music is immediately physiological, social,
cultural and military, in an emergent assemblage of bodies and
populations. Brad Evans analyses the post-9/11 security landscape
through the prism of Foucauldian biopolitics in order to outline the
ways in which the referent object of security is changing, and to
catalyse an exploration of the consequences of this for political
possibility and resistance. [We can see **security** **becoming**
**decreasingly concerned** with **identity** and **increasingly**
**focused** on **circulation** and **emergence**. In this sense, it is
**no** **longer** what **things** **are** that is the **focus** of the
**martial** **sciences**, but what they are **becoming**.]{.underline}
This produces a re-evaluation of the very meaning of 'security', and of
its meaning for politics and the place of war in contemporary society.
Moreover, [it is productive of a **change** in the **object** of
**security**, which is **no** **longer** a **defined** **group** or
state, but **life itself**; life **understood** as **always** **being**
in the **process** of **change** and **emergence**.]{.underline} Indeed,
[it is this **ongoing** **process** of **becoming** which **defines
'life' as such**. **Life is becoming**. It therefore **cannot** be
**secured** through **being** **fixed**, rather, **its becomings** must
be **monitored** and, if necessary, terminated before danger can be said
to have emerged.]{.underline} As Evans indicates, this creates serious
challenges for political thought. Firstly, ['**freedom'** becomes
**internalised** within the **system** of **security** and
**governance**, so that we can **no** **longer** think of **freedom**
**from** **security**, but of **security** as the **production** of
**freedom**]{.underline}. Secondly, [the **consequences** of
'**freedom'** become **radically** **unpredictable**.]{.underline} The
new sciences of complexity tell us that [we **cannot** **contain** this
radical freedom within a **certain** **political** territory or
**ideology**: rather, the **consequences** of **freedom** are inherently
**unpredictable** and **unstable**.]{.underline} This is nowhere better
illustrated than by the events of 9/11, when the potential of a
'catastrophic individual' to bring destruction and to transform
perceptions of the security situation was brought into painfully sharp
relief[. What this means is that **the event**,]{.underline} in
Deleuzian terms, [becomes the **object of security**, thereby creating a
paradox in which the moment **of political possibility** is also the
moment for the concentration of an **arsenal of military-strategic
forces** which are **actually** **productive** of the terrifying sorts
of event which they would seek to foreclose.]{.underline} Evans suggests
that resources from Deleuze's thought may allow us to think through
binaries such as present/future, finite/infinite, known/unknown, which
litter the terrain of discourses of security/freedom, through the
concept of difference which may mobilise an openness to political
formation which enables us to think a future beyond security, danger and
pre-emption. Guillaume Sibertin-Blanc offers an analysis of Deleuze and
Guattari's theory of **[the war machine]{.underline}** which [is
**concerned** **with** the way it can **produce** a **theory** of
**war** in which the **repressive powers of the state** are **not
localised** in the army, the police forces and so on, but comes to be
**constituted in certain ways** through the **dynamic** **interaction**
of forces which **either affirm the state or flee from
it**.]{.underline} In this respect, [a **genealogy** of **war**
**involves** **tracing** the **processes** **by** which **the war
machine comes to be captured by the state**, as well as being
**attentive** to the **lines of flight** along which the **war machine**
escapes **capture** and comes to **constitute a force of resistance to
state appropriation**.]{.underline} Reading Deleuze and Guattari's war
machine together with Clausewitzian precepts concerning the status of
war, what becomes apparent are the profound social and economic
ramifications of this reading of war. For Clausewitz, [war is the
**servant** of **state** **politics**, and can be so **precisely**
**because** it is not **itself** **political**.]{.underline} Similarly,
for Deleuze and Guattari, [**the war machine** is always **potentially**
**setting** up a line of flight from state politics, and is not itself
exhausted or determined by it.]{.underline} But Sibertin-Blanc argues
that Clausewitz places too much emphasis on war as an institutionally
governed historical reality, whereas Deleuze and Guattari are concerned
with the identification of the concept of the war machine
deterritorialised from its geo-political manifestations. [The
**process** by which the **war** **machine** is **captured** by the
**state** is **not itself military**, because the **military is the
outcome of this process**.]{.underline} Rather, [it is **territorial**
and **relates** to the circulation of **men** and **things** **within
the state**]{.underline}. In the current system, the state has lost
control of the war machine, and thus the war machine no longer has war
as its object, as this would have to be given by the state. Rather, [it
is **through** the **political** **economy**, and the **interstices of
society themselves**, that the war machine operates, manifesting itself
as a **global security order** rather than an **exceptional moment of
war**.]{.underline} Although states of exception still present a
challenge, [the **war** **machine** becomes **associated** with the very
**fabric** **of normality** as such which, no longer driven by the
state, becomes **disaggregated** **from** **politics**: a
**technocracy** of order which **presents** itself as **being** the
**very underlying** **conditions** of **life** **itself**.]{.underline}
Sibertin-Blanc suggests that [one could **replace** the **political**
end **given** to the **war** **machine** with the **economic** **end**
that it now has, in the sense that the **war** **machine** is
**concerned** with the **immanent** **unfolding** of the **capitalist**
**economy** itself.]{.underline} Further, he argues that [the idea of a
**war** **machine** dedicated to a '**global** **peace'** should not
**deceive** us into **expecting** a degree of **pacification** or a
**decline** in **violence**.]{.underline} Quite the contrary. The point
is rather that [the **global** **violence** and **instability** is
itself **internal** to the **world wide war machine** and does not
constitute an **interruption** in its **rule**.]{.underline}
Sibertin-Blanc leaves us with the challenge of thinking a politics of
resistance which can contend with the normalisation of war as a
background condition for everyday life; [a **politics** which, one
**cannot** be think, may itself **derive** some **sustenance** **from**
the **resources** of the **war** **machine** with which to **construct**
its **line** **of** **flight**.]{.underline} Gregg Lambert traces the
exteriority of the war machine to the state, and the relationship this
conjures between the state and 'the people.' He suggests that [the
**state** is **always** in the **process** of **seeking** to **capture**
the **people**, in **ideology**, in **political philosophy** or in a
**martial** **relation** to those who **defy** the state's
**insistence** on **interiority** and **regularity**.]{.underline}
[While the left might seek to build its legitimacy on the morality of
the people, this is an appropriation which actually serves to cauterise
the revolutionary potential of the peopl]{.underline}e in Deleuze and
Guattari's thinking. [The problem is that '**the people**' may all too
**readily** **collapse** into a **fascist assemblage**, the **nomad**
may appear most **prominently** in the guise of **an ambulant suicide
bomber**]{.underline}, and, as Deleuze and Guattari are themselves
appropriated by the IDF for the contribution that they can make into the
pacification of hostile striated space, it seems that [there is **no**
**conceptual** **territory** which is safe from the **grasping hands of
the militarists**, or from the threat of a **fatal**
**territorialisation** on the **black** **hole** of
**negation**.]{.underline} However, the point is that [the
**schizophrenic**, **bipolar** nature of concepts]{.underline} in
Deleuze and Guattari [**hauls** us **back** **from** the **brink of
despair**, because '**the people'** may also **appear as a war machine
with** respect to the state, producing the **emergence** of **new
political possibilities**.]{.underline} Lambert explores the figures
used by Deleuze and Guattari to dramatise the elusive and contradictory
nature of 'the people.' For example, Ahab and Bartleby both, in their
different ways, defy the state and thereby somehow embody it. They
betray it, and at the same time express what is most essential about it.
In this sense, they produce the American dream through their refusal to
conform to it. Through their failure in the eyes of the state, they
produce a creative line of flight from it. Only by failing can they
produce. [These refusenik or defiant figures]{.underline} who populate
Deleuze and Guattari's texts [are actually the **poles** of the
**revolutionary** **becomings** of the people. No one truly embodies the
American dream, there is **no perfect citizen**, and there are **no
people**. It is only through the **rejection** **of**, or **escape**
**from** these **injunctions** that a '**people to come**' can be
summoned; a **people** who **never arrives** but **stands** **for** the
**permanent possibility of difference** within a **political**
**system**.]{.underline} Lambert suggests that there are problems with
the ineluctable bipolarity of Deleuze and Guattari's war machine,
however, not least that we are left with the task of distinguishing
between 'destructive violence and creative violence.' This is not a new
problem, for is not the task of revolutionary violence the dedication of
force to the redemption of the world? The question is whether Deleuze
and Guattari offer us a novel way out of this conundrum. Lambert
suggests that we concentrate our research on the idea of death, which
may be the genocidal nadir to which the modern military arsenal
dedicates itself, or [which may be a space of **pure becoming**, 'A
Life', which **represents** the **pure** **form** of **political**
**possibility** and **therefore** the **counter** to the **black**
**hole** to which the **war machine collapse**.]{.underline}

### Link---Cap/Innovation

**The modern war machine has already exceeded the bounds of the state,
now occupying the position of an ever expanding axiomatic that seeks to
endlessly conquer. On the one hand of this new mechanism lies the forces
of the priest, the deterritorializing mode of capture that disassembles
the territories and desires external to it. On the other, however, lies
the emperor, the force of the international, the market that
reterritorializes the subject and world with grids of value. Like
Newton's 3^rd^ law, this system's productive potential is thus
constantly constrained by tension between the two sides, defined by an
equal conservative force that seeks equilibrium.**

**Glezos, 10** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,

Practices: Deleuze, Schumpeter and Capitalism\'s uneasy relationship
with technical innovation\",
https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/view/14685/5555)//guyB

[This innovative drive within capitalism is what leads Deleuze and
Guattari to describe the capitalist axiomatic as a machine for the
deterritorialization of flows, as capitalist enterprises constantly seek
out new technical innovations as a means to free up flows of labour,
knowledge, resources, energy and commodities. This presumed
relationship]{.underline} between capitalism and technological
innovation [cuts both ways]{.underline}. [On the one hand, capitalism is
innovative, driven by the profit principle to constantly seek out
cheaper, quicker and more efficient methods of production]{.underline}.
[On the other hand, innovation is capitalist, as new innovations further
cement and empower the real subsumption of productive practices under
the capitalist axiomatic. Understanding the relationship between
capitalism and innovation in such a way creates a problem for those of
us on the left who, on the one hand, wish to challenge the exploitation
and violence of the capitalist axiomatic while, on the other, feel
attracted to the power and promise that new technologies
provide]{.underline}. We find ourselves [wondering if capitalism is
necessary to bring about this technological progress]{.underline} or,
even worse, if the technological fruits of capitalism are fundamentally
tainted by their lineage. [By using the technology of advanced
capitalism, are we necessarily forced to capitulate or deform ourselves
to the requirements of the capitalist axiomatic? This
dilemma]{.underline}, however, [changes]{.underline} radically [if we
challenge this essential, almost ontological, connection between
capitalism and innovation]{.underline} \-- [not by arguing that
capitalism doesn\'t possess an innovative drive, but by arguing that
**this drive is paralleled by an equally strong conservative
drive**]{.underline}. [As much as capitalist enterprises are driven by
market forces to introduce technological innovations, they are equally
driven to limit, and frequently inhibit, technological innovation in
ways which are necessary for them to maintain their control over the
various processes of production, delivery, and consumption]{.underline}.
This is why Deleuze and Guattari argue that, [at the same time as the
capitalist axiomatic is a deterritorializing machine, it is also an
apparatus of capture]{.underline} which, though it deterritorializes
various flows, always then \"[maintains the energy of the flows in a
bound state on the body of capital.]{.underline}\"
[\[2\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn2) This
essay will attempt to [complicate the seemingly essential relationship
between capitalism and innovation]{.underline}. In doing so it will be
fighting a war on two fronts. Against those boosters of capitalism who
see in it only innovation and progress, I will argue that [because of
the potential danger that innovation can pose to capitalism\'s coherence
and control, **it is frequently pressed to inhibit that
innovation**]{.underline} \-- [to channel, decelerate and in some cases
reverse it]{.underline}. Conversely, to those critics who see in
technological innovation only the further perfection of capitalist
exploitation,
[\[3\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn3) I
argue that, [because of this uneasy tension, **new
technologies**]{.underline} (specifically new digital technologies)
**[present potential sites of resistance and possibility which can be
deployed against key capitalist axioms.]{.underline}** I will begin by
investigating the question of technological innovation through the work
of Joseph Schumpeter. Here I will note how we see, even in Schumpeter,
that prophet of innovation and entrepreneurship, the outline of
capitalism\'s conservative tendencies. I will then model this opposition
through Deleuze and Guattari\'s conceptions of the capitalist axiomatic
as both a machine for the deterritorialization of flows and an apparatus
of capture. Finally, I will investigate this model through the specific
case-study of advanced digital information technologies. Capitalism and
Innovation Innovation and Entrepreneurship We start with Joseph
Schumpeter as the theorist of capitalist dynamism par excellence. He is
the great thinker of technical innovation in capitalism, through the
figure of \"creative destruction.\" However, for our purposes, what is
most useful about Schumpeter is that he also theorizes what he terms
[\"restrictive practices]{.underline},\" which [function]{.underline}
within capitalist production [to constrain, channel and decelerate
innovation]{.underline}. However, before we get to these restrictive
practices, an analysis of Schumpeter\'s account of innovation is
necessary. [Technical innovation]{.underline}, for Schumpeter, [takes
place against the backdrop of the day-to-day capitalist production that
occurs in a relatively stable, static and circular fashion]{.underline}.
[\[4\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn4) In
day-to-day production, the processes of production and exchange maintain
a relatively steady equilibrium that is produced through market
pressures according to basic laws of supply and demand.
[\[5\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn5) This
is not to say that change doesn\'t take place. But change is either
steady and incremental or a result of exogenous upheavals (such as wars
or natural disasters) which will eventually be adapted to. Within this
\"accustomed circular flow,\" every individual can act promptly and
rationally because he is sure of his ground and is supported by the
conduct, as adjusted to this circular flow, of all other individuals,
who in turn expect the accustomed activity from him\... While in the
accustomed channels his own ability and experience suffice for the
normal individual\...
[\[6\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn6) As a
result, rational prediction and planning can take place, and the future
can (barring exogenous change) be projected from the present. However,
opposed to this process of circular flows, [Schumpeter then directs our
attention to a collection of processes which produce \"a change in the
channels of economic routine or a spontaneous change in the economic
data arising from within the system]{.underline}.\"
[\[7\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn7) That
is to say, Schumpeter [identifies moments of innovation]{.underline}
[[\[8\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn8)
which produce spontaneous, yet endogenous,]{.underline}
[[\[9\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn9)
change in the production process and create upheavals in the established
equilibrium. When these innovations end up working, economic life is
thrown out of equilibrium: **new rules have to be invented**, and
economic laws have to reassert themselves.]{.underline} [Old
practices,]{.underline} processes and technologies which are less
efficient or profitable than those which innovation brings, as well as
those firms which are unable to adapt[, are replaced.]{.underline}
[\[10\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn10) [It
is this process which produces that \"perennial gale of creative
destruction\"]{.underline}
[\[11\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn11)
that is at the heart of Schumpeter\'s analysis of capitalism.
Capitalism\'s unique qualities as an economic formation are expressed
through creative destruction. It encourages innovation and ensures that
old ways of doing things, however comfortable and traditional, are
discarded when they are shown to be inefficient. In so doing, the human
potential for production and achievement expands and accelerates,
seemingly without limit. Restrictive Practices [Many
accounts]{.underline} of Schumpeter (and [of capitalism]{.underline} in
general) [end here]{.underline} \-- with a description of the steady and
circular flow of economic life, slowly expanding due to demographic
shifts, occasionally radically accelerating due to technical
innovations. [This gives the impression of a healthy equilibrium
alternating between times of static/circular flow and times of rapid,
discontinuous change]{.underline}. However, [this is to miss the way in
which these two moments are in tension]{.underline}. Indeed, [the only
equilibrium is to be found within the circular flow of economic life,
which innovation, in the Schumpeterian sense, shatters, destroying old
certainties and forcing a new equilibrium to be painfully and
erratically (re)composed]{.underline}. Schumpeter is well aware of how
upsetting the upheavals of innovation can be within economic life.
Indeed, [just the possibility of such innovations diminishes the ability
to act rationally and plan effectively in economic life:]{.underline}
\[T\]he impact of new things \-- new technologies for instance \-- on
the existing structure of an industry considerably reduces the long-run
scope and importance of practices that aim, through restricting output,
at conserving established positions and at maximizing the profits
accruing from them.
[\[12\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn12)
Schumpeter goes on to draw out how [the \"perennial gale of creative
destruction\" can affect the day-to-day functioning and decision making
processes of economic production]{.underline}: [Practically any
investment entails, as a necessary complement of entrepreneurial action,
certain safeguarding activites such as insuring or hedging. Long-range
investing under rapidly changing conditions]{.underline}, especially
under conditions that change or may change at any moment under the
impact of new commodities and technologies, [is like shooting at a
target that is not only indistinct but moving \-- and moving jerkily at
that.]{.underline}
[[\[13\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn13)
The \"destruction\" of creative destruction is not just leveled against
older forms of economic activity.]{.underline} [**It is the destruction
of all the certainties of the economic system,** which actors use to
make decisions]{.underline}, plan, and organize production. **[Actors
within the capitalist system thus have a vested interest in the
maintenance of the system as it is]{.underline}** and [\"will cling as
tightly as possible to habitual economic methods and only submit to the
pressure of circumstances as it becomes necessary]{.underline}.\"
[\[14\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn14)
[This conservative element within capitalism is, however, not just
expressed through a baseline intransigence to novelty]{.underline}. In
addition to this passive resistance, [capitalist production is marked by
a collection of what Schumpeter terms \"restrictive practices,\"
practices that exist for the purpose, express or not, of decreasing the
rate and velocity of technological innovation, as well as for
**channeling it in systemically acceptable ways**]{.underline}. [These
restrictive practices include, first, \"patents or temporary secrecy of
processes or, in some cases, long-period contracts secured in
advance]{.underline}\"
[\[15\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn15)
and, second, what Schumpeter calls [\"monopolistic
practices\",]{.underline}
[\[16\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn16)whereby
[a firm, corporation or industry uses economic power to control or ward
off technical innovation, despite it being useful/profitable, as a way
of decreasing the shocks and destabilizations that innovation can bring
to the economy.]{.underline} We will discuss each of these sets of
practices in more detail shortly. For now [it is useful for us to
realize that restrictive practices of this kind, as far as they are
effective, acquire a new significance in the perennial gale of creative
destruction, a significance which they would not have in a stationary
state or in a state of slow and balanced growth]{.underline}. In either
of these cases restrictive strategy would produce no result other than
an increase in profits at the expense of buyers\... But [in the process
of creative destruction, restrictive practices may do much to steady the
ship and to alleviate temporal difficulties]{.underline}.
[\[17\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn17)
This is to say, [these restrictive practices are not temporary failures
or distortions of the market]{.underline}. Rather [they serve a
necessary and central function in the reproduction of the capitalist
system]{.underline}. We will now look at these arrangements in detail.
Patents It is somewhat odd at first that Schumpeter identifies patents
as one of his restrictive practices that inhibits technical innovation
since, in principle, [the purpose of patents it to encourage the
development of new technologies.]{.underline}
[\[18\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn18) Of
course, in a very narrow sense, patents are essentially restrictive
since they serve to put legal limits on the use of a practice or
technology. As Christopher May and Susan Sell describe, [Intellectual
property]{.underline} \[of which patents are one form\] [constructs a
scarce resource from knowledge or information that is not formally
scarce]{.underline}. Unlike material things, **[knowledge and
information are not necessarily rivalrous, and therefore coincident
usage seldom detracts from social utility]{.underline}**. Whereas [two
prospective users must compete to use a material resource]{.underline}
(And this competition may be mediated through markets and the setting of
a price), [two or more users of any particular item of knowledge or
information can use it simultaneously without competing.]{.underline}
[\[19\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn19)
[The logic of this restriction is that, by creating an artificial
monopoly around a form of knowledge, the law ensures that the creator
will be able to make money selling it (or at least more money than they
would if they had competition).]{.underline} By doing this, the law
provides an increased incentive to create and innovate. Alternately, if
\"information is not property, the incentives to create it will be
lacking. [**Patents and copyrights are social innovations designed to
create artificial scarcities where none exist naturally**\... These
scarcities are intended to create the needed incentives for acquiring
knowledge]{.underline}.\"
[\[20\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn20)
[Why then identify patents as a restrictive practice if, in theory, they
serve instead to encourage innovation and change?]{.underline} At the
very least, [for Schumpeter, patents serve as a restrictive practice
since they give the company introducing the innovation a level of
certainty and stability through their property in the innovation in
question]{.underline}, allowing them to determine how and to what extent
the innovation will be introduced, rather than having to react to the
competitive pressures of the market as a whole. **[This can frequently
mean that the innovation will be introduced and utilized in a suboptimal
manner]{.underline}**. May and Sell describe [James Watt\'s refusal to
license his steam engine patent, requiring that all engine construction
and sales go through him]{.underline}: \"[By doing so he may have \'held
back the development of the metalworking industry for over a
generation\'. Had his monopoly expired in 1783, England might have had
an extensive railway system much sooner.]{.underline}\"
[\[21\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn21) [If
a single patent can have this kind of effect on the progress of
technical innovation, it is not surprising that businesses frequently
look at the acquisition of patents as a way of controlling the
market]{.underline}.
[\[22\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn22)
More than this, [the legal structure of patents creates a potential
barrier to entry as the cost of defending them tends to discriminates
against smaller and weaker entrepreneurs, in favour of stronger
interests]{.underline}. [This function of patents as a way of
**inhibiting, rather than encouraging, technical
innovation**]{.underline} becomes even more acute as [contemporary
post-industrial economies become more dependent on intellectual property
as a source of value]{.underline}. With the rising value of intellectual
properties, [we increasingly see what Arti Rai and Rebecca Eisenberg
term \"upstream patenting,\" which is to say patenting not just \"end
products\" but also \"fundamental discoveries that provide the knowledge
base for future product development.\"]{.underline}
[\[23\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn23)
[Scientific and technological progress has always depended on a certain
amount of openness and free exchange of ideas, especially in the realm
of pure research. **New patenting strategies, however, seek to close off
this openness**]{.underline}, because of the developer\'s fear of losing
control of the potential value of a discovery. This is dangerous because
\"\[[u\]pstream patents may also hinder subsequent research if they give
a single entity monopoly control of basic research discoveries that
enable subsequent investigation across a broad scientific
territory]{.underline}.\"
[\[24\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn24)
[The open space of scientific discussion and debate has been replaced by
a \"patent thicket]{.underline}\" in which [researchers are frequently
incapable of affording access to necessary forms of knowledge, and are
afraid to act because of the threat of legal ramifications]{.underline}.
This leads some writers to speak of the creation of an \"anti-commons\"
[\[25\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn25) in
which the collective knowledge of human effort is increasingly parceled
off to individual ownership. [Software development constitutes another
area]{.underline} (and a particularly crucial one in the context of the
contemporary information economy) [in which patents can serve to inhibit
innovation]{.underline}. [Patent laws in the US allow developers to
patent not just entire applications, but any component part of the
program, including tools, algorithms, or even a particular combination
of existing technologies or ideas]{.underline}. As all the individual
building blocks of computer code begin to be patented, **[it becomes
almost impossible to write a computer program that doesn\'t infringe on
one patent or another]{.underline}**.
[\[26\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn26)
[For the large corporations this isn\'t a problem]{.underline}, as [they
each tend to possess large patent portfolios]{.underline}, which [they
can then cross-license against one another]{.underline}, ensuring that
[they are able to make software unobstructed]{.underline}. [For smaller
developers, however, the choice is to either pay the license, which can
frequently make the software unprofitable, or work around the patent,
which is time-consuming and might not even be possible]{.underline}. The
effect of patents on software development is therefore much the same as
the effect of \"upstream patenting\" on scientific research: [the
existence of a monopoly over the tools for the production of new
knowledge]{.underline}. [In patents **we thus see an instrument which
fits nicely with capitalism\'s ambiguous relationship with technological
innovation**]{.underline}**.** [Patent law provides a legal structure
for the ownership of knowledge, a way of encouraging innovation, while
in turn that same structure provides a measure of control over that
knowledge.]{.underline} **[Patent law turns what is potentially a public
good into private property, making scarce what is not by
nature]{.underline}**. It [turns the unruly progression of human
knowledge into another commodity to be privately held, controlled and
deployed for profit]{.underline}. Monopolistic Practices In addition to
patents, Schumpeter identifies another mechanism of control, what he
terms monopolistic practices, which refers to the economic powers that a
large-scale concern is able to wield over the market. In Schumpeterian
language, [a firm need not be a full monopoly]{.underline}, which is to
say in complete control of a particular commodity or market, [to employ
monopolistic practices]{.underline}. **[It must simply be able to exert
a certain amount of autonomous control over the market]{.underline}**,
either alone or in concert with a few other concerns (it might be more
accurate to call these practices oligopolistic but for the time being we
will stick with Schumpeter\'s terms). [Patents and monopolistic
practices are not entirely unrelated]{.underline}, as patents confer a
sort of monopoly and large corporations are able to more effectively
acquire, enforce and contest patents. [Large-scale concerns are able to
use their power to inhibit technological innovation where it might
threaten the existing forms of production.]{.underline} Thus, says
Schumpeter, [Progress entails,]{.underline} as we have seen,
[destruction of capital values in the strata with which the new
commodity or method of production competes]{.underline}. In perfect
competition [the old investments must be adapted at a sacrifice or
abandoned]{.underline}; but when there is no perfect competition and
when each industrial field is controlled by a few big concerns, these
can in various ways fight the threatening attack on their capital
structure and try to avoid losses on their capital accounts; that is to
say, **[they can and will fight progress itself]{.underline}**.
[\[27\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn27)
[Where the innovation is the result of the firm\'s own research, it can
be introduced slowly]{.underline}, after current fixed capital
investments have already been written off.
[\[28\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn28) [If
the innovation comes from a smaller competitor, the concern can use
patents and legal challenges to delay the introduction, or simply buy
out the competitor and shelve the innovation.]{.underline} Though large
corporations are capable of delaying technical innovation in the short
term, Schumpeter is not concerned about their ability to substantially
diminish or block progress: \"The power to exploit at pleasure a given
pattern of demand \-- or one that changes independently of the
monopolist\'s action and of the reactions it provokes \-- can under the
conditions of intact capitalism hardly persist for periods long enough
to matter for the analysis of total output.\"
[\[29\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn29)
[Monopolistic practices thus serve as a way of slowing down or smoothing
out the abrupt and destructive consequences that technical innovation
can have]{.underline}. [This is useful not just for the individual
concerns,]{.underline} says Schumpeter, [but for the market in general,
which can potentially be thrown out of equilibrium, or drop into a
depression, through the destruction of capital attendant to technical
innovation]{.underline}: \'Restraint of trade\' of the cartel type as
well as those which merely consist in tacit understandings about price
competition may be effective remedies under conditions of depression. As
far as they are, they may in the end produce not only steadier but also
greater expansion of total output than could be secured by an entirely
uncontrolled onward rush that cannot fail to be studded with
catastrophes.
[\[30\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn30)
Though Schumpeter may be relatively unconcerned with the effect of
monopolistic practices, later theorists argue that this is because he
was writing before the true ascendancy of the large scale concern or
corporation and had yet to see what real monopolistic practices could be
deployed in the market.
[\[31\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn31)
According to Baran and Sweezy, in Schumpeter\'s time there were still
enough small scale economic firms to ensure that new technical
innovations would eventually, if slowly, work their way into the market.
However, [with the rise of]{.underline} what they term \"[monopoly
capitalism]{.underline},\" which is to say the rise of the market being
primarily dominated by large corporations which are able to express
monopoly-like control (and which relate to one another according to
principles of \"corespectivity,\" rather than traditional economic
competition), [there is no longer the same competitive pressure to
innovate, or to take account of innovations produced by
others.]{.underline} [Once the \"largest-scale unit of control\" has
taken over, \"the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of
supply, the new type of organization\" all tend to be monopolized by a
handful of giant corporation]{.underline}s.
[\[32\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn32) As
a result of this, [innovations are typically introduced (or soon taken
over) by giant corporations which **act not under the compulsion of
competitive pressures but in accordance with careful calculations of the
profit-maximizing course**]{.underline}. Whereas in the competitive case
no one, not even the innovating firms themselves, can control the rate
at which new technologies are generally adopted, this ceases to be true
in the monopolistic case. [It is clear that the giant corporation will
be guided not by the profitability of the new method considered in
isolation, but by the net effect of the new method on the overall
profitability of the firm]{.underline}. And this means that in general
there will be a slower rate of introduction of innovations than under
competitive criteria.
[\[33\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn33)
Baran and Sweezy argue that \"this means that Schumpeter\'s perennial
gale of creative destruction has subsided into an occasional mild
breeze.\"
[\[33\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn33)
[The ability of large corporations to exert monopoly-like economic power
in the market affects both the pace and direction of technical
change.]{.underline} In the most basic sense, [this can mean the general
production of sub-optimal technology (sub-optimal both in terms of what
is available according to existing technologies and in terms of
inadequate research and development)]{.underline}. One example of this
is what\'s commonly known as planned obsolescence.
[\[34\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn34)
However, [this capitalist reticence towards technical innovations need
not be based solely on fear of competition or being supplanted in the
market]{.underline}. [New technical innovation, even when not in
conflict with existing productive processes, and when developed by one
of the large concerns, might still be deemed undesirable due to the way
that they subvert the existing principles of capitalist organization and
private property regimes]{.underline}. Take, for example the development
of certain information and communication technologies. [New
communication technologies allow for a more fluid and decentralized
distribution of information and decision making]{.underline}, thus
making numerous processes within production and exchange potentially
more efficient. As Peter Meiksins describes, [One of the potential
consequences of the new technologies is to create a technological basis
for alternative ways of organizing economic activity]{.underline}, for
pushing further some of the embryonic efforts to decentralize economic
activity\.... Since these technologies facilitate rapid communication
over long distances, it now is possible for widely separated enterprises
to coordinate their activities. Moreover, since they are also able to
provide individuals and/or enterprises with sophisticated, up-to-date
information about markets, the behavior of other actors within the
technological network and other relevant matter, those individuals
and/or enterprises no longer need to be confined within rigid,
prescriptive plans and procedures set well in advance. Instead, with an
understanding of what is expected of them, they can react autonomously
and creatively to the information provided through the technological
link.
[\[35\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn35) The
trouble is, however, that [decentralizing information and allowing for
autonomous and creative decision making accelerates and exacerbates
elements of uncertainty and unpredictability that we have described as
being uncomfortable for capitalist enterprises, as well as subverting
hierarchies of control present in most corporations]{.underline}. As
such, [moments of autonomy and creativity are to be kept to a
minimum]{.underline}. Frequently, [rather than taking advantage of these
opportunities, capitalist enterprises will instead use these new
information technologies as a way of surveilling and controlling more
completely the actions of workers and consumers]{.underline} \-- even
when this is less efficient, and less desirable to the consuming public.
[The individual capitalist is thus torn between two separate drives: the
first the drive to innovate, to make things more flexible and efficient,
the **second the drive to conserve, to maintain stability, control and
capture**]{.underline}. Meiksins shows how the banking sector provides a
key example of this tension: [In the case of banking, the contradictions
are\... obvious.]{.underline} [Systems are installed with the explicit
purpose of reducing teller discretion, replacing middle level
management, and increasing centralized control over information flow and
the behaviour of employees.]{.underline} Yet, at the same time, [under
pressure from external markets to extend the range of banking services
available to customers, banks are forced to \"upgrade\" tellers; the new
technology is used to provide tellers with information and abilities
that they can use to sell a wider variety of banking services and
products to customers. Banks are clearly uncomfortable with this
contradiction, and do whatever they can to limit and \"program\" away
teller discretion]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the underlying
contradiction does not disappear and the possibilities of the new
technology cannot be entirely suppressed.
[\[36\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn36)
Tensions [This tension between technical innovation and established
interests, between creative destruction and restrictive practices,
between progress and control, lies at the heart of the capitalist
assemblage. Deleuze and Guattari map this tension theoretically in the
image of capitalism as both a machine for the decoding and
deterritorialization of flows and as an apparatus of
capture]{.underline}. By pursuing this tension through Deleuze and
Guattari\'s analysis, [however, we can go beyond the duality of
Schumpeter\'s account, uncovering a more volatile and multifarious
capitalism than even the prophet of creative destruction
imagined]{.underline}. [The capitalist axiomatic is marked by two
drives: **the accelerative and the conservative**]{.underline}. On the
one hand, [it decodes and deterritorializes flows, freeing up stocks of
goods, people, knowledge, money, etc. that might be immobilized by
tradition or insufficient technological advances]{.underline}. [The
capitalist axiomatic]{.underline}, as Marx tells us, [drives to break
every barrier and loose every fetter]{.underline}. In this regard, [it
must reject the sovereign overcodings which necessarily territorialize
and block these flows]{.underline}. And yet, [just as this
deterritorializing movement pushes towards the
\"infinite,\"]{.underline}
[[\[37\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn37)
towards an absolute deterritorialization, the capitalist axiomatic must
function as an apparatus of capture and reterritorialize these flows
back \"on the full body of capital]{.underline},\"
[\[38\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn38)
which is to say immanently [reintegrate them into the orderly process of
capitalist production]{.underline} (which, as we saw above, is willing
to tolerate surprisingly little in the way of novelty, disorder and
dynamism). Thus, in contrast to the image we saw in the introduction,
[**capitalism is not synonymous with innovation and progress**, is not
defined purely by an inherent dynamism,]{.underline} because [it only
ever effects \"relative breaks, because it \... maintains the energy of
the flows in a bound state on the body of capital as a socius that is
deterritorialized, but also a socius that is even more pitiless than any
other]{.underline}.\"
[\[39\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn39) At
the same time as it has a tendency to overcome limits, \"capitalism only
functions on condition that it inhibit this tendency, or that it push
back or displace this limit, by substituting for it its own immanent
relative limits, which it continually reproduces on a widened scale. It
axiomatizes with one hand what it decodes with the other.\"
[\[40\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn40)
**[Even as capitalism is driven to innovate for the purposes of
efficiency, it needs to ensure that this innovation does not require the
supplanting of core capitalist axioms of control and coherence over the
productive processes]{.underline}** (the case of the banking industry\'s
struggle with the trade off between flexibility and control is
instructive here). [Deleuze describes this conservative drive in terms
of the creation of blocks of antiproduction which stop production and
innovation from \"getting away from\" the capitalist
axiomatic]{.underline} and running roughshod over the calm and orderly
process of production. Thus, the axiomatics of antiproduction \"double
the capital and the flow of knowledge with a capital and an equivalent
flow of stupidity that also effects an absorption and a realization that
ensures the integration of groups and individuals into the system. Not
only lack amid overabundance, but stupidity in the midst of knowledge
and science.\"
[\[41\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn41)
**[What we have then is a tension between two opposing forces, one
innovative and deterritorializing and the other conservative and
reterritorializing.]{.underline}** However, [let us not make the mistake
of conceiving of this duality of forces as some manner of dialectical
contradiction which will be resolved in a future synthesis]{.underline}.
[This duality of forces is constitutive of capitalism, and therefore
cannot be resolved]{.underline}. The best that can be hoped for is the
contingent and aleatory stabilization of the conflict somewhere between
the two ideal poles of creativity and control. [This is one of the roots
of the sheer multiplicity of forms of capitalism we see in the
world.]{.underline} [Different capitalisms \-- and different sectors
within different capitalisms \-- produce and are produced by different
negotiations between these warring forces]{.underline}. Where the
balance between these opposing forces will be established is the result
of multiple factors within the capitalist assemblage in which they take
place, including cultural practices, legal structures, political
formations, business and management cultures, material conditions, etc.,
all of which are themselves the aggregate results of countless
micro-level decisions.
[\[42\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn42)
Thus on the one hand we might see a manufacturing sector which inclines
towards conservatism, even in the face of a declining rate of profit,
[\[43\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn43)
while on the other hand we might see a financial sector which inclines
towards greater risk and innovation in pursuit of new investment
opportunities (for example, the development of increasingly esoteric
credit instruments which lie at the heart of the current economic
crisis). [The stabilizations achieved between these various conflicting
forces are always contingent, contingent both because they are the
result of complex and innumerable decisions made at a variety of
levels]{.underline} (and hence not the result of an immutable economic
or technological logic unfolding in teleological time), but also
contingent since [they do not fundamentally resolve the contradiction
between these opposing forces]{.underline}; they merely negotiate
between them and produce a temporary equilibrium. As time progresses,
these opposing forces will require new negotiations in response to new
dangers. If a particular market cleaves too closely to the conservative
pole, we will potentially see its collapse (the failure of the \"big
three\" automakers in America, for example). Conversely, [we are
currently seeing what happens when the creative impulse in capital
markets is pushed beyond the capitalist axiomatic\'s limit of coherence
and control]{.underline}. In this regard we see how [deterritorialized
flows which escape reterritorialization can potentially become
unreterritorializable \"lines of death.]{.underline}\"
[\[44\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn44)
Deleuze and Gauttari remind us, however, that there is another
possibility for the deterritorialized flows that capitalism is so driven
to produce. In addition to spiraling off into nothingness, or being
relatively reterritorialized onto the body of capital, there is also the
possibility that they might be absolutely reterritorialized onto another
plane of immanence. [Deterritorialized flows might become lines of
flight, leading to potentially non-capitalist spaces. This is of
interest to those of us who see in technological innovation at least the
potential of a challenge to capitalism. We might look to the possibility
of taking advantage of those deterritorialized flows which capitalism
produces and turning them against it, exacerbating them, **using them as
lines of flight and escape that might lead us to new and different
worlds**]{.underline}. As an example of how technological innovations
can turn against the capitalist axiomatic, in the next section we will
turn to the specific case-study of the development of new information
technologies. Here we will see [a line of deterritorialization that the
capitalist axiomatic is unable to comfortably reterritorialize
relatively, and which has the potential to turn into a line of flight
that might be absolutely reterritorialized on a whole different plane of
immanence]{.underline}. This is to say that [we see how a
deterritorialized flow might, if pushed beyond the comfort level of the
capitalist axiomatic, produce a non-capitalist regime or
practice.]{.underline} Information Technology and Intellectual Property
Rights We can start by looking at one particular aspect of information
technology, the drive for the increased digitalization of information:
\"Digitalization has removed the quality/copy trade-off, by allowing
generational copies to be, for all intents and purposes, exact copies of
the original digital artifact\... a \'frictionless environment\' for
content, where successive copies do not degrade\...\"
[\[45\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn45)
There are countless ways in which this digitalization has been useful to
business, both in terms of production and day-to-day operations. From
the ability to speed up internal communication, to making production and
delivery of music, books and film cheaper and more efficient,
digitalization perfectly serves capitalism\'s internal drive to decrease
production and circulation time and accelerate capital as
value-in-motion. The problem however is that, [as digitalization
produces a \"frictionless environment,\" producers are increasingly
incapable of maintaining control over content]{.underline}.
Digitalization \"immediately raises the potential threat that once a
digital good is distributed, unauthorized copies can compete throughout
its market for consumer use.\"
[\[46\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn46)
[Once the digitalization of content combined with widespread access to
high-bandwidth networks]{.underline} (as well as increasingly cheap
memory) it became feasible to share digital content with people anywhere
in the world. This ability le[ad to the rise of Peer-to-Peer software
(P2P) such as Soulseek or BitTorrent, which allowed individuals to
search the collections of all other users on the network and download
from them]{.underline}. [The potential to freely distribute information
was seen as a deep threat to the ability of corporations to control
their products]{.underline}. According to the Recording Industry
Association of American \[RIAA\], \"estimate\[s\] for worldwide losses
in 1994 was \$2.245 Billion,\"
[\[47\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn47) and
the Business Software Alliance claims that \"losses to the worldwide
software industry caused by the use of unlicensed software were said to
amount to US\$10.97 billion in 2001.\"
[\[48\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn48) [In
response to the loss of control over content brought about by these new
technologies, the **content owners have sought to employ the restrictive
practices with which we are now familiar**]{.underline}. In the first
instance, the media concerns sought to use legal power against illegal
copying. [The RIAA, for example, in 2003 began a campaign of tracking
down and suing music downloaders for copyright violations]{.underline}.
[\[49\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn49) In
concert with this increased enforcement has been a push for an increased
scope and power of copyright laws. For example, \"\[o\]ne of the more
notorious measures is the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), an act
of US congress\...whose purpose is to update US copyright laws for the
digital age.\"
[\[50\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn50) The
DMCA allows for quicker enforcement of copyright law through the use of
\"take-down notices\" which need not go through the courts. This
[deployment of legal power was then backed-up by a deployment of
economic power to decrease the speed and flexibility of information
technology]{.underline}. One way this was done was through the
introduction of what are termed Digital Rights Management (DRM)
technologies, the introduction of code into digital content and players
that limits their ability to be used for piracy purposes. [What is
important to understand is that the use of DRM technology exists solely
for the purpose of increasing the ability of copyright holders to
control their content and necessarily results in the production of
sub-optimal technology]{.underline}. DRM [decreases the speed, ease and
flexibility of information technology, making interoperability more
difficult, and even disabling the ability to use it in non-infringing,
but also non-authorized ways]{.underline} (such as Fair Use, or using
digital technology to produce and play independent media created and
distributed for free). Indeed, DRM technology frequently makes digital
technology less functional than the non-electronic equivalent,
inhibiting the ability to do such things as make back-up copies, use
small portions for personal use, or even lend it to a friend. **[DRM
necessarily makes information technology worse. It attempts to reverse
the effects of the \"frictionless environment\" that digitalization
introduced]{.underline}**. Here, [we can think back to Deleuze and
Guattari\'s reference to doubling the flow of information with a flow
stupidity]{.underline}. This is particularly important in the context of
a culture in which media consumers are frequently also becoming media
producers. [Remixing, mash-ups, self-publishing, micro-low-budget
filmmaking: all of these new forms of independent media production are
aided by the increasing fluidity of digital media.]{.underline}
Technologies such as DRM make it more difficult for independent
producers to use new media technologies, and hence potentially ensure
the monopoly of large media concerns over content production. In
response to this purposeful sub-optimalization of digital technology,
individual users all over the world have taken to trying to overturn DRM
technology. Hackers figure out how to break encryption technology on
DVD\'s, strip DRM out of music files, crack software and open up music
and video players for unrestricted use. In response to this, media
conglomerates have returned to legal powers as way of protecting their
sub-optimal technology. Another, and perhaps more disturbing, aspect of
the DMCA is that it \"prohibits circumvention of any technological
protection against copying and prevents the production of any device or
provision of any service designed to defeat protection mechanisms.\"
[\[51\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn51)
[This tension between the potential of information technologies and the
attempts to control them, both through legal and economic means, has
lead to a struggle between producers and users]{.underline}. As media
corporations try to close Pandora\'s box and reacquire the control over
information that they lost with the development of digital technology,
users have become increasingly enchanted with the possibilities that
these technologies provide, and frustrated with attempts to block their
use and development. [The work hackers have done is just one element of
a more generalized push to take advantage of the speed and flexibility
of digital technologies, and take control of the possibilities that they
offer]{.underline}. Indeed, **[these individual acts of technological
subversion, frequently undertaken for self-interested reasons (not that
that makes them illegitimate), have begun to percolate into broader
social and political positions]{.underline}**. As people see how digital
technologies allow for information to be easily shared and re-mixed,
used and combined, they begin to question the current structure of
intellectual property and the types of control it seeks to exercise. As
a result certain groups have begun to develop new ways to think about
intellectual property. [One example of the attempt to develop a new
intellectual property regime is seen in the \"Creative Commons\"
license: The Creative Commons is a non-profit corporation established in
Massachusetts,]{.underline} but with its home at Stanford University.
Its aim is to build a layer of reasonable copyright on top of the
extremes that now reign. It does this by making it easy for people to
build upon other people\'s work, by making it simple for creators to
express the freedom for others to take and build upon their work. Simple
tags, tied to human-readable descriptions, tied to bulletproof licenses,
make this possible.
[\[52\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn52)
[Creative commons licensing allows creators to give away, up front, the
right to use their work in specific ways]{.underline}. The most
interesting thing about the use of Creative Commons licensing for our
purposes is the way in which it begins not from the primacy of the
singular author as the agent of creativity but instead from the commons.
As knowledge producers (whether in the arts or sciences) become aware of
the ease with which communications technologies can facilitate
collaboration, and as users become increasingly used to forms of
knowledge production based on the explicit use and repurposing of old
knowledge objects (everything from software development to music
remixing), [the idea of creativity as the gift of a sole agent begins to
wane in favour of an image of a vibrant commons of intellectual
labour]{.underline}.
[\[53\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn53)
[The creative commons license is not \"anti-capitalist\" per
se.]{.underline} [What it does do is re-introduce the notion of the
commons as a central figure in the innovation of human
knowledge]{.underline}. A similar set of challenges to the maximalist
form of intellectual property rights comes from the Free Software
foundation and the idea of Free Software/Open-Source Software (FS/OSS):
\"FS/OSS is software whose source code is shared. Anyone can download
the technology that makes a FS/OSS program run. And anyone eager to
learn how a particular bit of FS/OSS technology works can tinker with
the code.\"
[\[54\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn54) [To
call it \"free\" software does not mean that it is given away for no
charge]{.underline}. What it does mean is that the software is free of
any copyright rules or restrictions which would inhibit your ability to
use, change, or even share the program. Free Software is distributed on
a special copyright license that producers call \"copyleft:: Copyleft
uses copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite of its usual
purpose: instead of a means of privatizing software, it becomes a means
of keeping software free. The central idea of copyleft is that we give
everyone permission to run the program, copy the program, modify the
program, and distribute modified versions \-- but not permission to add
restrictions of their own. Thus, the crucial freedoms that define \"free
software\" are guaranteed to everyone who has a copy; they become
inalienable rights.
[\[55\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn55) The
use of copyleft turns copyright against itself. Copyleft not only
releases information into the public domain, but ensures that anyone who
wants to use that information will also have to contribute to the public
domain. It is thus an engine for growing the intellectual commons. The
FS/OSS movement, though constrained to a narrow (though increasingly
important) sector of production, challenges the current property regimes
and seeks to encourage a mode of production based on ethical and
intellectual beliefs in collaboration and community. [In addition to
those actively trying to promote alternative intellectual property
regimes, there are multiple groups trying to affect the functioning of
the current regime, such as the Electronic Freedom Foundation and The
Association for Progressive Communication, both of which \"attempt to
influence the global communications policy agenda from a civil society
perspective.\"]{.underline}
[[\[56\]]{.underline}](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn56)
In addition to these specific organization \"\[m\]ajor Foundations, such
as the Ford Foundation, Markle Foundation, and George Soros\' Open
Society Institute, have supplied critical funding and encouragement to
bring civil society actors interested in information and communication
technologies together.\"
[\[57\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn57)
Thus we see how [**the development of technological lines of
deterritorialization can become lines of flight, leading from the
capitalist axiomatic to new organizations of law**, right, politics and
economics (not to mention artistic and scientific innovation). It\'s
true that none of these organizations or movements are explicitly
\"anti-capitalist.\"]{.underline} However, all advance ideas which begin
to challenge the current intellectual property regime, and also
challenge central axioms of capitalist production, consumption, labour
and organization. In [the case of the alternate intellectual property
regimes we discussed, though they do not separate themselves from the
capitalist market]{.underline} (indeed, they build on the current
existing intellectual property regime), [they do challenge it by opening
up new spaces, showing new possibilities for production]{.underline}
(the essential nature of the Creative Commons is to give away your
property rights, to allow others access to that which is supposedly
yours). Indeed, [we should not conceive of the idea of absolute
reterritorialization as the complete rejection of all capitalist
principles]{.underline} ( and even less as a revolutionary overthrowing
of the capitalist regime), [nor should we conceive of a non-capitalist
plane of immanence as one that is completely separate from the
capitalist axiomatic]{.underline}. [Such binary duality between the
capitalist and the non-captialist is unnecessary. For a line of flight
to be absolutely reterritorialized on a new, non-capitalist plane of
immanence, it need only function in such a way as to challenge one or
more of capitalism\'s central axioms and open up a space for alternative
production or consumption]{.underline}. It may continue to enter into
assemblage with the capitalist axiomatic (indeed, given the capitalist
axiomatic\'s scope and intensity in late modernity, it would be almost
impossible for it not to). However, in doing so, it forces a change in
the territory of the capitalist assemblage, expanding its borders and
challenging its axioms. In this case, we see a collection of actors and
organizations that advance the idea that innovation and progress are
better served and encouraged through some element of common ownership of
human knowledge, rather than exclusive private property. Note that this
is a fairly radical claim. [It is one thing in this day and age to
challenge the justice and equity of capitalism]{.underline}. [But to
charge it with inefficiency and conservatism is to strike where it is
supposedly strongest]{.underline}. These organizations have seen the
opportunities that new information and communications technologies
provide, how much easier they make collaboration and cooperation, how
they make possible the leveraging of mass collective action for problem
solving and production. [The purpose of this account is not to suggest
that digital technologies are the gateway to a glorious post-capitalist
utopia]{.underline}. Nor is it to argue that if we manage to overcome
DRM technology capitalism will have been defeated.
[\[58\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn58)
Rather, it is to point out that, [in the face of all of the discussions
about the wonders of post-industrial info-capitalism, capitalism and
digital technologies **do not fit together perfectly, but rather exist
in an uneasy tension**]{.underline}. By looking out for fault-lines
between particular innovations and particular capitalist axioms [we can
see and develop potential sites of resistance. And by having an open and
experimental attitude towards economic and technological
practices,]{.underline}
[[\[59\]](file:///C:/Users/jzilm/Downloads/cds004_Glezos.html#_edn59) we
can potentially take advantage of new technologies and push them into
new, unexplored spaces \-- spaces of imagination, innovation, community
and equality.]{.underline}

### Link---Ecological Immanence

#### We have entered a crisis of global security. In the face of anthropogenic climate change, the Magician Emperor and Jurist Priest have produced an ecological will to transcendence to surf the molecular movements of the climate. This transcendence over the Earth's ecosystems is thus the modus operandi of sovereign modes of capture, constantly deterritorializing fields of immanence to reterritorialize them upon lines of the market, the state, the international. 

**Marzec 16** (Robert P. Marzec, associate professor of ecocriticism and
postcolonialism in the department of English at Purdue University, "The
end(s) of immanence in the anthropocene: militarized ecologies and the
future of Deleuzian thought," Journal for Cultural Research 20(4), 2016,
pgs. 381-386)//JRD

As I write this essay, it is a week into the 2015 United Nations
Convention of Climate Change (officially known as "Conference of
Parties" or "COP21"). It is also two weeks after the attacks in Paris by
Syrian teams said to be working on behalf of ISIS. [**Syria** is one of
the **many ground-zero sites for climate change**, a fact not often
mentioned in descriptions of the nation's situation with
ISIS.]{.underline} The complexities of religious and ethnic diversity,
along with pressures from global neoliberalism certainly play a factor
here. But, [according to climate changes specialists, "**water and
climatic conditions** have played a **direct role** in the
**deterioration** of Syria's **economic conditions**"]{.underline}
(Gleick, 2014, p. 331). [**Anthropogenic** **effects** on **ecosystems**
are at the **heart** of **water-related violence** around the world, and
**water scarcity** will only become **more of a "security risk"** for
communities as we move further into the **twenty-first
century**.]{.underline} [According to the UN]{.underline}
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the **[IPCC]{.underline}** --
the world's leading authority on global warming), [this projected future
will **not change in time** to substantially **reverse** the course of
significant **ecological transformatons**, even with heroic efforts. The
**toxic** fallout from **anthropogenic desire** -- the coconstitutive
**underside** of humanity's **transcendence** of **environmental
limitations** -- will continue to have an effect for **centuries to
come**.]{.underline} We are already locked into at least a 1.5--2 °C
increase in total atmospheric temperature. In fact, total elimination of
C02 emissions today would only result in a decrease in atmospheric C02
of approximately 40 percent by the end of the century (bringing us back
to roughly 1995 levels) (Meehl et al., 2007, p. 749). With current
emissions "as usual" (which involves a continual increase in CO2s and
other greenhouse gases from economic "development") we could possibly
see a 5 or 6° increase, which would have a devastating effect on
planetary life. [This **deterritorialization** of the **world's
ecosystem** constitutes the new parameters of human and **nonhuman**
**ecological** existence. It is no wonder, then, that the **military and
security institutions** take climate change **seriously**.]{.underline}
They have come to draw out the necessary consequences of our ecological
occasion when others have continued to debate its existence. [The
singular challenge in the face of these events for the kind of
philosophy made possible by Deleuze,]{.underline} it seems to me, [is
the **struggle** to **conceptualize** **possible** **alternatives** to
current ecological circumstances]{.underline} (or perhaps ["**ecological
immanence**" would be a more appropriate]{.underline} syntagma to use
here). But [this]{.underline} also [requires an **intense** **analysis**
of both current and past **affiliations** between **security and the
planet's environment.**]{.underline} [These affiliations are
**complex**]{.underline}, [and have a]{.underline} [long history, dating
back to **military developments**]{.underline} that predate modern
nineteenth- and twentieth-century military innovations [and
**technologies**.]{.underline} Such an analysis is beyond the scope of
this essay, but suffice it to say that [the **military** in the **modern
era** (]{.underline}from the seventeenth century onward) [has
increasingly attempted to **strike up organic**, **immanent** relations
to **ecosystems**, alongside its more obvious attempts to **control**
**environments** in order to **transcend** **them**.]{.underline} [With
the official commencement of the **security society**]{.underline} (when
the US National Security Act was signed into law in 1947), [attempts to
**territorialize** the **immanence** of **nature** become both **more**
**scientific** and **systematized** (in accordance with State
protocols).]{.underline} [The most recent wave began **overtly** with
the **publication** of **dozens** of Defense Department documents such
as "**National Security** and the **Threat of Climate
Change**"]{.underline} (2007), ["Taking Up the Security Challenges of
Climate Change"]{.underline} (2009) [and]{.underline} others, including,
as well, [the **official targeting** of climate change in the 2010
**Department of Defense's** Quadrennial **Defense Review
Report**.]{.underline} These have been followed by hundreds of
statements by military officials and by speeches in which President
Obama and other politicians directly link climate change to national
security. This "incitement to discourse," to take a phrase from
Foucault, followed the publication in 2007 of the IPCC's Fourth
Assessment Report, which provided the most evidence and was the most
emphatic statement to date about the precariousness of our environmental
situation. This discursive event, I want to argue here, differs from
earlier Cold War affiliations between security and the environment. As
we'll see security in the Cold War was characterized by a
State-incorporated war machine (which I'll refer to in this essay as
"the military machine"). Its role in both political and civil society
was to act as an apparatus of capture. However, [the **post-fascist**,
and now **post-9/11** and **post-IPCC** **2007-Report** military machine
take a fundamentally **different attitude** toward nature.]{.underline}
[After]{.underline} roughly [**2007**, the **military machine** gives up
the desire to transcend the **immanence** of the planet's **ecological
bankruptcy.** Instead the **military** **machine**, moving **beyond**
**the State**, seeks to take on this eco-crisis, **to "surf" its
molecular movements**.]{.underline}1 During the Cold War the military
took the role of the State, was incorporated as the State's War Machine,
and operated as a machine of transcendence -- attempting to transform
environmental events such as climate, harvests, insect infestations, and
even considered creating climate change itself in order to redirect the
earth's climate to a US advantage (Hamblin, 2013). [Today **"Nature"**
has been **retooled as "climate change"** -- an **empty axiomatic**
that, in the **hands of security experts**, functions to **saturate the
socius** in the **same style as "terrorism."**]{.underline} [The
**military machine**]{.underline} -- [which has evolved into
the]{.underline} "security society" (or ["**control
society**]{.underline}," as Deleuze terms it) -- [therefore now takes up
a **fundamentally** **different** relation to
**immanence**.]{.underline} Faced with these developments can Deleuzian
philosophy offer a counterpoint to such an immanent technology of
security? Security and immanence Deleuze's focus on [**immanence**
constitutes a **struggle** to release **thought** **from** moralizing,
**transcendent** **formations** that **constrain** it within
**frameworks** of **logic**, **certainty**, and
dependability.]{.underline} [Opposed to the **authoritative**
**transcendence** of a **moralizing** system, immanence offers a more
**concrete** **engagement** with the **molecular**]{.underline},
[**heterogeneous** singularities of a **moving existence.** It defines
the **struggle** within **thought** for what has yet to be thought,
rather than the **application of already constituted knowledge** on new
forms of existence.]{.underline} Furthermore, as Dan Smith elegantly
argues, [**immanence** is key to Deleuze's development of **ethical
explorations**, which arise always "from a **purely immanent point of
view**"]{.underline} (Smith, 1998; p. 251). In developing an ethics
grounded in immanence Deleuze distinguishes between "ethics" and
"morality": morality attempts to subsume all acts within a transcendent
code, to capture them within predetermined nets of rules and
regulations; ethics instead is a term that refers to "facilitative"
rules that evaluate our actions according to "immanent modes of
existence"(Smith, 1998, p. 252). Yet, as Deleuze and Guattari
consistently emphasize, [**States**, imperialisms, and **apparatuses of
domination** in general also **strike** **up** **immanent**
**relations**.]{.underline} [They even **depend on them**]{.underline},
[and function by **establishing** certain **transcendent**-**immanent**
**affiliations** that **do not deny** or destroy **immanent
matter-in-motion**]{.underline} (there is no destroying immanence, only
reworking its general movements and potentials). Even the illusory
transcendent systems of morality such as Christianity only exist by
grafting themselves onto immanent relations: it is "not the existence or
nonexistence of a transcendent God but rather the immanent modes or
existence of those who must choose between his existence or
nonexistence" (Smith, 1998, p. 258). Early post-structuralism would
approach this problem of transcendence (its nonpositive impossibility)
in Derridian terms of the "absent center," in which the deconstructive
act (namely: tracing the logic of a system through to its inevitable
antagonistic conclusion) reveals the center of a structure to be
imaginary, and its supposed presence not a positivism but a "play of
différance." The power of this "critique of Western metaphysics" lies in
its revealing of power structures to be functions of an inherent
emptiness that acquires its "cohesion" in a "contradiction" that
"expresses the force of a desire" (Derrida, 1978, p. 352). Deleuze's
conceptualization of immanence complicates this critical recourse of
emptiness by substituting the focus on emptiness as the ultimate act of
unveiling for a focus on the material manifestation of transcendental
impulses: "Transcendence may be entirely 'empty' in itself, yet it
becomes full to the extent that it descends and crosses different
hierarchized levels that are projected together" (Deleuze & Guattari,
1994, p. 89). The fantasy of transcendence is made possible, Deleuze and
Guattari argue, by the continual generation of this metaphysical desire
by individuals and communities in specific modalities: "The transcendent
God would remain empty ... if it were not projected on a plane of
immanence of creation" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1994, p. 89). The
"appearance" of Christian transcendence manifests itself only in the
individualized relations one strikes up with this system of belief,
which is heterogeneously interpreted. [The **key difference** in the
relation of **State apparatuses** (transcendence) and **War Machines**
(immanence) would appear to lie]{.underline}, at least in What is
Philosophy?, [in the **constitution of the Figure**]{.underline}: "In
... imperial unity or spiritual empire, the transcendence that is
projected on the plane of immanence paves it or populates it with
Figures" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1994, p. 89). [We can find **many such
"Figures"** in today's **environmental** **developments** and struggles
for "**energy security**": "**oil**," "**gas**," "**ethanol**," and now
**even "water"**]{.underline} itself [have become **key "Figures"** of
**national security**, in addition to **global
commodities**.]{.underline} [The geopolitics of **national** and
**global security** also **transforms** **ecosystems** into
**geopolitical** **regions** that take on the character of
Figures]{.underline}: [**the Amazonian Rainforest**, the areas of
**dying water zones**]{.underline} [(such as in Syria), the **North
Pole** with its **gas and oil reserves** (accessible now that the
**polar** **ice** **caps** have **decreased** so
**extensively**).]{.underline} [These ecosystems have been
**deterritorialized** in the sense that they are **no longer complex**
ecosystems in the **anthropocene**.]{.underline}2 [They have become
**zones of insecurity** demanding to be **captured by security and
developed by capitalist interests**.]{.underline} [It becomes a question
as to how the machine of security functions in relation to this new,
deterritorialized earth]{.underline} -- if its capturing mechanisms
function like the old State, or if its mechanisms extend beyond State
rigidity to enact a different relation to immanence. To return,
Deleuze's connection of immanence to "deterritorialization" in "The
Treatise on Nomadology" and "The Apparatus of Capture," and later in
"Geophilosophy," complicates the relationship between transcendence and
immanence even further. In "Geophilosophy" Deleuze and Gauttari describe
two forms of relationship between immanence and deterritoralization: "[a
**major** **difference** arises **depending** on whether **relative
deterritorialization** takes place through **immanence** or through
**transcendence**]{.underline}" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1994, p. 88). Here
it would seem as if a fundamental distinction were being made between
immanence and transcendence, yet the phrase deterritorialization
"through transcendence" is further clarified in terms of what might be
called an integrated or streamlined repetition. The specific term they
use is "rotation": ["When it is **transcendence**, **vertical**,
**celestial**, and **brought** **about** by the **imperial** **unity**,
the **transcendent** **element** must always **give** **way** or submit
to a sort of **rotation** in order to be **inscribed** on the
**always-immanent** plane of **Nature-Thought**"]{.underline} (Deleuze &
Guattari, 1994, p. 89). [The security society has an intense interest in
such forms of "rotation,"]{.underline} and in fact it might be said that
[the **movement of security** as a fundamental feature of existence
depends on this **capturing of immanence** within what might be called a
**controlled vortex of desire**]{.underline}. For instance, [a new
ontological demand arose in]{.underline} eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century [military theory]{.underline}, [a disciplinary but
also securitizing demand that would seamlessly combine the military need
for a central command structure that could control soldiers
who]{.underline} [were]{.underline} coming to be [deployed at greater
and greater distances]{.underline}: battlefields, in other words, were
expanding as war came to develop along national, international, and
colonial lines. The command network and its communication systems often
broke down when soldiers were in the field. Out of range and in the
midst of a chaotic conflict more, encounters became more nomadic; they
arose outside the parameters of battle anticipated by those in command,
who had always necessarily stood "off site" (to invoke Deleuze and
Gauttari's description of the architectural plan in relation to the
construction of cathedrals). [In the face of this new challenge the
**military machine** came to be **enamored** with the idea of an
**organic architecture**, one that could **combine** the **immanence**
of the battlefield with the **transcendence** of the central
command.]{.underline} The search began for what came to be known as the
"higher-order motor." The higher order motor, as Manuel De Landa has
powerfully described in his Deleuzian analysis of military history,
arises from the desire to move from mechanistic assemblages (which
operate through forced and inflexible "top down" command structures) to
machinic assemblages (that function instead as self-organizing
singularities) (De Landa, 1991). [At the center of the military machine
lies the **demand**]{.underline}, of course, [for **organized**
**uniformity**]{.underline}. [This demand is problematic, for
**immanence is anything but uniform**.]{.underline} The theory of the
higher order machine, however, combined the overwhelming logic of 1) a
unidirectional pattern of thought, with 2) the belief in an organic form
of organization and rationality. But as an incorporated and highly
disciplined military machine gave way after the World War II to the
security society, the demand for uniform security gives way to singular
sites of security, organized around a progressively heterogeneous
deployment of insecurity. [At this point, the **higher order** motor
begins to take on a **scientific-ecological** character.]{.underline}
[It becomes less a matter of creating an ultimate military command
structure and instead a **scientific expedition** for **ontological
presences** -- powerful organizational **forces** -- assumed to be
lurking underneath human and nonhuman activity.]{.underline} A different
set of questions come to be posed: When and why do certain animals and
insects change their inharmonious movements into a unified assemblage
(crickets chirping in unison, for instance)? How do whales communicate
and organize their movements across such great distances? How do
deep-ocean currents form a natural pattern? [How do weather patterns
come to solidify to develop into disasters? The **search** for **these
organizational sequences** were an attempt to **constitute** an
**engagement** with **Nature** **"from the ground up,"** not from a
**transcendental imperative**.]{.underline} The nineteenth-century
higher order motor, to add another dimension here, predated Taylorism,
and thus was already operational when Jeremy Taylor was conducting his
research on the army. In other words, the movement of the higher order
motor to a "ground level" before and after the World War II predated the
State's decentralization of capital to the private sector. The
importance of De Landa's work lies in his reconstellation of history in
terms of these events, and the extensive manner in which they make
possible a human integration within a machinic assemblage governed by
war[: the "**history** of **military applications"** must be thought in
terms of "the **effects** of **technology** on the **military**,
understood here as being itself a **coherent 'higher level'
machine**:]{.underline} a machine that actually integrates men, tools
and weapons as if they were no more than the machine's components" (De
Landa, 1991, p. 4). This is precisely the direction that Deleuze and
Gauttari take toward the end of both the "Treatise on Nomadology" and
the "Apparatus of Capture" (which I will come to shortly). [The ability
of a self-organizing event -- a **singularity** that **changes** the
course in which **environments**]{.underline} (human, mechanical,
ecological) [**rise** and **develop** -- to take on **higher level** or
higher order **activations** names the moment at which a **certain
mode** of **production** formerly **limited** to a **specific** **site**
or field of **creativity** expands to enchain **multiple sites**, thus
**becoming** a **globalized** and a seemingly **"Nature-made"** mode of
**production**. It is the moment when war takes on the pretension of
being the basis of existence. In such a way, **military** **technology**
sets itself up as a **field of knowledge** production concerned with the
fundamental questions of the universe]{.underline} -- fundamental
questions that can [lead the scientist and the military leader on the
path to find the ultimate, natural foundations for universal security
itself]{.underline} (the moment when "peace" and "war" collapse in upon
one another -- when "peace" becomes "a form" that releases "total
(planetary) war" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, pp. 421, 422, 448, 467). De
Landa first traces out the development of a higher order machine of war
at the site of cryptology. This development begins with the creation of
cipher machines -- the tool that eventually develops into the modern
personal computer: The first modern computers were assembled in the
crucible of World War II, in the heat of several arms races: the
cryptological race against the cipher machines of Nazi Germany and Japan
and the race against German scientists to build the first atomic bomb.
The war produced not only new machines, but also forged new bonds
between the scientific and military communities. (1991, p. 5) Here, we
can begin to understand the essential relation between the war machine,
its incorporation by the State, and the phenomenon of acceleration
demanded by the circumstances of State-generated war. [**Militarized
ontology** has its essence in the **enforcement** of what we might call
a **"rotated velocity,"** designed to **replace** discretely
**heterogeneous** forms of motion and movement and teleologically direct
them toward the generation of a process that "**biologically**"
**organizes** itself.]{.underline} This empirical need to expeditiously
solve the problem of encrypted messages, however, did not remain
distinctive to the problem of breaking enemy codes. The intense pressure
on the allied forces to crack codes generated a magnitude of force that
angled an explanatory form of science (which it concurrently developed)
to military concerns: "Never before had science been applied at so grand
a scale to such a variety of warfare problems" (1991, p. 5). [This
particular brand of **science** and the objects it produced formed a
kind of **technological** "**swell**" that impacted both political and
social **production** on a **massive scale**.]{.underline} The result of
this collaboration, the discipline known as "operations research," has
evolved in the hands of cold warriors and think tanks into the more
inclusive "management science" (systems analysis), which in effect
transfers the command and control structures of military logistics to
"the rest of society and the economy." At such a point, human agency and
the larger-than-human structures become effects of the higher order
motor connected to the larger groundswell generated through the intense
pressure of science and the military working in conjunction to solve the
problem of mathematical encryption. De Landa's Deleuzian analysis
reveals how [this **new organizational process** arises out of the
pressures of a **historical** **occasion** that brings about a unique
machine, a new set of **procedures** that **expand in multiple
directions**: from the immediate context of decoding encrypted material
to an entire field of logistics that begin to take up **residence** in
the **economy and social system at large.**]{.underline}

#### Conceiving of the world as transnational alliance rather than structured by an exceptionalist antagonism produces a political order that maintains the ontological foundations for global hegemony \-\-- only embracing American defeat guarantees a maintenance of the metaphysical coordinates that sustain America 

**Spanos '2K** \[William, Professor of English and Comparative
Literature at Binghamtom, *America's Shadow*, 2000, p. 191-193\]

What I have argued in this book about the relationship between
philosophy and imperialism is that [[the]{.mark} euphoric annunciation
of the [end of history]{.mark}]{.underline} and the advent of the New
World Order [[by the deputies of]{.mark} the dominant [American
culture]{.mark} at the end of the Cold War [is symptomatic of]{.mark}
the achievement of the [global hegemony]{.mark} of \"America\"
understood not simply as a **political order**, but [as a **way of
thinking**.]{.mark}]{.underline} I have claimed that [[this triumphant
\"American\" way of thinking is not exceptionalist]{.mark}, as **it has
always been claimed by Americans**]{.underline}, especially since de
Tocqueville\'s announcement of the advent of democracy in America, [[but
European]{.underline},]{.mark} [which means **[metaphysical]{.mark}**:
an **[imperial thinking]{.mark}**, whose]{.underline} [provenance
resides in Roman antiquity, [that sees]{.mark} the being into which it
inquires as [a **totalized spatial image**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[a
\"**field**\" or \"**region**\" or \"**domain**\" to be
**comprehended**, **mastered**, and **exploited**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

But [this way of putting [this]{.mark} imperial metanarrative, though
necessary]{.underline} in [the context of the amnesiac imperatives of
thinking]{.underline} the Enlightenment as an epochal emancipatory
moment in world history, [is too general.]{.underline}

[It does not account for the historically specific transformation of
this European mode of knowledge production accomplished in the wake of
America\'s emergence as a global power: the fulfillment of the
Enlightenment\'s]{.underline} \"**[developmental model]{.underline}**\"
[in the effacement of the visible imperial logos informing traditional
metaphysics by way of the apotheosis of the \"objectivity\"]{.underline}
of empirical science and the advent of the classificatory table. Under
the aegis of a triumphant America, [the narrative economy of [European
metaphysics has come to]{.mark} its end in the form of [a **universal
instrumentalism**]{.mark}, a **[Man-centered thinking]{.mark}** for
which [**everything in time and space** is seen as a
\"**problem**]{.mark}\" that the larger comparative \"**picture**\"
renders **[susceptible to a final]{.mark} and determinate
[solution]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In Heidegger\'s proleptic terms, [[European metaphysical
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} in the technological age dominated by
America [[has become \"**Americanized**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" a
[\"re-presentational\"/\"calculative\" thinking or
\"**planning**]{.underline}\" [that has transformed]{.underline} [the
uncalculability of being at large [into a planetary \"world
picture]{.mark}]{.underline}[\":]{.mark}

\"**[We get the picture]{.underline}**\" [concerning something does not
mean only]{.underline} [that what is, is set before us, is represented
to us]{.underline}, in general, but that what is stands before us --- in
all that belongs to it and all that stands together in it --- as a
system. [\"To get the picture\" throbs with being acquainted with
something, with being equipped]{.underline} and prepared for it. [Where
the world becomes picture, what is, in]{.underline} [its entirely, is
juxtaposed as that for which man is prepared and which]{.underline},
correspondingly, [he therefore intends to bring before
himself]{.underline} [and have before himself, and consequently intends
in a decisive]{.underline} [sense to set in place before
himself]{.underline}. Hence **[[world picture]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
when understood essentially, [[does not mean a picture of the world
but]{.underline} **[the world]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[conceived and
[grasped as picture]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is, in its entirety, is
now taken in such a way that it first is in being and only is in being
to the extent that it is set up by man, who represents and sets forth.
[Wherever we have the world picture, an essential decision takes place
regarding what is, in its entirety]{.underline}. The Being of whatever
is, is sought and found in the representedness of the latter.1

Reconstellated into the [context of this Heideggerian diagnosis of
modernity, the American end-of-history discourse undergoes a resonant
estrangement. What is euphorically represented as \"good news\" ---the
global fulfillment (\"end\") of the emancipatory promise of History ---
comes to be seen as the [Pax Metaphysica: the colonization of]{.mark}
the errant mind of [humanity at large by a banal]{.mark} and banalizing
[thinking that has reduced everything]{.mark}, including human beings,
[to \"standing]{.mark} \[or disposable\]
[reserve.\"]{.mark}2]{.underline}

This \"end of philosophy\" in the form of a \"triumphant\"
instrumentalist thinking that has reduced being to disposable commodity
is everywhere manifest in the post-Cold War era. And, I suggest, its
most telling symptom is the globalization of (American) [English as the
lingua franca of the \"free market,\" which has as one of its most
devastating consequences the \"**Americanization**\" not simply of the
Western nation-states but of **entire Third World
cultures**]{.underline}.

What for the purpose of my argument this global triumph of \"American\"
thinking means is that **[even [those who would oppose
American]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[global [hegemony
are]{.mark}, insofar as they remain indifferent to the ontological
grounds of its sociopolitical practices, [condemned to think their
opposition according to]{.mark} the imperatives of [the discursive
practices they would oppose]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They [thus fulfill
the expectation of the deputies of American]{.underline} [culture who
predict that \"even **[nondemocrats]{.mark} will [have to speak
the]{.mark}** **[language of democracy]{.mark} in order [to
justify]{.mark} their [deviation]{.mark} from the single universal
standard**]{.underline}.\"3

That is to say, the fulfillment of the European metanarrative in the
globalization of American technological thinking, that is, the
Americanization of the planet, has tacitly reduced opposition to a
resonant silence. It is in this sense that, with Heidegger, [the
intellectual who is attuned]{.underline} [to the complicity between
Western philosophy and imperialism is compelled to call this \"**age of
the world picture**\"]{.underline} presided over by America
[a]{.underline} \"**[destitute time]{.underline}**\" or, more
suggestively, \"[a realm of in-between]{.underline}\" --- \"the No-more
of the gods that have fled and the Not-yet of the god that is coming.\"4

In the context of the impasse of oppositional thinking, in other words,
he/she is compelled to acknowledge the time of the postCold War occasion
as an interregnum. [This]{.underline}, [for an opposition that **limits
resistance to the political**, **means a time of defeat**]{.underline}.
But [for the oppositional]{.underline} [thinker who is attuned to the
**ontological exile**]{.underline} to which he/she has been condemned by
the global triumph of technological thinking it [also means the
recognition that this exilic condition of silence constitutes an
irresolvable contradiction in the \"Truth\" of instrumental
thinking]{.underline} --- the \"shadow\" that haunts its light --- [that
demands to be thought. In the interregnum, **[the primary task]{.mark}
of the marginalized intellectual [is the rethinking of thinking
itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And, as I have suggested, [[it is the
event of the Vietnam War]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
dominant [American]{.mark} culture\'s inordinate [will to forget
it]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- [that provides the
directive]{.underline}]{.mark}[s [for this]{.mark} most difficult of
[task]{.mark}s []{.mark}not impossible[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Confronting the metaphysical structures of European thought is a prerequisite to solving any environmental catastrophe or nuclear war 

**Grove '16 \[**Jairus, Professor of IR @ Hawaii, January 11, 2016,
<http://bostonreview.net/forum/new-nature/jairus-grove-jairus-grove-response-jedediah-purdy>\]

Unlike many who appeal to the Anthropocene simply to advance the cause
of geoengineering, Jedediah [Purdy]{.underline} begins with an
assessment of our political condition. Still, he **[fails to appreciate
the nature of [the geopolitics responsible for the crisis we
face]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If we are to take up his noble call for an
ecological democracy, we must acknowledge that [the [violence]{.mark}
done to our planet has largely been perpetrated not by all humans but by
a select group of Europeans. The Anthropos]{.underline}---the human
species as such---[is not to blame. Properly named, [our era]{.mark} is
not the Anthropocene but [the Eurocene]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It was [a
European elite]{.mark} that [developed a]{.mark} distinctively
[mechanistic view of matter]{.mark}]{.underline}, an oppositional
relationship to nature, [[and an economic system indebted to
**geographical**]{.mark} **[expansion.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[The resulting [political orders measured success by how much
wealth could be generated in]{.mark} the [exploitation]{.mark} of
peoples and resources]{.underline}. [The geological record bears the
mark of this European assemblage of hierarchies]{.underline}.
[[Understanding]{.mark} the forces of Europeanization]{.underline}---the
forces of [[racial superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[economic
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and global
resettlement]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[is essential to
understanding]{.mark} how the planet got to this point, and [how "we"
could possibly become democratic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Purdy and
others claim there are two reasons for renaming the last few centuries
to mark a new geological era. The first is a matter of accuracy: there
is significant evidence that humans have contributed to climate change.
The second is a matter of consciousness raising: renaming the Holocene
is essential to raising awareness that humans are responsible. Yet on
both counts, [we should reconsider what we mean by "human]{.underline}."
It would be more accurate, and go further in raising awareness, to
acknowledge the grossly disproportionate impact Europeans have had on
our planet. [This is not just another hyperbolic jeremiad against
European peoples: Purdy's invitation for global democratic thinking
requires a geological history and name that **foregrounds what really
stands in the way** of such a future.]{.underline} As Purdy points out
(unlike Paul Crutzen and others), the "human" footprint involves much
more than just carbon dioxide. [On a geological time scale, the effects
of atmospheric [carbon dioxide are dwarfed by those of
radioactivity]{.mark} and are comparable to those of plastic, the modern
waste product par excellence.]{.underline} [If the Anthropocene is meant
to name the scale of human impacts on the planet, it should refer not
only to warming but also to cooling the earth, and Europeanization has
done both at levels that even China's current growth cannot
match.]{.underline} Beginning in 1610, a small-scale ice age took hold
of the planet when a wilder arboreal nature took back what had been
inhabited land: [some 20 million people killed by the European invasion
of the Americas resulted in vast reforestation of the North and South
American continents. The providence spoken of by those who arrived was
not God but syphilis, influenza, and the number of other species that
went along for the ride.]{.underline} **[[Waves of well-armed]{.mark}
[European]{.mark} explorers and [settlers leveraged]{.mark} the
[devastation for their own gain]{.mark}. There is no way to know how
many languages, cities, ideas, cosmologies, and ways of inhabiting the
world were lost in this genocide and terraforming of the Americas. The
history of nuclear weapons is also predominantly
European]{.underline}**. The bombing of [Hiroshima]{.underline} on
August 6, 1945, [is only the beginning of this story]{.underline}. [In
the years that have followed, more than 2,000 nuclear weapons have been
tested,]{.underline} about [97 percent of which were detonated by
European powers]{.underline}. [Those detonations do not appear as tests
from the perspectives of the Marshallese or Western
Shoshone.]{.underline} [A seventy-year nuclear war has spread cancer,
incinerated sacred lands, and made other spaces uninhabitable on a
temporal scale several orders of magnitude more condensed than the
lifespan of atmospheric carbon dioxide.]{.underline} The nuclear powers
of the Eurocene---the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France,
and Israel---possess 97 percent of the 15,800 nuclear weapons around the
planet. **[The [beleaguered]{.mark} state of the [arms control]{.mark}
agenda [means self-annihilation is still a very real
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [As for plastic, the Texas-sized
trash gyres that swirl in the world's oceans are another reminder of
what a cosmology of disposability and synthetic chemistry has
wrought]{.underline}. [Plastic may lack the longevity of carbon dioxide
and irradiated earth, but for hundreds, maybe thousands of years it will
continue to circulate, wreaking havoc throughout the food
chain]{.underline}. We have post--World War II European development to
thank for single-serve plastic shampoo pouches and bottled water---the
latter needed only because nearby streams have been sold to Coca-Cola.
[Acknowledging the distinctively European history of our geological era
serves a **practical as well as a polemical end**]{.underline}. [[Any
democratic project must confront the geopolitics of the Eurocene]{.mark}
because it challenges the very paradigm of equality]{.underline}. "In
the Anthropocene," Purdy writes, "environmental justice might also mean
an equal role in shaping the future of the planet." In fact,
[[environmental justice will require]{.mark} unequal roles:
significantly constraining, even **[repressing, the powers of the
Eurocene]{.mark}**. On the eve of the creation of the United Nations at
the Dumbarton Oaks conference]{.underline}, W. E. B[. Du Bois saw the
failure of a dream before it had even been fully formed: the vast new
international body was little more than the institutionalization of the
global "color line]{.underline}." The great powers had insisted upon a
Security Council, and the General Assembly would be subordinated to its
nuclear authority. [Purdy's suggestion that the planet could be governed
equally ignores the vast systems of
injustice---[settler-colonialism]{.mark}, primitive accumulation, [and
violent power politics]{.mark}---that **[stand in the way]{.mark}**,
[upheld by great powers that use nuclear weapons to deter change
and]{.mark} **[deploy swarms of drones]{.mark} to hunt down those too
small for the nuclear option.**]{.underline} I would like to be part of
Purdy's ecological democracy, but he is wrong to say "There is no
political agent, community, or even movement on the scale of humanity's
world-making decisions." **[[We share a world governed by a few states
with the capability of ending all life on the planet.]{.mark} At the
international scale, [these states are essentially authoritarian; they
rule by economic violence and war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}**. [That some
of those states are not authoritarian at the domestic level is of little
consequence to the rest of the world.]{.underline} It should come as no
surprise that the leaders of the food sovereignty and anti--fossil fuel
movements Purdy describes belong to marginalized groups that see no
future in our current geopolitical order. Indigenous, black, and brown
people are at the vanguard of political struggle not because they are
more natural but because they have had front row seats in the making of
this crisis. The Eurocene is not perpetrated by all people of European
heritage, many of whom oppose the existing geopolitical order---myself
included. **[This distinction---between being European and being an
agent of the Eurocene---only intensifies the need to [rethink
democratization as demanding a politics of inequality]{.mark} rather
than a politics of incorporation]{.underline}**. Such a remaking of
justice is as complex and difficult as the climate crisis itself, and
just as worthy a struggle, irrespective of whether we can succeed[.
As]{.underline} Sylvia [Wynter has said, "we must now collectively
undertake a rewriting of knowledge as we know it. . . . because the West
did change the world, totally."]{.underline} **[To do so means exiting
the Anthropocene as an idea, and collectively---even if not
equally---exiting the Eurocene as a failed epoch]{.underline}**. As
Wynter says, [we need to consider other "genres of the
human."]{.underline} [Wynter explains she will not miss the Anthropos
because she, among so many others, was never considered human to begin
with. [To invent a new species is the task that must be]{.mark}
undertaken before there can be a "we," an "our," or a "cene" that is
more than a requiem for the end.]{.underline}

#### You should reject the aff's attempt at expanding cooperation. Such exchange further allows the dominant and violent behavior of the United States to further invade foreign spaces. This will to know, grid, understand, map, and calculate all of the various nations in the worlds perversely terminates in the most violent military atrocities, situating the US as the central documenting authority while the rest of the world can only ever figure as a target of bombing.

**[From Atomic Bombs to Area Studies]{.underline}**

As its name suggests, [**[area studies as a mode of knowledge production
is]{.mark}**, strictly speaking, **[military in its
origins]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Even though the study of the history,
languages, and literatures of]{.underline}, for instance, \"Far
[Eastern\" cultures existed]{.underline} well [before the Second World
War]{.underline} (in what Edward W. Said would term the old Orientalist
tradition predicated on philology) , [the **systematization of such
study** under the rubric of special geopolitical areas was largely a
postwar and U.S. phenomenon]{.underline}. In H. D. Harootunian\'s words,
\"[[The **systematic formation of area studies**]{.mark}, principally
[in **major universities**, was . . . a massive attempt to relocate the
enemy **in the new configuration of the Cold
War**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"47 As Bruce Cumings puts it: \"It is now
fair to say, based on the declassified evidence, that [the American
state and especially the intelligence elements in it shaped the entire
field of postwar area studies, with the clearest and most direct impact
on those regions of the world where communism was strongest: Russia,
Central and Eastern Europe, and East Asia]{.underline}.\"48 In the
decades after 1945, when the United States competed with the Soviet
Union for the power to rule and/or destroy the world, these regions were
the ones that required continued, specialized super- vision; to this
list we may also add Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.
As areas to be studied, these regions took on the significance of target
fields-fields of information retrieval and dissemination that were neces­
sary for the perpetuation of the United States\' political and
ideological hegemony.

In the final part of his classic Orientalism, Said describes area
studies as a continuation ofthe old European Orientalism with a
different pedagogi­ cal emphasis:

[No longer does [an Orientalist]{.mark} try first to master the esoteric
languages of the Orient; he [begins instead as a trained social
scientist and \"applies\"]{.mark} his [science to the Orient]{.mark}, or
anywhere else. This is the specifically American contribution to the
history of Orientalism, and it can be dated roughly from the period
immediately following World War II, when the United States found itself
in the position recently vacated by Britain and France]{.underline}.49

Whereas Said draws his examples mainly from Islamic and Middle Eastern
area studies, Cumings provides this portrait ofthe East Asian target
field:

The Association for Asian Studies (AAS) was the first \"area\"
organization in the U.S., founded in 1943 as the Far Eastern Association
and reorganized as the AAS in 1956. Before 1945 there had been little
attention to and not much funding for such things; but now the idea was
to bring contemporary social science theory to bear on the non-Western
world, rather than continue to pursue the classic themes of Oriental
studies, often examined through philology. . . . In return for their
sufferance, the Orientalists would get vastly enhanced academic
resources (positions, libraries, language studies)-and soon, a certain
degree of separation which came from the social scientists inhabiting
institutes of East Asian studies, whereas the Orientalists occu­ pied
departments of East Asian languages and cultures. This implicit Faus­
tian bargain sealed the postwar academic deal.50

A largely administrative enterprise, closely tied to policy, [[the new
American Orientalism took over from the old Orientalism attitudes of
cultural hostility]{.mark}, among which is]{.underline}, as Said writes,
[the dogma that \"[the Orient is]{.mark} at bottom something either to
be feared (the Yellow Peril, the Mongol hordes, the brown dominions) or
[to be **controlled** (by pacification, **research and
development**]{.mark}, outright occupation whenever
possible)]{.underline} .\"5 1

**[Often [under the]{.mark} modest and apparently innocuous [agendas of
fact gathering]{.mark} and documentation, [the]{.mark} \"scientific\"
and \"objective[\" production of knowledge]{.mark} during peacetime
about the various special \"areas\" [became the institutional practice
that substantiated]{.mark} and elaborated [the militaristic conception
of the world as target]{.mark}]{.underline}**.52 In other words,
[despite the claims about the apolitical and disinterested nature of the
pursuits of higher learning, [activities]{.mark} undertaken under **the
rubric of area studies**, [such as **language training**,]{.mark}
**historiography**[, **anthropology**]{.mark}, economics, political
science]{.underline}, and [so forth]{.underline}[, **[are fully
inscribed in the]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[politics and [ideology of
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To that extent, **[[the
disciplining]{.mark}, research, [and development of]{.mark} so-called
academic [information are part and parcel of a strategic
logic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And yet, **[if the production of
knowledge]{.underline}** (with its vocabulary of aims and goals,
research, data analysis, experimenta­ tion, and verification) in fact
[**shares the same scientific and military premises as
war**-if]{.underline}, for instance, [the ability to translate a
difficult language can be regarded as equivalent to the ability to break
military codes53]{.underline}-**[[is it a surprise that it is doomed to
fail]{.mark} in its avowed attempts to \"know\" the other
cultures?]{.underline}** [**[Can \"knowledge]{.mark}\" that is [derived
from]{.mark} the same kinds of bases** as [war **put an end to**]{.mark}
**the [violence]{.mark} of warfare**, or is such knowledge not **simply
warfare\'s accomplice**, destined to **destroy rather than preserve**
the forms of lives at which it aims its focus]{.underline}? [[As long as
**knowledge is produced in this**]{.mark} **self-referential
[manner]{.mark}**[, as **a circuit of targeting**]{.mark} or getting the
other [that ultimately **consolidates** ]{.mark}**the omnipotence and
[omnipresence]{.mark}** [of **the** ]{.mark}**sovereign \"self\" J
\"eye\"-the \"I\"-[that is the United States]{.mark}**[, the other will
have **no choice but remain** ]{.mark}**just that­ [a target whose
existence justifies]{.mark} only one thing, its [destruction]{.mark} by
the bomber**]{.underline}. As long as the focus of our study of Asia
remains the United States, and as long as this focus is not accompanied
by knowledge ofwhat is happening elsewhere at other times as well as at
the present, [[such study will ultimately confirm]{.mark} once again
[the]{.mark} **self-referential function of [virtual worlding]{.mark}**
[that was unleashed by]{.mark} the dropping of the atomic
[bombs,]{.mark} with the United States always **occupying the position
of the bomber**[, and **other cultures always**]{.mark} **viewed
[as]{.mark} the military and information [target
fields]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this manner, events whose historicity
does not fall into the epistemically closed orbit of the atomic
bomber-such as the Chinese reactions to the war from a primarily
anti-Japanese point ofview that I alluded to at the beginning of this
chapter-will never receive the attention that is due to them.
\"**[Knowledge,\" however conscientiously gathered]{.underline}** and
however large in volume, **[will lead only to further silence and to the
silencing of diverse experiences.]{.underline}** This is one reason why,
as Harootunian remarks, [[area studies has been,]{.mark} since its
inception, [haunted by \"]{.mark}the absence of a definable object\"
-and by **\"[the problem of the vanishing
object]{.mark}.\"**]{.underline}55

As Harootunian goes on to argue, for all its investment in the study of
other languages and other cultures, [[area studies **missed the
opportunity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, so aptly provided by Said\'s
criticism ofOrientalism, [[to become the site where a **genuinely
alternative form of knowledge** **production** might have been
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}\_ Although, as Harootunian writes, \"
Said\'s book represented an impor­ tant intellectual challenge to the
mission of area studies which, if accepted, would have reshaped area
studies and freed it from its own reliance on the Cold War and the
necessities of the national security state,\"56 [the challenge was **too
fundamentally disruptive** to the administrative and instrumentalist
agendas so firmly routinized in area studies to be accepted by its
practitioners]{.underline}. As a result, [Said\'s attempt to link an
incipient neocolonial discourse to the history of area studies was
almost immediately belittled, dismissed, and ignored, and his critique,
for all its relevance to area studies\' future orientation, simply
\"migrated to English studies to transform the study of literature into
a full-scale preoccupation with identity and its
construction]{.underline}.\"57

A long-term outcome of all this, Harootunian suggests, has been the
consolidation ofa type ofpostcolonial studies that, instead offully
develop­ ing the comparative, interdisciplinary, and multicultural
potential that is embedded theoretically in area studies, tends to
specialize in the decon­ struction ofthe nature oflanguage, in the
amalgamation ofpoststructural­ ist theory largely with Anglo-American
literary studies, and in the investiga­ tion mostly of former British
colonial cultures rather than a substantial range of colonial and
semicolonial histories from different parts of the world.58 On its part,
having voluntarily failed to heed Said\'s call, area studies can only
remain \"locked in its own enclaves ofknowledge\"59 based on the
reproduction of institutional and organizational structures with claims
to normativity, while being defensively guarded against the innovations
of poststructuralist theory that have radicalized North American
humanistic and social scientific learning since the 1970s.

As I have already suggested, **[the truth of the continual targeting of
the world as the fundamental form of knowledge production is
xenophobia]{.underline}**, [the inability to handle **the otherness of
the other**]{.underline} [beyond the orbit that is the bomber\'s own
visual path]{.underline}. For the xenophobe, [every effort needs to be
made to sustain and secure this orbit-that is, by keeping the place
ofthe other-as-target always filled]{.underline}. [With the end of the
cold war and the disappearance of the Soviet Union, [the United States
must hence **seek other substitutes for war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
has often been pointed out, **[[drugs, poverty, and illegal immigrants
have since become the new targets, which occupy­ together]{.mark} with
Moslems, Arabs, and communists (that is, Cuba, North Korea, and mainland
China)-[the status of that ultimate danger to be \"deterred\" at all
costs.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### The global domination of western metaphysics is not centrally a military project, but rather a project of knowledge production. Attempts to expand cooperation naturalize the *global presence of a militarized American way of thinking, seeing, and mastering the world.* These impotent gestures of imperial violence exemplify the logic of Hercules, pursuit of power, order and nation-building, and are intended to pave over the US' spectacular defeat in Vietnam. This violence makes imperative the intellectual task of retrieving the memory of Vietnam to oppose the War on Terror. It is the only way to undermine the metaphysical search and destroy mission of the Pax Metaphysica

and comparative literature at Binghamton University, American

[The other difference]{.underline}, as we have seen, [indissolubly
related to the first, is that, despite its infinitely more powerful
military might, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[lost the war to
the recalcitrant subaltern Other]{.mark}** it would have subdued and
accommodated to its Logos]{.underline}. And **[it lost it primarily
[because in this]{.mark} globalized [postcolonial
context]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and [by way of the disclosures re-
leased by the self-destruction of the end-oriented philosophical,
epistemo- logical, ecological, cultural, political, and military
mechanisms of Western imperialism]{.underline}---**[[America's
Other]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Greene foresaw and Caputo, O'Brien, and
many other veterans who have recalled their experience in writing have
testified, **[[refused to be answerable to the]{.mark} imperatives of
the polyvalent American [exceptionalist
narrative.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[The Vietnamese's response]{.mark}
rather [was]{.mark} to be **[rhizomatically
mobile]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[strategically
indeterminate]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in its goals, **[erratic in its
actions]{.mark}**, [indifferent to **temporal and spatial
boundaries**]{.mark}, resistant (in its attunement to the slow motion of
being) to the dictates of technological speed, and not least,
**[invisible to America's]{.mark} techno-[Ahabian
gaze]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} all [**calculated to decompose**]{.mark} the
relay of [American power]{.mark} extending back [from its
forward-oriented military machine]{.mark} through its progressivist
capitalist cultural apparatus, [to **the instrumentalist**
]{.mark}**(Franklinian "can-do") [thinking]{.mark}** []{.mark}that was
**envisioning, planning, and [conducting]{.mark}** [the war]{.mark} from
the remote distance of the Pentagon.]{.underline}

This double difference---an American war the ruthless, single-minded and
banalized conduct of which disclosed the violence hidden in the benign
American exceptionalist errand, on the one hand, and, by way of this
banalized single-mindedness, enabled its Other to fracture its
formidable war machine and reduce its power to impotence, on the
other---constitutes the proleptic witness of Graham Greene's novel,
written in the immediate aftermath of the Geneva Accords, about
America's initial arrogant---and blind---intervention in Vietnam.
Despite their efforts to personalize and then assimilate this war to
war-in-general, this double difference, as I have shown, is also the
symptomatic testimony of Philip Caputo's representa- tive memoir, A
Rumor of War, and Tim O'Brien's autobiographical novel, Going After
Cacciato, whose mis-en-scènes span the period between 1965, when
President Lyndon Johnson, justified by the fabricated Tonkin Bay
incident, sent the first official combat troops to fight in the "Indian
country" of Vietnam, and the Tet Offensive in 1968, which was the be-
ginning of the end of the United States' bloody imperial involvement in
that Southeast Asian country. [This resonant witness to the visible
contradiction between [America's]{.mark} deeply backgrounded
[ontological justification of]{.mark} the [Vietnam War]{.mark} and its
single-minded, indeed, **monomaniacal Ahabian practice** [has **haunted
the** ]{.mark}**collective [American consciousness]{.mark}** since the
fall of Saigon in 1975. [This specter]{.mark} also [explains the]{.mark}
dominant culture's **[obsessive effort]{.mark} since then [to forget
Vietnam]{.mark}**[---an **amnesiac** ]{.mark}**monumentalizing
[process]{.mark}** []{.mark}only apparently **[culminating in
the]{.mark} first [Gulf War]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a **triumphant
["end-of-history" discourse]{.mark}**---and its studied avoidance of
reference to the Vietnam War in justifying to the American people and
the world at large its ferocious retaliatory attack first on Afghanistan
and then, using the language of "shock and awe," which resonates with
the ferocity of Captain Ahab's "fiery pursuit" of the white whale, on
Iraq]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} double difference [is]{.mark}]{.underline}, I am
suggesting, also [[why it is **imperative** that **intellectuals, public
and academic**, who **oppose** the]{.mark} United States'
[]{.mark}representation and conduct of **the ["war on terror"]{.mark}**
**[retrieve the forgotten memory of]{.mark} the [Vietnam]{.mark}
War**]{.underline} as Greene's, Caputo's, and O'Brien's representative
texts articulate its singularity. For, as I have shown, [[their
**spectral witness**]{.mark} to **the terror of the "search-and-destroy"
mentality** inhering in **the myth of American exceptionalism**, despite
the sustained effort to obliterate it from history,
**[continues]{.mark}**, in the [after]{.mark}math of [9/11, to
**haunt**]{.mark} **the present [America]{.mark}n
government['s]{.mark}**---and the American media's---reductive
**personification of the complex global conditions** that Western
imperialism and more recently America itself have largely produced **in
the name of its [exceptionalist mission in the world's
wilderness]{.mark}**[, in the **demonized** ]{.mark}**symbolic [figures
of]{.mark} Osama [bin Laden and]{.mark} Saddam [Hussein]{.mark}**, its
**most recent Moby Dicks**]{.underline}. [The Vietnam War's spectral
witness to a mighty America's humiliating defeat at the hands of an
Other]{.underline}---[its other that refused to answer to the
accommodational impera- tives of its exceptionalist story in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}---[has now]{.underline}, **[as the initial seemingly
successful invasion of [Iraq has turned]{.mark} unexpectedly [into
a]{.mark} destabilizing and [volatile
occupation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} **[one [resembling]{.mark}
the [Vietnam "]{.mark}quagmire]{.underline}**," **[returned again to
haunt America]{.underline}**. **[As revenant, the singular history of
the [Vietnam]{.mark} War [exposes America's]{.mark} metaphysical,
epistemological, cultural, military, and political [initiatives for what
they are in a]{.mark} diverse and amorphous [part of the world whose
people have]{.mark} for centuries [suffered the]{.mark} terrible
[consequences of being]{.mark} the second [essentialized]{.mark} term
[in the Occident's binary logic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It
is]{.underline} thus [as likely as it was for **the Vietnamese "enemy"**
that the **decidedly undecidable "enemy"** it is encountering there will
turn the United States' inordinate power against itself]{.underline}.

To put all this in another way, **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
"[succeeded" in its preemptive military mission to defeat the
Taliban]{.mark} in Afghanistan [and Saddam Hussein]{.mark}'s army in
Iraq]{.underline}**. It has captured and hanged Saddam Hussein and may
eventually capture and bring Osama bin Laden to trial (even, against the
judicial tradition of democracy, to be tried by a military court). But
[granted these "accomplishments," President George W. Bush and his
neoconserative intellectual deputies are no more likely to annul or even
assuage the outrage that the United States has increasingly ignited both
among its former European allies and the various Islamic peoples of the
world at large by their concentering of [the]{.mark} cultural, social,
and polit- ical global morass their [exceptionalist ethos]{.mark} has
**[produced]{.mark} than [Captain Ahab's
"monomania]{.mark}"---**]{.underline}was able to **[annul the
self-defensive outrage of the ineffable "white" whale]{.underline}**.
**[This is becoming [increasingly evident in the]{.mark} failure of this
second Bush administration's monolithic [effort to recreate]{.mark} the
[Afghanistani and Iraqi nation-states in]{.mark} its own [(liberal
capitalist) image (as the administrations]{.mark} of John F. Kennedy,
Lyndon Baines Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon [failed to recreate]{.mark}
a [Vietnam]{.mark}ese []{.mark}nation-state in its own image [in
the]{.mark} 19[60s]{.mark} and 19[70s]{.mark})]{.underline}**. [It
is]{.underline} also [becoming increasingly evident in the diverse Iraqi
peoples' spontaneous cultural and military re- sistance to the American
occupation of their lands, a resistance that, omi- nously like that of
the Vietnamese, **refuses to be answerable to the United States'
exceptionalist/Orientalist narrative and to the forwarding warfare that
is endemic to it.**]{.underline}

What I am suggesting by way of invoking the witness of the literature I
have examined in this book about [the ultimate consequences of America's
predictably Ahabian response to the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon should become unequivocally manifest by reconstellating
both these moments of American history into the "hidden history of the
revolutionary Atlantic]{.underline}" (the period extending from the ori-
gins of the Atlantic slave trade to the revolutionary years) brilliantly
re- trieved by Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker from the oblivion to
which it has been relegated by the "Herculean" monumentalist historians
of this earlier epochal moment of the march of Western civilization:

[The classically educated architects of the Atlantic economy found in
**[Hercules]{.mark}**]{.underline} . . . **[a symbol of [power]{.mark}
and order]{.underline}**. [For inspiration they looked to the Greeks,
for whom Hercules was a unifier of the centralized territorial state,
and [to the Romans]{.mark}, for whom he [signified]{.mark} vast
[imperial ambition]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[The labors of
Hercules symbolized [economic
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**[:]{.mark} **[clearing of
land]{.underline}**, [the draining of swamps]{.underline}, and [the
development of agriculture]{.underline}, as well as [the domestication
of livestock]{.underline}, **[the establishment of
commerce]{.underline}**, and **[the introduction of
[technology]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[The [rulers
placed]{.mark} the image of [Hercules on money and seals,]{.mark} in
pictures, sculptures, and palaces, and [on arches of
triumph]{.mark}]{.underline}**. . . . John [Adams]{.underline}, for his
part, [proposed in 1776 that "The Judgment of Hercules" be the seal for
the new United States of America]{.underline}. . . .

[**These same rulers found [in the]{.mark} many-headed [hydra an
antithetical symbol of disorder and resistance]{.mark}**, a powerful
threat to the building of state, empire, and capitalism]{.underline}.
[The second labor of Hercules was the destruction of the venomous hydra
of Lerna. . . .]{.underline}

[From the beginning of English colonial expansion in the early
seventeenth century through the metropolitan industrialization of the
early nineteenth, **rulers referred to the Hercules-hydra myth to
describe the difficulty of imposing order on increasingly global systems
of labor**]{.underline}. [They variously designated dispossessed
commoners, transported felons, indentured servants, religious radicals,
pirates, urban laborers, soldiers, sailors, and African slaves as the
numerous ever-changing heads of the monster]{.underline}. But [the
heads, though originally brought into productive combina- tion by their
Herculean rulers, soon developed among themselves new forms of
cooperation against those rulers, from mutinies and strikes to riots and
insurrections and revolution]{.underline}.18

[As]{.underline} Philip Caputo, Tim O'Brien, and [**virtually [every
American soldier]{.mark}** [who fought in Vietnam]{.mark} reiteratively
[testify, the insurgents]{.mark} of the National Liberation Front [in
Vietnam, like the]{.mark} **many-headed [hydra]{.mark} of European
antiquity** (and of the revolutionary Atlantic economy), [were
**constantly defeated by the "Herculean" American military
juggernaut**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, but]{.mark} [they [nevertheless kept
rising up in unpredictable places]{.mark} and times [to]{.mark}
eventually [bring their would-be monster-slayer to a dead
end]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Giv[en the incommensurability of
America's predictable invocation of the (mythical) logic of
exceptionalism and the postcolonial globalized condition, there is
little reason to believe that the hatred precipitated by the United
States' perennial unilateral "defense" of its "interests" in the Islamic
world]{.underline}---**[a defense expedited by its reduction of the
diversity of this world to an abstract and predictable religioracist
frontier stereotype, the "clash of civilizations"]{.underline}**---
[will not also manifest itself as a "many-headed hydra" that will
resurface in unexpected places at unexpected times to constantly
molecularize--- and neutralize the power of America---its narrative, its
self-present will, and **its relentlessly forwarding military
machine.**]{.underline}

#### The alternative is to advocate political resistance and emancipation that are inherent in the spectral political being, an anti-metaphysical project that enables guerilla warfare against empire capable of unsettling the totality of global control \-\-- this is the first directive towards rethinking thinking 

**Spanos '2K** \[William, Professor of English and Comparative
Literature at Binghamtom, *America's Shadow*, 2000, p. 194-202\]

It is this radical contradiction that the American Cultural Memory\'s
remembrance of the war has obsessively tried to forget. As I have shown,
[[this]{.mark} inordinate [amnesiac will to obliterate]{.mark} the
disclosures of [Vietnam has been the hidden ideological agenda]{.mark}
not simply of the]{.underline} [American media\'s representation of the
war in its long aftermath, but of the intellectual deputies of the
dominant post-Cold War]{.underline} [culture]{.underline}, who have been
compelled by their recuperative exceptionalist \"Hegelian\"
metanarrative to negate --- or sublate --- the history of the Vietnam
War in order to celebrate the advent of the end of history and the Pax
Americana. What needs to be remarked about this victorious post-Cold War
discourse is that in affirming its universal truth, its spokespersons
are compelled to speak something different. What matters to them is not
the historically specific event of the Vietnam War, but the globally
triumphant idea of liberal capitalist democracy. Is it an accident that
they insistently speak of the post-Cold War occasion in this way? What
about this \"not Vietnam\"?

[[This is the first directive toward **rethinking thinking**]{.mark} in
the interregnum. An oppositional discourse that would be adequate to the
task]{.underline} of resisting the Pax Americana must first think [this
sublated negation of the contradiction positively]{.underline}. This is
not to say that the disclosure of this directive to think the nonbeing
of --- that belongs to --- the imperial discourse of instrumentalism is
restricted to the event of the Vietnam War.

[It is]{.underline}, [as Heidegger\'s earlier call to rethink the
nothing that modern science \"wishes to know nothing
about]{.underline}\"5 suggests, [the unthought directive precipitated by
the devastations at the sites of language, the earth, and its peoples
incumbent on the \"planetary imperialism]{.underline} [of
technologically organized man]{.underline}.\"6 [In a formulation of this
resonant disclosure that implicates \"Americanism\" with the advent of
the]{.underline} \"[age of the world picture]{.underline},\" [Heidegger
writes: As soon as the gigantic in planning and calculating and
adjusting and making secure]{.underline} \[one of the most revealing
symptomatic manifestations of which is the annihilation of space and
time by means of the electronic revolution\] [shifts over out of the
quantitative and becomes a special quality, then what is
gigantic]{.underline}, and what can seemingly always be calculated
completely, becomes, precisely through this, incalculable. This
[[**becoming incalculable** remains the **invisible shadow** that is
cast around **things everywhere** when man has been transformed into
subjectum and the **world into picture**]{.underline}.7]{.mark}

But, I am suggesting, [it was the decisiveness of the Vietnam War\'s
disclosure of this ontological contradiction]{.underline} --- **[[the
shadow]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [that has [**rendered** the retrieval
of **Heidegger\'s call to rethink**]{.mark} the not that [haunts]{.mark}
the discourse and practice of [\"**Americanism**\"]{.mark} **an urgent**
**imperative** of the post-Vietnam occasion.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[this]{.mark} is the pervasive]{.underline}, if only
symptomatic, [testimony of the early poststructuralist
theory]{.underline} --- enabled in large part by Heidegger\'s
interrogation of modernity, particularly, his retrieval of the
\"nonbeing\" of being --- [that in some fundamental sense [had
its]{.mark}]{.underline} [[origins in]{.mark} the self-destruction of
the truth discourse of the Enlightenment]{.underline} during the Vietnam
War [or, more precisely, in [the **failure of the global protest
movements**]{.mark} **it catalyzed**]{.underline} (most notably in
France, in Germany, in Czechoslovakia, and in Mexico) **[[to
effect]{.mark} essential and [lasting transformations]{.mark} in their
respective polities]{.underline}**. I am referring, above all, to the
various critiques of Western logocentrism that precipitated an acute and
pervasive consciousness of the marginal --- the radical Other --- [that
is either accommodated to or banished from the totalizing circle
articulated by the concentering imperial logos of Western
metaphysics.]{.underline} [Taking its point of departure from the
language of the countermemory established by Nietzsche]{.underline}, a
certain [Freud]{.underline}, [and Heidegger]{.underline} (\"Dionysus,\"
\"the returned repressed,\" the \"nothing\"), [these critiques gave this
ubiquitous Other of the logocentric Same various]{.underline}
[names]{.underline}: \"[the other that remains other]{.underline}\"
(Emmanuel Levinas), \"the [negative]{.underline}\" (Theodor Adorno),
\"the [differance]{.underline}\" (Jacques Derrida), \"the aporia\" (Paul
de Man), \"the [differend]{.underline}\" (Jean-Francois Lyotard), \"the
invisible of the visible\" (Louis Althusser), \"the
[deviant]{.underline}\" (Michel Foucault), \"the catachrestic
[remainder]{.underline}\" (Gayatri Spivak), \"the
[rhizomatic]{.underline},\" \"the \"[deterritorialized]{.underline},\"
or \"the [nomadic]{.underline}\" (Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari),
\"the [hybrid]{.underline},\" \"the Third Space,\" or \"the minus in the
one\" (Homi Bhabha), and so on. But [what these]{.underline} [various
names for the radically marginal have in common is not simply that they
testify to the global scope of the imperial]{.underline} [logocentrism
of modernity, but that they point to \"**something\" incalculable that
the imperial instrumentalist thought of American**]{.underline}
modernity cannot \"comprehend\" [and thus contain]{.underline}, indeed,
to [the shadow, as it were, that belongs to its
dedifferentiating]{.underline} [--- colonizing --- light.]{.underline}
As the metaphorics that everywhere in this early postmodern theory
accompanies these names, they testify to the specter --- that which, to
the metaphysical eye, is not --- that menaces the triumphalist thinking
of American modernity.

[It is]{.underline}, further[, this symptomatic awareness of the
spectrality of the \"not\" that belongs to but cannot be seen or said by
the \"triumphant\"]{.underline} [thought of the age of the world picture
that renders this early postmetaphysical thinker an \"ontological
exile\" from the solar \"at-homeland.\"]{.underline} Aware of the global
colonization of originative thinkin by the total technologization of
\"enlightening\" thought, this thinker becomes, in Heidegger\'s resonant
term, der Abgescbiedene, \"the one apart\":8 he is the \"ghostly\"
(geistlich) stranger (\"LP,\" 177)9 who wanders \"at the fringe of the
technically-economically oriented world of modern mass existence\"
(\"LP,\" 196) listening to the silence (the unsayable) its saying has
precipitated as self-destructive contradiction.

Indeed, in thus reverting knowingly to precisely the condition of the
\"undomiciliated\" or \"wandering\" or \"nomadic\" Other that enabled
and justified the \"civilizing/colonizing\" truth discourse of the
Occident, this [ontological nomad in \"the realm of the
Between\"]{.underline} (Abgeschiedenheit: \"apartness\") [becomes the
invisible \"ghost\" who, in his/her refusal to be answerable to the
saying of the homeland,]{.underline} [silently haunts its imperial
authority.]{.underline} In Derrida\'s \"Marxian\" version of this
\"nonbeing\" that activates anxiety (that which has no-thing as its
object) in the homeland, he/she becomes the \"revenant\" --- [the
interred \"specter\" who returns to \"visit\" the
\"visitor]{.underline}.\"™

[[It is]{.mark},]{.underline} as I have suggested, [[**this ontological
\"specter\"** that]{.mark} the \"**more worldly\" oriented [critical
discourses]{.mark}** that have superseded early]{.underline}
[poststructuralist theory [are blinded to by]{.mark} their finally
[\"**reformist\"** ]{.mark}**cultural [politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
And [it is [this]{.mark} oversight that [renders their]{.mark}
**political [marginality not exilic enough]{.mark} to be adequate to the
conditions of the global post-Cold War occasion**.]{.underline}

In interpreting Heidegger\'s antimetaphysical discourse and that of the
poststructuralism it catalyzed in terms of the spectrality that produces
anxiety in the dominant culture, I do not want to suggest that they,
unlike the oppositional discourses that have interred them as
counterproductive or obsolete, are, as such, viable agents of resisting
the neoimperialism of the Pax Americana. [Though this body of
antimetaphysical thought]{.underline} (I realize that this way of
putting it is reductive of specific differences) [foregrounds the
specter that menaces the truth discourse of Western modernity, it does
not, with the exception of Heidegger and perhaps the late
Derrida,]{.underline} [adequately **perceive that [the
imperative]{.mark} of the disclosure of the specter [is the rethinking
of thinking itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That is to say, its witness
to the **specter**]{.underline}, [as the metaphorical way in which the
spectral is articulated suggests, remains symptomatic and
thus]{.underline} inadequately thought. More importantly, [just as the
dominant oppositional discourses]{.underline} --- [whether those of
neo-Marxism]{.underline}, the New Historicism, [feminism, cultural
critique, black criticism, or postcolonial criticism]{.underline} ---
[discount or tend to slide over the ontological question provoked by the
annunciation of the end of history in their **[overdetermination
of]{.mark} [the political]{.mark} site**]{.underline}, [this
poststructural discourse]{.underline}, with the exception of the late
Derrida, [discounts or tends to slide over the political question
provoked by the annunciation]{.underline} of the Pax Americana. More
accurately, [it [fails to]{.mark} **perceive** and thus to
**[think]{.mark} the indissoluble affiliation between [the question
of]{.mark} being**]{.underline} and the question of the polls, theory,
and praxis.

[If]{.underline}, however, [we forcibly dislocate the
pervasive]{.underline}, if symptomatic, [disclosure]{.underline} [of the
specter out of the ontological matrix where it has been embedded in the
discourse of poststructuralism and reconstellate it into the specific
political history]{.underline} of the 1960s --- particularly, the
military strategy of the Vietnamese insurgents --- [its meaning
undergoes a **productive estrangement**. [The genocidal violence
perpetrated]{.mark} by the United States [against the Vietnamese]{.mark}
people and their land [in the name of the \"free world]{.mark}\" not
only [exposed the European origins]{.mark} of [the myth of American
exceptionalism]{.mark}. It also exposed the metaphysical principle of
decidability informing this grand imperial narrative]{.underline}. And
it was in some sense the recognition of this arrogant American
intolerance of undecidability that the Vietnamese Other exploited to
abort the goals of the cultural and political armies of a much more
powerful United States[. That strategy, it will be recalled, which has
been aptly called \"\'guerrilla warfare\" in the annals of Western
military history, refused to accommodate itself]{.underline}---to be
\"answerable\" [--- to the European concept of warfare]{.underline}:
[**the binary \"frontal engagement\"** of opposing visible]{.underline}
[armies whose story would **end in a \"decisive
victory.\"**]{.underline} Instead, these Vietnamese insurgents resorted
to a \"barbarian\" strategy. [[They resisted invasion of their Asian
homeland]{.mark} not by direct confrontation, but [by an **invisible
nomadic mobility**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a
\"[**[spectral]{.underline}**\" **[tactics]{.underline}**]{.mark}, as it
were --- [[that reversed the **see**-**er**/**seen binary of Western
imperialism and** ]{.mark}**in so doing demolecuralized the more
formidable invading army and [reduced its]{.mark} otherwise invincible
[war machine to]{.mark} utter [ineffectiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This disclosure of the Achilles\' heel of the Western imperial project
constitutes the second directive of the Vietnam War for the task
of]{.underline} rethinking thinking in the American age of the world
picture, more specifically, [for the articulation of a theory of
resistance against the Pax Metaphysica that is simultaneously a practice
of political resistance against the Pax Americana]{.underline}. In
reconstellating the Vietnamese strategy into the postcolonial context,
we not only discover the hitherto overlooked connection between the
spectral ontological Other precipitated by the fulfillment of the
logical economy of Western metaphysics in the \"Americanization\" of the
planet and the multitude of displaced political Others --- the
\"nonexistent\" beings --- precipitated by the fulfillment (the coming
to its \"end\") of the project of Western imperialism at large. [In
recognizing the indissoluble relationship between these two hitherto
disparate Others, we are also compelled to appropriate the \"eccentric\"
Vietnamese strategy of \"unanswerability\" that defeated America as a
directive for thinking the positive emancipatory possibilities of the
postcolonial occasion]{.underline}, that is, of the vast and various
population of people unhomed by the depredations of Western imperialism.

[This effort to theorize an \"eccentric\" adversarial political strategy
of unanswerability from the global demographic shifts incumbent on the
fulfillment of the imperial project has]{.underline}, is fact, [already
been inaugurated by]{.underline} Edward Said at the close of Culture and
Imperialism, if only in a tentative way. Symptomatically, if not fully,
conscious of the implications of the interregnum for thinking, Said,
like Salman Rushdie in his fiction, takes his point of departure in this
theoretical initiative from his exilic experience as emigre --- as an
irreversibly \"unhoused\" Other whose difference is indissolubly related
to, indeed, was produced by, the colonizing (at-homing) imperatives of
Occidental imperialism. In so doing, he invokes a theoretical motif that
was fundamental to but inadequately thought by the early postmodernists
(Heidegger, Derrida, Lyotard, for example) who overdetermined the
decentering of the Occidental logos, a motif that Said finds thought in
some degree by Paul Virilio (L\'lnsecurite du territoire), Gilles
Deleuze and Felix Guattari (Thousand Plateaus), and Theodor Adorno
(Minima Moralia), among others. I am referring to the possibilities not
only for refuge but for [[political resistance]{.mark} and emancipation
that, according to Said, [are]{.mark} paradoxically [inherent in the
unhomed]{.mark}, estranging, and dereifying mobility]{.underline} ---
[the]{.underline} [**[spectral political being]{.underline}**]{.mark},
as it were --- [of the displaced persons, [the migrants,]{.mark} and the
historyless Others of the imperial Occident [who]{.mark}, in the
postcolonial era[, exist \"between domains,]{.mark} between
[forms,]{.mark} between [homes, and]{.mark} between
[languages.]{.mark}\" These are the possibilities of e-mergence
precipitated on a global scale by the thinning out or occasional
breaking of the]{.underline} [lines of force that, by way of cultural
familiarization, domestication]{.underline}, [and pacification, have
historically bound the periphery to the metropoli]{.underline}tan
center/homeland. I have quoted a passage from Said\'s all-too-brief
summation of his oppositional postcolonial project in chapter 2, but the
resonant suggestiveness precipitated by the reconstellation of the
estranged political perspective he overdetermines into the ontological
context I have inferred from the decentering and disarticulating
guerrilla strategy of the nomadic Vietnamese insurgents warrants its
retrieval at this culminating point of my argument:

It is no exaggeration to say that [liberation as an intellectual
mission]{.underline}, [born in the resistance and opposition to the
confinements and ravages of imperialism, has now shifted from the
settled, established]{.underline}, [and domesticated dynamics of culture
to its unhoused, decentered, and [exilic energies]{.mark}, energies
whose [incarnation today is the
**migrant**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and whose consciousness is
that of [the **intellectual and artist in exile**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[the political figure between domains]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
**[between forms, between homes, and between languages]{.underline}**.
From this perspective then all things are indeed counter, original,
spare, strange.

From this perspective also, one can see \"the common consort dancing
together\" contrapuntally. And while it would be the rankest Panglossian
dishonesty to say that the bravura performances of the intellectual
exile and the miseries of the displaced person or refugee are the same,
[it is possible]{.underline}, I think, to [regard the intellectual as
first distilling then articulating the predicaments that disfigure
modernit]{.underline}y --- [mass deportation, imprisonment,
population]{.underline} [transfer, collective dispossession, and forced
immigration]{.underline}.

Having thematized the estrangement latent in the exilic condition of the
emigre --- the uncanny ability to see what from the point of view of the
imperial discourse of the dominant culture is otherwise invisible ---
Said goes on to invoke the exemplary migrant discourse of the exiled
German intellectual Theodor Adorno: \" \'The past life of emigres is, as
we know, annulled,\' says Adorno in Minima Moralia, subtitled
Reflections from a Damaged Life\.... Why? \'Because anything that is not
reified, cannot be counted and measured, ceases to exist\' or, as he
says later, is consigned to mere \'background.\'\" In the
Heideggerian/Derridian rhetoric I have emphasized in my effort to think
the implications of ontological imperialism, the emigre becomes the
spectral Abgeschiedene in the \"realm of the Between\" who haunts the
Being of the imperial culture that has reduced him/her to nonbeing. Said
rightly acknowledges \"the disabling aspects of this fate.\" But it does
not blind him, as it does so many \"progressive\" postmodern or
postcolonial thinkers, to \"the virtues or possibilities\" of this
spectral marginalization. They are --- and here Said announces the
post-postmodern and -postcolonial project of the inter regnum ---
\"worth exploring.\" \"Adorno\'s general pattern,\" he writes, \"is what
in another place he calls the \'administered world\' or, insofar as the
irresistible dominants in the culture are concerned, \'the consciousness
industry.\' There is then not just the negative advantage of refuge in
the emigre\'s eccentricity; there is also the positive benefit of
challenging the system, describing it in a language unavailable to those
it has already subdued.\"

Admittedly, the possibilities for this \"freedom from exchange\" ---
this \"last refuge\" from the globalization of late capitalism --- that
Said proffers as an alternative to the existing oppositional discourses
are, like Adorno\'s, the minima moralia of a damaged political life,
and, in its emphasis on survival, his alternative lacks the force of a
truly positive hope. But if, as the resonant doubleness of the language
I have italicized amply warrants, the terms of his global elaboration of
these postcolonial possibilities are reconstellated into the occasion of
the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism in
the 1960s, one need not, at least on this count, be quite as pessimistic
as Adorno and Said about the role of the intellectual in the global
post-Cold War period I have called the interregnum, without at the same
time succumbing to \"the rankest Panglossian dishonesty.\" For, to
reiterate, it [was precisely the Vietnamese\'s exploitation of the very
ontological conditions of their enforced confinement by a formidable
imperial culture that]{.underline} [estranged that colonized space
and]{.underline}, in so doing, **[disintegrated both the cultural
narrative and the decisive end-oriented imperial practice this narrative
was designed to enable]{.underline}**. [The powerless Vietnamese
masterfully transformed the United States\'s arrogant and clamorous
strategy to reduce the unaccountable and immeasurable Other to
nonexistent status or, to invoke]{.underline} Adorno\'s language, [to
consign its spectral Otherness to \"mere background\" in its
metanarrative]{.underline} --- which is to say, to silent invisibility
before the panoptic imperial gaze --- into a powerful polyvalent
de-structive and e-mancipatory (projective) weapon. And [it was [this
transformation]{.mark} of the debilitating, that is, passivizing and
silencing, effects of reification that [enabled this \"]{.mark}damaged\"
Third World [country]{.mark} --- precisely by way of its spectral
invisibility --- [to **disable** ]{.mark}**the otherwise irrefragable
operations of [reification]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} thus to **[defeat the
most powerful nation in the]{.mark} history of the
[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12

[To think the spectral as the menacing precipitate of the indissoluble
relationship between the Pax Metaphysica and the Pax
Americana]{.underline}: [this, not the \"reformist\" initiative of those
liberals]{.underline} like Sacvan Bercovitch and Richard Rorty [whose
oppositional discourse continues to be answerable to the imperial
language informed by the idea of America, is the resonantly silent
imperative of the]{.underline} [interregnum]{.underline}, especially for
American intellectuals of the Left.13 [This appeal to contemporary
American intellectuals to think the nomadic political emigre who haunts
the post-Cold War New World Order simultaneously with the ontological
specter that postmetaphysical European theorists14]{.underline} [have
thematized as the paradoxical consequence of the fulfillment of the
logical economy of Western philosophy is an appeal to **think America
globally**]{.underline}. And it [no doubt will be criticized by those
nation-oriented American intellectuals to whom it is addressed as
\"traveling theory,\"]{.underline} the importation of a foreign
interpretive discourse into a historically specifically American
context.15

### 2NC Overview -- Spanos

#### The Western will to knowledge structures the logic of our institutions ranging from the military to academia \-\-- the American pathology that imagines each individual as an empowered agent capable of proscribing grand solutions to all violence is not a universal human feeling, but rather a violent hubris that requires actively attacking at every opportunity. 

#### In fact, maintaining the global world order causes structural violence on a far greater scale than the aff can possibly resolve \-\-- unabashed Western supremacy left unchecked in our mindsets causes violent exploitation of the global periphery

War time

For many, particularly [in the United States, 9/11 was **a moment when
the world turned**]{.underline}; [for others]{.underline}, particularly
[outside the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [it was a
climactic summation of a longer history of **American imperialism** in
general and its **meddling in the Middle East in
particular**]{.underline}. Either way, it is not surprising that [many
commentators]{.underline} should have [emphasised the **temporality** of
the **military violence** that followed in the wake of the terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on that bright
September morning]{.underline}: **[[the 'war on terror' that became 'the
long war']{.underline}]{.mark}**. For the RETORT collective, [the
[invasions]{.mark} of Afghanistan and Iraq [marked]{.mark} 'the
[elevation]{.mark} -- [into **a state of permanent war**]{.mark} -- of a
long and consistent pattern of **military expansionism** in the service
of empire']{.underline} (RETORT 2005, 80). Keen (2006) wrote of
**['endless war']{.underline}**, Duffield (2007) of **['unending
war']{.underline}** and Filkins (2008) of **['the forever
war']{.underline}**. The sense of permanence endures, and yet Engelhardt
(2010, 2--3) ruefully notes that [it remains difficult for Americans to
understand 'that **Washington is a war capital**, that **[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is a war state]{.mark}**, that [it
**garrisons much of the planet**]{.mark}, and that the **norm** for us
is to **be at war somewhere at any moment'**]{.underline}. Bacevich
(2010, 225) [traces this state of affairs to what he calls the
'Washington rules' that long pre-date 9/11]{.underline}. [These are 'the
conviction that the obligations of leadership require the United States
to maintain a global military presence, configure its armed forces for
power projection, and employ them to impose changes abroad',
which]{.underline} he argues [have formed 'the **enduring leitmotif of
US national security policy'** for the last 60 years and '[propelled the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [into **a condition approximating
perpetual**]{.mark} **war'**]{.underline}.

**[Each of these temporal formulations implies spatial
formations]{.underline}**. For RETORT (2005, 103) **['military
neoliberalism' is 'the true globalization of our time']{.underline}**.
[The planetary garrison that projects US military power is divided into
six geographically defined unified combatant commands -- like US Central
Command, CENTCOM -- whose Areas of Responsibility cover every region on
earth and which operate through a global network of bases]{.underline}.
If you think this unremark- able, ask yourself Bacevich's question:
**[[how would the United States react if China were]{.mark} [to mirror
these moves]{.mark}?]{.underline}** [Think, too, of the **zones** in
which **the shadow of US military** violence still falls: not just
**Afghanistan and Iraq**, but also **[Iran]{.mark}**,
**[Libya]{.mark}**, **[Pakistan]{.mark}**, **[Somalia]{.mark}**,
**[Yemen]{.mark}**. Then [think of the **zones** where the
rhetoric]{.mark} of the 'war on terror' has been used by other states to
legitimise repression: **[Chechnya]{.mark}**, **[Libya]{.mark}**,
**[Palestine]{.mark}**, [the **Philippines**, **Sri
Lanka**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [then think of the [cities]{.mark}
that [have become]{.mark} [**displacements** of **the space of
war**]{.mark}, punctuation points in]{.underline} what Sassen (2010, 37)
[calls **'[a new kind of multi-sited war']{.mark}**]{.underline}:
[**Casablanca**, **Lahore**, **London**, **Madrid**, **Moscow**,
**Mumbai**]{.underline}. [All these lists are **incomplete**, but even
in this truncated form they suggest the **need to analyse** not only
'the forever war' but also what we might call **'[the everywhere
war']{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This is at once a conceptual and a material project whose scope can be
indexed by three geographs that trace a movement from the abstract to
the concrete: Foucault's (1975--6) prescient suggestion that [[**war**
has become the **pervasive matrix** within which **social life is
constituted**]{.mark}; the **[replacement of]{.mark} the concept of [the
battlefield]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **US [military doctrine]{.mark}** [by
the **multi-scalar**]{.mark}, **multi-dimensional
'[battlespace']{.mark}** with '**no front or back'** and [where]{.mark}
'[**everything becomes a site of permanent war**']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Graham 2009, 389; 2010, 31); and [the **assault on the global
borderlands** where the United States and its allies now conduct their
military operations]{.underline}. The first two are never far from the
surface of this essay, but it is the third that is my primary focus.

Borderlands and blurred boundaries

[Duffield]{.underline} (2001, 309) [once described the borderlands as
'[an **imagined geographical space** where]{.mark}, in the eyes of
metropolitan actors and agencies, the characteristics of
**[brutality]{.mark}**, **[excess]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **breakdown
predominate'**]{.underline}. There, [[in the **'wild zones' of the
global South**, wars]{.mark} are supposed to [occur 'through]{.mark}
**greed and [sectarian gain]{.mark}**, [**social fabric is destroyed**
and]{.mark} **developmental gains reversed**, **non-combatants killed**,
**humanitarian assistance abused** and **all [civility
abandoned']{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This **imaginative geography**
folds]{.mark} in and [out of the rhetorical distinction between **'our'
wars** --]{.mark} wars conducted by **advanced militaries** that are
supposed to be **surgical**, **sensitive** and **scrupulous** -- [and
**'their' wars**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In reality]{.underline},
however, [the [boundaries are **blurred** and **each bleeds into
its**]{.mark} **[other]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Gregory 2010). Thus the
US-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 combined a long-
distance, high-altitude war from the air with a ground war spearheaded
by the warlords and militias of the Northern Alliance operating with US
infantry and Special Forces; counterinsurgency in Afghanistan and Iraq
has involved the co-option of ragtag militias to supplement US military
operations; and in Afghani- stan the US Army pays off warlords and
ultimately perhaps even the Taliban to ensure that its overland supply
chain is protected from attack (Report of the Majority Staff 2010).

[[In mapping]{.mark} these borderlands -- which are also
**[shadowlands]{.mark}**, [spaces that enter]{.mark} European and
[American imaginaries in **phantasmatic form**]{.mark}, **[barely known
but vividly imagined]{.mark}** -- **[we jibe against the limits
of]{.mark} cartographic and so of [geopolitical
reason]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From Rat- zel's view of der Krieg als
Schule des Raumes to Lacoste's stinging denunciation -- 'la géographie,
ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre' -- [[the **deadly liaison**]{.mark}
[between **modern war** and **modern geography** has been conducted in
**resolutely territorial terms**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be sure, the
genealogy of territory has multiple valences, and Ratzel's Raum is not
Lacoste's espace, but [a critical analysis of the everywhere war
requires cartographic reason to be **supplemented** by other, **more
abile spatialities**]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} not only [a
matter of **transcending the geopolitical**, connecting it to the
**biopolitical** and the **geo-economic**, but also of **tracking space
as a 'doing'**, **precarious**, **partially open** and **never
complete**]{.underline}. It is in something of this spirit that
[Bauman]{.underline} (2002, 83) [identifies the '**[planetary
frontierlands']{.mark}** as staging grounds of today's wars, [where
efforts to]{.mark} ['**pin the divisions** and **mutual enmities** to
the ground **seldom bring results'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the course
of 'inter- minable frontierland warfare', so he argues, '[trenches are
seldom dug', adversaries are 'constantly on the move' and have become
for all intents and purposes 'extraterritorial']{.underline}. I am not
sure about the last (Bauman is evidently thinking of al Qaeda, which is
scarcely the summation of late modern war), but this is an arresting if
impressionistic canvas and the fluidity con- veyed by Bauman's broad
brush-strokes needs to be fleshed out. [After the US-led invasion of
Iraq it was commonplace to distinguish the **Green Zone** and its
satellites (the US political-military bastion in Baghdad and its
penumbra of Forward Operating Bases) from the **'red zone'** that was
everywhere else. But this categorical division is **misleading**. The
colours **seeped into and swirled around one another**, so that occupied
Iraq became not so much a patchwork of green zones and red zones as a
**thoroughly militarised landscape** saturated in **varying intensities
of brown** (khaki): 'intensities' because [within **this warscape
military** and]{.mark} [**paramilitary violence** could **descend at any
moment**]{.mark} without warning, and [within it **precarious local
orders** were **constantly forming**]{.mark} **[and
re-forming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I think this is what Anderson (2011)
means when he describes insurgencies oscillating 'between extended
periods of absence as a function of their dispersion' and 'moments of
disruptive, punctual presence', but [these variable intensities entrain
all sides in today's 'wars amongst the people' -- and most of all those
caught in the middle.]{.underline}

### AT: Perm / 2NC Link Wall

#### Our Spanos ev says that the perm fails as long as it retains the trappings of ontological thought in favor of neutral dialogue etc: "even those who would oppose American global hegemony are, insofar as they remain indifferent to the ontological grounds of its sociopolitical practices, condemned to think their opposition according to the imperatives of the discursive practices they would oppose."

#### The permutation's reformist impulse rehabilitates American image, fomenting neoliberal violence and continued military violence across the global periphery \-\-- they are nothing more than failed Vietnam protests 

**Spanos '2K** \[William, Professor of English and Comparative
Literature at Binghamtom, *America's Shadow*, 2000, p. 184-\]

Undertaken in the name of the \"promise\" of \"America,\" [these
[reforms were intended to reestablish the ontological]{.mark}, cultural,
and political [authority of the]{.mark} enlightened, [American]{.mark}
\"vital [center]{.mark}\" and its]{.underline} circumference and thus
[to recontain the dark force of the insurgent differential]{.underline}
constituencies that had emerged at the margins in the wake of the
disclosures of the Vietnam War. At the domestic site, these included the
coalescence of capital (the Republican Party) and the religious and
political Right into a powerful dominant neoconservative culture (a new
\"Holy Alliance,\" as it were) committed to an indissolubly linked
militantly racist, antifeminist, antigay, and anti-working-class agenda;
the dominant liberal humanist culture\'s massive indictment of
deconstructive and destructive theory as complicitous with fascist
totalitarianism; the nationwide legislative assault on the post-Vietnam
public university by way of programs of economic retrenchment affiliated
with the representation of its multicultural initiative as a political
correctness of the Left;30 the increasing subsumption of the various
agencies of cultural production and dissemination (most significantly,
the electronic information highways) under fewer and fewer parent,
mostly American, corporations; the dismantling of the welfare program;
and, symptomatically, the rehabilitation of the criminal president,
Richard Nixon. At the international site, [[this \"reformist\"
initiative has manifested itself as the rehabilitation of the American
errand in the world]{.mark}, a rehabilitation [exemplified by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates\'s [virtually uncontested]{.mark}
moral[/]{.mark}military [interventions in Panama, Somalia, Haiti,
Bosnia, the Middle East, and Kosovo]{.mark}]{.underline}; [its
interference in the political processes of Russia]{.underline} by way of
providing massive economic support for Boris Yeltsin\'s
democratic/capitalist agenda against the communist opposition; its
unilateral assumption of the lead in demanding economic/political
reforms in Southeast Asian countries following the collapse of their
economies in 1998; [its internationalization of the \"free market\";
and, not least, its globalization of the instrumentalist version of the
English language.]{.underline}

What needs to be foregrounded is that [[these]{.mark} global post-Cold
War \"[reformist\" initiatives are not]{.mark} **discontinuous
practices, a matter of [historical]{.mark}
[accident]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Largely enabled by the \"forgetting\"
of Vietnam --- and of the repression or accommodation or self-immolation
of the emergent decentered modes of thinking the Vietnam War
precipitated ---]{.underline} they are, rather, indissolubly, however
unevenly, related. Indeed, [[they are the]{.mark} multisituated
**[practical]{.mark} [consequences of the planetary triumph]{.mark}**
(the]{.underline} \"end\") [of the logical economy [of the **imperial
ontological discourse** that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has its origins in
the]{.mark} [founding of the **idea of the Occident**]{.mark} and its
fulfilled end in the banal instrumental]{.underline}/[technological
reasoning in the discourse of \"America]{.underline}.\" In thus totally
colonizing thinking, that is, [this [imperial \"Americanism\" has come
to determine]{.mark} the [comportment toward being]{.mark} of human
beings]{.underline}, [in all their individual and collective
differences, [at large]{.mark}]{.underline} --- even of those
postcolonials who would resist its imperial order. [This state of
thinking]{.underline}, which has come to be called the New World Order
(though to render its rise to ascendancy visible requires
reconstellating the Vietnam War into this history), [subsumes the
representative,]{.underline} but by no means complete, [list of
post-Cold War practices to]{.underline} which I have referred above.
[And it is synecdochically represented by the massive mediatization of
the amnesiac end-of-history discourse and the affiliated polyvalent
rhetoric of the Pax Americana]{.underline}.

#### Sequencing DA -- only confronting issues of sovereignty allows us to break free of the circular political practices that entrench militarism -- their reformism guarantees reification of the system.

[Such a political program has far reaching consequences, both for
Western sovereignty, and the way that the business of politics is
conducted. [The]{.mark} living population of the [earth]{.mark} has
[inherited a vision of sovereign power, which]{.mark} has
[spread]{.mark} cancerously [into even the most]{.mark} seemingly
[inaccessible aspects of]{.mark} everyday [life]{.mark}. This vision
commands all, claims legitimacy for all, and determines the conduct of
living for all within its domain. [Politics]{.mark} 'as we know it' [is
caught inextricably in the web of sovereign power, in such a way that it
seems that modern political debate cannot help but circulate around the
same, routine issues: \"What is the appropriate legislative response?\";
\"Is it within the State's powers to intervene in this particular
conflict?\"]{.mark}]{.underline}; \"How can we ensure the citizen's
rights are maintained in the face of the state?\". [[To
challenge]{.mark} such [an encompassing and peremptory]{.mark} political
[discourse]{.mark} --- [where every question implies the sovereign
absolutely, and every decision made refers to life itself]{.mark} ---
[would require]{.mark} the most intensive [rethinking]{.mark} of the way
in which territory, governance and economy are imagined.]{.underline} In
this sense, whilst Agamben's analysis of bare life, and Foucault's
theory of bio-power, provide a means by which to assess the condition of
non-human life with respect to sovereign power, [[the political
project]{.mark} must reach beyond these terms, and embrace an
intertwining of the human and the non-human: an
intersection]{.underline} which may be found in the animal life [shared
by both entities]{.underline}.

#### No perm, the alt isn't a commitment to political praxis which means you can't combine it with plan action, it's an act of critique which removes the possibility of plan action from consideration and focuses on the [processes of constructing]{.underline} the 1ac speech act---situating plan action within that process shuts down critical potential---complete rejection is key

**Neocleous 8** \[Mark Neocleous, Prof. of Government @ Brunel,
*Critique of Security*, 185-6\]

[[The only way]{.underline} [out]{.underline}]{.mark} of such a dilemma,
[to escape the **fetish**, [is]{.mark} perhaps [to **eschew**]{.mark}
**the logic of [security altogether]{.mark}** -- to reject it as so
ideologically loaded]{.underline} in favour of the state [that any real
political thought]{.underline} other than the authoritarian and
reactionary [should be pressed to give it up]{.underline}. That is
clearly something that can not be achieved within the limits of
bourgeois thought and thus could never even begin to be imagined by the
security intellectual. It is also something that the constant iteration
of the refrain 'this is an insecure world' and reiteration of one fear,
anxiety and insecurity after another will also make it hard to do. But
[it is something that the critique of security suggests we may have to
consider if we want a political way out of]{.underline} the impasse of
[security]{.underline}. This impasse exists because
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark} has now become so all-encom passing that
it [**[marginalises all else]{.mark}**, most
[notably]{.mark}]{.underline} the constructive conﬂicts,
[**[debates]{.mark} and discussions [that animate political
life]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The con stant [prioritising]{.underline} of
a mythical [security as a political end -- as the political end --
**constitutes a rejection of politics**]{.underline} in any meaningful
sense of the term. That is, as a mode of action in which differences can
be articulated, in which the conﬂicts and struggles that arise from such
differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which [[people might
come to believe that another world is possible]{.mark} -- that they
might transform the world and in turn be transformed.]{.underline}
[[Security politics]{.mark} simply removes this; worse, it [removes it
while purportedly addressing it]{.mark}]{.underline}. In so doing it
suppresses all issues of power and turns political questions into
debates about the most efﬁcient way to achieve 'security', despite the
fact that we are never quite told -- never could be told -- what might
count as having achieved it. [Security politics is,]{.underline} in this
sense, an [anti-politics,141 dominating political discourse in much the
same manner as the security state tries to dominate human beings,
reinforcing security fetishism]{.underline} and the monopolistic
character of security on the political imagination. [[We]{.mark}
therefore **[need to get beyond security]{.mark} politics,** **[not
add]{.mark} yet [more 'sectors']{.mark} to it**]{.underline} in a way
that simply expands the scope of the state and legitimises state
intervention in yet more and more areas of our lives. Simon Dalby
reports a personal communication with Michael Williams, co-editor of the
important text Critical Security Studies, in which the latter asks: if
you take away security, what do you put in the hole that's left behind?
But I'm inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe there is no hole.142 [The
mistake has been to think that there is a hole and that this hole needs
to be ﬁlled with a new vision or **[revision of security]{.mark}** in
which it is **re-mapped or civilised** or gendered or humanised or
expanded]{.underline} or whatever. All of [**these ultimately [remain
within the statist political imaginary,]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} consequently end up [**[re afﬁrm]{.mark}**ing
**[the state as the terrain of modern politics]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the grounds of security. [[The]{.mark} real [task is not to ﬁll
the]{.mark} supposed [hole with yet another vision of security, but to
ﬁght for an **alternative political language**]{.mark} which takes us
beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and which therefore does
not constantly throw us into the arms of the state. That's the point of
critical politics: to develop a new political language]{.underline} more
adequate to the kind of society we want. Thus while much of what I have
said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of
critical theory is that the negative may be as signiﬁcant as the
positive in setting thought on new paths. For if security really is the
supreme concept of bourgeois society and the fundamental thematic of
liberalism, then to keep harping on about insecurity and
[[to]{.mark}]{.underline} keep [[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}ing['[more
security']{.mark}]{.underline} (while meekly hoping that this increased
security doesn't damage our liberty) [[is to **blind ourselves
to**]{.mark} **the possibility of [building real alternatives]{.mark} to
the authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics**. To situate
ourselves against security politics would allow us to circumvent the
debilitating effect achieved through the constant securitising of social
and political issues]{.underline}, debilitating in the sense that
'security' helps consolidate the power of the existing forms of social
domination and justiﬁes the short-circuiting of even the most democratic
forms. [It would also allow us to **forge another kind of politics**
centred on a different con ception of the good]{.underline}. We need a
new way of thinking and talking about social being and politics that
moves us beyond security. [This would perhaps be emancipatory in the
true sense of the word. What this might mean]{.underline}, precisely,
[must be open to debate. But it certainly requires recognising that
security is an illusion that has forgotten it is an
illusion]{.underline}; it requires recognising that security is not the
same as solidarity; it requires accepting that insecurity is part of the
human condition, and thus giving up the search for the certainty of
security and instead learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities
and 'insecurities' that come with being human; it requires accepting
that '[securitizing' an issue does not mean dealing with it politically,
but bracketing it out and handing it to the state; it requires us to be
brave enough to return the gift]{.underline}.143

As its binarism suggests, [the foundational privileging of Identity over
difference in metaphysical thinking means operationally that it enables
the inquirer to read the temporal process as a system of evanescent or
always changing signatures, fragments, enigmas, shadows, phantasms, and
so on]{.underline}. [It enables him/her to address the differential
dynamics of time as a spectral subaltern surface (an adulterated or
\"fallen,\" and thus worthless, but always threatening Other) that
obscures --- or]{.underline}, rather, **[reveals as in a glass
darkly]{.underline}** --- [a prior **informing luminous presence** (an
abiding or **universal** or **permanent** **meaning**) that **a willed
penetration will reveal**]{.underline}. [Plato]{.underline}, for
example, in the Phaedrus, [called the partial temporal body into which
the soul had fallen a \"polluted\...walking sepulchre\" that only the
recollection (anamnesis) of a prior \"pure\" and \"whole\" state vaguely
shadowed in this corrupt and partial body could redeem]{.underline}.12
[However that \"otherly\" surface is represented, whether as shadow (as
in Plato) or as signature (as in St. Augustine and the Church Fathers)
or as negation (as in Hegel) or as fragment (as in modern empirical
science), [the **metaphysical mode of inquiry** assumes]{.mark} that
**the difference the inquirer encounters** is not an **irresolvable
contradiction or contingency**]{.underline}, **[but [a problem that can
and must be solved in the name of the truth]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[It
assumes the Other to be **a mere appearance**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [a
**recalcitrant agency of concealment and instability** that must **yield
what it conceals** to the **stabilizing truth of Identity**, of the One,
of the End, of **Presence**]{.underline}. In short, [metaphysical
inquiry represents that which is Other than its truth not simply as a
negative term (specter or spirit), but]{.underline}, as such, **[as that
which corroborates its Identity]{.underline}** (Spirit) **[and endows
its Truth with power]{.underline}**. Thus **[[perceiving meta-ta-physika
produces and validates the essential logic of the ontotheological
tradition]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark}, of
course, [[the hierarchized binary logic that **enables the first,
\"major\" term**]{.mark} --- the term representing a self-present and
plenary object --- **to [demonize the second]{.mark}**[, \"**minor**\"
or \"**subaltern**,\" term]{.mark}: the term representing an entity that
is not present to itself]{.underline}. **[[This binary
logic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in other words, **[[empowers the
privileged term to represent the Other as nonbeing (spectral), as some
kind of arbitrary threat to Being]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [the benign
total order to which the first term is committed --- and thus [to
**subdue and appropriate this Other to the latter\'s essential
truth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is in this sense that one can say that
**[[Western metaphysical thinking is essentially a
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By this, I [do not simply mean, as
does much postcolonial discourse that acknowledges in some degree the
polyvalency of the imperial project, a metaphor ap- propriated to the
thought of being (or of any site on the continuum of being other than
the economic or political) from another \"more practi- cal and
fundamental\" --- \"real\" --- domain of reference]{.underline}.13
**[[In identifying Western metaphysical thought with colonialism, I am
positing a literal and precise definition of the process of metaphysical
inquiry]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The binary logic endemic to the very idea of the West had its
origins]{.underline}, according to Heidegger, in late antiquity [with
the Romans\' colonization of Greek (the vestiges of pre-Socratic)
thinking, with]{.underline}, that is, **[their reduction of the
originative thinking of]{.underline}** the latter to a derivative
(constructed) understanding of truth. More specifically, the provenance
of this logic lies in the imperial Romans\' politically strategic
translation of a-letheia to veritas, truth as always already
un-concealment to truth as adaequatio intellectus et rei, the
correspondence of mind and thing.14 This epochal reduction of an
originative to a re-presentational mode of thinking --- a thinking that
places the force of being before one as a thing to be looked at --- was
calculatively determined by a relatively conceptualized understanding of
the operations of metaphysical perception. In decisively establishing
the binary opposition between the true and the false as the ground of
thinking, this reduction also decisively established the ground for the
eventual assimilation of an infinite relay of different but analogous
oppositions into the totalized epistemic binary logic of the Western
tradition. Under the aegis of the doctrine of the adaequatio, [it was
not only the binary opposition between Truth and falsehood that
empowered the correction or appropriation or reformation or disciplining
or accommodation or civilizing]{.underline}, which is to say, **[[the
colonization, of the \"errant\" or]{.mark} \"deformed\" or \"wasteful\"
or \"excessive\" or \"immature\" (uncultivated) or \"barbarous\" [or
\"feminine\" force named in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the second,
**[[demonized term]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As [the very metaphors used
to characterize the \"false\" suggest]{.underline}, [that opposition was
simply one]{.underline} --- no doubt **[the most
fundamental]{.underline}** --- [of a whole series of binary oppositions
inhering]{.underline}, however asymmetrically developed, [in
History]{.underline}, in, that is, th**[e founding Occidental
representation of temporal being-as-a-whole by way of perceiving \"it\"
meta-ta-physika]{.underline}**: [Being and time, Identity and
difference, the Word and words, Being and nonbeing, Subject and object,
Sanity and madness, Culture and anarchy, Civilization and barbarism[,
Man and woman]{.mark}, the White race and the colored races, [the West
and the east, the North and the south, and so on]{.mark}]{.underline}.
What this emphatically suggests is that **[[an oppositional criticism
that would be adequate to the task of resisting imperialism must cease
to think the imperial project in the disciplinary terms]{.mark} endemic
to and [mandated by the]{.mark} Occident\'s [compartmentalization of
being and knowledge.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Ernesto '[[Che']{.underline}]{.mark} Guevara [[argued]{.mark} that '[the
guerrilla fighter]{.mark}, who is general of himself, [need not die in
every battle', but]{.mark} he **[must]{.mark} always [be 'ready to
give]{.mark} his [life']{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For Guevara, what
supplies the 'positive quality of this guerrilla warfare is precisely
that **[each]{.mark} one of the [guerrilla fighter]{.mark}s [is ready to
die]{.mark}**, not to defend an ideal, but rather to convert it into
reality']{.underline}.[17](#17_For_Guevara__willingness_to_die_is_definitive_o___)
Indeed, as the embodiment of this positive principle in the
establishment of revolutionary focos, he advocates the forming of a
'suicide-platoon' of volunteers who can strike at the most dangerous
locations: 'Entrance to this platoon should be regarded as almost a
prize for merit'. **[[Guevara was careful to
distinguish]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[the [willingness to die
from]{.mark} the [will to die]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Unnecessary
self-exposure]{.mark} to 'defeat or annihilation' [is]{.mark} **simply
the marker of [bad strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Death and
destruction carry **no integral charge**]{.underline}. **[[Death is
revolutionary only as a code of practice]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
[suffering 'formidable privations' up to the point of death is essential
to the pedagogy of the
revolutionary.]{.underline}[18](#18_Ibid___pp__34__82_) Guevara's
contemporary Regis Debray was no less explicit; for the focoist, death
is a principle of
conduct.[19](#19_R__Debray__Revolution_in_the_Revolution__Armed____) [To
be a **revolutionary** is to **risk all**, and through such a
commitment, to be able to **turn any failure into a springboard** to
later success]{.underline}.[20](#20_Ibid___p__24_) '[To conquer is to
accept as a matter of principle that life, for the revolutionary, is not
the supreme
good'.]{.underline}[[21]{.underline}](#21_Indeed__to_risk_all_means_that__having_risen_in___)
**[[Only commitment unto death can prevent the taming of the revolution
under reformism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A pragmatics of revolutionary
suicide was similarly central for Mao]{.underline} Tse-Tung. Mao shared
with Bakunin and Nechayev the view that [violent action must spark a
revolutionary
moment]{.underline}.[22](#22_Mao_saw__China__a_s_littered_all_over_with_dry____)
Unlike Nechayev, however, [he distinguished between worthy and unworthy
suicides]{.underline}.[23](#23_Ibid___p__173_) [He recognised death is a
common occurrence whenever there is revolutionary struggle. An
indomitable spirit, **[willing to 'fight the enemy to the last drop of
our blood' is always
critical]{.mark}.**]{.underline}[24](#24_M__Tse_tung__The_Red_Guard_s_Handbook__trans__S___)
But [the revolutionary must avoid unnecessary sacrifices]{.underline}.
Mao stated in a classical excerpt that the meaning of weight of death
varies widely in accordance with the place of our self-expenditure: 'it
may be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a

[Not all deaths are equal]{.underline}.

Newton references both Guevara and Mao as grounds for his thesis,
arguing that [revolutionaries are often **simply not prepared to accept
the morbid actualities** of **revolutionary practice** identified by
both]{.underline}.[26](#26_Newton_1974__p__50_) [The [Black Panthers
would not 'romanticise]{.mark} the consequences of revolution in our
life time']{.underline}. [There is]{.underline}, Newton argues, [little
chance of participating in a revolution and then dying of old
age]{.underline}, and [he claimed to have no expectation of seeing the
revolution fulfilled in his lifetime, **only that 'the revolution will
grow in my life time**]{.underline} ... [I do not expect to enjoy its
fruits']{.underline}.[27](#27_Ibid___p__6_) **[[You
cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he implies, **[[be a revolutionary and
expect to
survive]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[28](#28_Newton_argues_that__a_revolutionary_death_is_th___)
[This fact had been borne out]{.underline}, he argued, [in every example
of resistance -- from the American colonists to the French of the late
eighteenth century, the Russians]{.underline} of 1917, [[the Jews of
Warsaw]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[Cubans]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
National Liberation Front and [the [North
Vietnamese]{.mark}]{.underline}: '**[any people who struggle against a
brutal and powerful force -- are
suicidal']{.underline}**.[29](#29_Newton_1974__p__7_) Newton's prison
experience confirmed this insight to him: His constant defiance resulted
in Newton receiving far worse treatment than his peers. Indeed, he
claims that his actions were such that the guards thought he was
suicidal. They assumed he would crack under the disciplinary pressure,
but instead, he became ever stronger: 'If I had submitted to their
exploitation and done their will, it would have killed my spirit and
condemned me to a living death. To cooperate in prison meant a
reactionary suicide to me'.[30](#30_Ibid_)

As such, [only because his actions carried the risk of death and mental
destruction could they be a means of propagandising to and radicalising
the other inmates and thus promoting the revolution against passive or
reactionary suicide]{.underline}. In this sense, for Newton,

**[[the concept of revolutionary suicide was not]{.mark} defeatist or
[fatalistic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On the contrary, it conveyed an
awareness of reality in combination with the possibility of hope --
reality because the revolutionary must always be prepared to face death,
and hope because it symbolises a resolute determination to bring about
change ... above all, it demands that the revolutionary sees his death
and his life as one piece.[31](#31_Ibid_)

[N[ewton's text imputes eschatological
connotations]{.underline}]{.mark}[, because of [a 'greater, more
immediate danger ... **the survival of the entire
world'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Newton argues that '[If the world does
not change, all its people will be threatened]{.underline} ... **[The
handwriting is on the wall']{.underline}**. [Only by adopting **a
strategy of revolutionary suicide**, can the Black Panthers 'establish
... the means for creative work']{.underline}.[32](#32_Ibid___p__6_)
[**[Only with suicide can they challenge the suicide machine of the
racist
Urstaat]{.underline}**.]{.mark}[33](#33_Ibid___p__7___Is_the_government_of_the_United_S___)

[There can be little surprise that [the Panthers were]{.mark} to be
[deemed]{.mark} such a [fundamental threat to the US]{.mark} state
formation]{.underline}. A startling claim is explicitly being developed
by Newton. He suggests that **[revolutionary politics is a game which
makes self-murder the currency of every decision]{.underline}**. In
doing so, [it presents an active death against a reactive
death]{.underline}, [with no dialectical resolution on offer in this
meeting]{.underline}. **[Newton posited an antiracist and antisovereign
politics that emerges in making pass words out of the morbid order words
of sovereignty]{.underline}**; **[the deterritorialisation of the death
that an inherently racist power decrees]{.underline}**. [Such a
deterritorialised and deterritorialising death simply has no relation to
the autonomic suicides implicated in Western notions of sovereign
individuality]{.underline}. **[It is [revolutionary because it explodes
the self in the declaration of its finitudes]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Far from suicide being posited as the ideologeme of pure identity, it
is claimed here to embody the passing of every
sovereign]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

We live, now, at a genuinely peculiar historical juncture. The credit
crisis has provided us with a vivid illustration of the principle set
out in the last chapter: that capitalism cannot really operate in a
world where people believe it will be around forever. [[For]{.mark} most
of the last several [centuries]{.mark}, [most people assumed]{.mark}
that [credit could not be generated infinitely]{.mark} because they
assumed that the economic system itself was unlikely to endure
forever]{.underline}. The future was likely to be fundamentally
different. [[Yet]{.mark} somehow, the anticipated [revolutions never
happened]{.mark}]{.underline}. The basic structures of financial
capitalism largely remained in place. [[It's only now]{.mark}, at the
very moment [when it's]{.mark} becoming increasingly [clear that
**current arrangements are not viable**]{.mark}, [that **we suddenly
have hit the wall in terms of our collective
imagination**]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is very good reason to believe
that, **[[in a generation]{.mark} or so, [capitalism]{.mark} itself
[will no longer exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[most obviously[, as
ecologists keep reminding]{.mark} [us, because it's impossible to
maintain an engine of perpetual growth forever on a finite
planet]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [current]{.mark} form of [capitalism
doesn't seem]{.mark} to be [capable of]{.mark} generating the kind of
vast [technological breakthroughs]{.mark} and mobilizations that would
be required for us to start finding and colonizing any other planets.
[Yet]{.mark} faced with the prospect of capitalism actually ending, [the
most common reaction]{.mark}]{.underline}---even from those who call
themselves "progressives"---[[is]{.mark} simply [fear]{.mark}. We cling
to what exists because **we can no longer imagine an alternative that
wouldn't be even worse**.]{.underline} How did we get here? My own
suspicion is that [we are looking at the final effects of the
militarization of American capitalism itself]{.underline}. In fact, it
could well be said that [the last thirty years have seen [the
construction of a **vast**]{.mark} **bureaucratic [apparatus for the
creation]{.mark} and maintenance [of hopelessness]{.mark}**[, **a giant
machine designed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, first and foremost, **[[to
destroy any sense of possible alternative
futures]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [At its root is a veritable obsession on
the part of the rulers of the world]{.underline}---in response to the
upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s---[with ensuring that social movements
cannot be seen to grow, flourish, or propose alternatives; that those
who challenge existing power arrangements can never, under any
circumstances, be perceived to win]{.underline}.35 [To do so requires
creating a vast apparatus of armies, prisons, police, various forms of
private security firms and police and military intelligence apparatus,
and [propaganda engines of every conceivable variety]{.mark}, **most of
which [do not attack alternatives directly so much as create a pervasive
climate of fear, jingoistic conformity, and simple despair that renders
any thought of changing the world seem an idle
fantasy]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Maintaining this apparatus seems even
more important, to exponents of the "free market," even than maintaining
any sort of viable market economy. How else can one explain what
happened in the former Soviet Union? One would ordinarily have imagined
that the end of the Cold War would have led to the dismantling of the
army and the KGB and rebuilding the factories, but in fact what happened
was precisely the other way around. This is just an extreme example of
what has been happening everywhere. Economically, the apparatus is pure
dead weight; all the guns, surveillance cameras, and propaganda engines
are extraordinarily expensive and really produce nothing, and no doubt
it's yet another element dragging the entire capitalist system
down---along with producing the illusion of an endless capitalist future
that laid the groundwork for the endless bubbles to begin with. Finance
capital became the buying and selling of chunks of that future, and
economic freedom, for most of us, was reduced to the right to buy a
small piece of one's own permanent subordination. In other words, [there
seems to have been a profound contradiction between the political
imperative of establishing capitalism as the only possible way to manage
anything, and capitalism's own unacknowledged need to limit its future
horizons lest speculation, predictably, go haywi]{.underline}re. Once it
did, and the whole machine imploded, we were left in the strange
situation of not being able to even imagine any other way that things
might be arranged. About the only thing we can imagine is catastrophe.
[**[To begin to free ourselves, the first thing we need to do is to see
ourselves again as historical actors]{.underline}**,]{.mark} as
**[people who can make a difference in the course of world
events]{.underline}**. This is exactly what the militarization of
history is trying to take away. Even if we are at the beginning of the
turn of a very long historical cycle, it's still largely up to us to
determine how it's going to turn out. For instance: the last time we
shifted from a bullion economy to one of virtual credit money, at the
end of the Axial Age and the beginning of the Middle Ages, the immediate
shift was experienced largely as a series of great catastrophes. Will it
be the same this time around? Presumably a lot depends on how
consciously we set out to ensure that it won't be. Will a return to
virtual money lead to a move away from empires and vast standing armies,
and to the creation of larger structures limiting the depredations of
creditors? There is good reason to believe that all these things will
happen---and if humanity is to survive, they will probably have to---but
we have no idea how long it will take, or what, if it does, it would
really look like. [Capitalism has transformed the world in many ways
that are clearly irreversible]{.underline}. What I have been trying to
do in this book is not so much to propose a vision of what, precisely,
the next age will be like, but to throw open perspectives, enlarge our
sense of possibilities; to begin to **[[ask what it would mean to start
thinking on a breadth and with a grandeur appropriate to the
times]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Butler]{.underline}, and others, [in an effort to rethink the work
performed by theory in a posttheory moment]{.underline}. It's not
accidental that [some of his most recent engagements have focused on
**the potentialities of the Occupy movement, the Arab Spring**, and the
legacies of the writings of Said and Hannah Arendt]{.underline}.18
**[Foregrounding the importance of [refusing
consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [his late work seeks to
[**make\[s\] visible** the **ontopolitical ruptures in the logic of
Western influence**]{.mark} and transnational capitalism]{.underline},
to which Said's and Arendt's thought is vital. While much of this work
is highly controversial for a number of reasons, Spanos has remained
engaged in contemporary debates not merely to be "trendy" but to
continue the dialogic process he has engaged in his entire scholarly
life.

[His [work]{.mark} **indirectly [aligns]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **many
[contemporary projects]{.mark}** far outside of literary
studies]{.underline}, [[including **"seed democracy"**]{.mark}
**efforts** by activists such as Vandana Shiva]{.underline};
[**[antiglobalization]{.mark} activism** as diverse as the varieties
practiced by Arundhati Roy, **[Occupy protesters, and
WikiLeaks]{.mark}**]{.underline}; **[transnational [feminist and queer
theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., Rosi [Braidotti]{.underline},
Jack [Halberstam]{.underline}) [and **[disability
theorists]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Rosemarie
[Garland-Thomson]{.underline}). **[Pedagogy is]{.underline}**,
obviously, [not limited to the space of university classrooms but also
takes place on blogs and Twitter, in rallies, and through documentary
films]{.underline}. [These theorists and activists may not cite Spanos's
work directly]{.underline}, but **[they are potential partners in the
contestatory dialogue his work initiates]{.underline}**, [preserving a
focus on human being in the world in its encounter with the violence of
Western (particularly US) sociopolitical powe]{.underline}r. Also
important is the global reach of Bill's work, thanks to his
international students' translations into Mandarin, Greek, Italian,
Spanish, and Turkish.

Perhaps **[[the strangest legacy of Spanos']{.mark}s
[]{.mark}work]{.underline}** today **[[is its use by]{.mark} high school
and [college debate teams]{.mark} across the United
States]{.underline}**. [These groups focus primarily but not exclusively
on]{.underline} his book [America's Shadow]{.underline}: An Anatomy of
Empire [to [produce]{.mark} what has become known as **"[the Spanos
kritik."]{.mark}**]{.underline} [In September 2011]{.underline}, one of
those students, [Christopher Spurlock, interviewed Spanos via e-mail,
following several more-informal conversa- tions with him]{.underline}.19
[The response to Spanos in the debate world is exten- sive and, perhaps
unsurprisingly, frequently polarizing and unsympathetic]{.underline}.
Reading these forums, however, [[it's clear]{.mark} that [many students
have taken **a great deal of time to contemplate** the implications of
his]{.mark} thought for their world, not only in terms of **debate
"format" and "style"** but also [in wrestling with the concepts
of]{.mark} **"disinterestedness," [framing]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in
Heidegger's sense of [[**the "world-picture"** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
Althusser's sense of **[[the "problematic"]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [and
**identity**]{.underline}. They've read many of his books and carefully
explicate his thinking to their peers, often with strikingly perceptive
nuance. **[Whatever these students do with such ideas, the fact that
[they have engaged with]{.mark}]{.underline}** what Robert P. Marzec
(another former student of Bill's) has called **[[an "ontological
archive of the current world order"]{.mark} seems
significant]{.underline}**---all the more so when this takes place in
high schools, which are increasingly dominated by standardized tests and
homogenization for a "common core."20

[[For]{.mark} many of us **within the university**, **[debates over
general education]{.mark}** and the Common Core now being widely adopted
in secondary education [reflect **the** ]{.mark}**most [direct legacy of
Spanos]{.mark}'s teaching.**]{.underline} **[The task of
pedagogy]{.underline}** in his view **[is]{.underline}**, above all
(following Heidegger), "**[[to rethink thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}**":
**[to [reconnect pedagogy with the ontological]{.mark} in order
[to]{.mark} adequately [critique the university's sociopolitical]{.mark}
and sociocultural [discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thus **[[keeping
active the questions posed by the temporality of
"difference]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [It doesn't seem accidental that
**[the gen]{.mark}eral [ed]{.mark}ucation [debate has
resurfaced]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} America after every global cataclysm
since World War I . . . including today's **post--Iraq War moment of
[the]{.mark} US ["war" on terror.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The end sought by]{.mark} the Roman studium humanitatis in
**reducing** the Greek paideia---the instigation of **[originative
thinking]{.mark}**---to eruditio et institutio in bonas artes
(**scholarship and training in good conduct**) [was the **cultivation of
a disciplined**]{.mark}**, loyal, and predictable [citizenry]{.mark}**
(Homo humanus) [to]{.mark} **secure the stability** of the metropolis
and **[extend]{.mark} its [hegemony]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} Homo
barbarus and **["barbarian" lands]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However more
benign the hegemonic rhetoric of "freedom" and "defense" makes the
\[Harvard\] Redbook's project seem, this too, as that of the Columbia
survey course in contemporary civilization after World War I, is finally
the end of general education enabled, if not exactly envisioned, by its
liberal humanist authors. (EE, 127)

Again, [general education is at the heart of institutional
debate]{.underline}; again, **[[we are in the midst of a "crisis in the
humanities]{.underline}]{.mark}**." As print culture, par- ticularly
literature, shrinks, [the stakes of general education become even higher
for English departments and other humanistic fields. Science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields), prioritized
by]{.underline} Presi- dent Barack [Obama]{.underline} in his 2013 State
of the Union speech, [are clear beneficiaries of this
shift]{.underline}, another variation in the "two cultures" debate. The
2012 issue of the MLA's Profession includes a presidential forum on
teaching--- "Language, Literature, Learning"---and encourages members of
the pro- fession to redirect their scholarly energies back into the
undergraduate classroom. [The university]{.underline}, and with it the
humanities, [is clearly poised to transition into something very
different from the institution Spanos was writ- ing about twenty years
ago]{.underline}. **[Our students increasingly live in virtual spaces,
even when they sit in brick-and-mortar classrooms. However we proceed
into this future, the essential questions raised by Spanos's work will
be important to keep active]{.underline}**.

### FW -- Spanos 

**Chow and Spanos make an ontological claim that global violence NO
LONGER FUNCTIONS by direct occupation -- it is a research praxis
premised on the metaphysics of total visibility, in which Western
planners map, calculate, and perfectly order the world. This
fundamentally establishes an understanding of the world-as-target, and
unintentionally becomes part and parcel with the preparation for war.
The more you learn about the world from ONLY policy debates, the more
knowledge and skills you'll equip the next generation of imperial war
planners with. Ensuring that debaters have an ethical foundation is more
important than producing fair debates.**

Dear Joe MIller, Yes, the statement about the American debate circuit
you refer to was made by me, though some years ago. I strongly believed
then \--and still do, even though a certain uneasiness about
\"objectivity\" has crept into the \"philosophy of debate\" \-- that
[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark} in both the high schools and colleges in
this country [[is assumed to take place nowhere]{.mark}, even though the
issues that are debated are profoundly historical, which means that
[positions are]{.mark} always [represented from the perspective of
power,]{.mark} a]{.underline}nd a matter of life and death. I [find it
grotesque that in the debate world, it [doesn\'t matter which position
you take]{.mark} on an issue \-- say, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates\' [unilateral wars of preemption \-- [as long as
you \"score points]{.mark}\"]{.underline}. [The world we live in is a
world entirely dominated by an \"exceptionalist\" America]{.underline}
which has perennially claimed that it has been chosen by God or History
to fulfill his/its \"errand in the wilderness.\" [That claim is powerful
because American economic and military power lies behind
it]{.underline}. [And any alternative position in such a world is
virtually powerless]{.underline}. [Given this inexorable historical
reality, [to assume]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the protocols of debate do,
**[that [all positions]{.mark} are [equal is to efface the imbalances of
power that are the fundamental condition of
history]{.mark}]{.underline}** and to annul the Moral authority inhering
in the position of the oppressed. This is why I have said that the
appropriation of my interested work on education and empire to this
transcendental debate world constitute a travesty of my intentions. [My
scholarship is not \"disinterested.\"]{.underline} [It is militant and
intended to ameliorate as much as possible the pain and suffering of
those who have been oppressed by the \"democratic\" institutions that
have power precisely by way of showing that their language of \"truth,\"
far from being \"disinterested\" or \"objective]{.underline}\" as it is
always claimed, is informed by the will to power over all manner of
\"others.\" This is also why I told my interlocutor that he and those in
[the [debate]{.mark} world]{.underline} who felt like him [[should call
into question the]{.mark} traditional [\"objective\" debate
protocols]{.mark} and the [instrumentalist language they privilege in
favor of a]{.mark} concept of [debate and]{.mark} of [language in which
life and death mattered]{.mark}.]{.underline} I am very much aware that
[[th**e arrogant neocons who now saturate the government** of]{.mark}
the [Bush]{.mark} administration]{.underline} \-- judges, pentagon
planners, state department officials, etc. [**[learned their
\"disinterested\"]{.mark} argumentative [skills in]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}the [high school]{.mark} and college **[debate
societies]{.mark} and** tha]{.underline}t, accordingly, **[they [have
become masters at disarming]{.mark} the [just causes of the
oppressed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This kind leadership will reproduce
itself]{.underline} (along with the invisible oppression it perpetrates)
[as long as the training ground]{.underline} and the debate [protocols
from which it emerges remains in tact. [A revolution in the debate world
must occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It must force that unworldly world
down into the historical arena where positions make a
difference]{.underline}. To invoke the late Edward Said, [only [such a
revolution will]{.mark} be capabl]{.underline}e of \"deterring
democracy\" (in Noam Chomsky\'s ironic phrase), of instigating the
secular critical consciousness that is, in my mind, the sine qua non for
[[avoid]{.mark}ing [the immanent global disaster]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[towards which the]{.mark} ~~blind~~ [arrogance of Bush]{.mark}
Administration [and his neocon policy makers is
leading]{.mark}]{.underline}.

WVS: [The danger of being [a total insider is]{.mark} that]{.underline}
the eye of [such a person becomes [blind to alternative possibilities.
The]{.mark} extreme [manifestation of]{.mark} this [being at one with
the system]{.mark}, of remaining inside the frame]{.underline}, as it
were, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Hannah Arendt, decisively
demonstrated long ago, Adolph [[Eichmann]{.underline}]{.mark}. That\'s
why she and Said, among many poststructuralists, believed that [[to be
an authentic intellectual]{.underline}]{.mark} \--to see what
disinterested inquiry can\'t see\-- [[one has to be an
exile]{.underline}]{.mark} (or a pariah) from a homeland\-- one who is
[both apart of and apart from the dominant culture]{.underline}. Unlike
Socrates, for example, Hippias, Socrates\' interlocutor in the dialogue
\"Hippias Major\" (he is, for Arendt, the model for Eichmann), is at one
with himself. When he goes home at night \"he remains one.\" He is, in
other words, incapable of thinking. When Socrates, the exilic
consciousness, goes home, on the other hand, he is not alone; he is \"by
himself.\" He is two-in-one. He has to face this other self. He has to
think. Insofar as its logic is faithfully pursued, [the framework of
[the debate system]{.mark}]{.underline}, to use your quite appropriate
initial language, [[does]{.underline}]{.mark}, indeed, [[produce]{.mark}
horrifically [thoughtless Eichmanns]{.mark}, which is]{.underline} to
say, [[a]{.mark} political [class whose thinking]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[whether it\'s called Republican or Democratic]{.underline}]{.mark}, is
thoughtless in that it [[is]{.mark} totally separated from and
[indifferent to the existential realities of the world]{.mark} it is
representing]{.underline}. It\'s no accident, in my mind, that [[those
who govern us in America]{.underline}]{.mark} \--our alleged
representatives, [[whether Republican, Neo-Con, or
Democrat]{.underline}]{.mark}\-- [[constitute such a \"political
class]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" **[[This governing class
has]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in large part, **[[their origins,
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** a preparatoary relay consisting of the
**[[high school]{.underline}]{.mark}** and college
**[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** circuit, **[[political
science]{.underline}]{.mark}** departments, **[[and the
law]{.underline}]{.mark}** profession. The moral of this story is that
[[the debate world needs more]{.mark} outsiders]{.underline} \--
[or]{.underline}, rather, **[[inside outsiders]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\-- [[if its]{.mark} ultimate [purpose is to prepare young people to
change the world rather than to reproduce it]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### As a result, orient your ballot around the differential subjectivities inured by your decision \-\-- such a decision structure creates substantively more enriching albeit difficult debates that center questions of theoretical structure over political tweaks \-\-- voting aff induces a liberal carelessness that makes creative solutions to global problems less likely and acceding to widespread interventions more likely

#### They've conceded a serial policy failure argument that their visions of global order bracket in reforms that calcify the current system and preclude broader questions about the dynamics undergirding contemporary political life

#### Specifically, determine whether to reform biopolitical management paradigms or instead divest from technomanagerial politics of death-making and cultivate spaces for critical reflection

#### There's no internal link from their framework to meaningful skills -- the more time we spend fantasizing about what we would do with power we don't have, the less time we have to recognize where we are and what we can do with our own lives -- they rob debate of the ability to construct ethical values for us to frame our future decisions -- Featherstone supports this and functions as a solvency argument for our FW bc we unsettle habitual modes of thought and enable creative solutions whereas they lock us into the violence produced by the status quo's mediocre thought

#### Other debates solve all their impacts -- they have to win that we should never have debates that interrogate the broader systems and structures -- without macro-systems-level-thinking, we are all quite liable to get bogged down in potentially irrelevant details and digressions

#### We lead to better portable skills -- learning to adapt in the moment and think critically about something you haven't predicted before is important to adjusting to the real world 

#### Fairness loss inevitable -- smaller schools and research, speed, high school camp and experience disparity all make debate structurally unfair, yet we get something out of it through trying our best to engage each other 

#### Hard debate is good \-\-- we cause aff strategic thinking \-\-- neg flex o/w, we need K framework args on a topic with massive aff-side bias where it's impossible to be neg 

#### Process CP\'s and T args fill in and cause worse aff ground loss 

#### Policymaking leads to a form a psychological doubling that negates personal responsibility and results in the worst historical atrocities---independent ethical reason to vote neg

**Fasching and deChant 2011** (Darrell and Dell, Prof. of Religious
Studies @ University of South Florida, Prof. of Religious Studies @ USF,
Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, Pg.  42-43) 

Interpreting our own historical situation is a risky business, for we
are still too close to the events. We do not have the distance needed to
put everything into proper perspective. Nevertheless, without such an
interpretation it is impossible to identify the ethical challenges that
face us, so we must risk it. In this chapter we argue that two major
trends unfolded in the twentieth century that are of significance for
thinking about ethics: (1) the phenomenon of mass killing encouraged by
sacred narratives that authorize \"killing in order to heal,\" as
symbolized by Auschwitz and Hiroshima, and (2) a cross-cultural and
interreligious ethic of non-violent resistance or civil disobedience
symbolized by figures like Gandhi and King -- one that functions as an
ethic of audacity on behalf of the stranger. The second, we suggest,
offers an ethic of the holy in response to the sacred morality of the
first. [[The modern period]{.mark}, which [began with]{.mark} a utopian
[hope that science and tech]{.mark}nology [would create]{.mark} an age
of [peace]{.mark}, prosperity, [and]{.mark} progress, **[ended
in]{.mark} an apocalyptic nightmare of [mass death]{.mark}, symbolized
by [Auschwitz and Hiroshima,]{.mark}** leaving us with the task of
creating a post/modern ethic that can transcend the techno-bureaucratic
tribalism that expressed itself in two world wars]{.underline}.
Technobureaucratic tribalism occurs when sacred narratives are combined
with the technical capacity to produce mass death. While we do not
pretend to offer an exhaustive explanation of the modern propensity for
mass death, we do suggest two key elements: (1) the use of sacred
narratives that define killing as a form of healing, and (2) [the
**[undermining]{.mark} of [ethical consciousness]{.mark}** [by
techno-bureaucratic organization through]{.mark} a
**[psychological]{.mark} process of [doubling (separating one\'s
personal and professional identities]{.mark}**),]{.underline} which
[[enables individuals to **deny**]{.mark} that **they are responsible
for**]{.underline} some of **[[their actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Through sacred stories, the stranger is defined as less than human and
therefore beyond the pale of ethical obligation, as well as a threat to
sacred order. At the same time, [[bureaucracies encourage]{.mark} one to
engage in **a total [surrender of self in]{.mark} unquestioning
[obedience to]{.mark} higher**]{.underline} (sacred)
[**[authority]{.mark}**]{.underline} [(]{.mark}[whether
God]{.underline}, religious leaders, [or political
leaders]{.underline}), [so that [when one acts]{.mark} as a professional
self [on behalf of an institution]{.mark}]{.underline} (the state, the
military, the church, etc.) [[one can say, **\"**]{.mark}**It is not I
that acts: [a higher authority is acting through me, so I am not
personally responsible]{.mark}.\"**]{.underline} Yet, [despite
the]{.underline} seemingly overwhelming dominance of [techno-
bureaucratic]{.underline} tribalism and [mass killing in the twentieth
century]{.underline}, a modest but important counter-trend also emerged
-- a cross-cultural and interreligious ethic of audacity on behalf of
the stranger, linked to such names as Tolstoy, Gandhi, and King. The
purpose of this chapter is to grasp the ethical challenge of modernity
as symbolized by Auschwitz and Hiroshima. The purpose of the remainder
of this book is to examine the potential of the ethical response to that
challenge offered by the tradition of non-violent civil disobedience,
symbolized by Gandhi and King, for a cross-cultural and interreligious
post/modern ethic of human dignity, human rights, and human liberation.

#### Their FW perniciously reinforces ideologies that indoctrinate us into adapting elitist and nationalist values. Given that academic policy suggestions are woefully incapable of addressing policy, prioritize solvency arguments that endorse building and reinforcing actually-existing social movements

Another reason I hesitate to make policy suggestions is **[that [I am
suspicious of]{.mark} the very idea of [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Policy implies]{.mark} the existence of [an elite
group]{.mark}---government officials,
typically]{.underline}**---**[[that gets to]{.mark} decide on
something]{.underline}** ("a policy") **[that they then arrange to be
[impose]{.mark}d [on everybody else. There's a little mental trick
we]{.mark} often play on ourselves when discussing such
matters]{.underline}**. **[We [say]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for instance,
"**[[What are we going to do about the problem of
X]{.underline}]{.mark}**?" as if "we" **[were society as a whole,
somehow acting on ourselves, but, in fact, [unless we happen to be part
of that]{.mark} roughly 3 percent to 5 percent of the [population whose
views actually do affect policy makers, this is all a game of
make-believe; we are identifying with our rulers when]{.mark}, in fact,
[we're the ones being ruled]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is what happens
when we watch a politician on television say "What shall we do about the
less fortunate?" even though at least half of us would almost certainly
fit that category ourselves. Myself, **[[I find such games]{.mark}
particularly [pernicious]{.mark} because I'd prefer not to have policy
elites around at all]{.underline}**. I'm personally an anarchist, which
means that, [not only do [I look forward to a day]{.mark} sometime in
the future [when governments, corporations, and the rest will be looked
at as historical curiosities in the]{.mark} same [way]{.mark} as [we now
look at the Spanish Inquisition or nomadic invasions]{.mark}, but **[I
prefer solutions to immediate problems that]{.mark} do not give more
power to governments or corporations**, but rather, **[give people the
means to manage their own affairs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It follows
that when faced with a social problem [my impulse is]{.mark} not to
imagine myself in charge, and ponder what sort of solutions I would then
impose]{.underline}, but **[[to look for a movement already out there,
already trying to address the problem and create its own
solutions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The problem of bullshit jobs, though
presents unusual challenges in this regard. There are no anti--bullshit
job movements. This is partly because most people don't acknowledge the
proliferation of bullshit jobs to be a problem, but also because even if
they did, it would be difficult to organize a movement around such a
problem. **[[What local initiatives might such a movement
propose]{.underline}]{.mark}**? One could imagine unions or other worker
organizations launching anti-bullshit initiatives in their own
workplaces, or even across specific industries---but they would
presumably call for the de-bullshitization of real work rather than
firing people in unnecessary positions. It's notatall clear whata
broader campaign against bullshit jobs would even look like. One might
try to shorten the working week and hope things would sort themselves
out in response. But it seems unlikely that they would. Even a
successful campaign for a fifteen-hour week would be unlikely to cause
the unnecessary jobs and industries to be spontaneously abandoned; at
the same time, calling for a new government bureaucracy to assess the
usefulness of jobs would inevitably itself turn into a vast generator of
bullshit.

mainly about. For starters, I would say any such theory would have to
begin with some initial assumptions. Not many. Probably just two. First,
**[it would have to [proceed from the assumption
that]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as the Brazilian folk song puts it,
"**[[another world is possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**." That
**[[institutions like the state, capitalism, racism and male dominance
are not inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[that it would be possible
to have a world in which these things would not exist, and that we'd all
be better off as a result]{.underline}**. To commit oneself to such a
principle is almost an act of faith, since [how can one have certain
knowledge of such matters]{.underline}? It might possibly turn out that
such a world is not possible. But one could also make the argument that
[it's this very unavailability of absolute knowledge which makes a
commitment to optimism a moral imperative: Since one cannot know a
radically better world is not possible, [are we not betraying everyone
by insisting on continuing to justify]{.mark}, and reproduce, [the mess
we have today]{.mark}]{.underline}? And anyway, **[even if we're wrong,
we might well get a lot closer]{.underline}**.

do the opposite]{.underline}, namely to turn directly into the wind of
Islamic discontent. In doing so, Obama\'s Cairo speech is a lesson in
the metaphysics of power. While the Bush administration implicitly
operated on the basis of a theory of power that held that power must
always expand, must always seek out new opportunities for control, that
the world must be subjected to military policies aimed at \"full

different]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps at some point he might have

**[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration **[[may be the
quintessential]{.mark} expression of [power as]{.mark} the [will to
will]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[that point where
power,]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[having tested its outer
limits,]{.mark} [turns back upon itself]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In retrospect, the [Bush]{.underline} political administration probably
[represented the last bacchanalian feast of power in its purest
form]{.underline}. Here, [the power of American empire having no
manifest enemy was finally liberated to be power in its final
stage]{.underline} \-- [power as a pure sign]{.underline}. [Globally
hegemonic in its military claims to \"full spectrum
dominance\"]{.underline} of time and space as well as \"metabolic
domination\" of the world population, [the **feast of American power
expanded with implosive energies**]{.underline} \-- **[a financial
sector]{.underline}** th[at transformed the machinery of capitalist
transactions into an economic landscape where mone]{.underline}y in the
form of credit finally [floated free of any solvency requirements; a
housing sector that increasingly operated on]{.underline} [the basis of
purely virtual value standards,]{.underline} with the value of homes
measured by aesthetic standards; and a consumer sector where the
delusional economy of zero credit requirements made individual
over-indebtedness a structural requirement of the operation of the
system as a whole.

Like many Democrats before him, [Obama\'s fate was to be elected after
the party when the bills for the feast come due and the treasury of the
state is effectively bankrupt]{.underline}. Probably by force of
circumstance, [Obama\'s interpretation of international politics is
based on a realistic understanding of the limits and precariousness of
American power]{.underline}. Confronting their moment of inevitable
historical decline after wild bouts of over-expansion and
hyper-contraction, empires, like individuals, are definitely not above
reacting badly \-- lashing out against convenient scapegoats as
projected sources of their own internally constituted troubles. While
the grim politics of reaction-formation was the everyday language of the
Bush administration with its War on Terror, secret detention facilities,
and the mobilization of the domestic population into a constant state of
anxiety based on an increasingly phantasmagoric fear of terrorism,
**[Obama has chosen a different pathway]{.underline}**. Here, [[American
power begins to **acknowledge its limits**]{.mark}, recognizing its
contingency and]{.underline}, indeed, political [vulnerability in a
swiftly changing word, [seeking out \"**conversations**\" **with its
opponents rather than exercise brute force**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[It is not so much that Obama\'s political circumstance is to preside
over the decline of American power, but quite the reverse]{.underline}.
If Obama can speak earnestly and enthusiastically about America as a
\"young country\" based on innovation, creativity, and hard work, it is
perhaps because [he wishes to reanimate American power in the context of
a radically altered world situation, that point where [power begins to
**play the game of seduction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not force. **[In
the game of political seduction]{.underline}**, [[shared
aspirations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the reality of [mutual implication,
and]{.mark} the assumption of co-[responsibility are everything]{.mark}.
[The transition]{.mark} of American power from a command philosophy of
military force to a theory of international relations based on
**political seduction** [begins with **mutual
recognition**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The particular challenge confronting Obama\'s charismatic vision of a
liberal world]{.underline} \-- interdependent, responsible, shared,
intermediated \-- is twofold. First, [how does he convince
the]{.underline} Muslim [world of the good intentions of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[when facts appear to move in
the opposite direction]{.underline}**? **[[How]{.mark} [does Obama
persuade the world that]{.mark} what is in [the]{.mark}
particular]{.underline}** (security/economic) [[interest of the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
in the general interest of the global community]{.underline}]{.mark}?
Secondly, how will Obama accomplish what surely must be his major
objective, namely migrating American political thought to a more complex
understanding of Islam? After all, at the same moment that Obama rose to
speak in Cairo the empire politics of the United States were in full
motion: the garrisoning of the globe with a multiplicity of American
bases; the violent occupation of Iraq; mass casualties among the Iraqi
civilian population as a result of American air attacks; a decade-long
war against Muslim guerilla forces in Afghanistan; aggressive
containment policies against Iran; and American support of Israel. While
Obama may deny the efficacy of the politics of power as
\"self-defeating\" and, moreover, insist in his Cairo speech that Muslim
\"stereotypes\" of the United States as a \"self-serving empire\" were
false, at least to the extent that such stereotypes did not take into
account the progressive quality of the American political experiment,
nonetheless his reanimated liberal vision seems to be short-circuited by
the real world of American empire. This is made all the worse because in
Obama\'s estimation the events of 9/11 continue to traumatize the
American psyche. In excluding \"violent extremists\" from the moral pact
that is charismatic liberalism, [[Obama is adamant:]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[These are not]{.mark} [opinions to be debated; these are facts to
be dealt with]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" In other words, [the
**interpretation** of [the **liberal framework with its calculus of
friends and enemies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[bodies that matter and
bodies that do not matter]{.underline}**[, **[is not an opinion open to
debate, but \"facts to be dealt with.\"]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[So]{.underline} then, [a]{.underline} skeptical Islamic world outside
and [traumatized American subjectivity]{.underline} within, an Islamic
world [that is mistrustful of its place in the American interpretation
of power, and an American population filled with animus about any
challenges to the hegemony of \"facts to be dealt with.\" These are
seemingly intractable obstacles to a charismatic liberal politics that
would privilege complexity]{.underline}, yet if not dealt with
[[obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[possess such virulent
psychological force that they would quickly deliver the world to a new
dark age of mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}, suspicion, [[and
violence.]{.underline}]{.mark} [While the American exercise of imperial
power has reduced many Muslim-majority countries to abuse value, the
inevitable blowback from such political subjugation has reinforced the
most atavistic tendencies in American politics]{.underline}.

Suiciding Itself to Virtual Life

It would be inaccurate to say that ours is merely a civilization of
technological hubris. Nietzsche was more insightful. For him, we are a
\"gamble,\" a \"going-across,\" a \"glance,\" a \"gathering storm.\" Or
perhaps Jean-Francois Lyotard for whom we are an \"incommensurability,\"
an impossibility that cannot be unrealized because we are perhaps never
capable of full self-consciousness. Whatever the case, it can never, and
probably will never be said of us, that we have not worn the membrane of
technology as our deepest primal, that the horizon of technology is not
the gamble upon which we stake the meaning of life itself. [While it is
a matter of strict epistemological warfare]{.underline} between social
constructionists and hypermoderns [to make much of the cultural issues
attendant upon the meaning]{.underline} of the \"post\" - post-society,
post-culture, post-gender [- I do not think that we have yet grasped
deeply into the interstices of our thought just how graphically, how
bleakly, we truly have become a culture of the]{.underline} post.

I do not mean this lightly. [[When the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[used nuclear weapons]{.mark} on Japan [it precipitated a]{.mark}
[threshold event of the greatest]{.mark} cultural
[magnitude]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[History literally
ended]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[If]{.mark} by history [we mean]{.mark} the
traditional cultural understanding of history as [an indeterminate sense
of unfolding time, an]{.mark} [open future]{.mark} never fully under
human control]{.underline}, then that sense of history decisively ended
in the bio-flash of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. And again, Lyotard was
right, but perhaps not in the sense he would wish. Post-history has been
\"driftworks,\" an indeterminate and increasingly violent series of
technological experiments on the horizon of existence itself: the
acceleration of space under the sign of digital culture until [[space
itself has been reduced to a \"specious present,\"]{.mark} and the
social engineering of time into a micro-managed prism of empty
granularities]{.underline}. Is it possible, just possible, that [[what
Nietzsche described as ressentiment]{.underline}]{.mark}, [this furious
reaction formation at our own distorted instincts, [now makes a new
appearance at an exclusively cultural level]{.mark}]{.underline}? Is the
real meaning of post-history the cultural road stories of **[[a
civilization suiciding itself to virtual life]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

[[Just as nuclear warfare gutted history]{.mark}, so too [genetic
engineering vacates the body.]{.mark} Suddenly and unpredictably, [a new
master discourse]{.mark} under the triumphant sign of
biology]{.underline} [as destiny has [installed itself as the]{.mark}
epistemological [lynchpin of a global alliance of the]{.mark} so-called
[life sciences and the life industries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cloaking
itself in the antiseptic, technical language of genetic engineering,
hyping itself as a \"bible of life,\" institutionalizing itself as the
Human Genome Project, here promising a future medical cornucopia of gene
therapy, there warning against the dysgenic effects of unmodified
organisms, everywhere dreaming anew of the genetic perfectibility of the
human body, the language of biology as destiny marks the appearance of
what I call \"third wave eugenics\". Having successfully immunized
itself from the overt fascism of the second-wave eugenics of National
Socialism and once having distanced itself from an open affiliation with
its Darwinian and Mendelian origins, third wave eugenics projects itself
into the future as the spearhead of the will to technology. Nihilism
today speaks the language of biology as destiny. The culture of third
wave eugenics is only awakening to its possibilities. We are, I believe,
entirely unprepared for this transformation.

Culturally, [it is as if [we are living through the cultural trauma of
two abrupt]{.mark}, and [ethically unfathomable, shutdowns]{.mark}: the
ending of a progressive sense of history and an indeterminate sense of
time with the climactic events of WWII]{.underline}; [and the ending of
an understanding of the body as something more than its genetic code. We
are the victims of two Manhattan projects: one resulting in the
extermination of history, and the other in the cryptography of the
body.]{.underline} Might not cultural trauma of this pervasiveness not
also serve simultaneously as both a precondition for the seduction of
genetic determinism and an anticipatory sign of its coming triumph?
[[Viewed ethically]{.mark}, [shouldn\'t such \'big science\']{.mark} as
the Human Genome Project not also [be considered in the
psycho-ontological language of trauma]{.mark}]{.underline}: the
[[certain]{.mark} [outcome of a world culture that]{.mark} once
[committed to the language of technology as destiny now finds itself
exhausted]{.mark}, fatigued, [feeding on its own referentials]{.mark},
while all the while warming itself in the sun of
technicity?]{.underline} Heidegger, Marx, and Nietzsche, then, as trauma
theorists diagnosing in advance the cultural preconditions necessary for
the triumph of the will to technology as well as its nihilistic fallout.

Artificial War

\"I think that space, in and of itself, is going to be very quickly
recognized as a fourth dimension of warfare.\"

General Ronald R. Fogleman, USAF, Ret

[[Not just artificial life, but also now **artificial
war**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Consider, for example, [[the recent war]{.mark} in Afghanistan where [in
an epochal break with traditional]{.mark} [military
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, RQ-1 Predator
[[Drones]{.underline}]{.mark} equipped with Hellfire antitank missiles
were [[utilized]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[as]{.underline}]{.mark}
stationary [platforms for [long-term]{.mark}]{.underline} optical
[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} and as remotely controlled missile
launchers. [[Real-time proximity]{.mark}
([surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline} of the caves of Afghanistan)
[[combined with strategies enhancing **virtual
control**]{.underline}]{.mark} (those video screens in Washington
displaying action on the ground in a remote battlefield)\-- this
technological mediation of the hyper-modern technologies of the
twenty-first century with medieval tribal warfare of the
third-century\--[**[suddenly migrates war to the planetary]{.mark}**,
[**digital dimension** for purposes of space-based information
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

With this, **[[the age of Artificial War has
begun]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In its manifesto for the future of
cyber-war, Vision 2020, the newly created United States Space Command
theorizes a future battlefield of \"full spectrum dominance.\"
Abandoning the earth-bound dimensions of land, sea air, [[USSPACECOM
projects a new era of artificial war in which the battlefield occurs in
the \"4th dimension\" of space]{.underline}.]{.mark} Befitting a
\"space-faring nation\" such as the United States, third-dimensional
warfare is surpassed by a vision of future war in which \"battle
managers\" are, in essence, computerized editing systems running on
automatic, absorbing fluctuating data fields concerning attacks and
responses, monitoring satellite transmissions from 20,000 miles in deep
space, sequencing missile launches, integrating \"dominant maneuvers\"
in space with \"precision engagement\" on the ground, sea and air,
providing \"full-dimensional protection\" to \"core national assets\"
and focusing logistics\" for a virtual battlefield that stretches into
an indefinite future. As USSPACECOM theorizes: the control of the seas
in defense of commercial economic interests and the war of the western
lands in defense of the expansion of the American empire to the shores
of California has now migrated to a war for the \"control of space\"
befitting a \"space-faring nation\" like the United States, this
spearhead of technology. Consequently, a future of artificial warfare in
which space itself is weaponized. [4th Dimensional warfare is the
technical language by which the [American empire now projects itself
into a future]{.mark} [of Artificial War]{.mark}: a 4th Dimensional
rhetoric of \"[global engagement]{.mark},\"]{.underline} \"full-force
integration,\" \"**[[global partnerships]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\"
[[weaponized space stations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[tracking
satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}, [reusable missile
launchers]{.underline}, [and on-line]{.underline}, real-time
[remote]{.underline}ly [control]{.underline}led [[anti-missile
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}.

I emphasize **[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** story [because it **[is
revelatory of the meaning of the will to
technology]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Here, technology is not only the
chosen aim of technological instrumentality (weaponizing space), but
also involves [technologies of mythology]{.underline} (the
well-rehearsed story of the unfolding American frontier where wagon
trains evolve into Predator Drones, and sea-faring navies migrate into
space-bound automated battlefield manager systems), [[technologies of
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} (the fourfold \"tactics\" of space war:
dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional protection,
focused logistics), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies of
(aggressive) [[judgment]{.underline}]{.mark} (\"multinational
corporations\" are also listed in Vision 2020 as potential \'enemies\'
of USSPACECOM).

[More than futurist military doctrine]{.underline} for the 21st century,
[Vision 2020 represents the essence of the will to
technology.]{.underline} Here, [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[is
both a space-faring means]{.mark} to the successful]{.underline}
[prosecution [of artificial warfare]{.mark} and its sustaining ethical
justification. [The will to technology folds back on itself]{.mark}\--[a
closed]{.mark} and self-validating [universe of thinking]{.mark},
[willing, judging, and destining]{.mark}\--[that brooks no earthly
opposition because it is a will, and nothing els]{.mark}e]{.underline}.
As Nietzsche reflected in advance: \"[**[it is a will to
nothingness]{.underline}**.]{.mark}\" Or, as Hannah Arendt eloquently
argues in her last book, The Life of the Mind, \"the famous power of
negation inherent in the Will and conceived as the motor of history (not
only in Marx but also, by implication, already in Hegel) is an
annihilating force that could just as well result in a process of
annihilation as of Infinite Progress.\"\[1\] Could it be that the
world-historical movement captured by the military logic of Vision
2020\-- this command vision of America as the historical spearhead of
the will to technology\-- represents that which is probably unthinkable
but consequently very plausible, a contemporary expression of the
metaphysics of \"not-being?\" [If \"permanent annihilation\" is the
sustaining (military) creed]{.underline} of Vision 2020, [then this also
indicates that [the world-historical movement]{.mark}, which it so
powerfully strategizes, [**is driven onwards by the seduction of
negation**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[another suicide note on the]{.mark}
way to the [weaponizing of space]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Consequently, if the American novelist, Don DeLillo, can write so
eloquently in his recent essay, \"In the Ruins of the Future,\" that
[[\'(T)echnology is our fate, our truth]{.mark}\" this]{.underline} also
[implies that in linking its fate with the \"truth of technology,\" the
United States,]{.underline} and by implication the culture of
globalization, may have, however inadvertently, [infected its deepest
political logic with the will to nihilism. In the sometimes utopian,
always militaristic, language of technological experimentalism,
\"Not-being\" finally becomes a world historical project.]{.underline}
Those who are only passive bystanders to the unfolding destiny of the
contemporary American descendents of the Puritan founders can only look
on with amazement coupled with distress as the \"American project\"
embraces not only the weaponizing of space but also genetic
experimentation with the question of evolution itself. While DeLillo
goes on to say that ([technology) \"is what we mean when we call
ourselves a superpower]{.underline},\" his pragmatism sells short the
point he really wants to make: namely, that by linking its fate, its
truth, with the question of technology the United States has also
enduringly enucleated itself within the larger historical, indeed if
USSPACECOM is to be believed, post-historical, project of technology.
Enucleated not as something other than the technological destiny which
is its profession of faith, of truth, but enucleated in the more
classical sense of the term, of being somehow interior to the unfolding
destiny of the will to technology. The larger cultural consequence of
this bold act of willing remains deeply enigmatic. In this case, is the
will to technology an intensification of the pragmatic spirit upon which
the American experiment was founded? Or has the will to technology, at
the very moment of its historical self-realization, already reversed its
course, becoming its own negation: Arendt\'s prophecy of \"not-being\"
as a \"process of annihilation.\" On the ultimate resolution of this
question depends the American fate, the American truth, as the spearhead
of technology.

On the public evidence, what makes the American project truly distinct
today is its enthusiastic abandonment of the pragmatic will for the
uncharted metaphysical territory of \"not-being.\" [[The will to the
conquest of empty spatialization]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
vivisectioning of the code of life itself [[has]{.mark} about it [the
**negative energy** of **suicidal nihilism**]{.mark}. Here, the language
of \"[not-being]{.mark}\"\--the desiccating logic of what Heidegger
memorably termed, \"Nothingness nothings\" as the historical form of the
technological project of \"permanent annihilation\"]{.underline}
\--expresses itself vividly in two master commands: Space Command and
Genetic Command. The first operates in the language of weaponized
astrophysics where the curvature of space is manipulated for strategic
purposes, and the other sequences the human genetic code itself. Thus,
control of space is inextricably linked with control of time. [[The
dynamic will to tech]{.mark}nology [projects itself doubly in the
macrophysics of a \"space-faring nation\"]{.mark} and the microphysics
of a body-[faring cellular biology]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a
collective demonstration of hubris that Greeks in the classical age
would only admire, and then fear, for its (technical) audacity and
stunning (metaphysical) innocence.

Ironically, at the very instance that USSPACECOM projects an imperialist
military future of \"full spectrum dominance,\" 9/11 occurs and we are
suddenly time-shifted into the age of viral terrorism. [Similar to the
incommensurability of technology itself where the reality of \"permanent
annihilation\" is sometimes offset by other ways of thinking technology,
the human imagination does not begin]{.underline}, cannot begin, [with
tactics of \'dominant maneuver\']{.underline} and \'precision
engagement\' and \'full-dimensional protection\' and \'focussed
logistics\' [but, with the terrorist side of fluid, earth-bound, real
material warfare.]{.underline}

[[Artificial war]{.mark}, then, [as a prolegomenon to the codes of
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Framed Democracy 

#### The aff represents metaphysical politics of description endemic of "framed democracy, " our current global milieu\-\--this metaphysical will to truth is the foundation of violence in framed democracy 

**Vattimo and Zabala '11** \[Gianni Vattimo, emeritus professor of
philosophy at the University of Turin and a member of the European
Parliament, and Santiago Zabala, ICREA Research Professor of Philosophy
at the Pompue Fabra University, *Hermeneutic Communism,* Columbia: New
York, NY (2011), p. 17-29\]

In a discussion with the distinguished French analytical philosopher
Pascal Engel on the uses of truth, Rorty showed how [[contemporary
philosophy is divided]{.underline}]{.mark} not only between realist and
antirealist conceptions of truth but most of all [between those who
argue over truth\'s realism or]{.underline} [antirealism and those who
try to avoid this metaphysical quarrel altogether]{.underline}.10 While
Engel was only interested in justifying his \"minimal realism\" theory
of truth at all costs, Rorty tried to indicate that [[while]{.mark} both
[realist]{.mark} and antirealist [theorists belong to the politics of
descriptions]{.mark}]{.underline} (because even the antirealist imposes
his description of truth\'s nonexistence), [[those who overcome such
dualism belong to a]{.mark} post- metaphysical culture]{.underline},
that is[, to a [politics of interpretation]{.mark}]{.underline} (which
we will study in chapter 3). But [Rorty\'s most significant
implications]{.underline} [concern]{.underline} not the democratic
opportunities [that philosophy might gain from leaving aside
the]{.underline} realist-versus-antirealist quarrel [but rather the
violent political consequences of the politics of
descriptions]{.underline}. It must be for these reasons that Rorty, in a
famous essay of 1985 entitled \"Solidarity or Objectivity?\" emphasized
the centrality of truth in our philosophical tradition:

The tradition in Western culture which centers around the notion of the
search for Truth, a tradition which runs from the Greek philosophers
through the Enlightenment, is the clearest example of the attempt to
find a sense in one\'s existence by turning away from solidarity to
objectivity. The idea of Truth as something to be pursued for its own
sake, not because it will be good for oneself, or for one\'s real or
imaginary community, is the central theme of this tradition.11

While most philosophers would agree with Rorty that truth is the central
theme of our tradition, not all of them will believe it is responsible
for a turn away from solidarity. The origin of this dispute lies in the
essence of truth, that is, in its pragmatic nature, without which it
also loses its meaning. Truth is not only \"violent,\" in that it turns
away from solidarity, but it is \"violence,\" because it can easily
become an imposition on our own existence. Being \"violent\" might imply
that it can also be peaceful, but truth instead often implies an imposed
description whose acceptance is assumed. [[Violence is the political
meaning of truth]{.mark}, because truth always implies a concluding
constriction that varies from its definition]{.underline} in the Gospels
(\"The truth will make you free\"), in Hegel (\"Truth is the whole\"),
or more recently in Baudrillard (\"The simulacrum is true\"). Although
[these definitions of truth]{.underline} probably have our well-being at
heart, they also [pretend to impose themselves regardless of our
different religious, existential, or social Being.]{.underline} Like the
metaphysical philosophies mentioned earlier, [these [definitions of
truth]{.mark} want to [maintain the social order]{.mark} that they find
themselves comfortable in, [and]{.mark} they [also claim to justify
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Although truth, as the reflection of a given objective order, has always
inspired ethical and moral ideals of life, these same ideals depended on
truth\'s unity, that is, the unity of opinions in the true. While this
unity has effectively become reality today because of the establishment
of a global political system (which we call framed democracy), [truth
does not therefore cease being violent, because claims of truth are also
claims of political power]{.underline}. But [[how does]{.mark} this
[violence take place]{.mark} in our global political
culture?]{.underline} [**Principally [through]{.mark} the use of
[dialogue as the \"moralization of politics]{.mark}**,\" that is, **as
[the apparently peaceful exchange of
opinions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---]{.mark}but, as we all know, even
Plato\'s exemplary dialogues aimed to conduct one of the two
interlocutors (often the slave) to recognize the truth that the other
already knew from the beginning. [If truth claims are also always claims
of political power]{.underline}, [that is, violence]{.underline}, [and
if this same [violence is nothing else than the \"silencing\" of the
other]{.mark} interlocutor [through]{.mark} an apparent
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[truth and violence become
interchangeable]{.underline}**. [Only the recognition of truth\'s
violence will allow one to consider the implicit danger of those
politics that claim to have an ultimate foundation]{.underline}, [that
is, politics founded on truth]{.underline}. As we will see, **[the
foundation of [truth through dialogue fixes thought within framed
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}**: **[[a conservative moralized order
where the democratic is only what legally enters]{.mark} the order
established by [metaphysics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

The most successful definitions of truth within contemporary analytic
and continental philosophy continue to belong to Husserl\'s
phenomenological theory and Alfred Tarski\'s philosophy of language (in
1933, Tarski developed Aristotle\'s \"correspondence theory of truth,\"
expressed in medieval philosophy as veritas est adaequatio rei et
intellectus). While many historians will have us believe that there is a
substantial difference between the two theories from a semantic point of
view, few have discussed the metaphysical implication that both theories
share. Contrary to the majority of Tarski\'s interpreters, we believe
that the quotation marks in his principle (\" \'p\' is True if and only
if p\")12 are essential, because they indicate its pragmatic essence, in
other words, for \"whom\" truth is significant. In sum: the position of
P outside the quotation marks is always expressed, affirmed, and
sustained by someone who needs it to be outside, hence, who is
interested in imposing P.

[Metaphysical philosophers would respond that this imposition, and
therefore the exclusion of the quotation marks from the second P, is
necessary in order for our \"affirmations, actions, and thoughts\" to
distinguish themselves from other affirmations, actions, and
thoughts]{.underline}. Without this opposition (between \"P\" and P),
our opinions would be useless, they say, and therefore we need Tarski\'s
principle to share our common experiences. But do we really need the
opposition between \"P\" and P to share our common experiences? Can\'t
there be a group satisfied with \"P\" without any interest in the
apparent real P?

This opposition or difference has become evident thanks to Heidegger\'s
analysis of truth, starting with Being and Time, where he distinguished
Husserl\'s metaphysical approach from a different hermeneutic one. Truth
for Husserl depends on the difference between the mere \"intention\" of
the phenomenological Being and the matter \"itself\"---in other words,
between the manner in which something appears and the manner in which it
is \"itself.\" This difference, just like Tarski\'s opposition between
\"P\" and P, consists in identifying an entity or order precisely as it
is in itself; that is, a proposition would be true only if it \"refers\"
to things in a way that permits them to be seen as they are in
themselves. But this \"reference\" is not very different from the
pragmatic \"imposition\" we mention above, because its purpose is still
to explain how something reveals itself (truth) in opposition to its
concealing (false).

Against this metaphysical interpretation, [Heidegger noticed how every
statement, whether true or false, valid or invalid, good or evil, is
always a derivative one]{.underline}, since the \"apophantic as\" is
only possible within the \"hermeneutic as.\" In other words, there is no
\"presuppositionless\" apprehension of something presented to us that
could be \"objectified\" by means of subjective predicative modalities.
Prior to the predicative knowledge, which can also be expressed in
Tarski sentences, [humans beings already have a \"preontological\" or
\"pretheoretical\" understanding of]{.underline} [the Being of things
that does not require a derivative one]{.underline}, as proposed by
Husserl\'s or Tarski\'s theories. This is why in Being and Time
Heidegger explained:

The statement is not the primary \"locus\" of truth but the other way
around: the statement as a mode of appropriation of discovered- ness and
as a way of being-in-the-world is based in discovering, or in the
disclosedness of Dasein. The most primordial \"truth\" is the \"locus\"
of the statement and the ontological condition of the possibility that
statements can be true or false (discovering or covering over).13

While we will analyze Heidegger\'s specific ontological structure of
human Being (Dasein) in chapter 3,14 it is important to understand here
how [the truth of statements is not derivative because erroneous but
rather because its roots refer back to the disclosedness of
understanding that determines every linguistic or prelinguistic
adequacy]{.underline}. It is a question not only of thematizing
prelinguistic phenomena but of emphasizing the priority of thought over
knowledge, [Being over beings]{.underline}, [and the \"hermeneutic as\"
over the \"apophantic as]{.underline}.\" While the \"apophantic as\"
allows both truth and error, at the level of the \"hermeneutic as\"
there is neither, since the \"proposition is not the place of truth;
truth is the place of the proposition.\"15 As we can see, [Heidegger did
not expose this metaphysical understanding of truth because it is wrong;
he exposed it \[this metaphysical understanding of truth\] for its
superficiality, that is, against [the]{.mark} metaphysical [attempt to
reduce the philosopher\'s task to attesting]{.mark} \"how we experience
truth\" or [that \"there is actually truth]{.mark}\" when in fact [we
find ourselves]{.mark} inevitably [presupposing it]{.mark}. Puzzling
over the correspondence between subject and object, [we lose
sight]{.mark} both [of]{.mark} the world within which all things are
given and of [our own engagement as beings.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Truth, whether in Aristotle\'s, Tarski\'s, or Husserl\'s terms, shares
the metaphysical structure that is at the origin of all Western logic,
where Being is interpreted only as the presence of something present,
that is, objectively. In this distinction, the subject and
predicate---in other words, the relation between two terms where one
refers to the other--- not only represent the logical and verbal
structure but also the imposition of this same structure. Heidegger
named the difference between our relation to beings (truth) and our
understanding of Being (disclosure) the \"ontological difference,\"
which allows us to recognize how within our metaphysical tradition
\"Being and truth \'are\' equiprimordially.\"16 As we can see,
Heidegger\'s analysis of truth (like Popper\'s, Arendt\'s, and Adorno\'s
alarms against scientific objective realism that we mentioned earlier)
was meant to emphasize its violence, because truth is nothing other than
the justification of Being, which, as we said, has always been
understood as objective presence. It is also for this reason that
Heidegger later declared that \"to raise the question of aletheia, of
unconcealment as such, is not the same as raising the question of
truth,\"17 where distinctions can be imposed (presence of Being) and
justified (truth as correspondence). This is why Ernst Tugendhat (and
other distinguished interpreters of Heidegger such as Habermas and Apel)
pointed out that Heidegger\'s conception of truth as aletheia, that is,
the \"event of unconcealment,\" renounces the distinction not only
between true and false assertions \"but also between good and evil
actions.\"18 What they pointed out is correct and also a confirmation of
Heidegger\'s opposition to truth as violent imposition, which, as we
said, justifies its descriptions. This is why within our \"scientific
global organization,\" \"neutral world,\" or, which is the same, framed
democracy any proposition, interpretation, or ethics that is not framed
within the realm of truth (or its opposite, falsehood) is wrong, an
alteration and disruption of the established order that must therefore
be silenced. The philosophical disruption of the established order\'s
philosophical hermeneutics (as we will see in chapter 3) is continually
accused of relativism, nihilism, and even political anarchism, because
instead of relying on truth descriptions, it is involved in
interpretative \"events of unconcealment.\" Only such a nontheoretical
way of thinking as hermeneutics (the modern version of which began as a
defense of the extramethodical truth of the human sciences against the
natural sciences)19 can do justice to these events that resist those
claims of absolute truth able to guarantee \"peaceful\" coexistence,
that is, framed democracies.

In sum, [to distance ourselves from the \"peaceful\" neutrality of
meta-physics, we must leave, discard, or cancel truth: **[the end of
truth is the beginning of democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.220 [[If this
were not the case, then]{.mark} the objective laws of economics or the
**outcomes of [political dialogues]{.mark}** [would prevent]{.mark} the
[constant crises]{.mark} that are part of our lives.
[But]{.mark}]{.underline} as we well know, economic and [political
crises are not only constant but often also supported by [these **same
laws** ]{.mark}**and dialogues**, since they [**depend on** the
**metaphysical justification**]{.mark} of objective
descriptions]{.underline}, that [is, **of truth**]{.underline}. It is
here that [**[dialogue becomes the best way to moralize
politics]{.mark}**, that is, to **conserve framed democracy\'s
interests, condition, and immunity**]{.underline}. In order to
demonstrate how these claims of truth are also claims of political
power, it is necessary to look into Plato\'s dialogues, which still
today represent the paradigmatic example of political morality.

The slaves in Plato\'s allegory of the cave could today be represented
by the weak, that is, by those [[oppressed cultures]{.mark}, citizens,
and states that [are]{.mark} **constantly [called]{.mark} on [to join
Western civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline} (also named the \"Washington
consensus,\" IMF, or United Nations). Just like Plato, **[[the West
believes that it holds]{.mark} truth]{.underline}**, that is, **[[the
appropriate knowledge capable of guiding]{.mark} the interest of all
[the other states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although Plato probably
thought his dialogues were in the slaves\' best interest, the fact that
he would also consider it necessary to \"drag the slave away by force
into the light of the sun\" if he was not convinced (through the
dialogue) implies that Plato himself was serving other interests. But
which interests? The interests of truth, which belong to those who
understand, know, and probably even created it in order to justify their
objective presences. This is why in most of Plato\'s dialogues [truth is
not an outcome but is always presupposed by those who opportunely
interrogate the]{.underline} others.

[Although the slave in Plato\'s Meno might discover the geometric truth,
he will not have \"understood\" it until he also submits to Plato\'s
interrogation]{.underline}. Just as philosophy, in the epigraph from at
the beginning of this chapter, must \"\[admit\] of a scientific
resolution,\"21 so must the slave \"submit to Plato\'s truth.\" [Both
are examples of oppressive impositions of metaphysics, which demand a
correspondence without which the dialogue or philosophy cannot take
place.]{.underline} As we can see, Plato\'s dialogues, just like
science, are the prelude to submission to truth or, which is the same,
violence, because Plato, by assisting his interlocutors on their journey
(\"from the darkened cave to the divine light of the Good\"), is still
serving the existence of a society of dominion maintained by these same
dialogues. Apart from the violence that truth imposes on the slave,
another significant feature of Plato\'s allegory are the dangerous
consequences that will come from knowing the truth. As Plato narrates,
upon the slave\'s return from the journey the others not only mock him
because he can no longer see in the darkness but also want to kill him
for requesting that they follow him. They are afraid of the journey,
that is, of truth, because it implies a certain violence that might not
be worth it. As we can see, truth becomes violence not only for all
those who do not accept leaving the cave but also for those who return
(and have in the meantime become philosophers according to Plato\'s
\"philosopher-king\" model) and now feel compelled to lead:

Once \[the philosophers\] have seen the Good itself, using this as a
pattern, each in his turn must order \[kosmein\] city, private men, and
themselves for the rest of their lives. Now for the most part they spend
their time in philosophy, but when a person\'s turn comes, he labors in
politics and rules for the sake of the city, not as though he were doing
what is fine, but that which is necessary.

(Rep. 54oa-b)

As we can see, the philosopher, according to Plato, must sustain the
establishment. He cannot \"work out Being for itself\"22 again for a
different paradigm or propose other possibilities to the established
organization but instead \"must order,\" that is, impose, what \"is
necessary.\" As the promoter of dialogues, Plato does not want the
established order to be disrupted, altered, or shocked by either those
artists that he banned from the Republic or by the philosopher, who
could also act this way. Banning mimetic art because it is a copy that
does not have limitations and can therefore bewitch us is not very
different from circumscribing philosophy to what is necessary. Such
\"necessity\" is nothing other than the silencing of the other through
dialogue, that is, an act of violence for the sake of conserving truth.
This points at the difference between dialogues and conversations.
Conversations, just like Heidegger\'s \"event of unconcealment,\"
represent the disruption of the order that dialogues protect, because in
the conversational exchange truth is not presupposed but rather
discarded from the beginning. [If a conversation is never what we wanted
to conduct but rather a situation in which we become involved as it
develops, it represents the greatest enemy of the dialogue\'s order:
**an unannounced event**]{.underline}.23 While the concepts of
\"conversation\" and \"event\" will be analyzed in chapter 3, its
difference from the concept of dialogue should be kept in mind, as it
indicates a possible shift from dialogue (that is, from the politics of
descriptions or, which is the same, framed democracy) to \"hermeneutic
communism[.\" While the **inevitable conflict** that takes place in a
conversation refers to a **latent anarchism**, **relativism**, and
**weakness of thought**, **[dialogue\'s]{.mark} impositions instead
[require a realism capable of conserving political
order]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

As we have seen, Plato and most of the philosophical tradition that
followed him demanded that philosophy not only find truth but also
conserve it. [Dialogues]{.underline}, which once served as the
moralization of politics, [have also become the establishment\'s main
concern during any crisis, alteration, or shock that might
appear]{.underline}. **[Contemporary [disputes over true and false
assertions]{.mark}]{.underline}** (whether philosophical, theological,
or scientific) **[[are the symptom of a]{.mark} politically
[conservative]{.mark} philosophical [culture prepared to impose
its]{.mark} [order through violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This, after
all, is why Karl Popper in The Open Society and Its Enemies accused
Plato, Hegel, and Marx of totalitarianism. This classic text was meant
to demonstrate how the enemies of the open and democratic society are
those philosophers who pretend to found politics on truth either through
the \"light outside the cave\" (Plato), the \"end of history\" (Hegel),
or the \"emancipative consequences of the revolution\" (Marx). Popper\'s
text was severely at-tacked by Platonists, Hegelians, and Marxists to
the point of becoming the least-studied text in the German master\'s
enormous bibliography.

[If political thought today for the most part still ignores this text,
it is because of its attack on the notion of truth in
politics]{.underline}. But what is most interesting is that this attack
is not very different from Heidegger\'s, as we saw above; after all,
both Popper\'s \"open society\" and Heidegger\'s \"event of
unconcealment\" were directed against dialogue\'s implicit order, that
is, against any attempt to found politics on truth. Although together
with Popper there were several other \"counter-Enlightenment\"
philosophers who warned against scientific-objective realism, as we said
above, there seems to be a return in some sectors of contemporary
philosophy (phenomenology and so-called analytical ontology) to a more
radical realism. The most interesting feature of this return to realism
is not only its expression of fear (and therefore its demand for
security) but also the conservative nature it exposes through its desire
for global unification.

Among the various causes of this return, [the completion of metaphysics
seems to us]{.underline} as the [most plausible]{.underline}
explanation, [because it indicates how the dissolution of philosophy
into the objective sciences has further **submitted it to the service of
the dominant political powers**]{.underline}.24 But [if realism is
simply the conservation of objective data that philosophy must
recognize]{.underline}, [politics submit to, and faith cherish, **[it
can only triumph within a framed democracy]{.mark}**,]{.underline} that
is, **[[where transformation and change are]{.mark} almost
[impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Dialogues
exclude]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the very possibility of
[transformation, because they impose truth on any]{.mark} form of
[dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the prevailing scientific order,
that is, the metaphysical foundation of democracy. [This
foundation]{.underline}, which leads philosophy to dissolve into
scientific objectivism, [has created contemporary framed democracy,
where]{.underline}, as Heidegger explained, **[the \"only emergency is
the lack of emergency]{.underline}**\":

The lack of emergency \[Not\] is the greatest where self-certainty has
become unsurpassable, where [everything is held to be calculable
and]{.underline}, above all, where it is [decided]{.underline}, [without
a preceding question, who we are and what we are to
do]{.underline}---where knowing awareness has been lost without its ever
actually having been established that the actual self-being happens by
way of a grounding-beyond- oneself, which requires the grounding of the
grounding-space and its time.25

[In this condition of lacking of emergency]{.underline} (which we can
also call \"neutralization\"), [where Being has been finally replaced by
beings,]{.underline} that is, by its technological global organization[,
philosophy seems forced both to impose its unification and to **conserve
the established dialogue**]{.underline}. This is why Heidegger, in the
passage above, finds emergency not only in metaphysics\' domination of
the world but also in \"who we are and what we are to do,\" that is, in
our freedom. The emergency today is the completion of a condition of
neutralization where \"freedom\" is only possible within the established
dialogue. [While the goal of the metaphysical philosophers was to spread
Enlightenment scientific objectivism to all the [disciplines]{.mark} to
assure a more efficient manipulation of external reality, their [main
task now has become to assure]{.mark} the conservation of [established
\"dialogic realism\" against any outsider, parasite, or foreign
event]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this condition, [[only philosophy]{.mark}
that [can ensure the ontological structure of framed
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} all the [factors that
constitute it[:]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[truth, dialogue,
institutions]{.underline}**) [will be rewarded]{.underline}]{.mark}
[both academically and socially]{.underline}.26

#### Framed democracy's commitment to a politics of description produces an ever-expanding mass of violence and war, as the discharges of capitalism are targeted as potential threats to the metaphysical imposition of liberal truth 

**Vattimo and Zabala '11** \[Gianni Vattimo, emeritus professor of
philosophy at the University of Turin and a member of the European
Parliament, and Santiago Zabala, ICREA Research Professor of Philosophy

York, NY (2011), p. 17-29\]

Both Fukuyama and Kagan, who are among the establishment\'s most
respected political scientists, have given an account of the current
world order where democracy has prevailed over history and must conserve
that victory. Against many interpreters of this debate, we do not
believe **[Kagan was contradicting Fukuyama\'s thesis but confirming
it.]{.underline}** Kagan\'s call for a \"league of democracies\" to
\"legitimate\" their interests against foreign states indicates his fear
of change, that is, of the return of history. As we can see, more than
in a debate over the end or return of history, [Fukuyama and Kagan have
engaged in an attempt to present framed democracy as the only legitimate
and legitimizing force]{.underline}, [regardless of the administration
in the White House]{.underline}. What is most interesting about their
argument is not the political scenario they present (at the service of
framed democracy) but rather what they leave out, that is, what in the
previous chapter we called defeated, weak, or other history.

As we mentioned in the previous chapter, **[[the politics of
descriptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [in order [to **impose**
]{.mark}**and justify [framed democracy]{.mark}**, **[must eliminate
everything that does not submit to its ordering of facts, norms, and
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Having said this, it should not be
a surprise that [Fukuyama and Kagan, together with other establishment
intellectuals, forget, neglect, or ignore the oppression caused by
neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}. And if they ignore such economic
oppression, **[it is because they themselves sustain it]{.underline}**:
their condition is also an effect of such oppression. Just as Searle was
indifferent to Derrida\'s arguments, so are Fukuyama and Kagan
indifferent to the history of the oppressed, because the priority, in
both cases, is always to submit to the scientific or democratic realm of
metaphysics. It must be for this reason that when Derrida commented on
Fukuyama\'s thesis in Specters of Marx (1993), a great deal of space was
given to what he left out of his analysis:

For it must be cried out, [at a time when some have the audacity to
neo-evangelize in the name of the ideal of a [liberal democracy]{.mark}
that [has]{.mark} finally [realized itself]{.mark} as the ideal of human
history:]{.underline} [**[never]{.mark} [have violence]{.mark},
inequality, [exclusion, famine, and]{.mark} thus economic
[oppression]{.mark} [affected as many]{.mark} human beings [in the
history]{.mark} of the earth and [of humanity]{.mark}**. Instead of
singing the advent of the ideal of liberal democracy and of the
capitalist market in the euphoria of the end of history]{.underline},
[instead of celebrating the \"end of ideologies\" and the end of the
great emancipatory discourses, let us never neglect this obvious
macroscopic fact, made up of innumerable singular sites of suffering: no
degree of progress allows one to ignore that **[never]{.mark}** before,
**[in absolute figures, have so many]{.mark} men, women and children
[been subjugated, starved or exterminated]{.mark} on the
earth**]{.underline}.14

[The \"inequality, exclusion, famine, and economic oppression\" that
Fukuyama and Kagan leave]{.underline} [out of their analysis represent
framed democracy\'s effects and also its greatest threat]{.underline}.
Although, since the fall of the Soviet Union, democracies have expanded
to the point of achieving a condition of \"lack of emergencies\"---that
is, of political, financial, and social emergencies---it does not mean
they are not ready for such events. As we have seen in the past decades,
[the establishment of democratic free-market capitalist states was not
only violent]{.underline}15 [but also ineffective, considering the
dissatisfaction that most Western citizens declare today]{.underline}.16
These dissatisfactions have reached such levels that the institutions
designed to detect social discontent are no longer limited to the United
Nations (International Labour Organization, World Trade Organization, or
the Food and Agriculture Organization) but have expanded to states\'
ministries of defense. These ministries have been producing reports that
not only confirm this situation but also prepare to confront it. As Mike
Davis explained in Planet of Slums, the Pentagon war-fighting doctrine
\"is being reshaped accordingly to support a low- intensity world war of
unlimited duration against criminalized segments of the urban poor.\"17
And Rear Admiral C. J. Parry (the director general of a recent UK
Ministry of Defense report) has indirectly explained why:

[Differentials in material well-being will be more explicit through
globalization and increased access to more readily and cheaply available
telecommunications]{.underline}. [[Disparities]{.mark} in wealth and
advantage [will]{.mark} therefore [become more obvious]{.mark}, with
their associated grievances and resentments, even among the growing
numbers of people who are likely to be materially more prosperous than
their parents and grandparents]{.underline}. [[Absolute poverty]{.mark}
and comparative dis-advantage [will fuel perceptions of
injustice]{.mark} among those whose expectations are not met,
[increasing tension and instability]{.mark}, both within and between
societies and [resulting in]{.mark} expressions of violence such as
disorder, [criminality, terrorism and insurgency]{.mark}]{.underline}.
They may also lead to the resurgence of not only anti-capitalist
ideologies, possibly linked to religious, anarchist or nihilist
movements, but also to populism and the revival of Marxism.18

Although reports from [[many]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[warn of a future **rife with wars**
(over **water**]{.mark}, [**immigration**, and]{.mark} **infectious
[diseases]{.mark}**]{.underline}),19 [the fact that \"absolute poverty\"
and \"comparative disadvantage\" are now also considered threats for the
security of framed democracies inevitably poses \"other\"
alarms]{.underline} than the ones indicated by Fukuyama and Kagan. As we
can see, [[the coming threats]{.mark} are not limited to **Russia**,
**China**, **and India**, which]{.underline}, as Kagan explains, [have
become \"**responsible shareholders**,\" but rather [come from
**everyone who is not part of framed democracy**]{.mark}**\'s neoliberal
capitalism**]{.underline}. This is why we do not believe **[[the next
wars will]{.underline}]{.mark}** primarily **[[be
against]{.underline}]{.mark}** other states20 but rather against those
\"**[useless shareholders]{.underline}**,\" who, for the most part, are
**[[the weak, poor, and]{.mark} [oppressed]{.mark} citizens, as
highlighted in the defense reports]{.underline}**. As we argue[, the
weak do not possess a different history but rather exist at history\'s
margins]{.underline}; that is, **[they represent [the discharge of
capitalism]{.mark} and are present not only in the Third World but also
in the slums of Western metropolises]{.underline}**. These slums are not
only becoming larger as we write but also are where the majority of the
population is forced to live because of the concentration of capital.
[While in the West the slums are becoming battlegrounds, in some South
American states]{.underline}, as we will see in chapter 4, [they have
become territories for social improvement through communist
initiatives]{.underline}. In sum, [the conflicts]{.underline} of the
twenty-first century [will]{.underline} not [be caused]{.underline} by
the return of history, as Fukuyama and Kagan predict, but rather
[by]{.underline} [its own ends:]{.underline} **[liberal
states]{.underline}**.

[The fact that framed democracy is already preparing to fight and win
such urban wars indicates]{.underline} [how within our democratic system
change is almost impossible and also how the oppressive effects of
capitalism are predicted to increase]{.underline}. As Meiksins Wood
explained, whether \"[national or global, [\[capitalism\] is driven
by]{.mark} a certain [systemic imperatives]{.mark}, the imperatives of
competition, profit-maximization and accumulation, [which]{.mark}
inevitably [require putting \'exchange-value\' before \'use-value\' and
profit before people]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"21 [[These are systemic
imperatives of dominion]{.mark}, supremacy, [and control]{.mark} over
others, [and they result in]{.mark} such metaphysical systems as
[liberalism]{.mark}, where the power of the individual becomes the only
substance]{.underline}. Our goal in this chapter is to demonstrate how
framed democracy\'s liberal, financial, and security measures regulate
one another in order both to conserve our current \"lack of
emergencies\" and to impose necessary emergencies.

If the democracies\' chief priority is to conserve what Heidegger called
the \"lack of emergencies,\" that is, the neutrality achieved through
science\'s liberal essence, modern states still have an essential
function, contrary to the opinion of many contemporary thinkers.22 This
function is not limited to the historical, racial, or linguistic
identification of a state\'s citizens but extends to other states:
\"liberal states\" are also \"liberating states\"; that is, they
liberate other states from undemocratic regimes. [The recent imposed
liberalization of Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline} (also called \"state
building\") [occurred under the orders of other liberal states and as a
consequence of the essence of liberalism. It is also in the name of this
essence that democracy is imposed today as the best system of government
even when it becomes corrupt]{.underline}. As we mentioned in the
previous chapter, the \"liberal essence\" of science consists in its
ideal of objectivity, that is, establishing \"truth\" or \"freedom\" as
only what legally enters within the established, recognized, and framed
democratic order.

It must be for these reasons that Carl Schmitt viewed \"[liberalism as a
coherent, all-embracing,]{.underline} [metaphysical
system]{.underline}\"23 and that Heidegger viewed it as another product,
with fascism, capitalism, and communism, of subjectivist metaphysics.24
This is why within metaphysically framed democracies liberalism avoids
change: while democratic elections are procedures for possible change,
liberalism is the realm within which such change presents itself through
elections, finance, and institutions. Liberal electoral results
represent humanity\'s unconditional self-legislation, in other words,
the focus on \"the I\"25 from which stems liberalism. But this vision
from a pure \"I,\" according to Heidegger, is impossible to achieve,
because

there are no experiences that ever set man beyond himself into

an unentered domain from within which man as he is up to now

could become questionable. That is---namely, that self-security---

that innermost essence of \"liberalism,\" which precisely for this
rea-son has the appearance of being able to freely unfold and to
sub-scribe to progress for all eternity. . . . Thus, it now took only a
few years for \"science\" to realize that its \"liberal\" essence and
its \"ideal of objectivity\" are not only compatible with the
political-national \"orientation\" but also indispensable to it. And
hence \"science\" as well as \"worldview\" must now unanimously agree
that the talk of a \"crisis\" of science was actually only a prattle.26

As we saw in the previous chapter[, [**such self-security** is a
consequence of]{.mark} the \"unconditional relationship\" of
[metaphysics, where \"**the present**]{.mark} **that is present to
itself [becomes the measure for all
beingness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"27 This is why, as Richard Polt
pointed out, \"[liberalism \[for Heidegger\] can go on \'progressing\'
forever precisely because its basis is static]{.underline}.\"28 Having
said this[, if the liberal worldview, capitalism\'s systemic
imperatives, and [states\' identification measures are unified
by]{.mark} static [desires of progress, control, and domination]{.mark},
**[they must also be unified in the fear of]{.mark} [possible foreign
shocks]{.mark}, disruptions, or emergencies**]{.underline}, which
Searle, Smith, Fukuyama, and Kagan express in their politics of
descriptions.

#### The intellectual foundations undergirding modernity have eroded. As accidents and catastrophes accelerate, that we live precariously perched on the apocalyptic edge renders communication itself facile and incoherent. Carving out opportunities for critical space creates the opportunity for revelatory experiences that shatter the contours of our political imagination and gesture toward alternative possibilities. 

**Featherstone 10** \[Mark Featherstone is Senior Lecturer in Sociology

"Virilio\'s Apocalypticism," *Ctheory*, 9/16/2010,
<http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/view/14787/5662>\]

[Although I would risk the claim that]{.underline} the capitalist view
of the productivity of [violence]{.underline},
[destruction]{.underline}, [and catastrophe may be **shaken by
[accidents]{.mark}** that **[threaten the coherence of the
socio-economic system]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or certainly the
environmental life support system]{.underline}]{.mark} itself, [[it is
not]{.mark} at all [clear]{.mark} that this is the case and [that
capitalism will reform its practices]{.mark} when it]{.underline} [looks
like the world is about to end]{.underline}. This is because the high
priest of neo-liberal economics, Milton Friedman \[17\], would regard
the total collapse of the socio-economic system in apocalyptic terms, as
an opportunity to re-boot the system in a more successful, more
efficient form, rather than as a wake up to reform the mode of
production in a general sense. In this respect, I think we must remain
cautious of [Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[18\] Augustinian [theory of
apocalyptic hope,]{.underline} which [parallels Girard\'s]{.underline}
\[19\] [view [that the]{.mark} contemporary [world is
balanced]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhere [[between the mimetic war of all
against all and an]{.mark} [apocalyptic turn that will usher in a new
mode of being together]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Žižek \[20\], Badiou
\[21\], and Kroker \[22\] explain, and Virilio knows all too well,
[contemporary [capitalism is itself an apocalyptic world-less
form]{.mark} **[rooted in metaphysics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, science
fiction, [[and]{.mark} the kind of [quasi]{.mark}-theological
[mysticism]{.mark} that Der Derian]{.underline} \[23\] [finds at [the
heart of the]{.mark} American
[military-industrial-media-]{.mark}entertainment
[network]{.mark}]{.underline} and the related project of virtuous war.
As such, and [because we must understand that post-modern capitalism may
well not only survive, but also profit from the end of the world, we
should recognise the importance of Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[24\]
[notions of **critical space**.]{.underline} What this idea captures is
the possibility that **[[we are]{.mark} currently [balanced on the
apocalyptic edge]{.mark} of the socio-economic system]{.underline}**,
[on the line [between violent destruction and the **extinction of
humanity as being-in-the world**, and]{.mark} the turn to a [new
ecological mode of living]{.mark} able to reconcile our identity as
natural, social, and technological beings]{.underline}.

Given this concern for the apocalyptic nature of hyper-modernity, and
Drew Burk\'s \[25\] account of Virilio as the apocalyptic thinker of
revelation, critical distance, and the scenic imagination par
excellence, I want to claim that we [should emphasise the link between
Virilio\'s concept of [critical space]{.mark} and his ideas of the
museum of accidents]{.underline} \[26\] [and more recently the
university of disaster]{.underline}. \[27\] Through these notions [he
[suggests the need to]{.mark} reveal the catastrophic nature of the
empire of speed, to [open]{.mark} up a [space for critical engagement
with our]{.mark} [culture of disaster]{.mark} that is [otherwise
prohibited by the **collapse of knowledge and thought**]{.mark} **[into
the ecstasy of communication and information]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[28\], [and ultimately to enable the turning or transformation of
global society to a more humane form.]{.underline}

I want to suggest that we should [[regard Virilio\'s
ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} of the museum of accidents \[29\] and the
university of disaster \[30\] [[as]{.mark} attempts to present [a theory
of the institutionalisation of the critique of the]{.mark} globalised
[empire of]{.mark} [speed that may tip the]{.mark} apocalyptic
[balance]{.mark} against the world-less mysticism]{.underline} of
neo-liberal post-modern capitalism [and [towards]{.mark} the
humanitarian demand for [a more liveable world]{.mark} where technology
works for humans, rather than the other way around.]{.underline} Against
what he calls the twilight of place \[31\], which condemns humanity to,
at best, a life on the move and, at worst, the living death of a
disembodied and spectral existence, Virilio shifts into reverse through
the idea of critical space that can institutionalise [[the]{.mark}
Ancient Socratic [call to \'Know Thyself\']{.mark}; such a call
[has]{.mark} been [disappeared by the culture of speed that **leaves no
time for reflection**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but remains hidden, a kind
of **unconscious supplement**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in our **world of
light speed trajectories and velocities**]{.underline}, [[awaiting the
moment when **time seems to stop** and]{.mark} **[critical thought is
possible once more]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Akin to the Freudian logic of
unearthing the hidden unconscious other side of psychic life,
[Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[32\] [notions of the critical
space]{.underline} of the museum of accidents and the university of
disaster [seek]{.underline}s [to reveal the other side of the modern
commitment to progress and development]{.underline}.

Following Aristotle, who suggested that the accident reveals the
substance and in doing so inspired western thinkers from Nietzsche,
Heidegger, Freud, Deleuze, and Derrida to think through a theory
contrasting the system and its others, [Virilio explicitly takes the
case of the accident and suggests that it has the potential to reveal
the substance or truth of the]{.underline} [modern temptation to
progress, speed, and totality]{.underline} \[33\]. Apart from revealing
this substance, as the violence and destructiveness of modernity,
especially in its hyper-active phase, it may be that what Virilio\'s
\[34\] apocalypse would also reveal would be the need for humanity to
learn a sense of humility. To accept that it is not divine, but rather a
limited earthbound species that cannot live without resistance or
gravity. The paradox of this situation is, of course, that it is
precisely humanity\'s limited nature, the fact that we are not Gods,
that has led us to reach for the skies only to plunge back down to earth
like Icarus, the tragic figure par excellence of Greek mythology.

Like Nietzsche \[35\], who was well aware of humanity\'s tragic nature,
[Virilio knows that we will always try to touch the sky. In]{.underline}
this respect I do not see him in any way as anti-modern, even though it
is possible that his critique of the excessive nature of the empire of
speed may express itself in a form of social and cultural conservatism
that is not easily reconciled with his radical critique of technology.
Instead I believe that [his problematic resides in the hubristic
forgetting of tragedy that has evolved through hyper-modernity and the
need to rehabilitate the Ancient idea of humanity as a tragic creature
of the limit that is made necessary]{.underline} and possible [by the
apocalyptic culture of post-modernism]{.underline}. This culture
simultaneously and paradoxically marks the moment when we run into the
limit of terrestrial time and space and forget about our earthbound
limited nature. In this respect my focus is less on Virilio\'s
conservatism or his desire to restrict humanity; rather I am interested
in what I perceive to be his concern to maintain the experience of the
limit in a global age where we simultaneously inhabit a state of global
fullness and completion and precisely for that reason have no sense of
that truth. It is this paradox, this conflation of the destructive
potential of completed modernity and the total inability of humanity to
understand this condition as a sign of the limitation and potential end
of its own existence, primarily because of its location or immersion in
a vortex of information that screens out critical thought and knowledge,
that forms the basis of Virilio\'s apocalypse and necessitates the
creation of institutions able to think through the end times in order to
pull us back from the brink. Herein resides the meaning of Virilio\'s
\[36\] idea of a politics of the very worst and his notion of the
accident as an inverted miracle able to radically re-orient our relation
to the world and technology.

Virilio\'s Notion of Catastrophic Modernity

For Virilio \[37\] modernity must be understood as a catastrophic epoch
which has led to what he calls a \'toposcopical disaster\' characterised
by humanity\'s inability to properly perceive the phenomenological
reality of the environment that functions as its life support system.
Against this catastrophic condition - which he tells us leads to the
psychopathological condition of the planet man who falls into
megalomania by virtue of his inability to understand his relation to the
totally mediated virtual world that has been condensed to the infinite
density of a singularity by the light speeds of new media technology -
Virilio explains that we need to find a new form of art suitable for
illustrating our condition and illuminating our apocalyptic situation.
\[38\] From this insight I think we can make two points. First, it is
methodologically significant that [[Virilio discusses the redemptive
quality of art, rather than critical theory, because]{.mark} what [this
illustrates]{.mark} is his view [that complex]{.mark} theoretical
[constructions are unlikely to impact]{.mark} upon [a high speed society
where **knowledge and**]{.mark} **[thought have been]{.mark}** more or
less **[destroyed by an excess of information and
communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The value of art
is]{.underline},]{.mark} therefore, [[that it makes an
emotional]{.underline}]{.mark}, [rather than cognitive,]{.underline}
[[impression]{.mark} upon the audience **[and causes them to
feel]{.mark}**, rather than necessarily theoretically comprehend their
situation in an epoch where [theoretical comprehension has
been]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best, marginalised, and at worst,
**[[foreclosed by the light speeds of new
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We know that Virilio \[39\]
foregrounds this methodological approach in his work because he has the
tendency to explain the ways in which his own work leaps from idea to
idea without necessarily working out the connections between theories
and concepts. The effect of this procedure is, therefore, to give the
reader first, an impression and second, an invitation to work backwards
through the theoretical connections present in his work. We can, of
course, find a precedent for this approach to critical writing, which is
perfectly symmetrical with the trajectivity of the post-modern empire of
speed, even if it does run the risk of collapsing into the vortex of
information and communication that characterises our mediated world. [We
can compare Virilio\'s thought to the German critical theorists\' notion
of the thought-image, which was similarly meant to oppose the banality
of the culture industry from the inside through the construction of
media-friendly critical bombs]{.underline}. \[40\] In the case of both
the German critical theorists, such as Adorno and Horkheimer (and to a
lesser extent Benjamin), and Virilio, I think [we can,]{.underline}
therefore, [pinpoint a notion of **[political activism,
where]{.mark}**by **[critical writing is]{.mark} itself [an artistic
activity meant to oppose the banality of tech]{.mark}nology [that simply
works for the sake of working]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and
somehow to spark critical reflection in the minds of the disorientated
and stupefied masses.]{.underline}

As Virilio \[41\] knows very well, the potential problem of this
strategy is that [it is not possible to fight speed with
speed]{.underline}. From the perspective of the Frankfurters, the threat
is that Virilio\'s user friendly critiques may be transformed into
commodities through the process of knowledge exchange on the open
market, thus becoming little more than fantastical representations of
radical critique in a globalised system that has no other. However, my
view is that [there is more to Virilio\'s]{.underline} \[42\] [turn to
critical art than the attempt to simply mimic the dynamism of the empire
of speed]{.underline}, and that it is possible to understand this
strategy in ways that render it perfectly symmetrical with his other
major radical theory, grey ecology \[43\], or the concern with the speed
limit. My view is that what [[Virilio\'s turn]{.mark} to critical art
[seeks to achieve]{.mark} is a connection to the masses caught under the
sign of light speed that is able to lift them out of the endless passage
of events and freeze time, creating [a moment of solitude,]{.mark}
concentration, contemplation, and [reflection]{.mark}, which in other
works he calls **critical space.**]{.underline} \[44\] My thesis is,
therefore, that [it is this critical space of reflection that Virilio
wants to open up in order [to]{.mark} [create the possibility of
apocalyptic transformation]{.mark} and that understanding this strategy
is key to comprehending the meaning of his political
activism]{.underline}.

This point about Virilio\'s activism is important because it shows us
that [his apocalypse is never immediate, but rather relies on the
recognition of the catastrophic nature of modernity]{.underline} that
his work may produce in the audience. It is only at this point that
Virilio\'s apocalypse, where apocalypse refers to a process of
revelation, would truly appear. Herein resides the second point about
the nature of Virilio\'s theory of the value of art for illuminating the
catastrophic nature of contemporary processes of globalisation; although
the catastrophe is always already present, and taking place as we speak,
the apocalypse is not now, and can never be now, without the revelatory
function of representation to tip the balance away from the unthinking
catastrophe of modernity that is endlessly taking place and towards the
critical ecological-phenomenological demand for a new relationship
between humanity, the world, and technology.

The apocalypse resides, therefore, in the moment of unveiling, in the
moment or event when the catastrophe becomes so apparent that it is
impossible for the audience or tele-viewer not to recognise its
representation or presentation in critical art and act upon this
recognition. Since this has not happened yet, and we remain caught up in
the end times where catastrophe is everywhere and apocalypse nowhere, we
might say that we live in the epoch of unrealised catastrophe. This is
because [the true realisation of catastrophe]{.underline}, not the basic
media representation of catastrophic events that is fed to passive
tele-viewers, but rather [[the existential realisation of the
catastrophe taking place now]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the endless
catastrophe pushing humanity and the world to the very edge of
existence, is the apocalypse]{.underline}. [[**This is the true moment
of revelation**, **that would change our relationship to**]{.mark}
**both technology and [the world forever, and demand us to actively
reformulate our way of living in the]{.mark} [world on the basis of that
revelatory experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[If this revelatory experience, this apocalyptic moment]{.underline}, is
the objective of Virilio\'s thought, I think that [we should read his
works as a history of the catastrophic nature of modernity,]{.underline}
hyper-modernity, and the emergence of the post-modern moment of
globalisation when [time and space are exhausted and there is nowhere
else to go]{.underline}. [**[As catastrophe piles upon catastrophe in a
totally mediated, totally inter-connected world where everything impacts
upon everything else]{.underline}**, [Virilio\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[45[\] [wager is that we will]{.mark} wake up to the catastrophe of
modernity realised or post-modernity and [change our
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Shifting into reverse, and
considering his now classic Speed and Politics \[46\], Virilio shows how
modernity and the obsession with speed and progress began with the
French Revolution. In his view the Revolution destroyed the immobility
of the feudal universe that had reigned more or less unchanged since
Aristotle considered the idea of the great chain of being, and
inaugurated a society and social form ordered by the principle of
futurity and modernisation. This new society was formed on the basis of
science, reason, technology, and democracy and was eventually meant to
reach its final destination in a utopia of techno-scientific reasoned
virtue. However, as Žižek \[47\] has shown in his essay on
Robespierre\'s famous \'Virtue and Terror\' speech, the revolutionaries,
who Virilio calls dromomaniacs, knew that their new society of speed,
movement, and progress could never succeed without overcoming or simply
crashing through whatever obstacles lay in its path. In this respect
Žižek highlights Robespierre\'s insight that virtue was always bound to
terror, that virtue was in fact impossible without terror, in much the
same way that Virilio foregrounds the terminal relationship between
speed and war, to show how the history of modernity, the epoch of speed,
has always been about the violent overcoming of obstacles and limits
through terrorist ballistic technologies.

This much is evident when we consider what Virilio \[48\] calls pure
war, his term for explaining the thin or even invisible line separating
war from peace in modern society. Consider the principal site of
modernity, modernisation, and speed, the city, which Virilio \[49\]
regards as a site of \'habitable circulation\'. If we think about the
city, which Mumford \[50\] tells us is the originary site of human
sociability and civilization, through the works of the Italian Futurist
artist Umberto Boccioni and the German sociologist Georg Simmel, we
enter a completely different scene to the foundational city painted by
Mumford. In Boccioni\'s The City Rises \[51\] or Simmel\'s The
Metropolis and Mental Life \[52\] we are presented with the image of the
city as a place of enormous energy and vitality, but also abstraction,
alienation, and violence.

In both cases Virilio\'s \[53\] view that the modern city is governed by
a dictatorship of movement is appropriate. There is no resting place, or
hiding place, in either Boccioni or Simmel. Moderns are fatally exposed
to speed and must learn to adjust to the new epoch. While Simmel was, of
course, critical of the new modern city of speed, because of the ways in
which it fostered a culture of distance and estrangement, Boccioni,
perhaps the master Futurist artist, thought that humanity had to evolve
to live with the new speeds of modernity. Hence his classic sculpture,
Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, can in many ways be seen as a
prefiguration of the totalitarian man captured in the writings of Ernst
Jünger \[54\], and critically discussed by Klaus Theweleit \[55\] in his
two volume psychoanalytic study of the proto-Nazi Freikorps
para-military group that terrorised Weimar Germany in the 1920s.

We know that neither Boccioni or Simmel were concerned with war in any
conventional sense; yet that they clearly relate to the modern prophets
of technological war, Marinetti, Jünger, and later the totalitarians,
Hitler and Stalin, whom Arendt \[56\] characterised by their obsession
with movement, dynamism, and the notion of violent progress towards a
pre-defined ideological utopian conclusion, is of central importance.
What this link illuminates is what Virilio \[57\] means by pure war as
the collapse of the relationship between peace and war and the
endo-colonisation of everyday life by the warrior ethos. Despite the
rejection of the violent utopianism of the totalitarians in the wake of
the discovery of the horrors of Auschwitz and the Gulag Archipelago, it
would be wrong to imagine that pure war or the obsession with speed and
movement has in any way left the scene of post-modern liberal society.
As Virilio \[58\] explains, [speed remains the hope or key utopian
principle of the west]{.underline}. He tells us that [movement is the
only law of the modern, hyper-modern, or post-modern]{.underline} [world
and that the **failure to move** is a sign of decay, decline, and
ultimately death]{.underline}.

[That the futurism of speed remains central to life]{.underline} in
western liberal and neo-liberal society [should not surprise us since
the founder of the liberal tradition]{.underline}, Thomas Hobbes
\[59[\], was himself concerned with the movement and the progress of men
through life]{.underline}. [In his political science he imagined society
as smooth Euclidean space populated by atomised men]{.underline} or
precise \'subjectiles\' bound by the rules of the road set out by the
Leviathan and expected to follow these rules on pain of death. For
Hobbes, life was a race, and a struggle for power, where power refers to
the difference between the relative speeds of men. In the context of
this situation, the rule of the Leviathan was meant to legislate against
fatal collisions. These would, in the state of nature, lead to
catastrophic accidents between men, resulting in the end of one of their
trajectories through life, immobility, and as a consequence, death
\[60\].

Beyond Virilio\'s \[61\] location of the emergence of modernity, the
epoch of speed, in the event of the French Revolution, it may well be
that we should also think about the ways in which Hobbes\' theory of the
state as traffic cop from the mid-17th century also contributed to the
origin of the new society of movement, dynamism, and progress. Here, we
may also consider how Hobbes\' work built upon the new physics of
Galileo and the theory of inertia that posited a universal law of
movement and undermined the Aristotelian orthodoxy that imagined a
universe of order, stasis, and organisation, and regarded all movement
as progress towards this natural end point. Given the radical break
between the ancient-medieval physics based upon Aristotle\'s thought and
Galileo\'s new modern paradigm that Hobbes took as a model of the
endless dynamism of early capitalist society, it is possible to see the
French Revolutionary break, which ushered in the society of the epoch of
totalitarianism, as an attempt to rediscover the ancient notion of a
telos that the Spartans and Plato had sought to defend against
Herodotus\' \[62\] notion of history, and combat the revolutionary
conditions later represented by Boccioni and Simmel.

In this way, it is possible to construct an historical time-line
explaining the emergence of the current catastrophic empire of speed
that Virilio believes has reached its limit and started to burn out
under conditions of globalisation. This time-line would run from the
historical destruction of Sparta and Plato\'s related utopian city
outlined in The Republic \[63\], evolve through Aristotle\'s theory of
movement towards natural ends, take in the destruction of Aristotle\'s
theory by Galileo and the new modern physics and Hobbes\' political
science of society as a race, before reaching Marx and the
anti-capitalist reaction to the new violent society of speed. This
anti-capitalist turn may in turn be related to the totalitarian attempts
to re-discover a modernist version of the ancient utopia of stasis,
leading finally to a consideration of the rise of post-modern
neo-liberal capitalism in the wake of the collapse of the
totalitarianisms that has liberated speed from all ideas of limitation.

The central point about the end of this time-line is, of course, that
the post-modern neo-liberal liberation of speed from all ideas of
limitation, where ideas of limitation refer to either utopian ends or
social speed limits such as trade regulations meant to govern the
movement of capital, is evidence of the hubris and the forgetting of
tragedy that Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Virilio all see as the core
problematic of the modern society of nihilism, technology, and speed
\[64\]. In each case I think it is possible to argue that [Nietzsche and
Heidegger, and now Virilio, recognise that the inability of humanity to
appreciate the necessary phenomenological resistance of the world upon
its movement and speed will produce catastrophic consequences in the
form of the emergence of a last man bored by a technological world that
he can no longer relate to and that completely prohibits his continued
movement through space]{.underline}. This is, of course, the famous
theory of inertia that Virilio \[65\] employs to show how the empire of
speed has started to collapse into a society of immobility and stasis
characterised by walls, borders, camps, and prisons that he generalises
through the ideas of global foreclosure, incarceration, and lock down.

In this new global crash culture, where the ideology of global
capitalism talks about freedom of movement and works off the idea that
increased proximity in a society where it is impossible to evade the
other will lead to more love, sharing, and community, Virilio\'s \[66\]
point is that reality is defined by surveillance, suspicion, paranoia,
security, hatred, petty jealousy, revulsion towards the other, and
ultimately pure war. This, then, is the catastrophe of the empire of
speed without limits. This is the catastrophe awaiting a revelatory
moment to transform it into an apocalyptic event that may enable us to
enact radical, revolutionary, change. [The challenge
remains]{.underline}, of course, [to find some way to produce this
apocalyptic moment, to produce this moment of revelation, through
artistic endeavour and critical thought in a society of speed where
everything is reduced to the status of information, communication, and
commodity to be exchanged and passed on]{.underline}. In other words,
there is no apocalyptic moment in the empire of speed because the empire
of speed is defined by what we might variously call following Kroker
\[67\] and Wilson \[68\] post-modern, virtual, hyper, or
supercapitalism.

[In the hyper-capitalist world, if we choose to adopt Kroker\'s name for
the new form of high speed]{.underline}, high tech, totally virtual
capitalism, there is no telos, [[there is no apocalyptic end]{.mark}, no
fatal moment of collapse, since]{.underline}, as Wilson \[69\] points
out, [[death is distributed across the system]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
this vision of the new capitalist world, [[mortality invades every
aspect of life in the form]{.mark} of a death drive that compares to
Virilio\'s concept of [pure war]{.mark}]{.underline} \[70\] which shows
how **[[war is no longer contained in a discrete event, but rather
exists everywhere, nowhere, and is at the same time never and always
on]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For Virilio \[71\] **[this death drive is
[explained by America\'s attachment to the idea of the
frontier]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, or]{.mark} what he calls, citing
Jackson, the frontier effect, which [has led the land of the free
towards a form of nihilism set on the destruction of the environment for
the sake of development]{.underline}, modernisation, progress, and
creation of what Deleuze and Guattari \[72\] call smooth space. That is
to say that **[[the American determination to
conquer]{.underline}]{.mark}** or overcome obstacles, to create smooth
space suitable for the speed of movement for capital and human flows, in
many respects **[[reproduces Hobbes\' capitalist metaphysics of
legalised movement]{.underline}]{.mark}** in real space. [It is this
innovation that transforms the phenomenological world of embodied
experience into a metaphysical or virtual abstraction that
humans]{.underline}, or perhaps we should say those post-humans plugged
into the network society, [experience through inter-face with
technology]{.underline}. Virilio\'s \[73\] America, the land of
Hobbesian materialist metaphysics realised, is for this reason
comparable to Baudrillard\'s \[74\] Nietzschean land of fascinated
banality. It exists as a land of deserts, a featureless landscape, a
smooth Euclidean space, that has come to define post-modern
globalisation as a catastrophic space awaiting the arrival of its
apocalypse.

What is more is that we know that the apocalypse is on the American
mind. Consider the born again Christian fundamentalists. They understand
the endless war in the Middle East, the lands of deserts, Iraq, the
birth place of human culture and civilization, and Armageddon, the site
of the final battle between the forces of good and evil, as the scene of
the coming apocalypse where the saved will be separated from the damned
and the world will learn what America already knows, that it is the land
of God. Again we can discern the strange virtualisation of the world,
which Virilio \[75\] understands as characteristic of the light speeds
of globalisation, where metaphysics and theology stand in for politics,
define the direction of our world, and set the scene for an apocalyptic
moment that will transform the basic co-ordinates of human reality.
Unfortunately, the contemporary American apocalypse, which updates
Winthrop\'s theory of the city upon the hill in popular and official
culture ranging from Tim LaHaye\'s Left Behind \[76\] books to the Bush
regime\'s PNAC, is not the apocalypse imagined by Virilio \[77\].
Whereas his theory suggests creating speed limits or a \'political
economy of speed\' in order to enable humans to live together in the
world, [[the American]{.mark} vision of the [apocalypse is about
destroying what little environmental resistance there is left in the
world in order to completely liberate humanity from its reliance on
natural life support systems.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In practical terms [this is,]{.underline} of course, [about spreading
the American way, and]{.underline} perhaps [military]{.underline},
economic, and cultural [imperialism]{.underline}, but what is important
about Virilio\'s vision is that it enables us to understand that
**[[behind the commitment to practical principles of freedom]{.mark},
individualism, [democracy, capitalism, and technology resides a
metaphysical imperative to salvation through
virtualisation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Paraphrasing Virilio
paraphrasing Heidegger who noted that [technology]{.underline} cannot be
understood technologically but rather [must be thought
metaphysically]{.underline}, it may be the case that [we cannot
understand the American-led process of globalisation politically or
economically, but instead must think]{.underline} about it
[metaphysically]{.underline} in terms of speed and the death drive
towards virtuality. This view, which describes the way Virilio \[78\]
understands processes of globalisation and the creation of the
dromosphere is certainly supported by [Der Derian\'s]{.underline} \[79\]
[theory of virtuous war.]{.underline} Der Derian\'s theory [explains a
mode of pure war, slimmed down in terms of its understanding
of]{.underline} [political complexity in order to meet the needs of
speed]{.underline}, so that the world is divided along the lines of Carl
Schmitt\'s \[80\] violent friend / foe dichotomy where the virtuous
chosen people face off against the evil others who are set to burn in
Hell in an apocalyptic fight to the death, and transformed into a media
abstraction by high technology, [which virtualises reality, making the
environment subordinate to the smooth spaces of the map]{.underline}.
For Der Derian \[81\], [America]{.underline}, the land of apocalyptic
virtuous war, [[the mode of pure war]{.mark} that fuses a theological
belief in]{.underline} [virtue with a high tech commitment to
virtuality, [was always fated to take this]{.mark} road]{.underline}.
[It was]{.underline}, after all, [named after Amerigo Vespucci, the
great cartographer-explorer, and has always been the land of maps and
the refusal of the world]{.underline}.

Introduction

As I argued in Chapter 1, much of international theory is predicated
upon an understanding of certain boundaries, both conceptual and
practical. International theorists typically attempt to differentiate
the international from the set of intra-state interactions. Here we have
the reification of a particular image of the bounded nineteenth-century
European sovereign, each master of its own territory, projected back and
forward in time -- an aspect of what R. B. J. Walker calls the discourse
of eternity. The domestic condition of hierarchy is contrasted with an
international ahistorical condition of anarchy between states.

Lately, [there is an opposing attempt in international theory to
theorize the hierarchical stratification of the international system.
This attempt includes aspects of]{.underline} the English School and
[social constructivism]{.underline}, but especially observed in the work
of David Lake or John Ikenberry. Each of these approaches emphasizes the
specific diffusion of social norms or the emergence of authority
relationships that call into question the pristine construction of the
hierarchy/anarchy dichotomy so prevalent in realist/neorealist theories.

Nonetheless, these [approaches typically remain
Western-centric]{.underline}. **[[They assume]{.mark} that [norm]{.mark}
[diffusion is a one-way street]{.mark}]{.underline}**: specifically,
[they assume [that the periphery remains a **passive**]{.mark}
**[receptor of norms that]{.mark} have historically [emerged in the
West]{.mark}**. In other words, such [approaches to the **theorization
of international hierarchy** do not take into account]{.mark} the
historical and [contemporary]{.mark} **imbrications**, [**feedbacks**,
**reverberations**]{.mark} **of political, social [and]{.mark}
institutional norms and [practices that were experimented on in]{.mark}
what were/are the ([neo)imperial lab]{.mark}oratorie[s]{.mark} that make
up the significant parts of the global order**]{.underline}.

What I have attempted to show in the preceding chapters is that we need
to be much more attuned to the multidirectional reverberations that
result from conditions of domination (particular historical forms of
formal and informal imperialism) that have profound effects on domestic
institutions and practices.

To return to Hoffmann's point made in 1959, [**[international theory
must be attentive to what "cuts]{.mark} [across" states]{.mark}** [and
not simply]{.mark} the [interactions between
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By tracing the ways in which **imperial
governance** resulted in **experiments** and **innovations of
violence**, social control and new forms of socioeconomic]{.underline}s,
[we can observe the extent to which such subordinated spaces have
historically possessed forms of agency that "cut across" and into the
"inside" of great powers.]{.underline}

The previous three chapters examined the conjunction between historical
changes in the international system and the effects that occurred
throughout not only the global periphery but also the center. While I
have stressed three different themes that remain crucial for
international theory -- namely violence, social control or security and
political economy -- my focus has been on demonstrating the links
between international changes (i.e. imperial or hegemonic periods of
crisis beginning in the nineteenth century) and the "management" of
subaltern and Western populations. Instead of emphasizing the effects
that such international changes have on systemic configurations, the
number of poles in the international system, for example, or, more
generally, on statecraft or foreign policy, I have shown how the
materialization of the camp, [the colonial surveillance state and
neoliberalization were significantly affected by the transnational
diffusions taking place across shifting imperial or hegemonic
networks]{.underline}. The nineteenth-century experimentation with
violence in imperial Africa, the colonization of the American West, and
the tectonic shifts in imperial geopolitics during the latter part of
the nineteenth century have had fateful implications for the
materialization of the concentration camp and the violence perpetuated
within Europe during the Second World War; concerns about internal
threats in newly industrialized European nation-states provoked the
emergence of a modern surveillance state that adapted techniques and
technologies developed in imperial domains; the neoliberalization of the
global South during the course of the 1970s proved significant for the
reassertion of American hegemony, a political project that would be
pushed forward by the adoption of a similar neoliberalization in the
United States and the United Kingdom. Subordinated peripheries are not
passive receptors of norms devised in the imperial West; historically
they have proved to be significant "laboratories of modernity" where
imperial agents could experiment, innovate and "discover" novel modes
and technologies of governing that would undoubtedly prove problematic,
at least initially, to implement directly within the metropole. As I
have argued in Chapter 1, we should understand the metaphor of the
laboratory in the Latourian sense. According to Latour, [by forcing the
social world to conform to its requirements, the laboratory becomes the
vector for defining the parameters of legitimate political and
social]{.underline} [action]{.underline}. In an analogous way, [the
(neo)imperial laboratory defines the contours of valid social and
political governance]{.underline}. [[What gets developed]{.mark},
innovated and experimented on [in the crucibles of imperial domains
becomes perceived as "tried and true"]{.mark} practice, [especially in
response to conditions of political]{.mark}, social or economic
[crisis]{.mark}. In this way, [the imperial lab]{.mark}oratory
[normalizes new forms of violence]{.mark}, social control, and the
reorganization of domestic politico-economic institutions.]{.underline}

Thus the linkages between the international, the domestic, the
peripheral and the metropole are much deeper and intense than
international theorists usually accept. They involve processes of
horizontal as well as vertical diffusion of norms and practices, of
material assemblages that connect hierarchical relations between
periphery and metropole. However, the relevance of uncovering these
processes of co-constitution between metropole and periphery is not just
for a deeper awareness of the historical implications of imperial
international relations. As I started off describing in the
Introduction, [[the Global War on Terror is]{.mark} itself [a]{.mark}n
intensified contemporary [moment of neoimperial experimentation]{.mark}
with significant reverberations not only for the United States itself
but also across a wide array of Western states.]{.underline} This is not
to say that the processes of militarization of the domestic space
underway are novel or specific to the United States. As the epigraphs to
this chapter show, the militarization of policing is a long-term process
that can be traced back to the American involvement in the Philippines
(as McCoy has shown) and is something that is also occurring beyond the
United States, for example in France (as Mathieu Rigouste has also
shown).

What is perhaps novel about our contemporary period, however, is that
**[our [traditional spatial definitions]{.mark} [that delineate the
applicability of specific forms of violence are becoming]{.mark}
increasingly [difficult to maintain]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Carlos
Galli argues, **[[the very notions of internal and]{.mark}
[external]{.mark} vis-à-vis state control over [territory have
essentially lost their meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**.3 "**[In the
global age]{.underline}**," Galli argues: **[[modern political
spatiality]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [the State, with all its right and
its ability to enclose an internal sphere with order and security,
creating a space where "not everything can happen" -- **[has ceased to
be fully in effect]{.mark}**, challenged as it is by the power of
economic flows and the needs of capital,]{.underline} [which demand a
new politics and which no longer allow the State to be the operative
center of political reality and its interpretation]{.underline}.4

**[[Threats can no longer be properly demarcated]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(if they ever were completely) according to a fixed spatial
configuration (i.e. **[[the]{.mark} traditional [cartography of]{.mark}
the [Westphalian]{.mark} order of [states]{.mark}]{.underline}**). [What
[we]{.mark} [end up with]{.mark} is a [global]{.mark} form of "[Empire"
possessing neither "**interior**]{.mark}**ity**" [nor
"**external**]{.mark}" [edges, **laced with a shifting multiplicity of
borders**]{.mark}]{.underline}, center-less and unstable. What emerges
is a planetary condition in which this:

[[global Empire \[is\] locked in a struggle against
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}, [against anomalous functions that exist
within it.]{.underline} In short, it [is an Empire whose inner
discontinuity produces conflicts that, no]{.underline} [matter where or
how they are generated, all have local status, and all of which also
fall immediately --]{.underline} with unforeseeable effects -- [into the
Whole]{.underline}.5

An effect of this effacement of any notions of inside and outside --
something, for example, Carl Schmitt recognized long ago -- is that, as
Galli puts it, "the Enemy today presents himself as the Disturber, the
specter of all that is internal and domestic -- as our own wicked
caricature, our Double, our Shadow."[6 [It is the persistent fear that
an amorphous enemy infiltrates the polity, undermining it through
persistent]{.mark} and ubiquitous [subversion that conditions a
specific]{.mark} governmental [response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This concluding chapter thus explores some of the nascent consequences
of these (neo)imperial experiences during the better part of a decade of
the Global War on [Terror, in light of a novel form of spatiality that
progressively effaces distinctions between internal and external,
metropole and periphery]{.underline}. **[[Experimentation may well occur
in Iraq or Afghanistan and reverberate back into the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [but [urban]{.mark} [American environments
may also become lab]{.mark}oratorie[s]{.mark} [for testing different
techniques]{.mark} and technologies by a state that no longer entirely
differentiates inside from outside. What defines the intensified
proliferation of military techniques and technologies at "home" and
"abroad" is a concern with the long-term maintenance of American
authority.7]{.underline} [What [this results in]{.mark} is [a]{.mark}
consistent [hollowing out of liberal]{.mark}-democratic [institutions
and the decaying]{.mark} civic [participation]{.mark} [of the
population]{.mark} largely [perceived as]{.mark} being [a threat]{.mark}
to state authority.]{.underline} As Sheldon Wolin puts it, "the
superimposition of empire and democracy, the corruption of
representative government, the declining status of the citizen, the
hegemonic status of American power in the world -- suggest that the
traditional categories of citizen, democracy, state and power
desperately need reformulation."8

### FW -- Framed Democracy 

#### Framework is a politics of description \-\-- try or die for using the debate space to theorize and positively interpret alternative ontological frames

Bubble: Neoliberalism and the Politics of Knowledge," *new formations: a

Thought Bubble

The Ernst & Young report quotes one anonymous university Vice-Chancellor
declaring: 'Our major competitor in ten years time will be Google ... if
we're still alive!' This quote supposedly encapsulates changes to our
relation to knowledge indicative of the two drivers of change which the
report calls 'digital technologies' and 'democratization'. The reason
why these two are related is because the report understands
democratisation simply in terms of 'access' and then assumes the flawed
syllogism whereby because digital technologies make knowledge accessible
and democracy is about access, therefore all digital technologies are
democratic. It would be foolish to suggest that a report citing 'the
Darwinian force of the market'33 could countenance the idea that
democracy ought to be measured by something other than consumer-style
access, but access in and of itself is not inherently democratic. Much
like 'excellence' it requires secondary criteria to become a meaningful
concept. Admittedly the report does avoid the positivist trap that users
of Google can easily fall into, of assuming that knowledge is simply
'out there', such that its acquisition is merely a matter of data
retrieval. The author of the report does link knowledge to analysis and
interpretation, but [[given]{.mark} that [we are asked to bend our knee
to]{.mark} 'the]{.underline} [Darwinian [force of the market']{.mark},
one suspects that [analysis]{.mark} and interpretation is of a kind
with]{.underline} [that found in the pages of the Financial Times and
[**will be limited to debates over best policy within a given system**,
**rather than any ontological engagement with the character and shape of
the world itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The Google model is, however, exemplary of the problem faced by the
post-historical university and the nature of its democratic role.
Leaving aside the rather obvious point that in the pursuit of profit
Google have quite happily aided the Chinese government in their
restriction of the democracy movement in that country, the Google model
is significant because its success is based on successfully attending to
and facilitating the personalisation that has come to define both
democracy and knowledge in neoliberal consumer cultures. Google's
success has primarily come from its ability to provide a highly
individualised service, partly due to the capacity of its search engine
to learn what the user likes and to display results that are closely
aligned to preferences indicated through earlier 'click signals'; but
this has also been a path to monetisation as the company is able to
claim that it can deliver customers to companies with impressive
precision. In an economy increasingly based on information, attention
becomes a very rare commodity,34 so the ability to deliver attention to
advertisers becomes a highly profitable capability. The capacity for
Google to archive click signals affords increasingly successful searches
without additional work from the user and provides a profile that
companies can attach themselves to in their search for consumers. \[End
Page 84\]

[While this mode of information retrieval sits well with all the
neoliberal markers of value]{.underline} - [individuality, preference,
choice, competition, immediacy - it gives rise to significant
concerns]{.underline} [for both knowledge and democracy that must not be
ignored]{.underline}. In a fascinating book entitled The Filter Bubble,
Eli Pariser sets out the implications of the Google algorithm.
Initially, while the idea that what is best for one person may not be
best for someone else is hardly revolutionary, the idea that a search
engine is 'biased to share our own views'35 has far-reaching
consequences. In short, 'your computer monitor is a kind of one-way
mirror, reflecting your own interests while algorithmic observers watch
what you click' (Filter Bubble, p3). Here, access is instant and
individualised, but Pariser is concerned that where 'democracy requires
a reliance on shared facts \[...\] we're being offered parallel but
separate universes' (Filter Bubble, p5). While it is important to argue
that "facts" are not enough, shared or not, the problem is accentuated
because the search engine, which is now a 'prediction engine' (Filter
Bubble, p9), has a tendency to search out 'facts' you have already
indicated a preference for through click signals. Ultimately the cookies
and bots that aid personalised web-browsing begin to produce a filter
bubble: 'a unique universe of information for each of us', but more
importantly one that 'fundamentally alters the way we encounter ideas
and information' (Filter Bubble, p9). In other words, the Google model
is one in which we continually receive more of what we already know and
have indicated a preference for. Ultimately, the filter bubble is 'a
cozy place, populated by our favourite people and things and ideas'
(Filter Bubble, p12).

Pariser notes that while this personalisation flatters users who believe
they are in a position of control because the prediction engine appears
to be giving them what they want, it increasingly subjects users 'to a
kind of informational determinism in which what you clicked on in the
past determines what you see next' (Filter Bubble, p16). This mode of
personalised access means that Google does have great significance for
the post-historical university, but that significance does not lie in
the claim that Google University is the future as Ernst & Young would
have us believe. Rather, the Google model is significant because the two
forces of impact and customer service suggest that **[[the
post-historical university will]{.mark} increasingly [take on the
character of a filter bubble]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [As research is
increasingly directed towards what are described to be the needs of
the]{.underline} [current system, and teaching is tailored to satisfying
the existing desires and preferences of]{.underline} [students refigured
as customers]{.underline}, the university's role in the global knowledge
economy will be to offer more of the same. [[The university has always
had a major role to play in maintaining the]{.mark} cultural
[s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark} and [policing knowledge]{.mark}, but it has
also historically been a major site for the social production of
dissensus which is irreducible to the promotional language of
'innovation']{.underline} and 'entrepreneurialism' (or any historical
equivalent thereof). Ultimately the sole purpose of the Ernst & Young
report is to ensure that the university of the future plays an integral
part in the production of an 'identity loop' (Filter Bubble, p127), or
what we might call a thought bubble that reproduces the truth of market
logic.

[In the face of this doctrinal onslaught the future of the university as
a social institution looks bleak, but]{.underline} despite the
heavy-handed ideological work that the Ernst & Young report epitomises,
[the future cannot be closed off in the way they hope]{.underline}. As
was noted in the introduction, the rationality of markets was shown to
be a pseudo-science by the persistence and the effects of what Besley
and Hennessey called the 'psychology of herding'. First of all this
produced the hysterical delusion that the business cycle had been
overcome, which was then counteracted by the global loss of confidence
that brought about the greatest economic crisis in living memory. \[End
Page 85\] The evident role played by these 'animal spirits' testifies to
the importance of a non-theoretical, non-rational relation to the world,
but also to a more profound ontological state of mind that Heidegger
refers to as 'attunement' or 'mood'.36 Ordinarily that attunement is an
unremarkable and comfortable familiarity, but one that might become a
concerted defence in times of crisis. Fluctuations in mood are usually
accompanied by stories that tell us something about the world we live
in. With regards to the world of economics these are stories that
precipitate trust, confidence, euphoria, frenzy, fear, and anxiety.37
These spirits and the stories that shape them are evidence of the
continuing hermeneutic condition set out above. [Stories make a world of
sense, but they are only ever interpretations and remain subject to the
vagaries of moo]{.underline}d.

[The narrative of neoliberal post-history can claim to be the rightful
representation of human relations only because it is underwritten by
gigantic economic, political and social power that]{.underline}
[supports and distributes its stories, not because it has discovered the
truth]{.underline}. In such an environment, [**[academics]{.mark}
regularly [articulate concern about the utilitarian]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}if not **[instrumental mood, of managers and students
alike]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the discourses of impact and
customer service further support such instrumentality and suggest that
the university of the future will increasingly help lock down the
narrative of post-history, **[[there is still
hope]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In keeping with Heidegger's (in)famous use
of Hölderlin's words: 'But where danger is, grows/The saving power
also',38 the pressures on students to achieve a certain GPA or class of
degree and the demands on them to be socially compliant, still does not
eradicate their sense that **[[the world is
contestable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In many cases the mood of
[students]{.underline} remains one of scepticism and doubt towards the
supposed common sense, coupled with a desire for change. They [remain
interested in the big questions and readily support courses that make
great theoretical demands on them.]{.underline} Students tend to be of
an age when the sedimented world they have inherited has not yet
ossified and all kinds of malformations and reformations remain
possible. This means that [[an important role can still be played by the
university]{.mark}; [not]{.mark} one that is [reduced to increasing
access to what is]{.mark} already [given]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} one that
**[opens up spaces for this contestation and challenging of the
world]{.mark}, for [offering]{.mark} up [radically alternative ways of
living and being-with-others]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

As was noted in the introduction, the [humanities have an especially
important role to play in this regard. While traditional humanities
disciplines]{.underline} such as philosophy, English, and history [have
all supported social and political conservatism through]{.underline},
amongst other things, [the defence of a canon, [these disciplines
have]{.mark} also [been]{.mark} traditionally [concerned with that **gap
between the meaningful and meaninglessness that defines the human
condition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whether a philosophical treatise, a
work of literature, or the recovery of a counter-history[, [work in the
humanities has always occupied that space where the **meaningful
totality we call our world suffers**]{.mark} **a variety of
[disruptions]{.mark} and [is revealed to be
inadequate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[The humanities are never more
alive than when faced with the loss of an established truth and the
slipping away of the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Some of the greatest
works in the humanities are riddled with anxiety]{.underline}. [It
therefore falls on the humanities in a time of crisis to enable anxiety
to work in the name of alternative visions, which is precisely why the
humanities are under such strident attack within the marketised model.
This is also a role that ought to be taken beyond the campus to form the
beginnings of a new contract with a public that has just bailed out
private speculators at the expense of public welfare]{.underline}.
Turning away from the anxiety generated by the crisis will only
encourage more of the same. [[**The public role of the university should
be to ensure this anxiety**, **understood as the re-emergence of the
questioning that neoliberal post-history continually seeks to suppress,
is turned to creative use**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

ON WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2004, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. Bush awarded the
National Humanities Medal to, among others, John Searle. In this
beautiful ceremony at the White House, Searle was honored for his
\"efforts to deepen understanding of the human mind, for using his
writings to shape modern thought, defend reason and objectivity, and
define debate about the nature of artificial intelligence.\"1 What is
most interesting about the awarding of this prize is not that Searle
accepted it but rather [what sort of philosophy is endorsed by a
president who had both just invaded a country contrary to the desires of
the majority of the world\'s population]{.underline} and restricted the
fundamental civil rights of his own citizens. While Searle\'s
justifications for accepting a prize from such a source might run from a
need for national recognition to a feeling of personal accomplishment,
the prize itself is appropriate to his philosophical position, which
represents **[[a politics of descriptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** as [the
latest development at the service of power]{.underline}.

[A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate
as a philosophy]{.underline}; [rather, it [is]{.mark} functional for
[the continued existence of a society of dominion]{.mark}, which
[pursues truth in the form of imposition]{.mark}]{.underline}
[([violence]{.underline}), [conservation]{.underline}
([realism]{.underline}]{.mark}), [and triumph]{.underline} (history).
[[These **metaphysically framed**]{.mark} **political [systems hold that
society must direct itself according to truth]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(the existing paradigm), [that is[, **in favor of the strong against the
weak**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only [the strong determine
truth]{.underline}, [because they are the only ones that have the tools
to know, practice, and]{.underline} [impose it]{.underline}.
[Philosophers]{.underline} like Searle, just as Plato, Hegel, or Tarski,
for example, [do not want their philosophies to dominate]{.underline},
[but in fact they help maintain a society in which they
find]{.underline} [themselves at ease]{.underline}---[that is, in which
they have become more or less conscious servants of the dominant
political class]{.underline}. [But what is most significant is not that
philosophers have been serving the dominant political powers but that
the need for dominion often results in metaphysical
thought]{.underline}. Metaphysics is an aspect and a consequence of
dominion, not its cause.

[**[Although legislators, politicians, and ownership classes need all
members of a society to follow their imposed paradigm]{.mark}**, **such
[paradigms cannot be sustained without the support of the intellectual
community]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} If, among all the
disciplines, [[the empirical sciences]{.mark} have [maintained a central
role within the structures of power]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is not
because they manage to obtain better results but [because [they
represent the greatest fulfillment of the essence of
metaphysics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} essence [consists in
revealing the ultimate truthful context of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[subject matter under analysis]{.mark}, which can vary from the
intrinsically materialist nature of physical reality to the theological
meaning of divine commands]{.underline}. Regardless of the subject
matter, the search for objective truth came to condition not only these
philosophers but also those different sectors of culture whose progress
should not be measured objectively. Richard Rorty (who for the past
thirty years fought against this objectivist tradition) indicated how
[[the \"Newtonian physical scientist]{.mark},\"]{.underline} since the
Enlightenment, [[became the \"model of the
intellectual]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [from whom social reforms were
requested]{.underline}. But the problem with [this
intellectual]{.underline} is that he [centered these reforms only around
\"objective knowledge of what humans beings are like---not knowledge of
what Greeks or Frenchmen or Chinese are like, but of humanity as
such.\"]{.underline}2 As we can see, **[[the search for universal truth
became an imposition on individual differences and
identities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Derrida, following Nietzsche and Heidegger, indicates how [this
metaphysical nature of philosophy has not only structured knowledge in
terms of established polarities (presence vs. absence]{.underline},
[truth vs. error, mind vs. matter, good vs. evil, man vs. woman) but
also produced a hierarchical order in a way that always favors the first
term over the second.]{.underline} In sum, by determining Being as
presence, Western philosophy has become a simple set of descriptions of
the present state of affairs and automatically privileges terms of
temporal, spatial, and unified present- ness over their opposites. This
is why Heidegger explained that \"insofar as the pure relationship of
the I-think-unity (basically a tautology) becomes the unconditioned
relationship, the present that is present to itself becomes the measure
for all beingness.\"3 Although these sets of measurable descriptions
took very different approaches throughout the history of philosophy
(from the Platonic realm of pure forms, to Kant\'s transcendental
conditions of experience, to Marx\'s inevitable movement of history),
the philosopher was committed to considering Being always as a
motionless, nonhistorical, and geometric object, operating just like the
European sciences (which Husserl declared to be in crisis). In order to
assure its progress within society, [**[philosophy]{.underline}**,
[**through its metaphysical obsession with truth**, **dissolved into the
sciences**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, that is, [into the **global
organization of all beings within a predictable structure of causes and
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As we can see, especially since the Enlightenment, when the empirical
sciences were given priority because of their access to Nature,
[philosophy became a scientific enterprise, leaving aside the wider
realms from which philosophic problems arise]{.underline}. For this
reason, prominent philosophers such as W. V. O. Quine can declare that
\"philosophy of science is philosophy enough,\"4 and now Searle, with
other contemporary metaphysical philosophers, tries to submit philosophy
to scientific methods or, as Rorty indicated, to \"the secure path of
science.\"5 But by submitting thought to the secure path of science (or
to truth in general), [[contemporary]{.mark} analytic and continental
[philosophies have fallen back into \"**realism**,]{.mark}\" that is,
[into the **simple analysis and conservation of facts**]{.mark} in order
to help scientific disciplines develop]{.underline}, which was already
the main concern of the Enlightenment. However, in doing so, [philosophy
evades what has been one of its most important tasks: suggesting
alternative, different, or innovative possibilities]{.underline}.
[[Philosophy is not a disengaged, contemplative, or neutral
reception]{.underline}]{.mark} of an objects [[but]{.mark} rather [the
practice of an interested, projected, and active
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[In]{.mark} this return to
\"reality,\" through [the complete neutralization of
differences]{.mark}, [philosophy becomes]{.mark} not only conservative
but also [a servant of the strongest political power]{.mark} (in this
case the American-style neoliberally framed democracies), which in turn
maintains philosophy]{.underline}. It must have been for these reasons
that Heidegger noticed, already in the early 1930s, how it did not take
long for \" \'science\' to realize that its \'liberal\' essence and its
\'ideal of objectivity\' are not only compatible with the
political-national \'orientation\' but also indispensable to it [The
national \'organization\' of science moves along the same lines as the
\'American\' \" organization of science]{.underline}.6

Although many philosophers believe this critique (of the bond be-tween
the objectivist goals of the sciences and the prevailing political power
or, which is the same, the foundation of politics on truth) only began
with Heidegger, Kuhn, and Derrida, already at the beginning of the
twentieth century Spengler, Popper, and others were sounding the alarm
about the dangers that came from spreading Enlightenment-style
scientific objectivism to all the disciplines. Classic texts such as
Spengler\'s The Decline of the West (1918-1922), Popper\'s The Open
Society and Its Enemies (1945), and even Arendt\'s The Origins of
Totalitarianism (1951) were concerned with the rationalization of the
world, a rationalization that we are witnessing today at a much more
profound level. Although all these texts did accuse the Enlightenment,
it was Adorno and Horkheimer, in their Dialectic of Enlightenment
(1947), who explicitly stated that the \"enlightenment is totalitarian\"
in order to indicate how [[the disastrous world wars of the twentieth
century were rooted in its development]{.underline}]{.mark}.7 But [[the
most important feature of these classic alarms over the politics of
descriptions is not a belief that objectivism is **erroneous, fallible,
or untrue** but rather that it is **unjust**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
other words, a murderous attack on ethics, freedom, and democracy. [The
\"total subordination of reason to metaphysical reality]{.underline},\"
declared Herbert Marcuse, \"[prepares the way for racist
ideology]{.underline}.\"8 It is not an accident that all these classic
texts appeared at the same time that Claude Levi-Strauss was producing
his anthropological studies, that is, when encounters with different
cultures provided a starting point for the theoretical decentralization
of European civilization.

The goal of this first chapter is to remind the realistic strain of
contemporary philosophy that Popper\'s, Adorno\'s, and Benjamin\'s
alarms against scientific objectivism and realism were also directed
against future metaphysical inclinations. [We also seek to indicate the
authoritarian political meaning of this realism]{.underline} into which
philosophers such as Searle have fallen. Heidegger, who can be
considered the first to demand an explicit return to the ontological
nature of philosophy against scientific or phenomenological inquiries,
was not only criticizing the oppressive objective impositions of truth
seeking but also indicating what metaphysics left out: the forgotten
Being. Against the majority of Heidegger\'s interpreters, we believe
that this did not demand a deeper scientific search for the \"object\"
of Being but rather a recollection of the oppressed history of
metaphysics, what Derrida called \"the margins of philosophy\" and
Benjamin \"the tradition of the oppressed.\" [It is in this forgotten,
defeated, and different history that one can find the victims of the
politics of descriptions]{.underline}---[and probably also an
emancipation from it.]{.underline} Also, it should not be considered an
accident that most of these antiobjectivist authors (Popper, Benjamin,
and Adorno) wrote these texts against Western rationality in exile, in
other words, in a condition of exclusion and foreignness. But [why are
we able today to expose the history, reasons, and politics of the
weak]{.underline}? [Certainly not because we have found the appropriate
representation of truth]{.underline}. Rather, [after the deconstruction
of metaphysics performed mainly by]{.underline} Heidegger and Derrida[,
**[it is no longer possible to impose truth without
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [that is, to force the rational results
obtained by the dominating civilization.]{.underline}

[The paradigmatic example of these politics of descriptions is
represented not only by centuries of oppressive colonialism but also by
the recent failure of the American capitalist system all over the
world]{.underline}. While the economic and military consequences of
metaphysically framed democracy will be examined in the second chapter,9
we will now venture into three essential theoretical features of the
politics of descriptions: the violence of truth, the conservative nature
of realism, and the winner\'s history.

### Alt -- Featherstone 

#### The alternative affirms a transvaluation and complete re-understanding of the aura of objects -- such a psychological shift produces space that can conceive of objects as more than "a means to an end", whereas voting affirmative consigns us to an information-gorged society that can only produce nihilism and despair 

**Featherstone 15** \[Mark Featherstone is Senior Lecturer in Sociology
at Keele University, UK, his areas of specialism are social and
political thought and psychoanalysis, THEORY BEYOND THE CODES,
"Einstein\'s Nightmare, On Bernard Stiegler\'s Techno-Dystopia,"
*Ctheory*, 2015,
<http://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/ctheory/article/view/14787/5662>\]

Here, I think we can see Stiegler\'s reliance on the work of Adorno and
Horkheimer, whose concept of consumption in their Dialectic of
Enlightenment is based on a fusion of Marx and Freud. Adorno and
Horkheimer explain that the reason we consume is to fill out the lack or
emotional void left by the sadism of the technological capitalist system
that alienates, estranges, and objectifies us. As Einstein\'s Nightmare
reveals, individuals turn to things and objects, because there are no
people, and the people there are become competitors whom the individual
absolutely cannot relate to in a meaningful way. But in this situation
the capitalist object never achieves the sacred quality of Winnicott\'s
transitional object because it is always on the move, on the verge of
obsolescence, and being-wasted by a techno-system that has to keep
producing newness and novelty in order to maintain the rate of the
consumer\'s consumption, which is ultimately a search for escape from
the horror of his or her lack relative to the monstrous perfection of
the machine. Unfortunately the consumer will never escape through the
capitalist object, or what Marx called the commodity, because today,
under conditions of late capitalism, the object has no magical aura.
Unlike Marx\'s commodity, where the object was able to move by itself,
the value of the object in late or neoliberal capitalism is cancelled by
the destruction of (first) spiritual and (second) symbolic value in the
turn to instrumental rationality, which means that the only meaningful
symbols are zeroes and ones. This is why the [only meaning of the object
in Stiegler\'s late capitalist society revolves around sadistic value,
or what]{.underline} Arthur [Kroker and]{.underline} Michael [Weinstein
call \"abuse\" value]{.underline} \[50\] \-- I am either above or below
the other on the basis of whether I own or do not own the object \-- but
even this base mode of valuation is momentary in that it is endlessly
cancelled by the condition of spiritual and symbolic misery.

Essentially, this is what Stiegler means when he talks about the decay
of capitalism from a form of economy premised on desire to a form of
economy organised around drives. [Whereas desire is premised on delay,
deferral, and the need to wait for the object which holds my
attention]{.underline}, [drive is based on immediacy, impatience, and a
throwaway attitude to the]{.underline} [thing which is always-already
worthless]{.underline}. In Stiegler\'s account, **[this reign of
drives]{.underline}**, where there is no spiritual or symbolic meaning,
**[is the limit of capitalism]{.underline}**. [Everything is worthless
and we are confronted with fundamental questions about the significance
of life. What is it that makes life worth living? This is,]{.underline}
of course, [perhaps the human question]{.underline}. It is the question
which only humans ask, because humans are not embedded in the
environment, but rather are thrown into the world in a state of excess
which is also a state of lack. \[51\] It is a question that humans have
resolved through the belief in various concepts. In ancient society,
this was belief in forms; then under religious society, God; then after
the death of God, progress, community, and each other; and then after
the end of history, objects. Stiegler\'s asks the same question of
capitalism: [what can we believe in in the wake of
capitalism]{.underline}, [which has transformed the object]{.underline}
\-- [and this includes humanity \-- into so much refuse, garbage, or
worthless shit?]{.underline}

[In order to reach this situation]{.underline}, where he is able to
confront the horror of the contemporary technological capitalist
dystopia, [Stiegler tracks the history of capitalism and bases
his]{.underline} [analysis in a theory of the progressive overcoming of
limits.]{.underline} First, he explains that early twentieth-century
capital solved the problem of accumulation through the introduction of
consumerism. Here, Freud\'s nephew, Edward Bernays, is a key thinker in
the establishment of a pact between the mass media and capital,
organised around the need to capture attention in order to stimulate
desire and transform the figure of the citizen into the figure of the
consumer. This innovation, which created a condition Stiegler talks
about in terms of becoming-herdish, was first explored by Adorno and
Horkheimer in their work on the culture industry. Stiegler points out
that the Frankfurt School thinkers were the first to understand that TV
time is work time organised in terms of brain capture and that
capitalist culture entails the transformation of significance into a
value to be bought and sold in much the same way as any other commodity.
\[52\] He moves on to argue that 1968 saw the original moment of the
transgression of the limit established by post-war consensus and the
Keynesian model of economics. By the late 1970s the liberatory spirit of
the 1960s, which had seen Deleuze and Guattari champion the
transgressive nature of desire in their book Anti-Oedipus, had been
absorbed into a radical new form of capitalism, neoliberal capitalism,
where desire is unleashed in the service of consumption and
accumulation. The rest of Stiegler\'s story concerns the way in which
neoliberal capitalism eroded delayed gratification and in doing so
destroyed desire itself in a society of credit where we are encouraged
to \"buy now, pay later.\" This is Stiegler\'s terminal form of
capitalism.

But what is [terminal capitalism]{.underline}? Stiegler explains the
profound implications of the cancellation of the delay of desire. \[53\]
First, this cancellation of delay in gratification [supports the general
destruction of the spiritual and symbolic value of the object itself,
which had taken hold through the turn to an instrumental rationality
that only recognises zeroes and ones.]{.underline} [The object that is
quickly obtained and consumed can have no value]{.underline} \-- [it is
here today, gone tomorrow]{.underline}. Second, [the destruction of
desire in drive where we have what we want now]{.underline} [effectively
cancels the authority of the superego that requires us to wait in the
formation of a kind of addictogenic death drive asociety]{.underline}.
There is now no law. Instead, [the human is reduced to the level of the
animal where instinct is unmediated by social structure.
Combined]{.underline}, these two effects have produced a strange society
conditioned by the rule of no rule, endlessly balanced on the edge of
all-out warfare. In his recent works, [Stiegler calls this the decadent
society, a **society of low intensity**]{.underline}, or what Virilio
calls [**pure war**, a society of disenchantment, **cynicism**, and
**despair**, a wasted, hopeless, psychotic dystopi]{.underline}a. Why
psychosis? As Lacan explains in his seminar on the psychoses, psychosis
is the result of the [collapse of the master signifier]{.underline},
which in turn [leads to the collapse of the symbolic order that situates
us in a reality mediated by signs, symbols, and meaningful
objects]{.underline}. \[54\] [Under conditions where the master
signifier gives way and the symbolic order collapses, humans have no way
to situate themselves in the world.]{.underline} As a result of such
psychosis[, the world disintegrates, leaving the psychotic to remake
their own universe on the basis of visions of threatening
others]{.underline}. This is, of course, what we find in Freud\'s study
of Schreber, where paranoia represents a defence mechanism against the
collapse into psychosis provoked by child abuse at the hands of a
perverse father. \[55\] Is it the case, then, that Stiegler\'s decadent
society harbours the conditions to produce a generation of Schrebers,
psychotics who are likely to turn to paranoia in order to save some
semblance of sanity?

This is essentially how I understand the thesis of Disbelief and
Discredit. In these books, Stiegler paints a picture of the capitalist
symbolic order in a state of advanced degeneration, where, because of
the turn to instrumental rationality and the economic rule of zeroes and
ones, spiritual and symbolic misery have become the norm. In this
context, paranoia, conspiracy, and the ideology of the enemy have become
normative. As Freud\'s study of Schreber shows, when there is nothing
else left, the psychotic will try to hang onto his enemy. This is where
I disagree with Stiegler, who opposes Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello\'s
idea of the new spirit of capitalism. \[56\] Stiegler argues that
Boltanski and Chiapello are wide of the mark when they say that the
1960s ushered in a new spirit of capitalism. In his view, the 1960s
introduced a new nihilistic, spiritless mode of capitalism. \[57\]
However, I would disagree on this point, and argue that there is a new
spirit of capitalism, but not the spirit of creativity or
entrepreneurialism suggested by Boltanski or Chiapello. Instead, I think
that the new spirit of capitalism is a paranoid, martial spirit
committed to violence, destruction, and ultimately suicide. Moreover,
this is not directed or motivated violence, but rather the kind of blind
rage that has been explored by Žižek, Badiou, and Sloterdijk in recent
works. \[58\] Most importantly, I would argue that this blind rage is
not necessarily oppositional or transgressive in the context of the
capitalist machine, because it is essentially an acting out of
neoliberal ideology concerned with competition at all levels of
existence. As noted above, the essence of capitalism, which is what
neoliberal ideology realises, is competitive struggle \-- one is either
above or below, more or less valuable.

In this way, I think that [the new spirit of capitalism is the **spirit
of sadism**, a **violent spirit** committed to **punishing the other**
in order to secure **supremacy**, **power**, and ultimately the
**salvation of the self under extreme pressure** from the posthuman
technical system.]{.underline} Blind rage is thus conformist, or what
Stiegler talks about in terms of hyper-power in order to indicate the
way in which control of the technical system is absolute, having
abolished any possibility of external critique. \[59\] However, he also
notes that this mode of power or conformity is endlessly on the verge of
breaking down, of tipping over into normalised forms of transgression
and stasis that will destroy the system itself. The hyper-power of the
system, which is premised on its instrumental rationality and its
endo-colonisation of every element of life, is thus constantly on the
verge of reversing into a state of hyper-vulnerability. This is the case
because it is fundamentally reliant on a Hobbesian social contract where
the political system protects the individual who obeys in return and
which longer functions in a state of symbolic misery. The basic problem
of Hobbes was always based in the question of obeyance \-- why would the
people obey and not simply cheat when they thought the Leviathan\'s back
was turned? The Freudian response to this problem was the superego or
authority in the head, while the Foucauldian response was the
panopticon, surveillance, and later biopower. However, the other
response would be to say that the Leviathan\'s political system was
organised around spirit and recognise that the people obeyed because the
majority believed in the goodness of society.

In the first two volumes of Disbelief and Discredit, Stiegler shows that
this is no longer the case \-- **[people can no longer believe in the
goodness, the idea, or the spirit of society because it is not ethical,
but is instead based on instrumental calculation]{.underline}**. In this
state of symbolic misery, **[the law is not ethical, but rather a
technique]{.underline}**, **[and the objective of any rational actor is
to find loopholes that allow one to behave with total
impunity]{.underline}**. In his book For a New Critique of Political
Economy, Stiegler associates this cynical mode of lawmaking with what he
calls \"mafia capitalism\" \-- a form of accumulation based on
criminality and speculation that has absolutely no investment in wider
society. \[60\] Here, the law accepts and recognises cynical behaviour
and this is why it is unable to suture the individual into any
collective, symbolic order. This is why the technical system lapses into
a state of hyper-vulnerability. If the system no longer protects people,
the Hobbesian contract is essentially broken, and society crumbles back
towards a state of nature. [Stiegler calls this state of revolt
\"disaffection\" in order to emphasize that it was always affect,
emotion, and belief that situated the individual within wider society in
the first place]{.underline}. \[61\] It was [affect]{.underline} that
[created the individual who is always co-individual in]{.underline}
Stiegler\'s use of Simondon and [belief that made people into subjects
subjected to the]{.underline} [authority of the master
signifier,]{.underline} the law of the father. \[62\] Stiegler tells us
that without affect, which effectively binds people to objects, belief,
which emerges from this relation, or spirit, which we might understand
in terms of the atmosphere that characterises a particular period, there
is no other way to uphold society but through naked state power. Here,
the dissociated disindividual is criminalised and police power becomes
fundamental to the operation of society. But there are limits to what is
achievable with police power, and the second volume of Disbelief and
Discredit, subtitled Uncontrollable Societies of Disaffected Individuals
is concerned with psychosocial pathology and particularly the
bestiality, fury, and nihilism of the disindividual caught up in the
short-circuit of drive. \[63\] The motto of this character captures his
base nature \-- I couldn\'t give a fuck!

Ironically, [because the asociety of the drive is the creation of the
instrumental rationality of technics, this situation is beyond
rationality]{.underline}. The dissociated individual cannot think \-- he
or she is interpolated into what Stiegler calls a state of systemic
stupidity. \[64\] Such [individuals are proletarianised because their
minds have been captured by the machine]{.underline}. Under condition of
attention capture driven by the culture industry, **[there is no time to
think; we become idiots]{.underline}** and develop an addictogenic
relation to the technical object. Recall Einstein\'s Nightmare \-- [my
iPhone is tasked with saving me from the meaninglessness of
existence]{.underline}. In order to illustrate this situation Stielger
draws on the Japanese phenomenon of hikikomori, or the \"shut-in,\"
where young men completely withdraw from social interaction in favour of
communication with machines and technology. \[65\] In Stiegler\'s view,
there is very little hope under these conditions \-- [there is no
reason, no trust, and ultimately we are free of the social contract. But
the problem with this is that there is nowhere to go and there is no way
to act because action is premised on sociability. What results is thus
an **immobile**, **thoughtless**, **nihilistic rage**]{.underline},
which has been seen in certain cases of hikikomori where isolation tips
over into murderous violence. There is a sense in Stiegler\'s work that
capitalist civilization is on the edge and that it is only able to
stagger on by virtue of systemic lethargy and demotivation, the other
side of blind rage and nihilistic destruction. For Stiegler, the big
question is what follows this obsolete form of civilization. He explains
that we need to find ways to believe in objects that matter and can hold
our attention. These objects need to be durable and worthy of
idealisation. In this respect, he tells us that we need to return to the
ancient model of skhole, where education was based in contemplation and
care for objects, rather than results and grade point average**[.
Essentially, we need to find reasons to live]{.underline}**.

IV\. Nihilism and Education

Stiegler thinks that [this kind of institutional shift is necessary
because there is no parental authority in neoliberal
capitalism]{.underline} \-- the instrumental rationality of the
technological system has wiped out cultural memory and destroyed
intergenerational connections premised on the authority of the paternal
superego and transferred this relation to TV and the culture industries,
\[66\] what Marcuse called the \"automatic superego.\" \[67\] Of course,
this is not simply a problem contained within education, but rather an
issue concerned with the future of civilization itself. In Stiegler\'s
account, events such as Columbine and Sandy Hook, where young men
rampage through schools, are premised on the pervasive nature of the
spirit of nihilistic rage, where the only way to leave one\'s mark is
through negative sublimation. \[68\] Here, [destruction and violence
become cultural acts, ways to assert one\'s existence in a world that
cannot recognise any form of significance beyond base calculations
around more or less]{.underline}. This is Stiegler\'s suicidal society,
his technological dystopia, which we must resist through the creation of
durable objects able to hold historical significance and thus the
possibility of progress through the present into the future on the basis
of the knowledge and experience of the past. This vision of history,
which he inherits from Husserl\'s theory of memory, retention, and
protention, is how Stiegler escapes from the suicidal society with no
future. This is his utopia beyond the petty calculations of the
computational machine, the technological dystopia of neoliberal
capitalism. In the second volume of Disbelief and Discredit, the
relation between the dystopia of nihilism and utopia of history is
couched in terms of struggle. \[69\] Stiegler tells us that we must
fight for the right to the future. Like Prometheus, the original rebel
with a cause, we must struggle to save the possibility of hope. We must
struggle to save our openness to change, which is, of course, based in
our humanity, which is, in turn, rooted in our fundamental lack \-- our
default.

Stiegler argues that **[we must find time and space in life
for]{.underline}** otium, or **[studious leisure]{.underline}**, [which
is today absolutely subordinate to]{.underline} negotium, or
[calculation and necessity]{.underline}. \[70\] Fundamentally, he
explains that [this is not about supporting the importance of the
pleasure principle, but rather a defence of **art**, **craft**, and the
**value of cultural discipline**]{.underline}, because [this is how we
insert ourselves into a world and **co-individuate ourselves** through
**communication with others**]{.underline}. In this sense, he is
critical of Foucault, who he argues advances a one-dimensional view of
the idea of discipline, a view that ignores the importance of discipline
in suturing people into social symbolic systems that allows them to
become human and elevate themselves beyond mere bestial necessity. This
is why he thinks **[we need valuable objects that can enable us to
create historical fictions]{.underline}** \-- **[realisable fictions
based in the past that can act as guides to the present and help us to
think about moving forward into the future. These good
fictions]{.underline}**, or fictions of the good, **[are essentially
utopias]{.underline}**, **[narratives necessary to escape the horror of
our contemporary un-world and which we can only create on the basis of
the care,]{.underline}** attention, and discipline **[we learn through
immersion in culture]{.underline}**. This is why Stiegler writes in
Taking Care of Youth and Generations about the culture industries and
what he calls the \"battle for intelligence,\" because it is here, in
the psychopolitical struggle for available brain time, that the
possibility of care, attention, and discipline is destroyed in the
emergence of hyper-attention and drive-based culture characterised by a
complete lack of focus. \[71\] Stieg[ler is scathing of consumer culture
because there is no know-how or craft in the channel or web surfer who
says I want this, that, and the other, and I want it now.]{.underline}
In explaining the emergence of what he calls \"global attention deficit
disorder,\" he refers to the short-termism of real time financial
speculation, which has brought the global capitalist technological
system to the brink of destruction. He calls this the dynamism of the
very worst and suggests we need to make time to think and contemplate
the good object that has some kind of meaning beyond its own profane
objectivity. But how is this possible in a society of hyper-attention,
where we cannot concentrate on one thing for very long, and cognitive
overflow, which ensures that we are unable to handle the floods of
information that flow through our minds?

Stiegler\'s answer is that [the global technological system is
essentially pharmakonic]{.underline}. \[72\] Indeed, he describes his
own critique of neoliberal capitalism as pharmacological in order to
argue that [the **light speed of attention** and **excess of
information** produced by late capitalism **effectively cancel
themselves out,**]{.underline} [thus opening up space for a new politics
of attention, information, and knowledge]{.underline} \-- [a
**noopolitics** to oppose what he calls the globalised market of fools
or conspiracy of imbeciles]{.underline}. In What Makes Life Worth
Living, he argues that this [**noopolitics** must be a politics of care,
attention, and the good object]{.underline}, where the object could be
Winnicott\'s transitional object, a child\'s teddy or blanket, or a
great work of art contemplated by everybody who stands before it.
Ironically, [the object itself does not matter \-- what matters is its
aura, that which transgresses the object\'s profane objectivity in
the]{.underline} [creation of transitional or potential space where the
new, the future, and hope can be born. This is Stiegler\'s utopia, the
truly human environment made in meaningful objects, rather]{.underline}
[than the technological environment that debases humans and things in
the creation of a wasteland]{.underline}, a techno-dystopia where
nothing really matters. This nightmare scenario, which is effectively
Einstein\'s Nightmare, or what Stiegler refers to as a \"Godless
apocalypse,\" \[73\] is what he is concerned with opposing through his
think tank, Ars Industrialis. Ars Industrialis is set on the
re-enchantment of the world through noetic struggle. This is not
Luddism, or a somehow anti-technological politics, but rather an attempt
to invent a non-instrumental or humanistic relation to technology based
in an appreciation of the infinite dimension of value. In many
respect[s, **this move requires a psychological shift**]{.underline} \--
[we must escape the vertigo of the technological system that encourages
us to overcompensate for our humanity understood in terms of a basic
lack that is also]{.underline} [an excess which enables us to imagine a
future mediated through the creation of more machines that dominate us
in the way we want to dominate ourselves]{.underline}. Centrally[, we
must come to terms with our own lack, because this lack]{.underline}, or
what Stiegler calls \"default,\" [is also the **root of our imagination,
creativity, and ability to make a future** beyond Einstein\'s
Nightmare]{.underline}.

### AT: Liberalism Good

#### Liberalism is inevitably imposed violently 

**Vattimo and Zabala 11** \[Gianni Vattimo, emeritus professor of
philosophy at the University of Turin and a member of the European
Parliament, and Santiago Zabala, ICREA Research Professor of Philosophy

York, NY (2011), p. 37-43\]

Robert Kagan\'s The Return of History and the End of Dreams (2008) is a
response to Francis Fukuyama\'s The End of History and the Last Man
(1992) and also the latest attempt from the politics of descriptions to
situate politics outside history. In order to complete its metaphysical
project (after imposing truth and conserving realism), the politics of
descriptions also needs to declare victory over those it has defeated,
that is, those who do not accept the established framed democracy. The
essence of such declarations, like Searle\'s realism, is conservative,
because it intends to conquer any alteration that might question its
instituted norms. Although Searle never declared realism\'s triumph over
history, his ontological desire to dissolve philosophy into the sciences
inevitably discards everything that does not submit to the Western
rationalistic tradition, including different philosophies. But where
does this discarding end? And against whom is this victory declared? In
order to respond to these questions, it is necessary to individuate
these self-declared winners and also the defeated. Our goal in this
final section is to suggest how Heidegger\'s oblivion of Being in favor
of beings can be identified with Benjamin\'s \"tradition of the
oppressed,\" that is, the weak. This discarded history reminds us that
we are always within history and never above it (as Kagan and Fukuyama
suggest), and it also reveals to us where a possible emancipation from
framed democracy can take place.

As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, [the desire for
do-minion often results in metaphysical thought, not the other way
around.]{.underline} [**Metaphysical democracy is a system sustained by
those who find them-selves at ease within its order of facts, norms, and
institutions**. These are the winners]{.underline}, [those who believe
Being\'s presence is worthy not only of description but also of
contemplation and conservation, since it guarantees their own
condition.]{.underline} But such a condition inevitably also includes
the defeated history, that is, the oblivion of \"Being\" and the
\"weak.\" While Being refers to Heidegger\'s oppressed history of
metaphysics, the weak, that is, those who are not part of framed
democracy\'s neoliberal capitalism, are a consequence of this same
oblivion. In sum, just as Being was discarded in favor of beings, so are
the weak oppressed in favor of the winners, that is, in favor of those
who dominate within framed democracy\'s conservative moralized order.65

While we will comment on [Kagan and Fukuyama]{.underline}\'s
conservative analysis of our current political world in the next
chapter, it is important to emphasize now how and why both authors
situate politics outside history. The reason is straightforward: they
[represent the winner\'s version of history, that is, those who believe
that history can be viewed from the standpoint of what Lyotard named
\"metanarratives]{.underline}.\"66 But in order to stand in this view,
[history must have already become \"all it can become,\" that is,
accomplished its continuous rational unification with
truth.]{.underline} [Framed democracy has now become a metanarrative not
only for these two prominent analysts but also for politics of
descriptions in general, which must conserve the dominion achieved
through science\'s global control]{.underline}. [The desire to declare
the end or return of history is bound up with framed
democracy]{.underline}, that is, [with an order that can legitimize or
delegitimize not only history but also other political
systems.]{.underline} This is why [framed democracy is]{.underline} to
Kagan and Fukuyama what [basic fact]{.underline}s are to Searle: [the
possibility to \"**proceed from a prior political
ontology**]{.underline}.\"67 But as we have seen, this \"prior
political\" ontology is just another way to demand that science not only
guide philosophy but also dictate all the other domains of culture.
While Kagan does not even bother to recognize the subordination of
politics, history, or democracy to science, Fukuyama instead openly
states how science also dictates history:

The first way in which modern natural science produces historical change
that is both directional and universal is through military competition.
The universality of science provides the basis for the global
unification of mankind in the first instance because of the prevalence
of war and conflict in the international system. [Modern natural science
confers a decisive military advantage on those societies that can
develop, produce, and deploy technology the most effectively, and the
relative advantage conferred by technology increases as the rate of
technological change accelerates]{.underline}. . . . The possibility of
war is a great force for the rationalization of societies, and for the
creation of uniform social structures across cultures.68

[If]{.underline}, as Fukuyama explains, [liberal democracy is \"the most
rational form of government, that is]{.underline}, [the state that
realizes most fully either rational desire or rational
recognition,\"]{.underline}69 [and if modern natural science manages to
dictate history\'s directions through military dominion]{.underline}, it
should not be a surprise that democracy and science have become
indissoluble. [And it is this indissolubility that situates framed
democracy outside history, where its ideal of objectivity can finally be
fulfilled]{.underline}. But now that science has effectively fulfilled
in framed democracy its \"liberal essence and its ideal of
objectivity,\"70 Fukuyama is convinced that \"[there are no serious
ideological competitors left to liberal democracy]{.underline}.\"71 In
other words, [liberal democracy has triumphed over history.]{.underline}
As we can see, [history has become a synonym for
\"progress]{.underline},\" that is, [for improvements not only of
different political systems but also of philosophies]{.underline}.
[Framed democracy is the completion of history\'s
development]{.underline}, realization, [and improvement. But one might
now ask: what is the political goal of declaring the end of return of
history]{.underline}?

[Although framed democracy is not the first order to declare the return
or end of history, as \"heirs of prior conquerors]{.underline}\"72 [it
must continue to **impose its victory over the defeated** in such a way
as to **neutralize other possible disruptions of its achieved
order**]{.underline}. This is why [within framed democracy, whatever and
whoever refuse to submit to truth, dialogue, or the]{.underline}
[predictable structure of causes and effects constitute not only an
\"alteration of history\" but also a **potential danger**]{.underline},
[and they must be **identified as such**]{.underline}. [These
identifications will become necessary to control the defeated and also
to continue to guide the rulers to achieve authority, maintain
independence, and most of all, induce indifference toward the
defeated]{.underline}. But how is it possible to overcome this winner\'s
history? Is a different history required or just framed democracy\'s
\"other history\"?

Contrary to many interpreters of Benjamin, we believe it is against this
indifference toward the defeated (which has increased tremendously in
recent decades) that he emphasized the significance of the \"other\"
oppressed history of framed democracy. The German thinker indicated a
substantial difference within Kagan and Fukuyama\'s commonly accepted
historiography: on the one hand, the \"history of the winners,\" which
he also called \"of the oppressors,\" and, on the other, that \"of the
defeated\" or \"oppressed.\" According to Benjamin, while the first has
always been traditionally considered a \"continuous\" history, the
second has been represented as \"discontinuous,\" that is, entangled in
disruptions, emergencies, and alterations. But if the second history is
\"discontinuous,\" it is not because it is wrong or irrational but
rather because it is defeated and oppressed; in other words, it is a
consequence of its oppressors, who are concerned in maintaining intact
their rule and oppressive tradition. For this reason, [Benjamin believed
that whereas \"the idea of the continuum levels everything]{.underline}
off \[alles dem Erdboden gleichmacht\], [the idea of the discontinuum is
the basis of a genuine tradition]{.underline},\"73 [that
is]{.underline}, of possible emancipations. [But as an oppressed
history]{.underline}, [it encourages the defeated and]{.underline} [weak
to come forward and also urges framed democracy to suppress its
indifference.]{.underline} [But where does the defeated history take
place, and what possibilities does it include]{.underline}?

As we can see, just as Benjamin\'s critique of the winner\'s history was
not intended to discover the real continuity of history, neither was
[Heidegger\'s destruction of metaphysics]{.underline} concerned with
discovering Being\'s truth. Instead, it [sought to discover its
political emancipation, that is, the realm within which freedom is
effectively possible]{.underline}. [This \"other\" history reveals
unnoticed possibilities, projects, and rights that were set aside in
favor of Western rationality, but, most of all, it reveals the
\"emergencies\" of framed democracy:]{.underline} \"[The tradition of
the oppressed teaches us that the \'state of emergency\' in which we
live is not the exception but the rule. We must attain to a conception
of history that accords with this insight. Then we will clearly see that
it is our task to bring about a real state of emergency, and this will
improve our position in the struggle against Fascism.]{.underline}\"74

[These emergencies take place outside the metaphysical descriptions of
Being, that is, beyond the winner\'s history (of truth, dialogue, and
realism), because they represent dangers that must constantly be
sup-pressed]{.underline}. But, [as potential dangers]{.underline}, [they
are also effective conditions for]{.underline} [disruption]{.underline},
that is, of [emancipation]{.underline}. As Benjamin argued, [the
commonly accepted]{.underline} [historiography \"misses those points at
which the transmission breaks down and thus misses]{.underline} [those
jags and cracks]{.underline} \[Schroffen und Zacken\] [which call a halt
to those who wish to move beyond it.\"]{.underline}75

[Although framed democracy has]{.underline} now achieved a condition of
global control where, as we have seen with Heidegger, the \"only
emergency is the lack of emergency,\"76 it is still possible to disrupt
this order through \"events of unconcealment\" that take place outside
the metaphysical descriptions of Being. But what do they look like?

[Heidegger]{.underline}, in order [to escape the metaphysical violent
oppression of truth that silences whatever does not submit to its
logical and verbal structure]{.underline} (the defeated oppressed
history), [individuates in truth\'s \"event of unconcealment\" an
alternative to its derivative scientific constitution]{.underline}. But
contrary to many interpreters, we do not believe that he indicated such
disclosedness only to demonstrate the limitations of the correspondence
theory of truth. He also revealed the political possibilities of truth
when established in this \"historical\" \"event of unconcealment.\"
Heidegger listed some examples where such establishments take place in
his famous essay \"The Origin of the Work of Art\" (1936):

Truth happens only by establishing itself in the strife and space it
itself opens up. . . . This happening is, in many different ways,
historical. One essential way in which truth establishes itself in the
being it has opened up is its setting-itself-into-the-work. Another way
in which truth comes to presence is through the act which founds a
state. Again, another way in which truth comes to shine is the proximity
of that which is not simply a being but rather the be-ing which is most
being. Yet another way in which truth grounds itself is the essential
sacrifice. A still further way in which truth comes to be is in the
thinker questioning, which, as the thinking of being, names being in its
question-worthiness \[Frag-wurdigkeit\]. [Science]{.underline}, by
contrast, [is not an original happening of truth but al-ways the
cultivation of a domain of truth that has already been
opened]{.underline}.77

As we can see, [these events are not different events but only
historical events of \"unconcealment\" that open up a new
space]{.underline}. In sum, only what takes place in the discarded
metaphysical tradition of philosophy allows a possibility of
emancipation from framed democracy--- certainly not science, which
represents its latest development. The \"task of history \[is\] to take
possession of the tradition of the oppressed,\"78 that is, to overcome
its oppressions. After all, this is why Derrida exposed the
\"iterability\" argument against Searle: not only to indicate other
possibilities at the margins of traditional philosophy of language but
also as a way out from the impositions of realism, that is, the
winner\'s history.

Unlike many who appeal to the Anthropocene simply to advance the cause
of geoengineering, Jedediah [Purdy]{.underline} begins with an
assessment of our political condition. Still, he **[fails to appreciate
the nature of [the geopolitics responsible for the crisis we
face]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If we are to take up his noble call for an
ecological democracy, we must acknowledge that [the [violence]{.mark}
done to our planet has largely been perpetrated not by all humans but by
a select group of Europeans. The Anthropos]{.underline}---the human
species as such---[is not to blame. Properly named, [our era]{.mark} is
not the Anthropocene but [the Eurocene]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It was [a
European elite]{.mark} that [developed a]{.mark} distinctively
[mechanistic view of matter]{.mark}]{.underline}, an oppositional
relationship to nature, [[and an economic system indebted to
**geographical**]{.mark} **[expansion.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[The resulting [political orders measured success by how much
wealth could be generated in]{.mark} the [exploitation]{.mark} of
peoples and resources]{.underline}. [The geological record bears the
mark of this European assemblage of hierarchies]{.underline}.
[[Understanding]{.mark} the forces of Europeanization]{.underline}---the
forces of [[racial superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[economic
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and global
resettlement]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[is essential to
understanding]{.mark} how the planet got to this point, and [how "we"
could possibly become democratic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Purdy and
others claim there are two reasons for renaming the last few centuries
to mark a new geological era. The first is a matter of accuracy: there
is significant evidence that humans have contributed to climate change.
The second is a matter of consciousness raising: renaming the Holocene
is essential to raising awareness that humans are responsible. Yet on
both counts, [we should reconsider what we mean by "human]{.underline}."
It would be more accurate, and go further in raising awareness, to
acknowledge the grossly disproportionate impact Europeans have had on
our planet. [This is not just another hyperbolic jeremiad against
European peoples: Purdy's invitation for global democratic thinking
requires a geological history and name that **foregrounds what really
stands in the way** of such a future.]{.underline} As Purdy points out
(unlike Paul Crutzen and others), the "human" footprint involves much
more than just carbon dioxide. [On a geological time scale, the effects
of atmospheric [carbon dioxide are dwarfed by those of
radioactivity]{.mark} and are comparable to those of plastic, the modern
waste product par excellence.]{.underline} [If the Anthropocene is meant
to name the scale of human impacts on the planet, it should refer not
only to warming but also to cooling the earth, and Europeanization has
done both at levels that even China's current growth cannot
match.]{.underline} Beginning in 1610, a small-scale ice age took hold
of the planet when a wilder arboreal nature took back what had been
inhabited land: [some 20 million people killed by the European invasion
of the Americas resulted in vast reforestation of the North and South
American continents. The providence spoken of by those who arrived was
not God but syphilis, influenza, and the number of other species that
went along for the ride.]{.underline} **[[Waves of well-armed]{.mark}
[European]{.mark} explorers and [settlers leveraged]{.mark} the
[devastation for their own gain]{.mark}. There is no way to know how
many languages, cities, ideas, cosmologies, and ways of inhabiting the
world were lost in this genocide and terraforming of the Americas. The
history of nuclear weapons is also predominantly
European]{.underline}**. The bombing of [Hiroshima]{.underline} on
August 6, 1945, [is only the beginning of this story]{.underline}. [In
the years that have followed, more than 2,000 nuclear weapons have been
tested,]{.underline} about [97 percent of which were detonated by
European powers]{.underline}. [Those detonations do not appear as tests
from the perspectives of the Marshallese or Western
Shoshone.]{.underline} [A seventy-year nuclear war has spread cancer,
incinerated sacred lands, and made other spaces uninhabitable on a
temporal scale several orders of magnitude more condensed than the
lifespan of atmospheric carbon dioxide.]{.underline} The nuclear powers
of the Eurocene---the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France,
and Israel---possess 97 percent of the 15,800 nuclear weapons around the
planet. **[The [beleaguered]{.mark} state of the [arms control]{.mark}
agenda [means self-annihilation is still a very real
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [As for plastic, the Texas-sized
trash gyres that swirl in the world's oceans are another reminder of
what a cosmology of disposability and synthetic chemistry has
wrought]{.underline}. [Plastic may lack the longevity of carbon dioxide
and irradiated earth, but for hundreds, maybe thousands of years it will
continue to circulate, wreaking havoc throughout the food
chain]{.underline}. We have post--World War II European development to
thank for single-serve plastic shampoo pouches and bottled water---the
latter needed only because nearby streams have been sold to Coca-Cola.
[Acknowledging the distinctively European history of our geological era
serves a **practical as well as a polemical end**]{.underline}. [[Any
democratic project must confront the geopolitics of the Eurocene]{.mark}
because it challenges the very paradigm of equality]{.underline}. "In
the Anthropocene," Purdy writes, "environmental justice might also mean
an equal role in shaping the future of the planet." In fact,
[[environmental justice will require]{.mark} unequal roles:
significantly constraining, even **[repressing, the powers of the
Eurocene]{.mark}**. On the eve of the creation of the United Nations at
the Dumbarton Oaks conference]{.underline}, W. E. B[. Du Bois saw the
failure of a dream before it had even been fully formed: the vast new
international body was little more than the institutionalization of the
global "color line]{.underline}." The great powers had insisted upon a
Security Council, and the General Assembly would be subordinated to its
nuclear authority. [Purdy's suggestion that the planet could be governed
equally ignores the vast systems of
injustice---[settler-colonialism]{.mark}, primitive accumulation, [and
violent power politics]{.mark}---that **[stand in the way]{.mark}**,
[upheld by great powers that use nuclear weapons to deter change
and]{.mark} **[deploy swarms of drones]{.mark} to hunt down those too
small for the nuclear option.**]{.underline} I would like to be part of
Purdy's ecological democracy, but he is wrong to say "There is no
political agent, community, or even movement on the scale of humanity's
world-making decisions." **[[We share a world governed by a few states
with the capability of ending all life on the planet.]{.mark} At the
international scale, [these states are essentially authoritarian; they
rule by economic violence and war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}**. [That some
of those states are not authoritarian at the domestic level is of little
consequence to the rest of the world.]{.underline} It should come as no
surprise that the leaders of the food sovereignty and anti--fossil fuel
movements Purdy describes belong to marginalized groups that see no
future in our current geopolitical order. Indigenous, black, and brown
people are at the vanguard of political struggle not because they are
more natural but because they have had front row seats in the making of
this crisis. The Eurocene is not perpetrated by all people of European
heritage, many of whom oppose the existing geopolitical order---myself
included. **[This distinction---between being European and being an
agent of the Eurocene---only intensifies the need to [rethink
democratization as demanding a politics of inequality]{.mark} rather
than a politics of incorporation]{.underline}**. Such a remaking of
justice is as complex and difficult as the climate crisis itself, and
just as worthy a struggle, irrespective of whether we can succeed[.
As]{.underline} Sylvia [Wynter has said, "we must now collectively
undertake a rewriting of knowledge as we know it. . . . because the West
did change the world, totally."]{.underline} **[To do so means exiting
the Anthropocene as an idea, and collectively---even if not
equally---exiting the Eurocene as a failed epoch]{.underline}**. As
Wynter says, [we need to consider other "genres of the
human."]{.underline} [Wynter explains she will not miss the Anthropos
because she, among so many others, was never considered human to begin
with. [To invent a new species is the task that must be]{.mark}
undertaken before there can be a "we," an "our," or a "cene" that is
more than a requiem for the end.]{.underline}

### L -- Realism 

#### Restraint fails -- their realist security documents establish a will to order that guarantees their approach fails

**Rythoven 15** \[Eric Van Rythoven, Carleton University, Canada, "The
perils of realist advocacy and the promise of securitization theory:
Revisiting the tragedy of the Iraq War debate ," European Journal of
International Relations, published online September 8, 2015\]

In the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War and the subsequent excesses of the
Global War on Terror, [[realist advocacy has gravitated towards]{.mark}
a more **[active promotion]{.mark} [of
restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Walt's (2006) Taming American
Power makes the case to a popular audience for the value of the US
exercising restraint on the global stage. Similarly, Posen (2013, 2014)
has argued for a grand strategy of restraint against an increasingly
expansive liberal hegemony. Rosato and Schuessler's (2011: 813) realist
foreign policy manifesto explicitly 'counsels restraint' in dealing with
minor powers such as Iran. While less visible, [a similar concern with
restraint is **also evident in securitization theory**]{.underline}.
Increasingly, its [[proponents]{.mark} are carving out a nuanced middle
ground, where the dangers of intense patterns of threat
construction]{.underline} mean that the practice of 'desecuritization is
preferable in the abstract, but concrete situations might call for
securitization' (Wæver, 2011: 469). Vibeke Schou Tjalve goes even
further by pointing to how visions of civil society inspired by early
20th-century Atlantic republicanism could be used to curb, but never
altogether eliminate, securitizing moves. [She
[argues]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[Ultimately, [human beings can only restrain each
other]{.mark}]{.underline}. The creation of a system of checks and
balances, of playing interest against interest, was the only viable
means of restraining the monopoly of ideas or the advance of uncontested
demonizing, securitizing moves. (Tjalve, 2011: 446, emphasis in
original)

Tjalve's work represents a stark departure from [the metaphor of the
marketplace by [focusing on an agonistic and competitive public
sphere]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, it [[shares with]{.mark} US
[realists]{.mark} a distinct [understanding]{.mark} of [**restraint as a
virtue** in security discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [How one advocates
for the]{.underline} importance of [this virtue]{.underline} to
contemporary forms of statecraft is possibly one of the most fruitful
grounds for dialogue between these two approaches today.

Yet, [restraint in security debates is typically held to be
elusive]{.underline}, [especially when such debates play to populist
impulses such as fears over]{.underline} [terrorism or nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. As noted in the previous section, [both
[realism and securitization theory are **beholden to**]{.mark} **a
vision of [fearful]{.mark} [publics acquiescing to security
arguments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The problem with [[this
logic]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it **[artificially [narrows the range
of emotional]{.mark} [dynamics at play]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[Reducing security]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[debates [to popular and
elite fears]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[ignores how]{.mark} such
[debates]{.mark} circulate and [are sustained by a]{.mark} [variety of
different]{.mark} emotions and [affects]{.mark}. Great power politics is
frequently punctuated by [a diplomacy of anger]{.mark}]{.underline},
[which may escalate into conflict in the absence of conciliatory
gestures]{.underline} (Hall, 2011). **[[Honour and]{.mark}
shame]{.underline}** [have powerful catalyzing effects for security
policy, as exemplified by the **[broadly circulating feelings of]{.mark}
shame** in the US after 9/11]{.underline} (Saurette, 2006).
**[[Humanitarian operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the Western
intervention in Libya, **[may [be wellsprings of joy]{.mark} and
jubilation [for liberal]{.mark} internationalist[s]{.mark}, who envision
them as heroic efforts that avert near-genocides and produce deeply
grateful local populations]{.underline}** (e.g. Kristof, 2011). [Nor is
the role of emotions purely facilitative in making security
arguments.]{.underline}

In some cases, [societies may come to fear the politics of fear itself
as it allows for the 'collective concentrations of power that make
possible]{.underline} ["institutionalized cruelty"]{.underline}'
(Williams, 2011: 455). Thus, [the use of torture]{.underline} by the US
[may have left an enduring anxiety over how public fears]{.underline}
[have been manipulated to support and sustain institutionalized
cruelty.]{.underline} The broader point is that as long as these
emotional dynamics are part and parcel of security debates --- in ways
that both inhibit and expand the security agenda --- they should be of
special interest to both realist and securitization studies.21

Conclusion

**[[The failure of realist advocacy]{.mark}, despite its hegemonic
status within the discipline, [to curb the expansion of]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark} agendas constitutes a genuine puzzle]{.underline}**.
Focusing principally on the 2003 Iraq War debate, this article has
leveraged the tools of securitization theory to offer an explanation for
this failure centred around three contributions. First, by viewing the
expansion of the security agenda as a product of threat inflation in the
marketplace of ideas, [[realists employed a **liberal model of
discourse** that stressed]{.mark} efficient [economic]{.mark}al
[reasoning over]{.mark} questions of [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
was a model protected, in part, by the incommensurability thesis.
Second, while generally competent interlocutors in eyes of
securitization theory, a closer examination of realist advocacy reveals
how [[ignoring]{.mark} identity and [emotion ceded powerful]{.mark}
cultural [resources to]{.mark} their [neocons]{.mark}ervative
opponents.]{.underline} Third, the article sketched a common research
agenda for realism and securitization theory under the auspices of a
shared interest in the statecraft of threat construction.

There is a sense in which this argument is unfair to Walt and
Mearsheimer, as well as to other realists who opposed the 2003 Iraq War.
Their advocacy may have failed but so, too, did a host of other
institutions (Kaufman, 2004), [including a lacklustre political
opposition, particularly among elites, and an uncritical
media.]{.underline} It may be more accurate to say that this was a
failure of the collective public sphere, rather than any one actor or
strategy (Tjalve, 2011). Yet, [the significance of realist advocacy
cannot be dismissed]{.underline}. The fact that neoconservatives spent
so much time and energy engaging realist arguments, including agreeing
to a public debate with Walt and Mearsheimer in February 2003, reflects
how [the intellectual architects of the war saw in realism a trenchant
and potent source of opposition]{.underline}.

Equally important is the concern that calling on realists to engage with
the role of identity and emotion in discourse challenges the traditional
academia--policy divide. In the Weberian view, appropriate scholarly
activism entails 'entering the debate in a nonpartisan way, and
confining \[oneself\] to disclosing "facts" rather than making
pronouncements about "values"' (Jackson and Kaufman, 2007: 95).
Objectivity, in the Weberian sense, is crucial in ensuring the
authoritative nature of academic 'facts'. Yet, [[despite]{.mark} their
'[measured scholarly tones']{.mark}, such [efforts can easily be read as
'obviously "political"' by the public and]{.mark} therefore be
**[dismissed as another partisan voice]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jackson
and Kaufman, 2007: 99). [This does not mean that objectivity and, thus,
authority are unimportant, but that these concerns need to be balanced
with a message sensitive to the vicissitudes of power in
discourse]{.underline}. Instead, it may be 'due to the very subjectivity
that some perceive as a liability' that some academics 'are well
positioned to issue the kinds of critiques that may resonate more
deeply' with popular audiences (Sucharov and Sasley, 2014: 177).
[[Rather than pursue a 'hygienic' objectivity]{.mark}, we might
[consider our attachments to specific communities as reservoirs for
thinking about richer]{.mark} forms of [public
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Cap Bad\-\--Sustainability

#### Marx's law of profitability explains cyclical recessions and renders capitalism unsustainable 

**Roberts 15** - London economist citing PhD economists (Michael,
https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2015/12/29/the-marxist-theory-of-economic-crises-in-capitalism-part-two/)

[Does Marx's law fit the facts?]{.underline} [Some]{.underline} Marxist
[critics of **[Marx's law of profitability]{.mark}** reckon that the law
**[can]{.mark}**not **[be empirically proven]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
refuted [because official statistics cannot be used to show Marx's law
in operation. But there are plenty of studies by Marxist economists that
show otherwise. The key tests]{.underline} of the validity of the law in
modern capitalist economies [would be to show whether 1) the rate of
profit falls over time as the organic composition of capital rises; 2)
the rate of profit rises when the organic composition falls or when the
rate of surplus value rises faster]{.underline} than the organic
composition of capital; [3) the rate of profit rises, if there is sharp
fall in the organic composition of capital as in a slump.]{.underline}
These would be the empirical tests and [there is plenty of empirical
evidence for the US and world economy to show that the answer is yes to
all these questions. For example,]{.underline} [[Basu and
Manolakos]{.underline}](http://gesd.free.fr/basumano.pdf) [applied
econometric analysis to the US economy between 1948 and 2007 and
found]{.underline} that there was [a secular tendency for the rate of
profit to fall with a measurable decline of about 0.3 percent a year
"after controlling for counter-tendencies."]{.underline} [In [my work on
the US rate of profit,](http://gesd.free.fr/mr1213.pdf) I also found an
average decline of 0.4 percent a year through 2009.]{.underline} And
[here is a figure by G Carchedi for]{.underline} the rise in the organic
composition of capital ([OCC)]{.underline} in the industrial sector of
the US since 1947 [versus]{.underline} the average rate of profit
([ARP]{.underline}). It tells the same story. US ARP and OCC (i.e. C/V)

[[There is a clear inverse correlation between a rising organic
composition of capital and a falling rate of profit.]{.mark} **Can
Marx's law explain crises?**]{.underline} How does Marx's law of
profitability work as an explanation and forecast of slumps in
capitalist economies? [[The law leads to a]{.mark} clear [causal
connection to regular and recurrent crises]{.mark}]{.underline}
(slumps). [It runs from falling profitability to falling profits to
falling investment to falling employment and incomes. A bottom is
reached when there is sufficient destruction of capital
values]{.underline} (the writing off technology, the bankruptcy of
companies, a reduction in wage costs) [to raise profits and then
profitability. Then rising profitability leads to rising investment
again]{.underline}. The cycle of boom recommences and the whole 'crap'
starts again, to use Marx's colourful phrase. [There is a cycle of
profit alongside the long-term tendency for the rate of profit to
fall.](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/cycles-in-capitalism.pdf)

![Profit cycle](media/image2.png){width="6.0777777777777775in"
height="3.976116579177603in"} [The [evidence of this causality]{.mark}
between profit and investment [is available]{.mark}.]{.underline} Jose
Tapia [Granados, using regression analysis, finds that, [over 251
quarters of]{.mark} US [economic activity]{.mark}]{.underline} from
1947, [[profits started declining]{.underline}]{.mark} long [[before
investment]{.underline}]{.mark} did [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[pre-tax profits]{.mark} can [explain]{.mark} 44% of all [movement in
investment, while there is no evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[investment can explain any movement in profits.]{.mark} I find a
higher 'Granger causality' of 60% from annual changes in profit and
investment]{.underline} (unpublished) [and a correlation of 0.67 for the
period since 2000.]{.underline} And see this by G Carchedi ([Carchedi
Presentation](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/carchedi-presentation.pptx)).
[[In the period leading up to the Great Recession]{.mark} 2008-9, [we
can see the causality visually]{.mark}]{.underline} for US profits,
investment and real GDP in the graphic below. The mass of US corporate
profit peaks in mid-2006, investment and GDP follows two years later.
Profits turn back up in late 2008 and investment follows one year later.

![profits lead](media/image3.png){width="4.622222222222222in"
height="3.466666666666667in"}

[There are two basic regularities shown by the data: that a change in
profits tends to be followed next year by a change in
investment]{.underline} in the same direction; [and that a change in
investment is usually followed]{.underline} in a few years [by changes
in profits in the opposite direction.]{.underline} Thus we have a cycle.
From these results, the "regularity" of the business cycle, and the fact
that profitability stagnated in 2013 and declined in 2014 (and now the
mass of profits in 2015) after growing between 2008 and 2012, it can be
concluded with some confidence that a recession of the US economy, which
will be also part of a world economic crisis like the Great Recession,
will occur again in the next few years. And [Marx's law of the tendency
of the rate of profit to fall makes an even more fundamental prediction:
that the capitalist mode of production will not be eternal, that it is
transitory in the history of human social organisation. [The
law]{.mark}]{.underline} of the tendency [[predicts that]{.mark}, over
time, [there will be a fall in the rate of profit globally, **delivering
more crises of a devastating character.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Work has
been done by modern Marxist [[analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[confirms that the world rate of profit has fallen over the last 150
years.]{.underline}]{.mark} See the graph below ([data from Esteban
Maito](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/maito-esteban-the-historical-transience-of-capital-the-downward-tren-in-the-rate-of-profit-since-xix-century.pdfhttp:/gesd.free.fr/mrwrate.pdf)

![world rate of profit
Maito](media/image4.png){width="6.607872922134733in"
height="4.308333333333334in"} Maito's data for the 19th century have
recently been questioned ([DUMENIL-LEVY on
MAITO](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/dumenil-levy-on-maito.pdf)),
but [in a recent work using different sources and countries, [I find a
similar trend for the post-1945 period globally]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Revisiting a world rate of profit June
2015](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/revisiting-a-world-rate-of-profit-june-2015.pdf)).
[And [earlier groundbreaking work by]{.mark} Minqi [Li and colleagues,
as well as by]{.mark} Dave [Zachariah, show a similar
trend.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Maito concludes: "[The tendency of the
rate of profit to fall and its empirical confirmation highlights the
historically limited nature of capitalist production.]{.underline} If
the rate of profit measures the vitality of the capitalist system, [the
logical conclusion is that it is getting closer to its endpoint. There
are many ways that capital can attempt to overcome crises and
regenerate]{.underline} constantly. Periodic crises are specific to the
capitalist mode of production and allow, ultimately, a partial recovery
of profitability. This is a characteristic aspect of capital and the
cyclical nature of the capitalist economy. But [the periodic nature of
these crises has not stopped the downward trend]{.underline} of the rate
of profit [over the long term. So the arguments claiming]{.underline}
that [there is an inexhaustible capacity of capital to restore the rate
of profit]{.underline} and its own vitality and which therefore
considers the capitalist mode of production as a natural and
a-historical phenomenon, [are refuted by the empirical
evidence.]{.underline}" [So the law predicts that, [as the organic
composition of capital rises]{.mark} globally, [the rate of profit will
fall despite counteracting factors and]{.mark} despite [successive
crises]{.mark} ([which temporarily]{.mark} help to [restore
profitability]{.mark}).]{.underline} [[This shows that capital as a mode
of production]{.mark} and social relations [is
transient.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Capitalism]{.mark} has not always
been here and it [has ultimate limits]{.mark}**, namely capital itself.
It has a 'use-by-date'. That is the essence of the law of profitability
for Marx]{.underline}. Alternative theories [This is not to deny other
factors in capitalist crises. The role of credit is an important part of
Marxist crisis theory and indeed, as the tendency of the rate of profit
to fall engenders countertendencies, one of increasing importance is the
expansion of credit and the switching of surplus value into investment
in fictitious capital rather than productive capital to raise
profitability temporarily, but with eventually disastrous consequences,
as The Great Recession shows]{.underline} ([The Great
Recession](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/the-great-recession.pdf);
[Debt
matters](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/debt-matters.pdf)).
Alternative theories of crisis like underconsumption, or the lack of
effective demand, are taken from theories from the reactionary Thomas
Malthus and the radical Sismondi in the early 19th century and then
taken up by Keynes in the 1930s and by modern inequality theorists like
Stiglitz and [post-Keynesian
economists](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=15854). But [[lack
of demand and rising inequality cannot explain]{.mark} the [regularity
of crises or predict the next one. These theories do not have strong
empirical backing]{.mark} either]{.underline} ([Does inequality causes
crises](https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/does-inequality-causes-crises.pdf)).
Professor Heinrich, after concluding that Marx did not have a theory of
crisis and dropped the law of profitability, [does offer a vague one of
his
own](https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/the-two-michaels-heinrich-and-roberts-in-berlin-dogmatism-versus-doubt/):
namely capital accumulates and produces more means of production
blindly. This gets out of line with consumption demand from workers. So
a 'gap' develops that has to be filled by credit, but somehow this
cannot hold up things indefinitely and production then collapses. Well,
it is a sort of a theory, but pretty much the same as the
underconsumption (overproduction) theory that Heinrich himself dismisses
and [Marx dismissed 150 years
ago.](http://www.mcg-j.org/swp_arc/english/etheory/economics/eprm29-2.htm)
It seems way less convincing or empirically supported that Marx's own
theory of crisis based on the law of profitability. [[**No other
theory,** whether from mainstream economics or]{.mark} from [heterodox
economics, **can explain**]{.mark} **recurrent and regular
[crises]{.mark}** and offer a clear objective foundation for the
transience of the capitalist system.]{.underline}

**[That [capitalism is unsustainable]{.mark} has long been empirically
observable.]{.underline}** Most obviously, manufacturing costs and
consumer commodity prices are trending towards zero[.]{.underline} For
example, whereas the world's fastest supercomputer in 1975 was worth
\$5m (\$32m in 2013's money), the price of an iPhone 4 released in 2010
with the equivalent performance was \$400. Aerospace companies producing
propulsion systems in 2010 for \$24m in 24 months are now 3-D printing
their engines for \$2,000 in two weeks. And rather than having
globalised supply chains, such companies foresee the entire rocket being
built in 'at home' \[7\]. While 'offshoring' manufacturing jobs to the
'low-income economies' is said to save up to 65% on labour costs,
replacing human workers with robots saves up to 90% \[8\]. Unlike
workers, robots do not need wages, breaks, sick days, holidays or
pensions. And they work quicker in the first place, too. While
industrialisation, particularly in Asia, saw 83 'developing countries'
achieving growth rates by the early 2000s that were more than twice the
rate of the 'developed' OECD members, the rest of the world has seen the
same opportunity end 'prematurely'. Latin America and Africa are already
deindustrialising (shifting to services-based workforces) -- from a much
lower starting point than Asia \[9\]. Whereas industrialisation peaked
in western European countries at income levels of around \$14,000, India
and many sub-Saharan African countries appear to have reached their peak
manufacturing employment at income levels of \$700 (both at 1990 levels)
\[10\]. Not only do robots and 3D-printing increasingly remove the
incentive for capitalists based in the US and Europe to exploit workers
overseas, the incentive to exploit transit workers -- who add production
time/value to the commodities they transport around the world -- is also
removed \[11\]. The emergence of cellular agriculture (lab-grown food),
with falling prices and rising quality estimated to see the beef
industry go bust by 2035, is going to have the same effect \[12\]. For
the past 145 years, the imperialist powers -- the US, Britain, France,
Germany and Japan -- have been increasingly compelled to export capital
(invest) overseas in order to expand and cheapen their exploitable
labour bases, thereby sustaining their own economies by living off
profits generated by commodity-producing workers in the 'developing
world'. Britain, for example, exported capital equal to 560% of its GDP
in 2014 \[13\]. Between 1980 and 2012 the net outflows of capital from
'developing' countries being funnelled into 'developed', ie imperialist
nations, totalled \$16.3 trillion \[14\]. But the economic relation that
underpins imperialism is now unravelling. [If prices are trending
historically towards zero, so too must the **['global' aggregate rate of
profit]{.mark}**. According to]{.underline} Estaban [Maito's estimates,
it [**fell in a secular trend** from 43% in the 1870s to 17% in the
2000s, **and is**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as of 2014) **[[on course to
reach zero around 2054]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[15\]. Automation and
absolute overaccumulation [But as]{.underline} the criminally
under-appreciated Polish Marxist Henryk [Grossman warned in 1929,
[capitalism is bound to collapse "much earlier than a zero rate of
profit"]{.mark}]{.underline} \[16\], because capital, inherently, does
not accumulate harmoniously -- the process tends to break down.
Overaccumulated capital -- surplus capital that has become unprofitable
to reinvest -- is inevitable. It causes every recession, a partial and
temporary breakdown, and is at the same time an underproduction of
surplus value; ie, too little profit has been generated to preserve and
expand the value of total capital. (Surplus value, or surplus labour
time, is the amount of value the capitalist appropriates from the
worker, who, on average, keeps only what they need to subsist, their
necessary labour time. Profit then is essentially unpaid labour, which
tends to increase with innovation. Hence falling prices.) Debt therefore
rises to 'fill the gap' caused by this underproduction, but can only
cover the lag in profit for so long before recession becomes inevitable,
since investors are bound to withdraw funds when growth becomes too
stagnant, channelling this new surplus instead into tax havens, land and
the competitive gambling of speculation that generates financial
'bubbles'. Each breakdown is overcome through the sufficient
destruction, cheapening and centralisation of capital. But the resulting
innovation means fewer workers tend to remain employed relative to total
capital. Despite the increased rate of exploitation that temporarily
lifts profit rates, the next overaccumulation tends to be greater than
the one which preceded it. There is no such thing as 'technological
unemployment' though -- alongside surplus capital grows unexploitable
surplus labour (unemployment). Clearly, the closer we get to the
completion of the historical trend towards fully-automated production,
the closer capitalism gets to its final breakdown. Production is already
highly automated. As James Manyika, McKinsey Global Institute director,
said in June 2017: "Find a factory anywhere in the world built in the
past five years  --  not many people work there." But the services jobs
-- relatively unproductive since they tend to handle near-finished
commodities, if they handle commodities at all -- that replaced
manufacturing work are now becoming increasingly automated, too. In
Britain, where services count for 80% of economic activity, the number
of supermarket checkout assistants fell by 25.3% between 2011 and 2017.
At the end of March, after most countries had entered lockdown, almost
half of company bosses in 45 countries said they were speeding up plans
to automate their businesses. \[17\] Innovation always takes place most
rapidly during a recession, when prices are low. With lockdown turning
the home into the place of work, Microsoft could boast of having
discovered a fresh way of reducing labour costs and extending absolute
labour time as it announced "two years' worth of digital transformation
in two months". As The Guardian reported at the end of April: "Bank
branches were already closing in droves before the epidemic, but here is
the perfect excuse to shut more. And that's not all. The authors of an
Oxford University study thought that by 2035 it would be possible to
automate 86% of restaurant jobs, three-quarters of retail jobs, and 59%
of recreation jobs. By unlucky coincidence, those are among the very
industries hardest hit by an epidemic now demanding quantum leaps in
efficiency if some companies are to avoid going under." \[18\] But
automation is abolishing the source of profit, ie, commodity-producing
human labour. To be more precise, automation is the final expression of
capitalism's self-abolishing tendency. As Marx wrote in 1858: "As soon
as labour in the direct form has ceased to be the great wellspring of
wealth, labour time ceases and must cease to be its measure\... Capital
thus works towards its own dissolution as the form dominating
production." \[19\] But this dissolution does not happen in a seamless
falling rate of profit towards zero, since -- as explained, and as
indicated by both zig-zagging profit rates and the recessions that tend
to strike roughly every 10 years -- capital does not accumulate
harmoniously. As the Soviet Russian philosopher Genrikh Volkov wrote in
1967, increasing automation eventually leads to "the breakdown, instead
of the consolidation, of the existing relations \... of the private
ownership of the means of production.... Its consummation is
incompatible with capitalism." \[20\] In Capital, Marx anticipates an
eventual "absolute overaccumulation" of capital. "The limit of
capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers," says Marx.
\[21\] But stretching the rate of exploitation of the working class to
anywhere near 100% is obviously impossible -- for starters, capital
cannot even afford to exploit an ever-increasing part of it, a surplus
population that grows alongside surplus capital, while workers in the
growing services sector are also relatively unproductive. "As the
capitalist mode of production develops, an ever larger quantity of
capital is required to employ the same, let alone an increased, amount
of labour-power." But there are other limits too: "As soon as capital
would, therefore, have grown in such a ratio to the labouring population
that neither the absolute working time supplied by this population, nor
the relative surplus working time, could be expanded any further (this
last would not be feasible at any rate in the case where the demand for
labour were so strong that there were a tendency for wages to rise); at
a point, therefore when the increased capital produced just as much, or
even less, surplus value than it did before its increase, there would be
absolute overproduction of capital." \[22\] From zero interest rates to
worldwide hyperinflation If the rate of profit is on course to hit zero
around 2054, but the final breakdown is bound to happen much earlier
than that, it at least becomes impossible to dismiss the theory that we
are entering this uncharted territory right now. But empirically,
[there]{.underline} also [seem to be [several approaching]{.mark}
economic limits or ['tipping points']{.mark} which [cannot be
converging]{.mark}]{.underline} at the same time [[merely by
coincidence. For starters, **average GDP growth rates
in**]{.underline}]{.mark} what the World Bank defines as [**['high
income countries' are]{.mark} already [closing in on zero]{.mark}**[,
having fallen every decade for the past half century]{.mark}: from 5.59%
in the 1960s, to 4.15% in the 1970s, 2.93% in the 1980s, 2.35% in the
1990s, and 1.78% in the 2000s.]{.underline} The figure rose slightly to
1.97% in the years 2010-2017, but this minor reprieve has already proven
to be unsustainable. GDP in the imperialist nations, though, is inflated
by the profits leached from the rest of the world, since much of the
profit from each commodity goes towards the GDP of the nation in which
it is sold, rather than where it was made. \[23\] Productivity growth in
the high income countries has itself, since 2011, spluttered below 1%.
**[[Aggregate global debt]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the total debt of
governments, corporations and households), [[already mountainous before
the Great Recession, **has hit new heights**]{.mark}, indicating
record-high overaccumulation]{.underline} \[24\]. According to the IMF,
global debt fell by 1.5% of GDP in 2017 compared to a year earlier, but
remained more than 11 percentage points of GDP above the previous high
in 2009. In June 2019, the IMF said global debt stood officially at
\$184 trillion, 225% of global GDP. This averages out at \$86,000 for
every person in the world, 2.5 times average annual per capita income.
But according to financial analyst Ron Surz, once 'off-the-books' net
obligations such as social security and health care are taken into
account, official figures are understated by a factor of 2.5, making
actual global debt \$460 trillion, 560% of GDP and \$215,000 per person
(as of July 2019) \[25\]. He put the US figure not at the official 105%,
but 390%. Even that is without taking into account the serious
accounting problem in the US Department of Defense. In 2016, before
Trump was elected, the department's Inspector General said he could not
properly track \$6.5 trillion in defence spending. An academic study
looking at the years 1998-2015 later put the figure at \$21 trillion
\[26\]. The US defence budget has ballooned to \$748bn as the long-time
imperialist superpower scrambles to hold on to its dying empire. Another
financial analyst, Simon [[Thorpe, calculated]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2015 [[that global debt was 2.5 times higher than]{.mark} the [global
money supply]{.mark}]{.underline} (up from two times higher in 2013)
\[27\]. This is despite the fact that the US's monetary base exploded
from \$842bn in August 2008 to \$2.9 trillion in January 2013 and then
\$4 trillion in August 2014. [[The sheer amount]{.mark} of debt [is
unsustainable since the tax base needed to pay it is]{.mark} obviously
[shrinking in relative terms.]{.mark}]{.underline} Though it has been
socialised, it is now simply too large to work off. Something the
capitalist state can do to ease the government's ability to pay its debt
is reduce interest rates, which also makes borrowing cheaper and
stimulates lending, maintaining the circulation of money. But lifting
the economy out of recession usually takes a 4-5% base interest rate
cut. [[In the US and across Europe **base rates are already at
zero**]{.mark}, having been cut by around only 2%. [Central banks have
said going negative would make the banks unviable.]{.mark} Therefore, it
is highly probable]{.underline} -- lockdown or no lockdown -- [that
**[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as Pento says, **[[is soon going
to spiral]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the first time in its history
[**[into]{.mark}** a crisis of **[worldwide
hyperinflation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, since rates will have to start
going back up to re-incentivise bond holding and sustain the tax base.
But debt-to-GDP -- already at record highs and rising -- will surge, and
so the tax base will continue to shrink; bondholders will realise that
what they are owed cannot be repaid and increasingly transfer their
funds into hard assets, especially precious metals. [[The only way to
avoid]{.mark} hyperinflation [is for states to default]{.mark} on their
debt through hyperdeflation]{.underline} -- which the record bailouts
imply they are understandably trying to avoid -- but that would happen
after hyperinflation anyway. The US's national annual deficit is now
expected to soar from \$984bn in 2019 to \$3.8 trillion in 2020. The US
has never meaningfully defaulted on its debt but, historically,
countries that have failed to get their debt-to-GDP back below 90% have
gone on to default, meaning they have had to go to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bail out (usually in the form of high-interest
loans and on the condition of privatising state assets). But given that
the US dollar is the world's reserve currency -- all oil must be traded
in US dollars, for example, making the solvency of all countries
dependent on their ability to purchase US dollars -- the IMF effectively
is the US. The US dollar has lost more than 96% of its value, its
purchasing power, since 1913. The figure is more than 99.5% for British
pound sterling, compared to 1694, the year it was founded \[28\]. This
is why negative rates would make the banks unviable -- they would finish
off the depreciation of fiat currency. Many countries, including Russia
and China, have started diversifying their foreign currency reserves in
the past few years, meaning the main source of financing US debt is
disappearing. Even the biggest US bank, JP Morgan, told its clients in
August 2019 to sell the dollar. The world economy will likely soon be
without a reserve currency. While smaller economies have survived
defaults through bailouts in the past, the US and western European
countries are the richest and most developed in the world. They
represent monopoly capitalism, or imperialism, the highest stage of
capitalism. As mentioned, with their workforces now largely
services-based, the imperialist nations have been largely living off of
profit produced by the labour of commodity-producing workers in Africa,
Asia and South America. If the imperialist economies collapse, it's
because the whole system has collapsed. Indeed, as of 7 March, investors
had already pulled \$83bn from developing markets, the largest capital
outflow ever recorded, according to the Institute of International
Finance. If all [[these converging factors]{.mark} -- near-zero prices,
flat productivity growth, unsustainably high debt, zero interest rates,
exhausted currencies -- do not [constitute a final breakdown of the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, then what will?

### Cap Bad\-\--Nuclear War

#### Capitalism ensures armed conflict\-\--profit compels militaristic statecraft and escalating crises\-\--nuclear war inevitable absent transition

**Campbell 14** \[Sally Campbell, "Why does Capitalism lead to war?,"
September 2014, Socialist Review,
http://socialistreview.org.uk/394/why-does-capitalism-lead-war\]

[The century since the slaughter in the First World War has been
littered with endless more bloody wars]{.underline}. Sally Campbell
argues the drive to war is not accidental but **[inherent in the logic
of capitalism]{.underline}**.

I[n the 20 years running up to the First World War there
were]{.underline} approximately [100 binding agreements]{.underline}
between the Great Powers [promising peaceful coexistence]{.underline}.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague was set up in 1899 "with
the object of seeking the most objective means of ensuring to all
peoples the benefits of a real and lasting peace, and above all, of
limiting the progressive development of existing armaments". This was at
the behest of the peace-loving Tsar Nicholas II of Russia (nickname:
Bloody Nicholas).

[It is fairly easy to understand why the ruler of a lesser power would
want to stem an arms race he knew he couldn't win]{.underline}. But
there was a wider, less cynical belief that somehow war could be avoided
by convincing the ruling classes of Europe to behave differently. After
all, war, so destructive of people and property, is surely not in the
interests of the system?

The left wing version of this notion was developed by Karl Kautsky, a
leading member of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), as the First
World War was beginning. Kautsky argued that it was only a section of
capitalism that benefited from war --- finance capitalists, whose
profits relied on export of capital and thus required ever-expanding
empires, and arms manufacturers, who relied on war and the threat of war
for their profits.

[This minority of the capitalist class]{.underline}, according to
Kautsky, [had managed to convince the majority of industrial capitalists
that they could only defend their interests in the colonies]{.underline}
--- raw materials and labour --- [through war and
empire-building]{.underline}. In fact, said Kautsky, the capitalists of
different nations could agree peacefully to divide up the world and
exploit it.

He wrote in Imperialism and the War (1914), "There is no economic
necessity for the continuation of the great competition in the
production of armaments after the close of the present war. At best such
a continuation would serve the interests of only a few capitalist
groups. On the contrary capitalist industry is threatened by the
conflicts between the various governments. Every far-sighted capitalist
must call out to his associates: Capitalists of all lands unite!"

Kautsky was for peace, but he believed there could be a capitalist peace
--- that imperialism was just one of several options for the system.

His Russian contemporaries, Lenin and Bukharin, strongly challenged this
idea. They developed the classic Marxist theory of imperialism,
centrally in Lenin's Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism and
Bukharin's Imperialism and World Economy. They argued that **[military
competition for markets between capitalist nations]{.underline}** [is an
inevitable development of peaceful competition]{.underline}. As [the
system aged it changed --- the small units of capital characteristic of
early capitalism swallow each other up into **larger and fewer concerns
and monopolies**.]{.underline}

At this stage of development, Bukharin argued, **[economics
is]{.underline}** organisationally **[fused with
politics]{.underline}**. [The sheer scale of production in the
industrialising nations could no longer be contained within the
geographical boundaries of the state and had to reach out beyond those
limits.]{.underline} [The **interests of these large firms are
increasingly merged with the state**]{.underline} --- and [it backs them
up politically and militarily in the name of the national
interest]{.underline}. **[It builds up armies and weapons, invades
countries where necessary to grab resources or to safeguard trade routes
and markets, establishes spheres of influence and alliances --- and it
will go to war against other powers to defend any of these
things]{.underline}**.

[Each war ends in a settlement, a new division of the world between the
powers,]{.underline} **[but these agreements never hold]{.underline}**.
**[Capitalism is a system locked into relentless
production]{.underline}**, [and this develops unevenly]{.underline} ---
**[some capitalist states will grow more quickly than others, and demand
a re-division of the world to favour them]{.underline}**.

This analysis of imperialism as "the method of competition between state
capitalist trusts" was true of the First World War, and the 1920s and
1930s confirmed it at a new level. The unprecedented economic crisis of
the period drove each national capital to turn to increasing degrees of
state intervention and direction along with protectionism and closed
trading blocks.

Nazi Germany was an extreme example of a state-directed economy in which
the needs of individual capitalists were subordinated to the needs of
national capital. Production was geared towards the military with the
aim of breaking into nearby markets currently closed to it. As in the
First World War, German capital took a gamble that, as a latecomer to
the imperialist table, it could grab the markets it needed to compete
with more established powers.

Churchill meets Stalin

The victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany paved the way for a new
re-division of the world. Even before the Second World War was over, in
October 1944, Churchill famously went to Russia to meet Stalin and
proposed a post-war division of Europe between the Allies, hurriedly
scribbled out on a note: "Romania: Russia 90% others 10%; Greece:
Britain 90% Russia 10%; Yugoslavia 50-50..." Stalin marked the page with
a tick and the agreement was made. But despite this, for the next 45
years the world would be locked into the Cold War, with the new great
powers grating against each other in a new formation.

Though they had been allies in the Second World War, Russia and the US
now took opposing sides, and though Churchill had carried the note to
Stalin, Britain was already losing its position in the global hierarchy.
The American H-bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima were as much
about asserting US dominance as smashing the Japanese regime. They were
not just a warning to Stalin, but to Britain, France and Germany too.

The shadow of the bomb hung heavy over the world in the immediate
post-war years, and the fact that all-out nuclear war didn't happen does
not mean that the threat wasn't real. The Cuban Missile Crisis in
October 1962 was the first time in history that the US military went to
DEFCON 2. It was a moment of real brinkmanship and, even though the US
had many more nuclear warheads than Russia, both had more than enough to
obliterate each other several times over.

The impact on society was huge. A whole number of films from the time
testify to how close the possibility of annihilation felt. The War Game,
a 1965 BBC film, told of a conventional war that escalated to nuclear
confrontation; 1964's Dr Strangelove and Fail-Safe both tell of
unintended missile launches that lead to all-out nuclear war; The
Bedford Incident (1965) ends with blistering celluloid as a nuclear
submarine explodes; while Ladybug, Ladybug (1963) examines the
distorting fear of living in a world so utterly out of our control.

This sense of alienation is important. As Lenin, and Marx before him,
pointed out, the capitalists are trapped by the system as much as
workers are. Each capitalist or group of capitalists represented in a
state is locked into competitive accumulation versus other capitalists.
Any capitalist who does not exploit in order to accumulate will be
driven out of business by others. [This relentless drive leads to
economic crises]{.underline}, leaving some capitalists bankrupt while
others benefit, [while in the longer term the whole system tends towards
stagnation and social crisis]{.underline}.

**[The consequences of this endless race are dire]{.underline}**. It is
clear today, for example, how such competitive accumulation is causing
catastrophic climate change with unprecedented speed.

[No individual capitalist controls the system and neither are they able
to group together with all the other capitalists in what]{.underline}
Kautsky called [a "super-imperialism" to peacefully and rationally run
the world]{.underline}. [Any capitalist who tries to understand the
destructive dynamic and change their behaviour would]{.underline},
again, [be driven out of business by their competitors. As long
as]{.underline} [they stay in the game they benefit from it in wealth
and power. So they tend to identify with their system, call it
civilisation, and **fight to defend it**.]{.underline}

So [while]{.underline} the notion of **[nuclear world war
is]{.underline}** in many ways completely **[irrational]{.underline}**
--- missile madness --- it **[also flows completely logically out
of]{.underline}** the level of development of
**[capitalism]{.underline}** in the 20th century. As Lenin wrote in
1917, "[The capitalists partition the world,]{.underline} not out of
personal malice, but [because the degree of concentration which has been
reached forces them to adopt this method in order to get
profits."]{.underline} Since the end of the Second World War [this
partitioning and repartitioning has been **enforced through the threat
of nuclear force among other things**.]{.underline}

The fight against war

It is important to understand the systemic causes of war because it
leads to particular conclusions about how to campaign against and how to
end war. In the 1950s and 1960s a mass movement against nuclear weapons
grew up, led by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). It involved
hundreds of thousands of people in marches, protests, meetings and
debates. "Ban the bomb" is a slogan that any decent human being can get
behind, and they did. But it also suggests a particular kind of
politics, namely that we can have capitalism without the bomb, if only
we can convince a broad enough layer of society to reject it and
politicians to legislate against it.

[Socialists argued that the bomb is a class issue]{.underline}. We have
to be part of peace and anti-war movements and build them. But we also
have to do that by agitating for an anti-war, anti-imperialist position
among workers who may not currently reject war --- because it is they
who have an interest in overthrowing the whole system. This is precisely
what socialist John Maclean did in Glasgow's Clydeside during the First
World War.

The threat of [nuclear war receded after Cuba]{.underline} and up until
the "New Cold War" of the early 1980s. [There were still
wars,]{.underline} notably in Korea and Vietnam, [and there were
tensions within the blocs]{.underline} --- China versus Russia, Western
Europe failing to back the US in Vietnam. [But the end of the world
feeling dissipated]{.underline}. This was not because of any change of
heart from the ruling classes, but because the post-war economic boom
allowed all sides to expand without treading on each other too badly.

The US was able to win the Cold War in the end because it forced Russia
into a new arms race in the 1980s, which bankrupted it. [American
capitalism used its military might to attempt to force a new division of
the wor]{.underline}ld. It wanted to defeat the Russian empire in order
to stop it from grabbing more resources --- e.g. West Germany with its
skilled workforce and highly developed industries --- and to extend its
own influence further east, through expanding Nato. The US also sought
to exert its influence over Western Europe and bring France and West
Germany into line.

But [Russia was also locked into this battle. It had to attempt to keep
up with the West in order to defend its own markets and
resources]{.underline} --- even if the price was risking internal unrest
as people's living standards were driven down while all resources were
poured into new missiles systems.

The Cold War was not a clash of ideologies, but a struggle between
different competing sections of international capitalism. [Military
conflict can]{.underline}, of course, [take on its own logic beyond the
immediate parameters of economic competition, but the]{.underline}
**[economic base always reasserts itself]{.underline}**. It is the
fundamental defining factor.

After the Cold War

Since the end of the Cold War we have seen new missile defence systems
put in place, such as George W Bush's "Son of Star Wars" programme,
which can nuke us from outer space. We've seen the neocons (who believed
Nixon's problem in Vietnam was his unwillingness to use nuclear weapons)
running the US and instigating the "war on terror". It seems likely that
they were willing to use nuclear weapons against Iran --- but were
prevented by the massive worldwide movement against war in Iraq.

We have seen the US-backed settler state in the Middle East, Israel,
attack Palestine again and again, and we have seen Nato's rivalry with
Russia played out once again in Ukraine. President Obama, though he
seemed so different from George W, has been driven to engage in numerous
wars in his six years in office.

For the most part, [wars since 1945 have not played out in capitalism\'s
heartlands]{.underline}; it has been [millions of people in poorer parts
of the globe that have suffered the most]{.underline}. In part [this is
because of the growing interpenetration of the wealthiest parts of
capitalism]{.underline} --- Europe, the US and East Asia. [Most
capitalists will avoid destroying their own capital invested in other
states if possible.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the logic of [imperialism
remains and will always **drive capitalists to clash with each
other**]{.underline}.

This does not mean that [cataclysmic nuclear world war]{.underline} is
inevitable, but it does mean that [the only way to ensure against
it]{.underline} permanently [is to]{.underline} do all we can to [foster
working class self-emancipation]{.underline}. This was the conclusion
Lenin's theory of imperialism led to --- and it was the reality of what
the Bolsheviks did in Russia during the First World War. They built an
anti-imperialist movement from the factory floor up --- and it ended the
war on the Eastern Front.

[The people I have [interviewed]{.mark}]{.underline}, [from Daniel
Ellsberg to Larry Wilkerson, who used to be Colin [Powell's chief of

[[diplomats, military people]{.underline}. [They all think that nuclear
war is not likely. **They think it is assured**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
It's not that there's a chance, they think, of nuclear war. **[They
think there is 100 % certainty]{.underline}** [that if things continue
as they are at some point sooner, it could be today or tomorrow or
later, it could be some years from now, [there will

war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The safeguards simply aren't safe enough,
and that this new investment, the new nuclear arms race that has started
under Obama, but it's also happening under Putin, driven by the
military-industrial complexes of Russia and the United States, although
the Americans are certainly more the instigators. But [these whole new
whack of [nuclear weapons are coming online and the old ones that still
exist]{.mark} and in deteriorating situations [that are not
safe]{.mark}, the [possibility of accidental nuclear war]{.mark} is not
possible]{.underline}, it **[[is certain]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They
think the possibility of some kind of terrorist attack using dirty bombs
could be mistaken for an attack by a major power. And if the dirty bomb
went off in New York, as someone would have put a small nuclear bomb in
a container ship and it blows up in New York Harbor, there's only a 10
second window. We're still on a hair-trigger alert between Russia and
the United States. 10 seconds for the militaries of both countries to
decide, if what just happened was an attack or terrorist attack, an
accident, ten seconds.

All the people are not talking 10 minutes. You're talking ten seconds.

Paul Jay

Ten seconds. Hair-trigger that on a radar map they see blips coming in
to decide whether it's geese or bombers. Everyone uses the same phrase.
It is a miracle we are still here. The miracle is because, on several
occasions, I think it's close to a dozen If the protocols had been
followed the soldiers who saw the blips or depending on the case, what
the situation was. But they didn't follow orders. And that's why we're
still here talking about it. And I know if you want, I can give a couple
examples of those cases.

I know it's out there in the press somewhat, but I learned more about it
in talking with Daniel Ellsberg. I'm working on a film with Ellsberg,
which is kind of why I'm into this topic because before I started
interviewing Ellsberg, I was in nuclear war denial as much as everybody
else was. It was just not anywhere near the front of my consciousness.
You know, all of this, I think when the Cold War ended, just kind of the
whole anti-nuclear movement went away, and people thought, oh, well, you
know, Russia and United States are going to get along now. They'll
figure out the old nukes and all this, and it just receded as an issue.
But all the people that know the issue say it's actually more dangerous
now than it was during the Cold War. But Ellsberg woke me up to this.
And one of the stories in his book, Doomsday Machine, and this
documentary series I'm going to be doing is based on that book, it was
during the Cuban Missile Crisis. There was a Russian submarine
underneath the American ships as the American ships were blockading
Cuba. What the Americans didn't know is that the Russians had a protocol
that if the submarine was out of contact with Moscow for 48 hours, if
they couldn't establish radio communication, they should assume nuclear
war had broken out and fire. They had some kind of nuclear-tipped small
missiles, and they were only 40 miles off the coast of the United
States. And they should fire into the United States, assuming that
Russia had been attacked, the Soviet Union had been attacked.

Well, while the Americans didn't know about that protocol, what the
Russians didn't know is the Americans had figured out how to jam
communication between the submarine and Moscow. So the communication
does go down for 48 hours because it's being jammed. The Russians don't
know that that's the reason. The 48 hours go by, and it's time to break
out the envelopes that give the trigger orders to shoot order. So they
bring out the envelope, and the protocol is three senior officers have
to sign that they've agreed it's appropriate to fire. So the captain
signs, number two in command signs and then it's up to the number three.
Number three is the guy who's the party official, and he represents the
Soviet Communist Party on the ship, and he has to sign and he refuses.
He says, "What if this is a technical problem?" And he actually gets
disciplined when he gets home, but it's only because he refused to sign
that nuclear war didn't break out during the Cuban crisis. And then
there's other examples like this both in Ellsberg's book, and other
places. We're only here because a few people refused to follow orders.
And it is a miracle.

Who owns the nuclear weapons production industry? And is it very
profitable?

Paul Jay

Well, **[[profit is what it's all about]{.mark}, and this]{.underline}**
is what's ridiculous. [People have to understand how systemically
dangerous capitalism is now]{.underline}. And this nothing says it more
than the fact that **[it [purely profits driving the nuclear war
strategy]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
Daniel Ellsberg has a line which he says [the **nuclear weapons
program**]{.underline} after World War Two **[was a commercial subsidy
for the aerospace industry.]{.underline}** That there simply was no
military justification to develop a nuclear weapons program after World
War Two. He points to the ICBM. The **[whole ICBM program is
obsolete]{.underline}**. Billions and billions invested in the existing
ICBM and new ICBM are coming online. But ICBM is, according to all the
military experts that I've read, are easy targets. Intelligence on both
sides, Russia and the United States and Chinese, for that matter. The
Chinese are a little bit of an exception here because the Chinese have
not built their nuclear force out anywhere near to the extent of Russia
and the United States. But they know where the ICBM is, They're
essentially targets and they're not that effective as a deterrent. What
is effective as a deterrent are nuclear-armed submarines because they
move around. It's hard to track where they are and they have more than
enough armaments to end life on Earth. But [ICBM continues because
they're very expensive and the armaments industry makes tons of money
out of making them]{.underline}. But if you want to go to the beginnings
of this and understand the profit motive, I interviewed a guy named
Lester Ernest and he was part of a program at M.I.T. in around
1959/1960.

He had joined the army. He got into the early computer program of the
U.S. Army. When he got out, M.I.T. asked him to come and he started
working on something called the Sage Radar System. And the Sage Radar
System is in the Dr. Strangelove movie and maybe in some others. And you
see this great big board where they can track incoming airplanes and
then they supposedly know everything. And the Stage Radar System was
connected to bomarc missiles. And what Sage would do is if Russian
bombers were flying in, the computer system, and this was the largest
gathering of computer power in the history of the world, at the time.
And in fact, some of the technology that led to the creation of the
Internet came out of the work done to develop the Sage radar system.

And they were going to track these bombers and then hit them with bomb
arc missiles. And this gave everyone the assurance that the United
States would be safe with developing their own nuclear armaments threat.
And this defense system, they didn't have to worry. There was even an
underlying suggestion that the United States could conduct a first
strike against the Soviet Union and still be safe because of sage and
the Bomarc missiles.

So anyway, Lester goes to work at M.I.T. and he gets there in two or
three days. And he turns to one of his colleagues and he says, 'How did
you guys figure out the radar jamming systems?' Because we know the
Soviet planes and our planes, everybody's got radar jamming now. And
Lester told me and I have this on camera, Lester says, 'There's a long
silence. And the guy says to him, well, we didn't really figure that
out. And Lester says, 'Well, then none of this works. And the guy says,
well, we don't talk about that,'. The whole thing was a fraud. They
spent in today's dollars a trillion dollars over about 25 years. And the
whole thing was a scam. And the manufacturers of the Sage Radar System,
the manufacturer of the bomarc missiles, which they then, this is
another great one. I love this one. Lesters has to go to Congress. And
this is asked by the armaments people, some of the Pentagon people, to
go to Congress and get them to agree that the Bomark missiles that are
going to shoot down these Soviet planes should be armed with nuclear
missiles, nuclear warheads. I said to Lester, I said, 'hold on for a
second, so you're gonna go to Congress and get them to recommend that
Soviet bombers flying over Canada and the United States with nuclear
weapons are going to be hit by missiles with nuclear weapons'. And all
this is going to happen over Canadian and American territory. And this
is making everyone safe. I said, I'm sorry excuse my language, 'That's
F'ing insane', and Lester says, 'Of course it's insane'. I said, 'did
you do it?' He said, 'yeah, I went and they agreed. And the Bomarc
missiles were armed with nuclear-tipped nuclear missiles'. I said, 'why
did you do it?'. He said, 'you know, we were just at that point in it
for the money. We all thought we were all going to die. We all thought
nuclear war was going to end everything. And we were just so cynical and
we were getting paid so much. And the whole culture was about money
sloshing around the manufacturers of the radar, the weapons and so on.
The Pentagon, everybody was in on it and we went along with it'. He's
since regrets at all. He became the founder of the artificial
intelligence lab at Stanford University and fought for open source and
against trademark and copyrights and things. It kind of woke him up
eventually.

But [this whole fraud is at the heart of nuclear war
planning]{.underline}. As we know that that [**nuclear war** doesn't now
just mean the destruction of all the major cities]{.underline} of the
United States, the Soviet Union, of course, Europe is gone. But [it used
to be thought]{.underline}, oh, well, that's only the northern
hemisphere. At least humans will survive in the southern hemisphere.
Well, that's not true either. It's now pretty clear that there'll be
something called **[nuclear winter]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} that
the **[firestorms]{.underline}** [created by the burning of the cities
will create so much smoke and ash in the atmosphere, that will be the
**end of agriculture** all around the globe.]{.underline} And this
business, the manufacturing of the nuclear weapons, the Pentagon
strategists, Congress that buys into it, Obama and then Trump and of
course, all of the presidents since Truman. **[They go along with this
because of the pressure of the military-industrial
complex]{.underline}** and the whole culture of proving that America's
the greatest Hegemon and so on. **[It's put life on Earth at
risk.]{.underline}** But while there are political considerations,
geopolitical considerations, this is still the grand chessboard for the
people that think about these things. The heart of it is money making.

Michael

We've got about ten more minutes, Paul. I've got three more questions
for you. Does America's dominant global commercial position depend on
military might, including the nuclear arsenal?

Paul Jay

That's a good question. It certainly doesn't depend on the nuclear
arsenal, really. But that's not to say the nuclear arsenal isn't used.
It is used as a threat against non-nuclear countries. Take Iran. There's
always sort of in the back of the confrontational discourse between the
United States and Iran, the threat that a tactical nuclear weapon could
be used against Iran. And in fact, Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire who
is the big supporter of the far-right forces in Israel, and he helped
elect Trump, he's the one that financed Trump. He's actually said on a
panel in 2013, in New York, that the United States should seriously
consider dropping a tactical nuclear weapon in an Iranian desert to send
the Iranians a message of what's in store for them. And as insane as
that is, and insane as Sheldon Adelson is. Sheldon Adelson has the ear
of Donald Trump. And even before that, Adelson had the ear of very
powerful Republicans that he would donate money to. So nuclear weapons
are a threat to help enforce American dominance but it's not needed. Is
the military might needed? Well, look at the inroads China's making.
China's become the greatest trading partner of Brazil. It's the number
two or number one trading partner of every other country in Latin
America. It's ahead of the United States now in Africa. It certainly
competes with and in many countries is ahead of commercial relationships
throughout Asia. So where is this great military machine preventing the
growth of the commercial power of China? It's not. So the competition
for a commercial hegemony, commercial global dominance, the military may
be in the older days played that kind of role where Americans would
directly go intervene with American troops and do regime change and get
a pro-American regime. But how'd that work out in Iraq? They not only
did not get a pro-American government, they did not even get control of
the oil in Iraq. Interestingly enough, Chinese oil companies last I saw
had more contracts than the American ones did because of the great
anti-American sentiment amongst the Iraqi people. They got a government
in Iraq that's at least as aligned with Iran as it is with the United
States.

You know, those days of being able to just go in and get regime change,
like look at Libya. Libya was a grab. Libyan war was about Libyan oil,
obviously. Well, whichever's chaos and the Russians are making a big
inroad in Libyan oil. So where is it that the military supports such
commercial dominance? I'm not saying it doesn't do anything. I'm sure in
some situations the power of the American armed forces, certainly in the
Middle East, where they in Bahrain, where they have a big fleet. The
fact that the army is right there, it helps prop up the monarchy of
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. It's not that it doesn't play any role, but it
doesn't play that significant role because every time they actually try
to use the military to intervene, it's a debacle.

Michael

Paul Jay. Why, in this time of the COVID 19 pandemic, the great civil
unrest, 40 million people unemployed, why is this a good time to raise
the issue of nuclear disarmament?

Paul Jay

Well, because the threat is so imminent and most people have no sense of
it at all. Even on the left, when I tell people I'm working on a film
with Ellsberg about the Doomsday Machine, they raise their eyebrows and
say, well, we've lived we've survived it this long. There's no reason to
think we won't survive it longer. And the climate is far more dangerous
an issue with the climate crisis. And, well, I would say the answer's
two things. One is, would you do want to trust a class political
institutions that couldn't deal with a virus with nuclear weapons and
Armageddon? You're going to trust our fate to those people? They
couldn't prepare for a virus that they knew about for years. These are
the people you're going to trust with the survival of humans. The second
reason I say why now is I think the pandemic has made the unthinkable
thinkable. This idea, even though we knew there was a pandemic coming,
it just wasn't real, it was abstract. The same way climate change is
still abstract for so many people. But it's a dose of reality and it's a
shredding of the sort of bubble that entertainment culture creates that
we're all, you know, as long as you're not poor, as long as you're not a
poor person of color, life is OK and okay, enough that it's better to
just live in the comfort of denial. Well, the pandemic has broken down a
lot of that comfort of denial. The other thing about the issue of
nuclear weapons, while there are some immediate issues that need to be
demanded, for example, the elimination of ICBM's, the reduction at the
very least of nuclear weapons down to 10 or 20 at the max, enough that
you could say there's a deterrent because Ellsberg believes you just
can't win the argument at this stage of not having any weapons at all.
But you make the situation so much safer if you're down to 10 or 20 and
not thousands.

So that's an immediate issue. But when you go beyond that kind of issue,
**[the solution to the problem of the nuclear threat is the
same]{.underline}** solution [as it is for climate]{.underline} crisis.
Frankly, it's the same solution for dealing with future
[pandemics]{.underline}. It's the same solution for dealing with
[poverty]{.underline}. We have to deal with who has power. [We have to
deal with democratizing the economy and the]{.underline} development of
converting military production to green production and democratizing
politics. And it's all about developing, I think, public economic
institutions, starting with banking as a public utility and eroding the
power of Wall Street. Because you asked **[who owns the nuclear
armaments manufacturing companies?]{.underline}**

Well, [[the same companies]{.mark} that interesting [enough on the
media, the same institutional investors,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[BlackRock]{.underline}]{.mark}, Vanguard, State Street, [the other big
asset managers and financial institutions that own]{.underline} 93% of
[the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**ew **[Y]{.underline}**ork
**[T]{.underline}**imes [own Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, **[the
12 companies that are the major manufacturers of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}** are all primarily [owned by the same institutional
investors]{.mark} that control]{.underline}, ready for this, **[90% of
the S&P 500]{.underline}**. [The concentration of ownership that's taken
place since 2007/08 crisis where these massive asset management
companies like BlackRock]{.underline}, led by this guy, Larry Fink, who
might be Biden's secretary of the Treasury.

BlackRock is the company that just got handed the contract by the
Federal Reserve to dole out this trillion to 700 billion or trillion. I
can't remember the number, to corporations, and so on. [[They **own**
the companies that **make**]{.mark} **all the weapons, including
[nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The same companies own the
majority controlling interest of all the major fossil fuel companies,
except for Total from France]{.underline}. They owned all the major
corporate media, with the exception of Bloomberg, which is privately
owned, and the Washington Post, which is privately owned. But everything
that's publicly owned is controlled by the same massive asset management
companies. And it's not like this is the evil Dr. Strangelove. These
guys are just, that's what they do.

[[They invest and they need **maximum return on their
capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Like whose money is BlackRock
investing]{.underline}? Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds,
billionaires' money. Between the three top asset management companies,
they control 14 trillion dollars. That's more than the GDP of China.
Bloomberg says by 2020, their going to control more assets than the GDP
of the United States[. **[It's a machine]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. It's
a blind machine]{.underline}**. **[[The way this capitalism
works]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The consciousness it creates in the people
that are the elites and the people that manage these big institutions,
they may individually understand how bloody insane it is, just the way
Lester Earnest understood how insane the Sage Radar System was. But they
can't stop doing it. It's just what it is and who they are. [It only
changes with a mass movement that demands these kinds of economic and
democratic reforms with power in the streets that far surpasses what
we're seeing and far more conscious]{.underline}, not burning down
buildings for no reason, but millions and millions of people in the
streets combined with an electoral strategy to elect progressive
candidates. And if we don't do it, we're doomed.

**Herrine '20** \[Luke; September 14; PhD Candidate at Yale Law School;
"A tribute to David Graeber,"
https://lpeproject.org/blog/david-graeber-tribute/\]

[Graeber's lesson is not that]{.underline} [**[once we see the
arbitrariness of our institutions]{.underline}** [we]{.underline}
]{.mark}[should come to [realize]{.mark} that we have no obligations to
each other and disobey anything]{.underline} that do not fully endorse
in the moment. Rather, to borrow a trick from the Marxian account of
(commodity) fetishism: we should not become alienated from our own
(social) labor. **[We [create]{.mark}/reproduce [the social forms that
shape our lives]{.mark}, and we can recreate them in an infinite number
of ways]{.underline}**. [But that does not mean social forms do not have
power over us. There is no way to create a world without social forms
that are somehow outside of our power.]{.underline}

This account--to the extent I have done it any justice--names exactly
the sort of dynamic that the American Legal Realists and their allies in
Europe were getting at.

Realism is often treated as a pure form of functionalism: the internal
logic of socio-legal forms should be ignored in favor of asking how a
given legal rule serves broader policy goals. Law and economics has
claimed the mantle of realism under this guise: all legal rules should
be seen as instrumental to the maximization of an exogenously defined
social welfare function. CLS has done so in a different way: taking
legal forms too seriously is a form of false consciousness to avoid
confronting the real, deep, existential-moral question of how to strive
for a society totally free of alienation and domination. When liberal
legal theorists talk about realism, it is usually just the slogan "every
legal question is actually a policy question" that they have in mind.

[Graeber's essay]{.underline} on fetish [should help to encourage the
alternative possibility that [being against]{.mark} the reification of
[**existing legal forms** is not to **abandon** ]{.mark}**the importance
of [form]{.mark}s [altogether]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Doing so requires
embracing paradox, but the paradox is merely a feature of living in a
world of our own creation. We need illusions and performances even if we
know they are "only" illusions and performances.

It is not a coincidence that Karl Llewellyn, on page 454 of "A Realistic
Jurisprudence: The Next Step" calls [the "realistic" approach to legal
analysis "of a piece with the work of the modern
ethnographer."]{.underline}

What Lewellyn was after was a way to make sense of the fact [that [legal
practice depends on dividing up the world into relatively **stable
social forms**]{.mark}]{.underline} an[d [yet]{.mark} it must
[avoid]{.mark} the "tendency of the crystallized legal concept \[or
form\] to persist after the fact model from which the concept \[or
form\] was once derived." **What is required, then, is ["constant
back-checking of the category against the data]{.mark}**]{.underline},
to see whether the data are present in the form suggested by the
category-name." For example: [[does **the legal
form/concept**]{.underline}]{.mark} "employee",
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it was, [[with certain
assumptions]{.mark} about how industry would be organized, **[still
serve in a fissured world when those assumptions no longer
hold]{.mark}**]{.underline} (assuming they ever did)?

Graeber goes much further than Llewellyn does--a different both of
disciplinary and political proclivity. He wants not just a more flexible
form of jurisprudence (which an older Llewellyn would refer to as "The
Grand Style"), but a world more like that which existed on the northwest
coast of Africa before the Europeans pillaged it:

[[a world of almost constant **social creativity**]{.underline}]{.mark};
in [which few arrangements]{.underline} \[are\] fixed and permanent,
and, even more, where there \[is\] little feeling that they really
should be fixed and permanent; in which, in short, [[people were indeed
in a **constant process of imagining new social
arrangements**]{.underline}]{.mark} and then trying to bring them into
being. Gods could be created, and discarded or fade away, because social
arrangements themselves were never assumed to be immutable.

[What is a revolution? We used to think we knew.]{.underline}
[Revolutions were seizures of power by popular forces aiming to
transform the very nature of the political, social, and economic system
in the country in which the revolution took place, usually according to
some visionary dream of a just society.]{.underline} Nowadays, we live
in an age when, if rebel armies do come sweeping into a city, or mass
uprisings overthrow a dictator, it's unlikely to have any such
implications; when profound social transformation does occur---as with,
say, the rise of feminism---it's likely to take an entirely different
form. It's not that revolutionary dreams aren't out there. But
[contemporary revolutionaries rarely think they can bring them into
being by some modern-day equivalent of storming the
Bastille.]{.underline} At moments like this, it generally pays to go
back to the history one already knows and ask: [Were revolutions ever
really what we thought them to be]{.underline}? For me, the person who
has asked this most effectively is the great world historian Immanuel
Wallerstein. He argues that for the last quarter millennium or so,
[revolutions have consisted above all of planetwide transformations of
political common sense.]{.underline} Already by the time of the French
Revolution, Wallerstein notes, there was a single world market, and
increasingly a single world political system as well, dominated by the
huge colonial empires. As a result, the storming of the Bastille in
Paris could well end up having effects on Denmark, or even Egypt, just
as profound as on France itself---in some cases, even more so. Hence he
speaks of the "world revolution of 1789," followed by the "world
revolution of 1848," which saw revolutions break out almost
simultaneously in fifty countries, from Wallachia to Brazil. In no case
did the revolutionaries succeed in taking power, but afterward,
institutions inspired by the French Revolution---notably, universal
systems of primary education---were put in place pretty much everywhere.
Similarly, the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a world revolution
ultimately responsible for the New Deal and European welfare states as
much as for Soviet communism. The last in the series was the world
revolution of 1968---which, much like 1848, broke out almost everywhere,
from China to Mexico, seized power nowhere, but nonetheless changed
everything. This was a revolution against state bureaucracies, and for
the inseparability of personal and political liberation, whose most
lasting legacy will likely be the birth of modern feminism.
[[Revolutions are thus planetary phenomena]{.underline}.]{.mark} [But
there is more. [What they really do is **transform basic assumptions
about what politics is ultimately about**]{.mark}**. [In the wake of a
revolution, ideas that had been considered veritably lunatic fringe
quickly become the accepted currency of debate]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Before the French Revolution, the ideas that change is good, that
government policy is the proper way to manage it, and that governments
derive their authority from an entity called "the people" were
considered the sorts of things one might hear from crackpots and
demagogues]{.underline}]{.mark}, or at best a handful of freethinking
intellectuals who spend their time debating in cafés. A generation
later, even the stuffiest magistrates, priests, and headmasters had to
at least pay lip service to these ideas. [Before long, we had reached
the situation we are in today: that it's necessary to lay out the terms
for anyone to even notice they are there. They've become common sense,
the very grounds of political discussion. Until 1968, most world
revolutions really just introduced practical refinements]{.underline}:
an expanded franchise, universal primary education, the welfare state.
The world revolution of 1968, in contrast---whether it took the form it
did in China, of a revolt by students and young cadres supporting Mao's
call for a Cultural Revolution; or in Berkeley and New York, where it
marked an alliance of students, dropouts, and cultural rebels; or even
in Paris, where it was an alliance of students and workers---was a
rebellion against bureaucracy, conformity, or anything that fettered the
human imagination, a project for the revolutionizing of not just
political or economic life, but every aspect of human existence. As a
result, in most cases, the rebels didn't even try to take over the
apparatus of state; they saw that apparatus as itself the problem. It's
fashionable nowadays to view the social movements of the late sixties as
an embarrassing failure. A case can be made for that view. It's
certainly true that in the political sphere, the immediate beneficiary
of any widespread change in political common sense---a prioritizing of
ideals of individual liberty, imagination, and desire; a hatred of
bureaucracy; and suspicions about the role of government---was the
political Right. Above all, the movements of the sixties allowed for the
mass revival of free market doctrines that had largely been abandoned
since the nineteenth century. It's no coincidence that the same
generation who, as teenagers, made the Cultural Revolution in China was
the one who, as forty-year-olds, presided over the introduction of
capitalism. Since [the eighties, "freedom" has come to mean "the
market," and "the market" has come to be seen as identical with
capitalism]{.underline}---[even]{.underline}, ironically, [in places
like China, which had known sophisticated markets for thousands of
years, but rarely anything that could be described as
capitalism.]{.underline} The ironies are endless. [[While the new free
market ideology has framed itself above all as a rejection of
bureaucracy, it has, in fact, been responsible for the first
administrative system that has operated on a planetary
scale]{.underline}, [with its endless layering of public and private
bureaucracies]{.underline}: [the IMF, World Bank, WTO, trade
organizations, financial
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} transnational
[corporations]{.underline}, NGOs. [This is precisely the system that has
imposed free market orthodoxy]{.underline}, and opened the world to
financial pillage, [under the watchful aegis of American arms. It only
made sense that [the first attempt to recreate a global revolutionary
movement]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the Global Justice Movement that peaked
between 1998 and 2003, was effectively a **rebellion against the rule of
that very planetary bureaucracy.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Future Stop In
retrospect, though, I think that later historians will conclude that the
legacy of the sixties revolution was deeper than we now imagine, and
that the triumph of capitalist markets and their various planetary
administrators and enforcers---which seemed so epochal and permanent in
the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991---was, in fact, far
shallower. I'll take an obvious example. [[One often hears that antiwar
protests in the late sixties and early seventies were ultimately
failures]{.underline}]{.mark}, since they did not appreciably speed up
the U.S. withdrawal from Indochina. [[But afterward, those controlling
U.S. foreign policy were so anxious about being met with similar popular
unrest---and even more, with unrest within the military itself]{.mark},
which was genuinely falling apart by the early seventies---[that they
refused to commit U.S. forces to any major ground conflict]{.mark} for
almost thirty years.]{.underline} [[It took 9/11,]{.underline}]{.mark}
an attack that led to thousands of civilian deaths on U.S. soil,
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [fully [overcome]{.mark} the notorious
"[Vietnam syndrome"---and even then, the war planners made an almost
obsessive effort to ensure the wars were effectively
protest-proof]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Propaganda was incessant,
the media was brought on board, experts provided exact calculations on
body bag counts (how many U.S. casualties it would take to stir mass
opposition), and the rules of engagement were carefully written to keep
the count below that.

The creation of new regulatory institutions to implement these economic
policies and to govern the modern economy points to another set of
strategies employed by Progressive Era thinkers to counteract
domination: changes to the structure of the political process. The
creation of regulatory agencies and commissions at state, local, and
national levels offered reformers the hope of an effective new tool for
managing the increasingly complex modern economy, asserting the public
good against powerful private actors such as trusts or corporations, and
sidestepping the problems of political corruption and capture within
legislatures. [[To expand]{.mark} democratic **[agency]{.mark}** to
counteract economic domination,]{.underline} these [reformers
effectively reinvented the fundamental structure of the political
process itself, creating new channels for the expression of popular
sovereignty]{.underline}. Thus reformers succeeded in institutionalizing
ballot, recall, initiative, and referendum procedures in many state
constitutions from 1890 to 1912. 85 Others established, for the first
time, home rule powers for local government bodies as a way to expand
participation and bypass the corruption of state legislatures and party
machines. 86

In a similar vein, [today [we might address]{.mark} the problem of
disparate political power by [seeki]{.mark}ng [**alternative vehicles**
for democratic collective]{.mark} [action through which to build the
power of ordinary citizens]{.mark} and communities.]{.underline} The
battle for reviving democratic accountability and responsiveness is not
exhausted by a sole focus on campaign finance reform or voting rights,
though of course both are critical to rebalancing political power. There
are other forms of building democratic political power. Today, [[we see
a similar revival of interest in]{.mark} cities as [spaces for policy
experimentation, as offering small]{.mark}er-scale foot[holds]{.mark}
where reformers can put into practice alternative economic arrangements,
[with an eye towards larger **national debate** and **eventual policy
change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 87

Regulatory agencies, though often understood in technocratic,
expertise-oriented terms, might similarly become spaces for democratic
action, participation, and accountability. Recent developments in legal
history document the ways in which regulatory agencies have served as
critical spaces in which democratic politics have taken place, and
modern policy regimes and normative understandings of rights have been
forged out of contestation between different stakeholders and
policymakers. 88 Administrative agencies are therefore routinely in the
forefront of developing novel applications of moral and political claims
that we might otherwise think are the province of legislatures and
courts, from the administration of welfare benefits to the
implementation of fair-housing principles. 89 Such \"administrative
constitutionalism\" involves the creative interpretation and evolution
of legal norms and moral-rights claims by bureaucrats faced with
pressure from social movements, often operating beyond or even despite
the commands of the President, Congress, or the courts. 90

Agencies can be reformed to provide more direct forms of stakeholder
representation. 91 In both cities and regulation, we also see attempts
to create more participatory policymaking processes that can help
redress disparities of influence and power, from participatory budgeting
to technology-facilitated modes of voice and citizen monitoring of
government actions. 92

Finally, across both of these domains of economic and political
restructuring, a key driver of redressing power comes from the
mobilization and organization of social movements. If the reform
politics of the Progressive Era and the critique of domination were
interrelated with the emergence of the antitrust movement, labor
republicanism, populism, and urban reformism, the prospects for economic
and political restructuring today depend crucially on new forms of civic
power developed by movements and civil society organizations. 93 Many
activists and reformers in this period sought to mobilize citizens
through political association as a way to create a more equitable
balance of political power. 94

IV\. Constitutional Political Economy and Fourth-Wave Legal Realism

This admittedly brief recasting of legal realist and Progressive Era
thought highlights some valuable starting points for developing an
alternative conceptualization of political economy. While there is much
more to be said about how exactly we might adapt and apply
antidomination regulatory strategies like antitrust and public utility
or expand democratic agency through urban, regulatory, or
social-movement-driven governance, for our purposes what matters is this
central conceptual framework animating these different approaches to
reconstituting economic and political processes. In this framework, the
problem of capitalism is understood as a problem of domination and
economic power. The response to such power must entail attempts to
expand the democratic capacities of citizens. This approach to political
economy offers a substantive alternative to the laissez-faire political
economy of the Roberts Court. It also importantly departs from
conventional traditions of New Deal liberalism. While the New Deal, in
many ways, gave voice and reality to Progressive Era aspirations for
expanded government regulation of the economy and for creating economic
opportunity through the forging of the modern social contract, it also
represented a significantly thinner vision of political economy, placing
too much emphasis on economic growth and technocratic management in
place of more robust commitments to full economic equality, inclusion,
and democracy. 95 The focus on domination and democracy suggests a more
far-reaching vision of political economy.

What, then, is the relationship between constitutionalism and this
antidomination, democratic-agency account of political economy? The
Progressive Era thinkers, referenced above as catalysts for constructing
this vision of political economy, were also notably hostile to courts
and judges. 96 While we may temper somewhat our own views of the
judiciary in comparison to theirs, we can take note of the theory of
change suggested by Progressive Era reformers. Certainly there are
important points of tangency between the kind of economic and political
restructuring needed to redress problems of domination and expand
democratic agency and major interpretive battles over the Constitution
itself, from campaign finance to voting rights to class actions and
questions of congressional power and federalism, not to mention the
continued battles over equality, discrimination, and fundamental rights
under the Fourteenth Amendment. But this account suggests a different
mode of constitutionalism and social change - one where courts might
still play a role, but a secondary and downstream one. At the level of
ideas, it was the intellectual battle over laissez faire that was
paramount; for the Progressives this meant unmasking the realities of
power operating under the surface in the market economy and arguing for
the value of popular sovereignty. At the same time, change also
manifested through reforms that focused on the underlying structures of
economy and politics - through attempts to shift the basic legislative,
regulatory, and legal foundations of modern capitalism. The primary
sites of contest are therefore in the realms of public philosophy,
legislation, and regulatory governance.

Constitutionalism appears at two levels. First, it appears at the level
of fundamental values. The critique of domination and the value of
democratic agency help give further content to core moral values of
equality, freedom, and democracy that animate so much of constitutional
discourse. The second way in which this account of political economy is
constitutional stems from its view of how power is distributed and can
be reallocated: through radical changes to the basic structure of
economic and political order. Thus, while many of the Progressive Era
thinkers profiled above were deeply skeptical of judges and courts, they
nevertheless offered a constitutional vision of political economy in
this particular sense. Their constitutionalism was not the
constitutionalism of text, interpretation, and doctrine. Rather, their
account sought to make real fundamental public values of freedom,
democracy, and equality; and it sought to do so through reforms that
would literally reconstitute basic economic, political, and social
structures to make these values real. From economic structural changes
like antitrust and public utility regulation to radically different
political structures like regulatory agencies and municipal Home Rule,
the democratic political economy excavated above was thus deeply
constitutional.

This is not the \"big-C\" constitutionalism of constitutional text,
doctrine, or Supreme Court jurisprudence. It is rather what we might
think of as the \"small-c\" constitutionalism of our basic economic and
political structures: how we constitute the market economy through laws
that define its basic forces and dynamics, and how we constitute the
polity through regulations and processes that shape the allocation of
political power. So on this understanding of constitutionalism, looking
for a constitutional claim of right under the constitutional text is, in
a sense, looking in the wrong place. Instead, constitutional political
economy has its impact by informing diagnosis, critique, and reform
through the vectors of legislation, regulation, and social movements.
Thus, we might turn to the constitution of the market, looking to
legislative and regulatory regimes like antitrust and public utility to
curb private power. We might see the impact of constitutional political
economy in efforts to rebalance the political power of new forms of
worker association and grassroots social movements, and more
democratically participatory vehicles for governance and policymaking
through regulation and local government. We might also see shifting
public discourse and norms through the contestation and mobilization of
civil society and social movement actors.

There is an important reason why we might want to understand
constitutionalism in this way - as values and as basic structure.
Reconceptualizing constitutionalism and constitutional political economy
in this vein helps pull the high politics of constitutionalism outside
of its narrow province in the courts and in constitutional theory,
deemphasizing the primacy of courts, doctrine, and text. It also helps
to elevate legislation, regulation, public philosophy, and social
movements as sites of law, politics, and contestation that implicate our
most critical normative values and shape our most foundational economic
and political structures. These are not merely domains of \"ordinary
politics\" or technical public policy. Imbuing them with the stature of
constitutionalism appropriately elevates the moral and structural
concerns that are at stake in these domains.

Joseph Fishkin and William Forbath\'s forthcoming The Anti-Oligarchy
Constitution and the Essays in this Symposium represent exactly this
kind of effort to reimagine our fundamental constitutional values of
democracy and equality in context of our New Gilded Age of economic and
political inequality. Their account of constitutional political economy
is most compelling in these two senses: as engaging the fundamental
moral questions of what freedom, opportunity, and democracy mean in
today\'s society, and as securing this moral vision through laws that
alter the basic structure of our economy and politics. [[Such]{.mark}
moral and structural change [can be accomplished through a particular
approach to law and social change]{.mark}, [**prioritizing the
synergies** between **normative arguments**, **social movements**, and
**legislative and regulatory changes**]{.mark} to the basic
structure]{.underline}. Nor are Fishkin and Forbath alone in this. In
the aftermath of the financial crisis and in the face of the Roberts
Court, this emerging wave of legal scholarship can open up a variety of
avenues for deeper critique and reform. [While some of these legal and
policy arguments do involve battles in the Supreme Court, many of them
take place more directly on the terrain of regulation]{.underline},
legislation, state-and local-level policy, and social movement advocacy.

Indeed, this wave of legal scholarship might be considered another heir
to the legal realism of the earlytwentieth century. Like the legal
realists of a century ago, there is a growing cascade of scholarship
that takes as its focus the investigation of the deep underlying
structures of our economy and political process, and is closely linked
with questions of public policy and social change. In addition to this
very Symposium, consider for example the rich new scholarship unpacking
the legal and intellectual foundations of political economy and modern
capitalism, 97 or the booming scholarship since the 2008-2009 financial
crisis on how law constitutes the financial system, and how this system
can be reconstituted to create a better balance between private power
and public values. 98 We also are seeing new literature on
political-process design in the context of regulatory agencies, in
particular, along the front lines of participatory and democratic
institutional design. 99 Many other areas of law might be cited as well.
The point is that, like the legal realists reacting to the First Gilded
Age, we see in legal scholarship today a wide array of scholars in
diverse subfields employing different methodologies to critique, unpack,
and deconstruct contemporary political economy - all with an eye towards
deconstructing problematic forms of economic and political power - and
recovering the ideas, policies, and reforms that might shift us in a
more democratic and egalitarian direction.

In context of the broader moral challenges of political and economic
inequality, these trends suggest what we might call a \"fourth wave\" of
legal realism. Conventionally, the legal realist movement is understood
to have two primary successors, each of which revolutionized legal
scholarship: law and economics, and critical legal studies. Each of
these movements in turn developed a key aspect of the original legal
realist method, yet faced important limitations as they developed. The
turn to empirical social science and expertise is modeled by the rise of
law and economics, while the antiformalist critique has helped fuel the
deconstructive project of critical legal studies. 100 Yet the
law-and-economics revolution of the late twentieth century, with its
focus on efficiency, welfare, and neoclassical economic models, has been
rightly criticized as a revived formalism. 101 Similarly, the
antiformalism of legal realism was more deeply developed by the critical
legal studies (CLS) movement, 102 which unmasked the many ways in which
law reproduced hierarchies of power and unfreedom. Yet CLS suffered from
its own limitations: while it was effectively disruptive of both
legal-process and law-and-economics accounts, as a whole it ultimately
did not provide a constructive alternative vision for a more egalitarian
and democratic political economy. As Roberto Unger himself argued, CLS
\"largely failed in its most important task: to turn legal thought into
a source of insight into the established institutional and ideological
structure of society and into a source of ideas about alternative social
regimes.\" 103

In the last twenty-five years or so, there has been a third wave of
legal realism, a hybrid combination of these two heirs into a more
pragmatic focus on policy and institutional design. Legal realism in
this wave manifested itself, in the leveraging of behavioral, empirical,
and institutional analysis, to suggest changes to policy-making
processes to make them more efficient and just. 104 This third wave of
legal realism repurposed the critique of formalism as a way to open
space for policy expertise - expertise which can be achieved by
leveraging the insights of social science, including law and economics.
105 The critical project of revealing how law constructs inequalities
along racial, gendered, or class lines is, therefore, now paired with an
analytical focus on policy design, and on assessing comparative
institutional competencies. 106 Similarly, the insights of law and
economics, on this view, can be seen not as a hostile ideology against
democratic or egalitarian values, but rather as a way to analyze
micro-scale behaviors and macro-scale costs and benefits of different
institutional systems. 107

But as the anxieties about neo-Lochnerism and the Supreme Court
underscore, the challenges for law and public discourse in this New
Gilded Age of economic and political inequality go beyond the scope of
pragmatic policy design. [We need to harness these institutional design
insights towards the substantive ends of counteracting domination,
rebalancing economic and political power, expanding opportunity, and
reviving democratic **agency**]{.underline}. The techniques of
contemporary legal scholarship, from behavioral analyses to contextually
rich studies of law and society to comparative institutional analyses,
offer tremendous potential. [But [absent]{.mark} a **[full]{.mark}er
[engagement]{.mark}** [with the]{.mark} [normative question of
values]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [these [approaches risk falling
into an **overly narrow** or]{.mark} seemingly **[neutral policy
science]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 108 A fourth wave of [[**legal
realism** could build on these traditions, linking the analysis]{.mark}
of underlying ideas and structures [to a **substantive moral vision of
democratic political economy**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The import of this kind of a project points to a final mode in which we
might understand this focus on values and structures as
\"constitutional\" - in the political aspiration to literally
reconstitute American political economy today. The timing of Fishkin and
Forbath\'s project - and of the remarkable confluence of scholarly
interest in issues of inequality, power, structure, and democracy on
display at the symposium - suggests as much. Arguably [we find ourselves
in a unique moment today, often referred to as a \"Second Gilded Age,\"
where the country faces a confluence of economic and political
inequality.]{.underline} But I suspect that the reason why so many
scholars are gravitating towards these questions of inequality,
exclusion, oligarchy, and power is because [many of us sense that this
moment is also unique in its capacity to shift]{.underline} - perhaps
radically - [our broad understandings and structures of political
economy[.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[We are living in a moment of
rupture]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And so the stakes of this moment are not
just in its negative dimensions, in the problems of inequality and
disparities of power and opportunity we see all around us. The stakes
are in the as-yet-unrealized potential for the emergence of new
constitutional understandings and basic structures. We may be in a
Second Gilded Age, but done right, the politics and potential of this
moment could be a Third Reconstruction - or a new refounding.

The Populists, Progressives, and Labor Republicans of the late
nineteenth century certainly understood themselves as participating in a
battle to redefine the fundamental and literal constitution of the
country (the 1892 People\'s Party platform, for example, styled itself
deliberately as a Second Declaration of Independence). [This ferment
eventually produced the ideas that became the New Deal
settlement]{.underline} a generation later. [These [projects of
**constitutional political economy**]{.mark} appearing in a variety of
forms and disciplines in legal scholarship today [could help
contribute]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[in some]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[small [way]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[to a]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[similar constitutional [shift]{.mark}]{.underline}** - [one
that,]{.underline} if we are lucky and if done right,
[would]{.underline} not merely recreate the New Deal settlement, but
instead re[invent]{.underline} it for [a radically different social,
economic, and political context]{.underline}.

[A growing literature is now exploring]{.underline} options for
so-called [degrowth]{.underline}, which aims to promote human wellbeing
and ecological resilience without requiring GDP growth (Hickel et al.,
2021; Kallis, 2017; Keyßer and Lenzen, 2021; Wiedmann et al., 2020;

wellbeing and ecological protection]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gaffney et

challenge, however. We do not yet know how degrowth policies could be
adopted at scale or how they would interact with our current economic
processes and patterns of behaviour. Nonetheless, [our climate
predicament demands openness to new approaches]{.underline}. To better
understand the options, further research into basic relations between

Experiences in socialist construction [Thanks]{.underline} in great part
[to the practical experience of Lenin in]{.underline} making
[revolution, 21st-century socialists have a wealth of experience on
which to base further conclusions. Marxists have been able to use
accumulated theory]{.underline} and practice in order [to lead
revolutions in Russia, China, Korea, Yugoslavia, Cuba and many other
countries.]{.underline} [While there have been vast differences in the
experiences of]{.underline} those [socialist revolutions, they share one
common feature:]{.underline} [The [socialist revolutions of the 20th
century took place in countries where the level of productive forces was
very low]{.mark} compared to the imperialist countries. [Every]{.mark}
successful [revolution faced the]{.mark} primary [task of
developing]{.mark} their [economies---while under constant]{.mark}
military [threat]{.mark}]{.underline} by world imperialism. For that
reason, Lenin described the challenges of building communism in 1920 in
very practical terms: "Communism is Soviet power plus the
electrification of the whole country." There was no hope in building
socialism if the economy remained underdeveloped. Because of the
combined challenges of developing the productive forces under the gun of
world imperialism, no socialist revolution has yet reached a stage where
the "withering away of the state" could be imagined. [Imperialism has
seized on any weakness in the revolutionary states in order to foment
counterrevolution.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the working classes in the
countries that have set out to build socialism have made tremendous
gains. Russia's working class in 1917 was 4 percent of the population.
Within 50 years, it was the second-most powerful economy in the world.
China had never been able to feed its entire population prior to the
revolution. Millions died during famines in China prior to 1949. Yet
after the 1949 revolution, for the first time the economy was able to
feed the largest population in the world. Despite immense pressure from
imperialism, Cuba has been able to achieve tremendous gains---despite
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Cuban workers enjoy among the
highest living standards of any of their counterparts in Latin America
or much of the oppressed world. [The [continued military and economic
dominance]{.mark} by world imperialism---first and foremost [by U.S.
imperialism]{.mark}---has [made the transition]{.mark} to
socialism]{.underline} that Marx and Lenin described so far
[[impossible.]{.mark}]{.underline} The workers' states have needed to
devote a considerable part of their social development toward the
strengthening of the proletarian dictatorship---the army and police---in
order to defend against invasion or counterrevolution. Taking that next
step will require a society based on the dictatorship of the proletariat
in the United States. [[Toppling the world's dominant capitalist power

[workers around the world]{.mark} who are trying to engage in socialist

class.]{.underline} All the social wealth extracted from the oppressed
world by U.S. corporations and mines could be used to reverse the
effects of centuries of colonial and imperialist exploitation. [A
revolution in the United States would undercut the economic basis for
divisions]{.underline} among the working class that promote racism,
sexism and homophobia. Socialism is a system of peace, justice and
equality. **[[The road to socialism begins with]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Alt\-\--AT: Communism Fails\-\--Empirics

#### Past revolutions weren't Marxist -- impoverishment and socialism in one country caused failure 

**Eagleton 11** \[Terry, Distinguished Professor of English Literature
at Lancaster University, *Why Marx Was Right*, 2011, Yale University:
New Haven, CT, p. 16-18\]

[Marx himself never imagined that socialism could be achieved in
impoverished conditions.]{.underline} Such a project would require
almost as bizarre a loop in time as inventing the Internet in the Middle
Ages. Nor did any Marxist thinker until Stalin imagine that this was
possible, including Lenin, Trotsky and the rest of the Bolshevik
leadership. [You cannot reorganise wealth for the benefit of all if
there is precious little wealth to reorganise. You cannot abolish social
classes in conditions of scarcity, since conflicts over a material
surplus]{.underline} too meagre to meet everyone's needs will simply
revive them again. [As Marx comments]{.underline} in The German
Ideology, [the result of a **revolution in such conditions** is that
''**the old filthy business''**]{.underline} (or in less tasteful
translation, ''the same old crap'') [will simply reappear. All you will
get is **socialised scarcity**. If you need to accumulate capital more
or less from scratch, then the most effective way of doing
so]{.underline}, however brutal, [is through the profit
motive]{.underline}. **[Avid self-interest]{.underline}** [is likely to
pile up wealth with remarkable speed]{.underline}, though it is likely
to amass spectacular poverty at the same time. **[Nor did
Marxists]{.underline}** [ever imagine that it was possible to achieve
socialism in one country alone]{.underline}. [The movement was
international or it was nothing. This was a **hardheaded materialist**
claim, not a piously idealist one. If a socialist nation failed to win
international support in a world where production was specialized and
divided among different nations]{.underline}, [it would be unable to
**draw upon the global resources** needed to abolish
scarcity]{.underline}. [The productive wealth of a **single country**
was unlikely to be enough]{.underline}. The outlandish notion of
[socialism in one country was invented by Stalin]{.underline} in the
1920s, partly [as a cynical rationalisation of the fact that other
nations had been unable to come to the aid]{.underline} of the Soviet
Union. **[It has no warrant in Marx himself]{.underline}**. [Socialist
revolutions must of course start somewhere. But **they cannot be
completed** within national boundaries. To judge socialism by its
results in one desperately isolated country would be like drawing
conclusions about the human race from **a study of psychopaths in
Kalamazoo**. Building up an economy from very low levels is a
backbreaking, dispiriting task. It is unlikely that men and women will
freely submit to the hardships it involves]{.underline}. [So unless this
project is executed gradually, under democratic control and in
accordance with socialist values,]{.underline} an [authoritarian state
may step in and force its citizens to do what they are reluctant to
undertake voluntarily]{.underline}. **[The militarization of labour in
Bolshevik Russia is a case in point.]{.underline}** The result, in a
grisly irony, will be to undermine the political superstructure of
socialism (popular democracy, genuine self-government) in the very
attempt to build up its economic base. [It would be like being invited
to a party **only to discover** that you had not only to bake the cakes
and brew the beer but to **dig the foundations** and **lay the
floorboards.** There wouldn't be much time to enjoy
yourself]{.underline}. Ideally, [socialism requires a **skilled**,
**educated**, politically sophisticated populace, **thriving civic
institutions**]{.underline}, a wellevolved technology, [enlightened
**liberal traditions and** the habit of **democracy**]{.underline}.
[None of this is likely to be on hand if you cannot even afford to mend
the dismally few highways you have]{.underline}, [or have no insurance
policy against]{.underline} sickness or [starvation beyond a **pig in
the back shed**]{.underline}. [Nations with a history of colonial rule
are especially likely to be bereft of the benefits]{.underline} I have
just listed, since colonial powers have not been remarkable for their
zeal to implant civil liberties or democratic institutions among their
underlings. [As Marx insists, socialism also requires a **shortening of
the working day**]{.underline}---partly to provide men and women with
the leisure for personal fulfillment, partly [to create time for the
business of political and economic self-government]{.underline}. **[You
cannot do this if people have no shoes]{.underline}**; and to distribute
shoes among millions of citizens is likely to require a centralised
bureaucratic state. [If your nation is under invasion from an array of
hostile capitalist powers]{.underline}, as Russia was in the wake of the
Bolshevik revolution, **[an autocratic state will seem all the more
inevitable]{.underline}**. Britain during the Second World War was far
from an autocracy; [but it was by no means a free country, and one would
not have expected it to be]{.underline}.

Some advocates of the participatory model hold that everyone should be
remunerated equally for the same amount of work, despite differences of
talent, training and occupation. As Michael Albert puts it, ''The doctor
working in a plush setting with comfortable and fulfilling circumstances
earns more than the assembly worker working in a horrible din, risking
life and limb, and enduring boredom and denigration, regardless of how
long or how hard each works.''∞≠ [[There is,]{.underline}]{.mark} in
fact, [[a strong case for paying those who engage in
boring]{.underline}, [heavy, dirty or dangerous work more
than]{.underline}]{.mark}, say, [[medics or academics whose labours are
**considerably more rewarding**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Much of this
dirty and dangerous work could perhaps be carried out by former members
of the royal family]{.underline}. [We need to reverse our
priorities.]{.underline} Since I have just mentioned the media as ripe
for public ownership, let us take this as an exemplary case. Over half a
century ago, in an excellent little book entitled Communications,∞∞
Raymond [[Williams outlined a socialist plan for]{.mark} the arts and
[media]{.mark} [which rejected state control]{.mark} of its
content]{.underline} on the one hand [[and]{.mark} the sovereignty of
[the]{.mark} [profit motive]{.mark} on the other.]{.underline} Instead,
[[the active contributors]{.mark} in this field [would have]{.mark}
control of [their own]{.mark} means of [expression and communication.
The actual ''plant'']{.mark}]{.underline} of the arts and media---[radio
stations, concert halls, TV networks, theatres, newspaper offices and so
on---[would be taken into public ownership]{.mark}]{.underline} (of
which there are a variety of forms), [and their management invested in
democratically elected bodies]{.underline}. **[These would include both
members of the public]{.underline}** [and **representatives** of media
or artistic bodies]{.underline}. [[These
commissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, which would be strictly independent of
the state, [[would]{.mark} then be responsible for
[awarding]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[public
resources]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and ''**leasing''** the socially owned
facilities either [to individual practitioners or to independent,
democratically self-governing companies of actors, journalists,
musicians]{.mark} and the like]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} [men
and women could then produce work free of both state regulation and the
distorting pressures of the market.]{.underline} Among other things,
[**[we would be free]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
situation in which a bunch of [power-crazed,]{.mark} avaricious
[bullies]{.mark} dictate through their privately owned media outlets
what the public should believe]{.underline}---which is to say, their own
self-interested opinions and the system they support[. [We will know
that socialism has established itself when we]{.mark} are able to [look
back]{.mark} [with]{.mark} utter [incredulity on the idea that a handful
of commercial thugs were given **free rein**]{.mark} [to corrupt the
minds of the public with **Neanderthal political views**]{.mark}
convenient for their own bank balances but for little else]{.underline}.
[[Much]{.mark} of the [media under capitalism avoid
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}, controversial or [[innovative work

settle for **banality**]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[sensationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and **[gut
prejudice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Socialist media, by contrast, would
not ban everything but Schoenberg, Racine and endless dramatized
versions of Marx's Capital[. There would be popular theatre, TV and
newspapers galore]{.underline}. ''Popular'' does not necessarily mean
''inferior.'' Nelson Mandela is popular but not inferior. [[**Plenty of
ordinary people** read **highly specialist journals** littered with
**jargon unintelligible to outsiders**.]{.underline}]{.mark} It is just
that [[these]{.mark} journals]{.underline} [[tend to be about

Education and state monitoring might diminish these dangers, but [some
[Marxists look]{.mark} instead [to an]{.mark} [economy]{.mark} which
would be neither centrally planned nor market-governed.]{.underline}π On
this model, [resources would be [allocated by
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[between producers, consumers,
environmentalists and other relevant parties, in networks of
**workplace**, neighbourhood and **consumer

economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [including decisions on the overall
allocation of resources]{.underline}, rates of growth and investment,
energy, transport and ecological policies and the like, [[would be set
by **representative assemblies** at local, regional and national

### Alt\-\--AT: Cap K/T Space

#### Socialism key to space

**Phillips '21** \[Leigh Phillips is a science writer and EU affairs
journalist, "We Don't Need Elon Musk to Explore the Solar System,"
Jacobin, May 2021,
<https://jacobinmag.com/2021/05/elon-musk-space-exploration-mars-colonization>\]

A reasonable critique of Musk's SpaceX endeavors might begin by noting
that, regardless of how noble an aim Musk may have for his
centibillions, there simply should not be centibillionaires (or even
regular millionaires and billionaires). One might also echo Neil
Armstrong's criticism of private space flight --- a criticism that once
made Elon cry when 60 Minutes asked him about his hero arguing against
the privatization of space. We might note how
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark} exploration during the Cold War, despite
the militarist overtones of the Space Race, [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
explicitly [[intended to be for all]{.underline}]{.mark} mankind rather
than in service of the jollies of ultrarich space tourists.

A democratic and public redirection of Elon Musk's billions might be
spent differently. One might further assert that, given the non-identity
of the set of all things that are beneficial and the set of all things
that are profitable, **[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}** colonization
**[[will be]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
**[[public]{.underline}]{.mark}**-**[[sector]{.underline}]{.mark}**
endeavor, **[[or it will not happen]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- as such a
[[private space]{.underline}]{.mark} travel **[[has no
near]{.underline}]{.mark}**-term,
**[[medium]{.underline}]{.mark}**-term, **[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}**
even **[[long-term]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[prospect
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** any **[[return]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on
financial investment beyond servicing low-earth, medium-earth, or
geostationary orbit]{.underline}. And, finally, we might denounce the
union-busting at Musk's factories or even argue that his "accumulation
of resources" is less the product of his own efforts than it is
primarily an upward redistribution of value created by his workers.

That is to say that there are a raft of progressive critiques of Musk
that could be made that nevertheless still value space exploration and,
one day, human colonization of the cosmos.

Indeed, if one values space exploration and looks forward to the time,
as astronomer Carl Sagan put it, "when most human cultures will be
engaged in an activity you might describe as a dandelion going to seed,"
then **[[a socialist critique is]{.underline}]{.mark}** all the more
**[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[given]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} irrational
[[limit]{.underline}]{.mark}ation[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[markets
impose on human endeavor]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

But instead, there are thousands of snark-drenched tweets sneering at
how crackpot, masculinist, and even childish Elon's dream is. They argue
that space travel is a waste of resources that would be better spent
solving problems here on Earth, and that space colonization is a
repetition of the colonization of the New World.

Even Bernie Sanders responded to Musk by saying: "Space travel is an
exciting idea, but right now we need to focus on Earth and create a
progressive tax system so that children don't go hungry, people are not
homeless and all Americans have healthcare. The level of inequality in
America is obscene and a threat to our democracy." At the time of
writing, the senator's tweet had received some 95,000 likes.

Bernie is, in this case, wrong.

Space exploration, including space travel, is one of the grandest tasks
humanity has ever set for itself. It is a false dichotomy --- and an
austerian one at that --- to say that we do not have enough money for
both a space program and social justice or environmental protection. We
can more than afford to do both. NASA's budget is but a fraction of the
Pentagon's. **[[It should not be difficult to imagine
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** democratic **[[socialist
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or even just one a little less
neoliberal, **[[that permits much more space]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
much less war.

We can have public health care and science. We can end homelessness and
explore the cosmos. We can have unionized, family-supporting jobs for
all and, one day, almost certainly some considerable time from now,
colonies on other worlds.

#### Zero chance capitalist space efforts colonize space before 

**Phillips '21** \[Leigh Phillips is a science writer and EU affairs
journalist, "We Don't Need Elon Musk to Explore the Solar System,"
Jacobin, May 2021,
<https://jacobinmag.com/2021/05/elon-musk-space-exploration-mars-colonization>\]

[One must distinguish]{.underline} here [between the near-term
impossibility of Musk's dreams of cities on Mars and the very long-term
necessity of]{.underline} [humanity spreading itself throughout the
cosmos]{.underline} sometime within the next eon in order to ensure our
survival.

We do not need to escape Earth due to [climate change or
biodiversity]{.underline} loss. Resolving these two issues (and other
environmental challenges) [are far **easier** to solve than
**terraforming**]{.underline} other worlds. Even at 6ºC of global
warming --- the upper but low-probability bound of the increase in
average global temperature by century's end that is projected by climate
models --- Earth would be far more inhabitable for humans than a Martian
colony that would remain, for the foreseeable future, tethered to
Earth-based life support systems. Even a terraformed Mars would still be
less habitable for humans due to its incorrigibly low gravity.

In fact, if astronomers tomorrow discovered an Earth analogue exoplanet
in a distant solar system that had similar or even identical atmospheric
chemistry, mass, biospheric signatures, tectonic and magnetospheric
activity --- but was an average six degrees warmer than Holocene-era
Earth, then this world would be hailed as eminently habitable.

And [while]{.underline} near-Earth [asteroids]{.underline} do [present
a]{.underline}n ongoing existential [threat]{.underline}, [the
tech]{.underline}nology [required to track and divert them would
again]{.underline} [be a doddle compared to]{.underline} making a
[permanent]{.underline}, self-sustaining [habitation]{.underline} on
another planet viable.

[The real existential threat is not anywhere close
near-term]{.underline}. But it is real, and a legitimate reason why, at
some point, humanity does need to spread itself beyond Earth.

In about 600 million years, the Sun's increase in luminosity will in
turn increase the weathering of silicate minerals --- what make up about
90 percent of Earth's crust. This will upset the carbonate-silicate
cycle, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as weathered
minerals are washed into rivers and oceans, buried in sediments and
ultimately recycled back into the mantle as tectonic plates subduct at
continental margins. The CO2 is then returned back to the atmosphere
through volcanism. Also known as the inorganic (or slow) carbon cycle,
it takes place over millions of years, while the organic (or fast)
carbon cycle that cycles carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere and
back takes place on the scale of years. The shinier sun's acceleration
of silicate weathering will result in a sharp drop in the concentration
of atmospheric CO2 (opposite to the problem we face with global
warming), below the amount needed for trees and some other plants to
live. Eventually, plant life as a whole will die off, and with it most
animals. Within a billion years, the oceans will boil off, and the
planet will return to a microbial world.

The reason we are acting to prevent climate change and biodiversity loss
right now on this planet is to preserve the conditions that allow humans
to flourish. It is not to save the planet. The planet has experienced
far more extreme conditions in the deep past than what we are doing to
it. Indeed, past mass extinction events were necessary for subsequent
evolutionary radiation (increase in biodiversity as a result of
speciation), just as death is for life. Without dinosaur extinction,
mammals would never have filled all those ecological niches the
dinosaurs left behind.

Instead, the purpose of preventing climate change and biodiversity loss
is to arrest global change and preserve indefinitely a set of conditions
that have existed only since the start of the Holocene epoch (since the
end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago) and that are currently
optimal for us humans.

Thus, for the same reason of human species preservation with respect to
the climate and biodiversity emergencies, at some point within the next
eon, but due to the solar-produced terminus of habitable conditions on
Earth, humans need to establish themselves on other worlds. And on as
many as possible --- for those worlds, too, face their own limited span
of habitability, and at any point, a star exploding as a supernova at
the end of its life could sterilize any nearby biospheres (perhaps some
extremophile microbes might survive, but the game would certainly be
over for humanity).

Of course, we have a whopping 600 million years to worry about boiling
oceans and the plant-pocalypse. There is no urgency at all, even if the
moral imperative to prevent climate change and to colonize other worlds
is the same.

But over the very long term, the cosmos is a dangerous place. Humans
need to be a multi-planetary --- and ultimately multi-solar-system ---
species in order to increase the chances of our survival. Musk is right
to embrace this goal. That is not what he needs to be challenged on.
Instead, we should ask whether his actions serve that laudable goal.

Venus or Mars?

We can get a more detailed understanding of what Musk means than his
tweet or his interview commentary provide in his detailed, sixteen-page
paper that appeared in 2017 in the academic journal New Space, which is
dedicated to the burgeoning commercial space sector, "Making Humans a
Multi-Planetary Species."

He opens the paper with a recognition that, at some point, if we stay on
Earth, we will confront an eventual extinction event. "The alternative
is to become a spacefaring civilization and a multi-planetary species."

He alights upon Mars as the obvious first option for establishing a
"self-sustaining city --- a city that is not merely an outpost, but
which can become a planet in its own right." He rejects Venus due to it
being, as he correctly puts it, a super-high-pressure, hot acid bath. He
rejects Mercury due to it being too close to the Sun, and the Moon for
lack of atmosphere and its twenty-eight-day "day" (a Martian day, or
"sol," for comparison, is an Earthling-friendly 24.5 hours). And he
rejects, at least for now, the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, as they are
much harder to get to.

Mars has more than its own share of habitability issues, but Musk does
not mention them, other than to say that, while Mars is "a little cold"
(in reality, -63ºC, or -81ºF, compared to Earth's balmy 16ºC, or 57ºF),
"we can warm it up." The Martian atmosphere is "very helpful" because
it's primarily CO2, with some nitrogen and argon, meaning that "we can
grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere." Most cheery of
all, Musk says it would be "quite fun" to be on Mars, because the
gravity is about 38 percent that of Earth, making it easy to lift heavy
things and "bound around."

Mars, as seen from space. (WikiImages via Pixabay)

It's all so simple. "We just need to change the populations because
currently we have seven billion people on Earth and none on Mars."

And so the paper is primarily devoted to explaining how to solve that
sole problem: how to lower the cost of a trip to Mars from the current
roughly \$10 billion per person down to the median cost of a house in
the United States. By making rockets reusable, refilling in orbit,
producing propellant on Mars, choosing the right propellant, and
improving system design and performance, Musk reckons he can get the
cost of a ticket down to \$200,000, perhaps as little as \$100,000.

And Musk's SpaceX has done a tremendous job so far of sharply reducing
the cost of escaping Earth's gravity well, primarily via deep vertical
integration of the firm. It produces a whopping 70 percent of its
components in-house, as opposed to the 1,200 different suppliers in the
outsourced supply chain of its main competitor, the Boeing--Lockheed
Martin partnership known as the United Space Alliance. Each of these
suppliers extracts their own profit margin from every contract in the
chain, jacking up the cost per launch to \$460 million. SpaceX, by
comparison, charges NASA and its other clients just \$62 million per
launch, and Musk says he has slashed the marginal cost of a reused
Falcon 9 booster launch to a mere \$15 million.

Well done, Elon. Or, rather, well done to all the engineers, logistical
experts, and other workers who have done most of the labor, allowing
SpaceX to revolutionize the business model of getting to space.

There is not really any mention of the enormous challenges of [the
atmosphere's **low pressure and toxic composition**, the preponderance
of deadly **perchlorates** in the soil, or the lack of
**magnetosphere**]{.underline} to protect against solar and cosmic
radiation. [The current atmosphere of Mars is too thin to support most
life]{.underline}: its pressure is only about 1 percent that of Earth.
Only hypopiezotolerant microbes (those that live in low-pressure
environments), such as ones that are lofted by winds into Earth's
stratosphere, would be able to survive. The atmosphere is also 95
percent carbon dioxide --- fine for plants (if the pressure were able to
be raised) but not for animals.

Musk does say that once Mars is warmed up, "we would once again have a
thick atmosphere and liquid oceans." Bioremediation using bacteria to
clean up perchlorates already occurs on Earth, but we are talking about
an entire planet here. There is no discussion of how any of this might
happen, over what time period, and who would pay for it. Same with the
construction of an artificial magnetosphere. Dealing with [the
perchlorates alone would]{.underline} likely [be]{.underline} profoundly
[more challenging]{.underline} and expensive than the relatively
straightforward process of decarbonizing Earth's economy.

A 2018 NASA study found that [there is insufficient CO2 and H2O from the
Martian soil, polar ice caps, and minerals in the upper crust to get
anywhere close to thickening the atmosphere and using it like a blanket
to warm up the planet.]{.underline} All these sources combined would
still only boost the pressure to about 7 percent of that of Earth.
Carbon-bearing minerals deep in the crust might have enough CO2 to
achieve the needed pressure, but nothing is known about their extent,
and recovering them with current technology would be colossally energy
intensive. Another idea is to direct comets or asteroids to crash into
Mars and release their greenhouse gases that way. Again, these are
fantastical ideas that will be impractical for many, many generations
yet to come.

NASA astronauts in space. (NASA)

And **[there is]{.underline}** likely **[no way of ever overcoming
Mars's low gravity]{.underline}**. [If you added all the mass of Venus
to that of Mars, smashing]{.underline} [the planets together, even then,
you would still not quite achieve Earth's gravity]{.underline}. It is
true that we do not know what the physiological effects of 38 percent of
Earth's gravity are, either on humans or other life. We have two data
points: Earth gravity, what we call 1G, and the 0G microgravity of the
International Space Station (ISS). But from studies of astronauts who
have spent extended periods aboard the ISS, we know that **[0G is
extremely bad for human health]{.underline}**.

Muscles atrophy. Tendons and ligaments begin to fail. Facial and finger
muscles, which cannot be worked out via onboard gyms or treadmills,
weaken. The spine lengthens, with astronauts gaining an inch or two in
height and suffering from back pain. Bones demineralize, losing density
at a rate of 1 percent per month.

As Christopher Wanjek, a former NASA science writer and author of 2020
book Spacefarers --- which is an optimistic volume on the viability of
manned space travel --- notes: "To visualize how bad that bone loss is,
consider the fact that the major obstacle to fully recycling urine into
drinking water on the ISS is that the filters get clogged daily with
calcium deposits." Wanjek writes how the rate of vision loss is such
that a crew to Mars would need to pack eyeglasses with various
prescriptions for "each phase of their gradual, inevitable, and
permanent vision loss."

Kidneys get confused by blood not being where it's supposed to be and
think there is an excess, so they start to remove what they believe to
be excess water. The blood thickens, driving a reduced production of red
blood cells, which in turn drives anemia, shortness of breath, lethargy,
and greater likelihood of infection. Perhaps worst of all, brain
compression resulting from microgravity negatively impacts regions
responsible for fine motor movement and executive function ---
deteriorations that could be permanent.

A range of interventions, including exercise, drugs, and compression
clothing can shave the sharp edges off some of these effects, but
ultimately, [the solution on a spacecraft is the simulation of gravity
via centrifugal force]{.underline} --- a spinning ship. [This is not
something that you can do with a whole planet.]{.underline}

It is for this reason that [Venus]{.underline}, with its gravity not too
far off that of Earth, [may actually be a better terraforming candidate
than Mars --- one day --- despite its currently inhospitable
atmosphere.]{.underline}

The Real Business of SpaceX Isn't Mars

One has to suspect that Musk knows all this. We have a hint of this
when, at one point in his paper, Musk concedes that it will be difficult
to fund his vision just by slashing the cost of getting to space. He
admits that SpaceX expects to generate substantial cash flow from
launching lots of satellites and servicing the International Space
Station for NASA. Additional help for bankrolling the Mars project might
come from the emergence of a market for really fast transportation of
things or people around the world by rocket: cargo could be transported
anywhere on Earth in forty-five minutes, and a trip from New York to
Tokyo could take a mere twenty-five minutes (so long as takeoff and
landing takes place where the tremendous noise, as he puts it in
hip-CEO-speak, "is not a super-big deal").

As a result, one gets the impression by reading between the lines that a
[self-sustaining Martian city is all just an impressive marketing
maneuver taking advantage of most people's sense of adventure and
wonder; of our species' ancient need to wander and explore]{.underline}.
The real business of SpaceX was never a Martian colony but rather
servicing a mature satellite market, stealing government space contracts
from the likes of Boeing, and kicking off a terrestrial rocket transport
sector. The dream of Mars is, in this case, not really any different
from the adman's fiction of romance and aspiration that sells a can of
Pepsi or a Jeep.

The dream of Mars is, in this case, not really any different from the
adman's fiction of romance and aspiration that sells a can of Pepsi or a
Jeep.

None of this is to suggest that establishing an outpost on Mars for the
purposes of scientific exploration should not be attempted, even in the
next couple of decades. But an outpost, as Musk himself makes clear,
does not approach a self-sustaining city, and still less a
multi-planetary species.

Because humans do need to exit Earth at some point in order to maintain
the species, [if we are to establish genuinely
**self-sustaining**]{.underline} **[colonies]{.underline}**, then
[terraforming will likely be necessary]{.underline} one day, as well as
interstellar generation ships that take us to habitable exoplanets far
beyond the solar system. For all of this, we will have to figure out how
to take our ecology with us.

We are not really the collection of individuals we thought we were, but
rather are deeply embedded within our ecosystems. Indeed, each of us is
a microbial ecosystem whose edges are vague. Where does the bacterial,
fungal, and viral multitude that is "me" stop and my equally
microbiological environment begin? This does not mean that Earth will be
the only home we ever have, but it does mean that the antiseptic,
forestless, riverless Starship Enterprise would leave its inhabitants
very sick before too long.

How much of our ecology do we need to take with us, though? We just
don't know yet. The science of ecology is very much still a young
discipline. This is where fantastical science-fiction conceptions of
vast ships made from hollowed out asteroids and packed with different
biomes fills the gap of what we do not know. Likewise for novels like
Becky Chambers's To be Taught, if Fortunate, in which, instead of
terraforming other worlds, adapting them to our needs, we genetically
alter our bodies via "somaforming" to adapt ourselves to their
conditions.

Plainly, then, **[there is no rush for any of this]{.underline}**, even
as there is a moral imperative for us, one day in the distant future, to
permanently exit Earth. Our **[colonization]{.underline}** of other
worlds is akin to the building of the grandest cathedral we have ever
envisaged: a project that **[will tak]{.underline}**e centuries, or more
likely millennia, many **[millennia]{.underline}**. **[This is nothing
that a private company can deliver]{.underline}**. **[There is no
near-term return on investment]{.underline}**; indeed, **[there is no
aim of profitability at all, but rather]{.underline}** of **[our
species' survival through the eons.]{.underline}**

Rocks Are Not People

There are those who argue, perhaps because space colonization and
colonization of the New World have a word in common, that the desire to
journey into space is expressive of a colonial mentality.

From a trivial point of view, it is indeed colonial, insofar as the
object is to build colonies. But there is a big difference between the
conquest of the indigenous peoples of the Americas and the Antipodes:
the Moon and Mars are rocks, not human beings.

A view of Earth from the Moon's surface.

Indeed, the equivalence of rocks and people, or rather the notion that
the human inhabitants of these lands did not count as people, is
precisely the moral calculus that was made by the genocidaires of
colonialism.

If we find microbial life on Mars, again, microbes are not people. We,
of course, must be very careful upon our early visits to other worlds
that we do not accidentally introduce terrestrial microbes. We have one
chance to see whether life evolved elsewhere. If we contaminate Mars
with bacteria or archaea from Earth before we make this assessment, it
may be difficult to tell Martian and Earth microbes apart.

Such contamination protocols, however, only need be carried out until
the otherwise pristine conditions have been sufficiently studied. The
only question here is how long and how much effort should be made.
Following such research, there is no distinction between terrestrial
microbes establishing themselves on Mars (or any other world) and what
would have occurred had microbes caught a ride on a meteor from one
world to another without any human contribution.

And, if terrestrial microbes later outcompeted Martian microbes as a
result, again, this would be no different from competition for resources
between species on Earth, which, along with predation and symbiosis and
other inter-species interactions, form the basis for many ecosystem
properties and processes. Again, that's not colonialism. That's life!

Carl Sagan's Dream

In our critiques of centibillionaires like Elon Musk, we should be very
careful not to argue that, whatever he wants, we simply want the
opposite. That's the case for much recent popular writing critical of
the private space sector.

It's true that our vision of space --- as a commons for all humanity,
driven by democratic states --- is very different from that of Musk, and
that, indeed, **[the capitalist class's power is a barrier to that
vision]{.underline}**. But [we should reject]{.underline} what the late
philosopher Mark Fisher called [capitalist realism: not merely the
concession that there is no alternative to the current order but the
inability to conceive that there can be one.]{.underline}

[Market ideology is so ingrained even in the minds of its opponents that
a public-sector program of space]{.underline} exploration, travel,
resource extraction, and, at some point in the future, [colonization,
cannot be fathomed.]{.underline} The critique surrounding space should
instead be that, so **[long as it is for profit]{.underline}** or
national pride, **[space programs will never be able to live up
to]{.underline}** Carl **[Sagan's dream of our species as the dandelion
of the cosmos.]{.underline}**

We can learn something from the technological and humanist optimism of
the first person in space. "Nothing will stop us. The road to the stars
is steep and dangerous. But we're not afraid," Yuri Gagarin told Space
World magazine. "Spaceflights can't be stopped. This isn't the work of
any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which
mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human
development."

**[More Sputnik and less SpaceX,]{.underline}** maybe, but ad astra per
aspera nevertheless.

#### Every percentage point of existential risk reduction is equal to a delay of 10 million years

**Bostrom 03** Nick Bostrom, philosopher at the University of Oxford, a
Ph.D. degree in philosophy from the London School of Economics, and was
a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford, 2003,
"Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological
Development", Utilitas Vol. 15, No. 3,
<https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html#_edn8>, EO

However, the true lesson is a different one. [If what we are concerned
with is]{.underline} (something like) [maximizing the expected number
of]{.underline} worthwhile [lives that we will create]{.underline},
[then [in addition to]{.mark} the opportunity cost of [delayed
colonization,]{.mark} we have to [take into account]{.mark} the [risk of
failure to colonize]{.mark} at all. We might fall victim to an
[existential risk]{.mark}, one where an adverse outcome would either
annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and
drastically [curtail its potential]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[8\] [Because
the lifespan of galaxies is measured in billions of years, whereas the
time-scale of any delays that we could realistically affect would rather
be measured in years or decades, [the consideration of risk trumps the
consideration of opportunity cost]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [[a
single percentage point of reduction of existential risks would be
worth]{.underline}]{.mark} (from a utilitarian expected utility
point-of-view) [[a delay of]{.mark} over [10 million
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Therefore, [if our actions have]{.mark}
even [the slightest effect on the probability of]{.mark} eventual
[colonization, this will outweigh their effect on when]{.mark}
[colonization takes place]{.mark}]{.underline}. For standard
utilitarians, priority number one, two, three and four should
consequently be to reduce existential risk. The utilitarian imperative
"Maximize expected aggregate utility!" can be simplified to the maxim
"Minimize existential risk!".

### Impact\-\--AT: CPT/Trade

#### No capitalist peace theory

**Nagle 10** \[John, "Nostrum or Palliative? Contesting the Capitalist
Peace in Violently Divided Societies," Civil Wars, Vol.12, No.3
(September 2010), p. 218--236\]

[The central thesis]{.underline} here [is]{.underline} that 'domestic
[institutions associated with capitalism]{.underline}, namely [private
property and competitive market structures,]{.underline} [have promoted
peace]{.underline} between states over the past two centuries'.84 [The
reason]{.underline} for this, it is [claimed, is that
states]{.underline} tightly [bound]{.underline} together
[by]{.underline} mutually beneficial [trade]{.underline} tend to look to
[settle conflicts peacefully]{.underline} as high levels of
international [commerce]{.underline} between states [raised 'the costs
of military conflict to unacceptable levels]{.underline} for modern
economies'.85 According to Bussmann, '\[i\]t is not in a country's
interest to go to war with a state with which its private economic
agents maintain an extensive exchange of goods and capital'.86 There is
a similar claim concerning how levels of foreign investment can
contribute to pacific relations between states and even within states.
Again, the idea here is that states will try to avoid violent conflict
so as not to deter foreign investors. The threat or onset of violent
conflict, on the other hand, disrupts not only trade but FDI flows. The
decision of foreign investors to locate their capital is influenced not
only by the economic policy of the host country, but also by the risk of
violent conflict in that state. War deters investors because it creates
insecurity leading even to the total loss of investments as factories
are closed, raw materials are in short supply and employees are killed
or are drafted into service.87 One example of how the lure of FDI can
help provide a context for stability between formerly warring neighbours
concerns Bosnia and Serbia. Although relations between the two states
have remained volatile since the end of the war in the mid-1990s, in
2010 an attempt was made to ameliorate relations between these
neighbours in order to lure FDI stock to the region. After a meeting
between the two states to discuss a joint approach toward international
markets, a member of Bosnia's tripartite rotating presidency stated that
'\[b\]adly needed investments will come only if there is security and
stability'.88 There are some [critiques that can be directed at the
above proposition]{.underline}. First, [while interdependent trade
and]{.underline} the lure of [FDI may make state]{.underline}s highly
[wary]{.underline} of engaging in war due to its exorbitant cost,
[ironically it **may encourage insurgents to mobilise**]{.underline}.
[Calculating that the state may do anything]{.underline}, short of
military action, [to protect economic stability, insurgents may provoke
violence in the reasonable hope that the state may give in to their
demands to expedite a quick peace.]{.underline} For example, the British
government's fear of the IRA bombing the financial City of London led it
to provide concessions to Irish republicans after one bomb cost damage
estimated as £350 million.89 Second, it [is not always the case that
states will avoid war at all costs]{.underline} to protect FDI; [far
from it, they **may resort to extremely coercive anti-insurgency
methods** precisely to guarantee the security of foreign
investors.]{.underline} The region of Aceh in Indonesia provides a case
in point here. In the early 1970s an abundance of oil and natural
liquefied gas was discovered in the region by Mobile. In response, an
industrial zone was created to allow the inflow of heavy foreign
investment. As part of the development of the industrial zone the local
Acehnese experienced severe disruption, including forced evictions and
some loss of indigenous industry; moreover, the Acehnese received only a
small percentage of the profits. Due in part to the disruptive impact of
the industrial zone, an Acehnese secessionist movement emerged -- the
Free Aceh Movement (GAM) -- and some of their attacks were targeted at
Exxon Mobil facilities and migrant Javanese workers. In direct response
to the attacks by GAM, Exxon Mobil threatened to suspend production in
Aceh until security could be guaranteed. Taking action, the Indonesian
government responded to the GAM campaign by initiating Operation 'Red
Net': a brutal counter-insurgency initiative, which led to the deaths of
up to 5,000 people. The counter-insurgency campaign did little to
convince Exxon that their investment and employees were safe and the
corporation cancelled operations in Aceh in 2001, which cost the
Indonesian government an estimated \$100 million per month in lost
revenue. Later on that year, the International Labor Rights Fund, acting
behalf of Acehnese villagers, filed a lawsuit against Exxon, accusing
them of human rights abuses, including murder and torture, when they
hired army units to protect natural gas fields.90 Third, and related to
the last point, [in regions characterised by extreme security
problems]{.underline} due to the threat of violence, [the carrot waved
to attract foreign investors must be **so great that it threatens** to
offset the potential balance between the local and international
ownership of post-war reconstruction]{.underline}. [This problem can be
witnessed in Iraq]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the occupation, [the
US-run CPA decreed the privatisation of 200 state-owned Iraqi
firms]{.underline}, the reduction of corporate tax from 40 to 15 per
cent, [and permission for foreign companies to own 100 per cent of
privatised Iraqi assets,]{.underline} including the right to 'transfer
abroad without delay all funds associated with its foreign investment,
including shares or profits and dividends'.91 [All of this was passed
without]{.underline} seeking [consent from the Iraqi
people]{.underline}, thus [**acting to ignite grievances and filling the
ranks of a growing insurgency** seeking to exploit ethnic
conflict]{.underline}, especially since little was done by the CPA to
deal with basic problems, like water sanitation, unemployment, security
and electricity. Many [Iraqis viewed]{.underline} the
[privatisation]{.underline} of the nation's industry into the hands of
foreign contractors [as]{.underline} little less than
[colonisation]{.underline}, especially as oil contracts became the focus
of bribery, price-fixing and embezzlement. Over \$12 billion of oil
revenue went unaccounted for and the CPA granted immunity from
prosecution to US personnel.92 According to Whyte, the scale of the
[appropriation of Iraq's oil revenue]{.underline}, in particular, [was a
'neo-liberal strategy of economic colonization']{.underline} carried out
by the CPA, especially since the authority dismissed the universal
principles of international law enshrined in the Hague and Geneva
treaties, so that they could 'privilege the primacy and autonomy of
market actors over laws intended to enshrine universal protections for
civilian populations in war and conflict'.93 Another problem here is
that [there is often an expectation that neoliberal processes will
expedite a relatively **speedy and tangible improvement**]{.underline}
in people's everyday life. **[This is rarely so]{.underline}**.
[Free-market economics]{.underline} largely **[relies on
trickledown]{.underline}** economics, with the profits garnered by the
vanguard entrepreneurs eventually arriving to those located at the lower
levels of society. The [anticipation of immediate results
may]{.underline} thus act to **[raise hopes only for them to be dashed
when little seems to change]{.underline}**. In fact, **[the situation in
the short term may actually worsen]{.underline}** as public workers are
laid off as state spending declines and existing welfare systems are
rolled back. [This is a]{.underline} potentially **[inflammatory
scenario,]{.underline}** as [protest mobilisation **is most likely**
when expectations of improvement are generated but are ultimately
deflated.]{.underline}94 In his analysis of peace building initiatives
Roland Paris notes that in order to pave the way for divided societies
to become fully functioning peaceful market economies, the [IMF and
World Bank typically initiate structural-adjustment
programmes]{.underline}. In exchange for loans, states are required to
instigate sweeping economic and institutional reform, including
privatising strategies, deregulation, decreases in corporation tax, and
austerity measures involving severe cutbacks in public spending to
ensure budgetary balance.95 [Rather than delivering any peace divided,
in the short term the population]{.underline} of divided societies
undergoing structural adjustment policies **[are subject to what is
tantamount to a 'peace penalty' as public sectorworkers are laid off and
public services are underresourced.]{.underline}**96 [This]{.underline}
situation [can exacerbate the ethnic security dilemma]{.underline}
mentioned earlier in regard to rapid democratisation. If [a]{.underline}
particular [ethnic group]{.underline} are [overrepresented in the public
sector]{.underline} (such as Serbs in Croatia) they [will
be]{.underline} obviously [fearful for their future security and may
resort to militant means]{.underline} to protect their interests. More
broadly, **[the decrease in security wrought by rapid market reform may
exacerbate social and ethnic tensions.]{.underline}** Ironically,
[attempts to stimulate future prosperity may create a new 'conflict
trap', **reducing the recruitment costs** for spoilers of the peace
process]{.underline}. For instance, in the early 1990s [the Rwandan
government had implemented]{.underline} internationally mandated
[austerity measures]{.underline} (government spending cuts, reductions
in price subsidies, and deregulation of the domestic economy) to help
engender a market economy. [These]{.underline} measures, Paris argues,
'[fostered an atmosphere of economic insecurity that strained intergroup
relations in the vital period leading up to the
genocide]{.underline}'.97 A related problem occurs when [market reforms
act to intensify socio-economic inequalities in a divided
society]{.underline}, especially when such disparities have been a focus
for violent ethnic mobilisation before[. After years of civil war,
during the 1990s the Chammoro government in Nicaragua initiated sweeping
economic reforms]{.underline} (public sector lay-offs, privatisation
policies, the liberalisation of the banking sector and a reduction of
public spending) under the auspices of the World Bank and IMF. [These
reforms resulted in an absolute decline in living standards and
exacerbated distributional inequalities]{.underline} between the rural,
largely indigenous peasantry and the wealthy urban elite. [Since these
inequalities were at the root of previous periods of violence in
Nicaragua, the transition to economic liberalism 'worked against the
goal of promoting a stable and lasting peace']{.underline}.98 (229-32)

#### Rules based trade fails to solve war\-\--perceived inequality increases ethnic conflict

**Nagle 10** \[John, "Nostrum or Palliative? Contesting the Capitalist
Peace in Violently Divided Societies," Civil Wars, Vol.12, No.3
(September 2010), p. 218--236\]

Another strand to the global thesis is that ['\[d\]isconnectedness
defines danger]{.underline}'.51 That is [states]{.underline}
'dangerously [disconnected from the globalizing world]{.underline}, from
[its rule sets, its norms]{.underline}, and all the ties that bind
countries together in mutually assured dependence',52 [are viewed as
more likely to engage in conflict]{.underline} since they do not have to
worry about the costs (diplomatic and financial) associated with war.
[These 'disconnected' states are not harmonised with other neoliberal
economies, especially in terms of trade regulations]{.underline} and
human rights legislation. [The idea]{.underline} here [is that
globalisation creates costly signalling]{.underline} by making
communication convincing.53 When leaders make political decisions they
have to weigh the economic costs and global markets act as a forum to
signal resolve.54 Such is the pacific quality of economic globalism,
that one proponent states: Show me where globalization is thick with
network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and
collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable
governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than
murder . . . But show me where globalization is thinning or just plain
absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive
regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and --
most important -- the chronic conflicts that incubate the next
generation of global terrorists.55 [There are numerous flaws to this
**globalism thesis**.]{.underline} The argument [that global
cosmopolitan values are eradicating ethno-national differences is
**unconvincing so far**]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline} in strictly
economic terms [the power of most states organised at the national scale
is eroding, **national and ethnic identities are incredibly robust
entities**.]{.underline}56 As one theorist notes[, although]{.underline}
relatively [discrete national economic systems have become enmeshed in
global processes]{.underline}, ['there are few grounds for
thinking]{.underline} that a concomitant [widespread pluralisation of
political identities has taken place']{.underline}.57
[Globalism,]{.underline} while it offers the opportunity for identity to
be a palimpsest upon which any number of associations can be penned,
[is]{.underline} also **[a profoundly disorientating
process]{.underline}**. [Many ethnic conflicts are **inspired by a
backlash against globalism**]{.underline}, [especially 'the disruptive
effects of global integration, and the failure of markets to
self-regulate in a way that protects the interests of the people' in the
poorer regions]{.underline} of the world.58 A point that will be
returned to later. (225)

### \-\--AT: Gartzke

#### Gartzke's model is trash

**Choi 11** \[Seung-Whan, PhD, "Re-Evaluating Capitalist and Democratic
Peace Models," International Studies Quarterly (2011) 55, 759--769\]

The Capitalist Peace Model: Three Errors [Based on]{.underline} a sample
of all [dyad years from 1950 to 1992, Gartzke's]{.underline} (2007)
[work addresses the question of whether capitalism exerts a pacifying
effect]{.underline} on the onset of international conflict.2 It proposes
that the absence of militarized disputes between democracies is largely
explained by the fact that since democracies tend to espouse capitalism,
the likelihood of disputes is greatly reduced. More specifically,
economic development, globalization of capital, and similar state policy
interests are hypothesized to lead dyads to be less likely to experience
a dispute. [For empirical testing, the capitalist peace model is built
on a replication of the democratic peace model]{.underline} proposed by
Oneal and Russett \[1997:278, Model 1, Table 2, as indicated in note 47
of Gartzke's (2007:176) study\], [which ''allows for ready comparison of
results]{.underline} and diminishes the danger that \[his\] findings
result from idiosyncrasies in coding or model specification'' (Gartzke
2007:173). The model consists of a lower score of democracy, a higher
score of democracy, capitalist variables, and several control
variables.3 Model Specification Error: Peace Years Taking note of Beck,
Katz, and Tucker's (1998) methodological suggestion,
[Gartzke's]{.underline} capitalist peace [model includes three temporal
spline variables (that is, spline1, spline2, and spline3) to control for
time dependence. However, a peace year variable that measures the number
of peace years since the last conflict and that serves as the base
variable to create those three spline **variables is left out**. Since
logit splines require that all four variables be included together, the
exclusion of a peace year variable makes the estimates of the capitalist
peace model **untenable**. Because Gartzke's study does not control for
the complete spline function]{.underline} for the years of peace[, it
obtains inconsistent parameter estimates and incorrect standard
errors.4]{.underline} Thus[, **the capitalist model is misleading
because its estimation suffers from omitted variable bias**. These
omissions explain why the effect of democracy does not hold
up]{.underline} in the capitalist peace model, [rather than the
capitalist variables winning over the democracy variable in
competition]{.underline}. As demonstrated in the next section, when the
model specification error is properly corrected, democracy re-emerges as
a pacifying factor in a consistent manner, whether a crisis is related
to a militarized dispute or a war. Observation Omission: Regional
Dummies When statistical software drops some observations upon the
execution of a model, it issues warning notes. Generally, researchers
investigate whether those drops are a justifiable procedure in order to
obtain unbiased and consistent estimates. [If researchers overlook
critical error messages about observation drops and report coefficients
and standard errors as they are, their findings may be misleading or
even worse, erroneous]{.underline}. The next section illustrates how
ignoring warning notes about observation drops can stymie one's
analysis. In [particular, this relates to Gartzke's study that does not
analyze the implications of warning notes regarding dropped observations
that are caused by the **inclusion of regional dummy
variables**]{.underline}. Sample Selection Bias: All Dyads versus
Politically Relevant Dyads [Sample selection bias is caused by the
selection of a particular sample instead of conducting a census of the
population. Gartzke's study examines the capitalism-- conflict
connection with a focus on all dyads but not on politically relevant
dyads]{.underline}. However, the [use of all possible dyads is open to
two criticisms. The first is theoretical: for example, there is no
reason to expect a militarized dispute between Malaysia and Uganda. The
second is **methodological**, as the inclusion of all possible dyads
makes the non-zero militarized dispute event extremely rare. Politically
relevant dyads that either share a border or include at least one major
power are considered more conflict prone than any other type of dyad
because they are exposed to more opportunities to interact, increasing
the likelihood of conflict. For this reason, students of conflict have
emphasized the importance of politically relevant dyads over all
dyads]{.underline} (for example, Lemke and Reed 2001; Russett and Oneal
2001). The next section demonstrates that [when the capitalist peace
model is fitted with politically relevant dyads, capitalist variables
become less robust, and in some cases
**insignificant**]{.underline}**.(**760-2)

#### Gartzke flawed 

\--meh

**Drezner 5** \[Daniel; Professor of international politics at Tufts;
September 9; Foreign Policy, "The commercial peace?,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2005/09/09/the-commercial-peace/\]

I'd really like for Gartzke's theoretical conclusions to be true, and he
makes a persuasive case in the paper. I have three small cavils,
however:

1\) [What, exactly, makes governments decide to increase economic
freedom in their own countries]{.underline}? One possibility is that
democracies are more likely to do this than non-democracies. For
example, Helen Milner and Keiko Kubota argue in "Why the Rush to Free
Trade? Democracy and Trade Policy in the Developing Countries" that:

Rising international trade flows are a primary component of
globalization. The liberalization of trade policy in many developing
countries has helped foster the growth of these flows. Concurrent with
this rush to free trade, there has been a global movement toward
democracy. We argue that these two trends are related: democratization
of the political system reduces the ability of governments to use trade
barriers as a strategy for building political support.... We provide
empirical evidence to support our claim through econometric analysis of
the developing countries from 1970-1999. Democracy seems to be
associated for these countries with trade liberalization. Globalization
may be fostered by democratization.

[In other words, it's possible that the best way for countries to
promote economic freedom is to promote political freedom as the
antecedent]{.underline}. 2) That said, the other thing that worries me
about Gartzke's finding is that **[trade openness is not significant in
any of the regression results]{.underline}** (though, as the appendix
makes clear, trade metrics are included in the economic freedom score,
so this could just be multicollinearity at work). Again, [it could be
that trade openness leads to more economic freedom across the board,
which then leads to less violent behavior.]{.underline} But if that's
not the case, [it's profoundly disturbing, since besides democracy
promotion]{.underline}, [trade diplomacy is the primary engine through
which the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [promotes economic
freedom in the rest of the world.]{.underline} 3) One last musing ---
[the economic freedom score is a composite of a series of
measures]{.underline}, [including rule of law]{.underline} (which is
correlated with democratic regimes) [low inflation]{.underline} (which
is correlated with economic development) and [low tariffs]{.underline}
(which is correlated with economic openness). [How much of the empirical
results are driven by multicollinearity]{.underline} between the
explanatory variable and the the control variables?

### \-\--AT: Mousseau

#### Mousseau's method is bad faith, statistically illiterate guesswork 

**Ray '17** \[James Lee Ray and Allan Defoe, "Democratic peace versus
contractualism," Feb 6, 2017,

Conflict Management and Peace Science\]

[DOR]{.underline} (2013) is [the most recent in a series of papers
evaluating Mousseau's claims about contractualism]{.underline} (and
democratic peace) (Dafoe, 2011; Russett, 2011). The authors point out
that [one of the most important and dubious aspects of
Mousseau]{.underline} (2013) [involves **missing data.**]{.underline}
The analyses reported in Mousseau (2013) rely crucially on
contractualism operationalized with life insurance data, and [those data
were missing for 98% of the observations included in the
study]{.underline}. [That alone is enough to raise **severe reservations
about Mousseau's results**]{.underline}. Authoritative discussions of
imputation warn about the dangers of imputing large proportions of data
points, with 98% far beyond even an "extreme" degree of missingness
(Rubin, 1996: 482). Further, [Mousseau]{.underline} (2013)[singly
imputes missing data]{.underline} ([using a command in Stata that is now
obsolete,]{.underline} reflecting the dubious validity of this process),
[despite the methodological consensus]{.underline} (at the time and
still today) [that single imputation]{.underline}, as compared with the
recommended multiple imputation, **[underestimates the uncertainty in
the imputed values]{.underline}**. In addition, Mousseau's (2013)
imputation model was not published anywhere, and can only be inferred
from a close review of his replication files.

In short, [98% of the data on Mousseau's]{.underline} (2013)
[key]{.underline} independent [variable were imputed from a model that
was not discussed or defended, and in a manner that was almost
**certain** to produce **erroneous estimates.**]{.underline} DOR (2013)
show that multiple imputations of that life insurance data produce
significant coefficients for Democracy Low in virtually all plausible
specifications of the models in question.

DOR (2103) discuss, in addition to the imputation of the life insurance
variable, six other design choices made by Mousseau (2013) having to do
with (a) the coding of conflicts lasting more than one year, (b) the
analysis of all MIDS vs only MIDs with fatalities, (c) inclusion of
Democracy High as a control variable, (d) inclusion of an interaction
term focusing on democracy and contractualism, (e) the
operationalization of Democracy, and (f) the choice of data on life
insurance.

Regarding the first of these design choices, DOR point out that [for
Mousseau's outcome measure of conflict, he set as 0 all]{.underline}
[years involving conflict after the first year]{.underline}. By this
coding, a 5 year MID would be coded the same as a 1 month MID (1, 0, 0,
0, 0); a year of peace is coded the same as a year in conflict (after
the first year). No scholar of whom we are aware, other than Mousseau
(2018), has argued for such a measure of ongoing conflicts, although
such authoritative sources as Bennett and Stam (2004) have argued
against it. Bennett and Stam recommend that, if conflict onset is to be
the dependent variable, then years of ongoing disputes should be
excluded, rather than included as 0s, since "we should only include
cases where all values of the dependent variable could actually occur"
(p. 53). It is worth noting that "this one correction (to Mousseau 2013)
restores the evidence for the democratic peace" (p \< 0.1). So, DOR did
not have to go very far to reveal the fragility of Mousseau's analyses;
the correction of a single dubious operationalization was sufficient to
overturn his results.

[While showing that Mousseau's results disappear after one correction is
informative, DOR might have generated hundreds of analyses and only
reported the single result that supported their case]{.underline}. But
in fact, they examine virtually all of the possible options dealing with
the seven design issues specified above, producing 144 different
specifications. Sixty-six percent produced highly significant
coefficients for Democracy (p \< 0.01); 89% were weakly significant (p
\< 0.1). The opposite side of this coin is the fragility of Mousseau's
reported finding regarding contractualism, democracy and peace. Almost
any variation in design choices (most of which are defensible) reveals
weaknesses in that finding.

Mousseau (2018) reviews DOR's analyses, reports that 120 of them include
contractualism as a variable, and argues that all but four of those
analyses are invalid because of design choices made by DOR that are
(according to Mousseau) "controversial or contrary to convention." In
order to produce the finding he prefers demonstrating that contract
intensity, not democracy, has an important pacifying impact, he rejects
all the relevant design choices regarding the seven issues in question,
except the ones that he prefers.

As Simonsohn et al. (2015, Abstract) point out, "Empirical results often
hinge on data analytic decisions that are simultaneously defensible,
arbitrary, and motivated." They offer a process they call
"Specification-Curve Analysis" as a way of evaluating models according
to their sensitivity to such data analytic decisions. It gives higher
marks, so to speak, to models that prove to be more robust.

[Mousseau's own research history suggests that more than one of the
available options we are discussing here are acceptable. Analysts can
choose, for example, to include or exclude states that join in disputes
after they have continued for some time]{.underline}. Mousseau (2018)
argues that "By convention 'joiners' are participants who enter a
conflict after it has already started by 'originators.' Standard
practice is to observe only originators." But Mousseau (2009: 65)
explains that "Following standard procedure, I ... included joiners."

Another of these issues regarding which Mousseau (and many others) has
been inconsistent involves ongoing disputes of the type we discussed
above. Mousseau (2018: 180) asserts that DOR (2013) stipulate that years
of ongoing disputes should be excluded from analyses, and that
Mousseau's (2103) inclusion of those years was a "major error." In fact,
as we have seen, what DOR criticize is not the inclusion of ongoing
years of disputes. What they criticize is the coding of years of
continuing disputes (when conflict onset is the dependent variable) as
0s rather than missing data. DOR (2013) specifically acknowledge that
either including or excluding observations of disputes that continue for
more than one year is "justified." But Mousseau (2018) also concedes
that in four of his papers published before 2013 (namely Mousseau, 2009,
2012a; Mousseau et al., 2013a, b), years of ongoing disputes were
excluded.

So, [Mousseau and many other analysts have relied on more than one
option regarding most of the design choices under discussion
here]{.underline}. In [spite of this copious evidence that there is
considerable variety in the field regarding such design choices,
Mousseau]{.underline} (2018) [routinely designates one option as the
"standard" or "conventional" practice, and accuses DOR]{.underline}
(2013) [of "errors" if they make different choices, or even just
evaluate the impact of the alternative options. Ideally,
models]{.underline} [are able to produce consistent results in spite of
variation in]{.underline} (often both or all acceptable) [design
choices.]{.underline} DOR (2013) demonstrate that the "contractualism"
model tends to be sensitive to such variation.4

But a more fundamental point to be taken away from this debate has to do
with the limits to which one can move toward resolution by focusing on
dueling regression analyses of observational data. Those limits can be
stretched to some degree by the derivation and testing of novel
observable implications from a rich theory and the testing of these
implications by causal process tracing, analyses of public opinion data,
and micro-analyses.5 But observational data will always require
substantial caution as a basis for claims about causal linkages.

Conclusion

For that reason, [it is important to move the debate beyond the focus on
such data]{.underline}. [Their shortcomings can be addressed with some
success by experiments, natural or otherwise.]{.underline}

Natural experiments are rare opportunities in history when some process
manipulated a causal factor of interest in an as-if random way. These
are extremely valuable, since (as-if) random treatment assignment
guarantees that our estimates of causal effects will not be biased by
the confounders that plague most observational studies. [Natural
experiments are rare, and often require extensive
"shoe-leather"]{.underline} (subject matter expertise and fieldwork) [to
find them and collect the data to analyze them]{.underline} (Dunning
2012). **[But any serious research program ought to have seriously
looked for them]{.underline}**, and many have been found to study such
elusive phenomena as the effects of extractive institutions on growth
(Acemoglu et al., 2012), of armed combat on ethnic homogeneity (Jha and
Wilkinson, 2012), of proportional vs representative government on
well-being (Hinnerich and Pettersson-Lidblom, 2014), of honor cultures
on war (Dafoe and Caughey, 2016) and so forth. Where might we find a
natural experiment for contract intensity?

**Dafoe 14** \[Dafoe, A., Kelsey, N., "Observing the capitalist peace:
Examining market-mediated signaling and other mechanisms," Journal of
Peace Research 51, September 2014\]

The stakes are large for researchers to better understand the mechanisms
supporting the liberal peace. This study sought to do so by
investigating the family of market-mediated signaling mechanisms
purported to generate the observed correlation between mutually open
capital markets and peace. We [examined six most likely crucial cases to
look for evidence of the mechanisms suggested by Gartzke]{.underline},
Li & Boehmer (2001): that open capital markets facilitate costly
signaling through economic costs ex ante to militarized conflict[. We
employed a novel formal case selection strategy that maximizes the
leverage and minimizes the bias of our cases]{.underline}. [Because our
case selection strategy was objective, other scholars may examine
potential problems with our design and may extend our analysis to the
next most promising cases]{.underline}. Our research finds some support
for market-mediated signaling mechanisms, clarifies the means by which
they may operate, suggests reasons why they may fail to obviate a
conflict, and finds suggestive evidence for alternative explanations for
the relationship between capital openness and peace.

Our case studies yield a mixed judgment on the plausibility of
market-mediated signaling mechanisms. The two wars that we examined
provide strong support for the existence of [market-mediated
signaling]{.underline} following highly conflictual events, though in
both these cases it [clearly failed to avert the conflict]{.underline}.
This seemingly paradoxical result may, however, arise from our selecting
'high leverage' cases for which the relevant scope conditions were
absent. We find it plausible that market-mediated signaling could help
to avert conflicts arising from asymmetric information in other
circumstances where escalation is more gradual, issues are more
divisible, and leaders have not become locked-in to the conflict.

However, [in the other cases]{.underline}, which were selected in a
manner less likely to retrieve cases outside the scope conditions of the
mechanism (non-fatal MIDs and high risk dyad-years), **[we found little
conclusive evidence of market-mediated signaling.]{.underline}**
**[These cases did suggest several supplemental or alternative accounts
for the capitalist peace association]{.underline}**. We found evidence
for anticipation of costs as a factor in actors' thinking. We saw
instances of third-party intervention that may have been encouraged by
the economic openness of parties involved. Several of our cases
suggested that the causal relationship may be reversed: open capital
markets may indicate a state's acceptance of the regional status quo and
peace. Peace-oriented leaders may instrumentally use the pacifying
effect of capital openness to reinforce their desired peace. These
additional mechanisms suggest possibilities for future research.

#### Aesthetics doesn't solve anything but attempting to endorse it both reentrenches capitalism and enables racialized capitalist oppression

**Bromberg 13** (Svenja Bromberg PhD - social theorist and philosopher
with expertise in French and German thought from the 19th to the 21st
century, "THE ANTI-POLITICAL AESTHETICS OF OBJECTS AND WORLDS BEYOND",

<https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond>,
MG)

There is at first a very material sense in which its advocates justify
the turn to objects. [We are at a point where our faith in the powers of
the subject to critique and subvert reality, as grounded in
Enlightenment theory, **has been truly defeated**, not least by
capitalism's now much discussed ability to demand precisely subjective
-- emotional or affective -- investments in its exploitative
machinery.]{.underline}[[^5^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote5sym) Thus,
it is not only the fact that '**subjects are always already
subjected'**,]{.underline} which we have learned from Foucault, Butler
and other
poststructuralists.[[6]{.underline}](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote6sym) [But
if capitalism wants us to be ever more alive, happy and truly engaged in
shaping our own lives on the basis of the endless possibilities this
world has to offer, then the critique offered by vitalist theories,
aesthetic modes such as Bourriaud's '**relational aesthetics'** and more
critical forms of emancipated spectatorship against an objectifying and
alienating capitalist reality **appear assimilated and
defused**.]{.underline}[^[7]{.underline}^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote7sym) As
Diedrich Diederichsen outlines in a recent e-flux article, it is
precisely what was still antithetical to the Fordist assembly line --
[different modes of dreaming 'dangerously' or living authentic or
alternative lives -- that seems to have become part of the post-Fordist
'imperative to produce a perfect self as a perfect
thing'.]{.underline}[[^8^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote8sym) Smiles
or grins, day-dreams and ways of being that could formerly help
alleviate or escape the alienated existence of the labourer have
themselves become reified as part of the **requisite service we are
compelled to
provide**.]{.underline}[^[9]{.underline}^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote9sym) Diederichsen
describes a sense, similar to the German theatre director René Pollesch
in his play *Love is Colder than Capital* in which **[all relations have
become toxic and emotions have been rendered cold objects for
capital.]{.underline}**[[^10^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote10sym) Thus,
the primary concern seems to be with oppressive, exploitative and
reified capitalist social relations and how to break out of them -- but
the solutions we're confronted with from the diverse strands of the 'new
materialisms' no longer lie in the critique of these relations, but
rather in a nonrelational and un-dialectical gesture that posits the
world of matter against the man-made disaster of a neoliberal
existence.]{.underline}[^[11]{.underline}^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote11sym)

[The search for what Diederichsen calls 'de-reification' ventures
towards that which evades representation, which is not rendered
object *qua* instrumental reason but *qua* its own force, the dark, the
mystic, the animate but soul-less -- something that is more truly cold
and yet not cold at all. This line of argument, however -- which is
echoed in Hito Steyerl's emphatic call for us to finally accept the
death of the subject and embrace the forces of construction and
destruction, of violence and the possibility stored within things --
problematically **sidelines the classed, racialised and gendered
oppressions of capitalist reality**]{.underline}**.** Within this,
masses of people have never been granted any 'subject status' in the
first place and are, instead, rendered mere objects or even superfluous,
because not productive, for capital. From the point of view of these
relations, [the move towards accepting or even embracing objectification
as in itself emancipatory can be **nothing more than a bad
joke.**]{.underline}

[This sentiment, which shares its focus with the new materialisms, tends
to uphold a mind-body dualism in which the subject is associated with
the mind and the bad effects of Enlightenment rationalism, whereas the
physical body with its pre-cognitive responses and movements is often,
and rather miraculously, able to maintain a certain independence from
worldly subjections. Even if there is an investment in overcoming this
dualism and a certain caution against glorifying 'nature' as the
unchanging outside of the human world to be called upon when attempts to
elevate culture fail, the new materialisms' emphasis on pre-cognitive
affects, feelings and touch in the realm of the natural, or as moments
of 'matter receiving form', **cannot escape the body's
prioritisation.**]{.underline}[**^[12]{.underline}^**](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote12sym) This
tendency towards an 'aesthetics through
embodiment'[^13^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote13sym),
which finds its theoretical anchor in Brian Massumi's work and other
thinkers in the field of **Affect Studies,** is still very much
entangled with the **human** body and its ability to be drawn into new
relational and animate fields through or as part of an
artwork.[^14^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote14sym)

[The Aesthetic Achieves Lift-Off and Comes Back Down with a
Thud]{.underline}

This exalted vision of the purity and autonomy of art, in which the
artist is a creative visionary, a Promethean hero, gave rise to the
Romantic sensibility of the late eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries---and to much that followed. It informs Swinburne's bold
pronouncement, "Art for Art's sake first of all, and afterwards the rest
shall be added to her ... but from the man who falls to artistic work
with a moral purpose shall be taken away even that which he has"; the
Russian formalists' elevation of the self-referential patterns of
aesthetic form as art's singular guiding light; and even Carl Jung's
vision of the artist as the expression of the highest truths of our
collective unconscious, "the unwitting mouthpiece of the psychic secrets
of his time."

This reverential tradition led to the canonization of aesthetic works as
academic literature departments took shape in the late nineteenth
century. These masterpieces, T. S. Eliot writes in his 1919 essay,
"Tradition and the Individual Talent," are monuments in an imaginary
library and "form an ideal order among themselves." By Eliot's time,
Shiner tells us, art and culture---and their accompanying norms of
manners and refinement---had become a great dividing line, replacing an
earlier divide between the large mass of common folk and a tiny
hereditary aristocracy:

[The emergence of new art institutions like art museums, literary
reviews and secular concerts led to the use of cultural choices to mark
social ascension, and a consequent withdrawal of art from lower-class
culture, so that whereas in 1500, popular culture was everyone's
culture, by 1800, the clergy, nobility, merchants and professional men
and their wives had **abandoned popular culture to the lower classes**
...]{.underline}

By the late nineteenth century, the kind of multilevel culture with
which we are now familiar began to emerge. [One could identify a
person's social class in part by what papers or books they read, what
music they listened to, what plays they saw, what sort of pictures they
preferred.]{.underline}

[But this is becoming less and less true today; art and culture have
**ceased to serve** as the dividing line between the elites and the
unschooled, unwashed masses. Art lost that status when, as I argue here,
the vaguely literate but entirely uncultivated post-war techno-financial
elite **replaced the old literary intelligentsia**, whereupon literature
and other hallmarks of high culture began to undergo a first gradual and
then more rapid rot on the vine. Marxist and Marx-inspired class
prejudice, together with Dadaism and postmodernism, leveled the
distinctions between high and low, avant-garde and kitsch, originality
and banality and ultimately between art and everything else, resulting
in profound and sweeping biases against perceived elites and difficult
elite culture. Ultimately, conventional aesthetic merit ceased to
matter.]{.underline}

[But banal or low art]{.underline} differs fundamentally from high art:
[it **lacks the visionary gleam**; it can only **reflect society back to
itself**. Such art could no longer be credibly thought to **fulfill
anything like the transformative**, redemptive function attributed to
art by Schiller and his followers. The special status of the great
artist, the creative genius, the echo of divinity, quickly fell away, to
be replaced by market values,]{.underline} which equate genius with
worldly success and relegate the true geniuses toiling in obscurity to
the realm of oddball quackery, making them figures of ridicule. And woe
be to those effete intellectuals and elitist critics that still dare
abide by the traditional distinction between high and low and speak ill
of comics, comic book films, sitcoms, reality TV, pop music, hip hop and
so on.

Scholars and practitioners frequently employ the term "dilemma" to
describe painful decision making but "quandary" would be more apt.27A
dilemma involves two or more alternative courses of action with
unintended but unavoidable and equally undesirable consequences. If
consequences are equally unpalatable, then remaining inactive on the
sidelines is an option rather than entering the serum on the field. [[A
quandary]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[entails]{.mark}
**tough [choices]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} **unattractive
[options]{.mark}**]{.underline} with better or worse possible outcomes.
[While humanitarians are perplexed]{.underline}, they are not and should
not be immobilized. The solution is not indifference or withdrawal but
rather appropriate engagement. [The key lies in]{.underline} making [a
good faith effort [to **analyze**]{.mark} the **[advantages and
disad]{.mark}vantage[s]{.mark}** of different]{.underline} alloys of
[politics]{.underline} and humanitarianism, [and then [to
choose]{.mark}]{.underline} what often amounts to **[[the lesser of
evils]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Thoughtful humanitarianism is more appropriate than rigid ideological
responses, for four reasons: goals of humanitarian action often
conflict, [**good [intentions]{.mark}** [can have]{.mark} **catastrophic
[consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}; there are alternative ways to
achieve ends; and even if none of the choices is ideal, victims still
require decisions about outside help. What Myron Wiener has called
"instrumental humanitarianism" would resemble just war doctrine because
contextual analyses and not formulas are required. Rather than resorting
to knee-jerk reactions to help, [it [is necessary to **weigh**]{.mark}
**options** and make decisions about choices that are far from
optimal]{.underline}.

Many humanitarian decisions in northern Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, and
Rwanda---and especially those involving economic or military
sanctions--- required selecting least-bad options. Thomas Nagle advises
that "given the limitations on human action, it is naive to suppose that
there is a solution to every moral problem. "29 Action-oriented
institutions and staff are required in order to contextualized their
work rather than apply preconceived notions of what is right or wrong.
Nonetheless, classicists continue to insist on Pictet's "indivisible
whole" because humanitarian principles "are interlocking, overlapping
and mutually supportive. . . . It is hard to accept the logic of one
without also accepting the others.

"30The process of making decisions in war zones could be compared to
that pursued by "clinical ethical review teams" whose members are on
call to make painful decisions about life-and-death matters in
hospitals.sl The sanctity of life is complicated by new technologies,
but urgent decisions cannot be finessed. [It is impermissible
to]{.underline} long for another era or to [pretend that the bases for
decisions are unchanged]{.underline}. However emotionally wrenching,
[[finding **solutions** is an]{.mark} **operational
[imperative]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is challenging but
intellectually doable. Humanitarians who cannot stand the heat generated
by situational ethics should stay out of the post-Cold War humanitarian
kitchen.

Principles in an Unprincipled World.Why are humanitarians in such a
state of moral and operational disrepair? In many ways Western liberal
values over the last few centuries have been moving toward interpreting
moral obligations as going beyond a family and intimate networks, beyond
a tribe, and beyond a nation. The impalpable moral ideal is concern
about the fate of other people, no matter how far away.szThe evaporation
of distance with advances in technology and media coverage, along with a
willingness to intervene in a variety of post\--Cold War crises,
however, has produced situations in which humanitarians are damned if
they do and if they don't. Engagement by outsiders does not necessarily
make things better, and it may even create a "moral hazard by altering
the payoffs to combatants in such a way as to encourage more intensive
fighting.

"33 This new terrain requires analysts and practitioners to admit
ignorance and question orthodoxies. There is no comfortable theoretical
framework or world vision to function as a compass to steer between
integration and fragmentation, globalization and insularity. Michael
Ignatieff observes, "The world is not becoming more chaotic or violent,
although our failure to understand and act makes it seem so. "34Gwyn
Prins has pointed to the "scary humility of admitting one's ignorance"
because "the new vogue for 'complex emergencies' is too often a means of
concealing from oneself that one does not know what is going on. "3sTo
make matters more frustrating, never before has there been such a
bombardment of data and instant analysis; the challenge of distilling
such jumbled and seemingly contradictory information adds to the
frustration of trying to do something appropriate fast.

International discourse is not condemned to follow North American
fashions and adapt sound bites and slogans. [[It is **essential**
to]{.mark} struggle with and even **[embrace]{.mark}** the
[ambiguities]{.mark}]{.underline} that permeate international responses
to wars, but [[without the **illusion** of]{.mark} a
**[one-size-fits-all]{.mark} solution**]{.underline}. The trick is to
grapple with complexities, to tease out the general without ignoring the
particular, and still to be inspired enough to engage actively in trying
to make a difference. Because more and more staff of aid agencies, their
governing boards, and their financial backers have come to value
reflection, an earlier policy prescription by Larry Minear and me no
longer appears bizarre: "Don't just do something, stand there! "3sThis
advice represented our conviction about the payoffs from thoughtful
analyses and our growing distaste for the stereotypical, yet often
accurate, image of a bevy of humanitarian actors flitting from one
emergency to the next.

performances]{.underline}. [Obedient performances in cumulative effect
tend to support the existing regime as they insinuate its dictates into
our collective habits of perception, judgment, and action]{.underline}.
[Unless a dissident group of workers meticulously "works according to
rule" to disrupt production through excruciating obedience in a way that
discloses how tangled formal rules can become]{.underline}. Or a group
creatively improvises on the performance of Bartleby the Scrivener,
posing endless questions about the orders given to it until the machine
overflows itself or is jammed. **[These indeed are creative role
experimentations]{.underline}**. [So was the practice in Eastern Europe
during the late stages of Soviet rule to clap endlessly when a Soviet
stooge spoke]{.underline}, [until the bewildered speaker was moved to
sit down amid the roar around him]{.underline}. [I recently attended a
faculty meeting with the president of my university at which the entire
faculty remained silent after his Ceo-style talk ended and he departed
slowly up the aisle. **Sometimes silence sends a message to power.**
**Our lives are messages**]{.underline}.5 [**[Role experimentation can
disrupt and redirect]{.mark} the flow of [authority, habit,
institutional regularity]{.mark},** and future projection. [It
can]{.mark} also **[encourage]{.mark}** [others to look more closely at
their own performances]{.mark} in this or that domain]{.underline}.
**[[Such experiments can]{.mark} also [set the stage for]{.mark} more
adventurous and [larger scale actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. My
examples will be limited to con- stituencies who are the most apt to
read this book, though they could easily be adjusted to a broader array.
[Suppose **[a constellation of students]{.mark}**, studying to enter
professional life, [forms study groups to explore]{.mark}]{.underline}
more closely how those professions presuppose and enforce [[a set
of]{.mark} **[practices]{.mark} [that contribute to]{.mark} [the
fragility of things]{.mark} as they simultaneously draw attention away
from that contribution**]{.underline}. [The [students may pose
**untimely questions**]{.mark}]{.underline} in their political science,
economics, engineering, medical, business, legal, and biology classes.
If in a secular institution, they may seek out courses that complicate
the assumptions of secularism. If in a religious school, they may
organize a group to explore the history of atheism or of minority faiths
that eschew the theme of a per- sonal God. They can engage experimental
artistic work that stretches their habitual patterns of perception and
judgment. The nature- and soundscape compositions of John Luther Adams
have salutary effects on many in this respect. **[[Such activities
can]{.mark} also [prime you to experiment with other role performances
once you enter professional life]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[If a
lawyer]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**, [you may]{.mark} organize to
[rethink]{.mark} your [connections]{.mark} to the ugly prison system
[and]{.mark} to [adjust your practice]{.mark}** to protest its ugliness.
Or you may give a portion of your time [to challenge
corporations]{.mark}, localities, and states [that defile the
environment]{.mark}. [If a doctor]{.mark}, you may organize voluntary
medical care for the poor and publicize what you are doing.]{.underline}
In both cases **[[these experimentations]{.mark} make a modest
difference on their own, prime our capacities for more sensitive
perception in other domains of life, and may [prepare us to
participate]{.mark} with others [in]{.mark} yet [more adventurous
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[These are [minor moments]{.mark},
but an accumulation of minor moments [can jostle settled habits of
perception]{.mark}; they can encourage a readiness to become more
exploratory; and [they can extend the time horizon within which we think
and act]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [Suppose]{.underline}, now,
[you are middle- or upper-middle-class citizens in a polity that has
competitive elections]{.underline}. [You have become increasingly
dissatisfied with the course your society is taking.
**Voting**]{.underline}, while pertinent, **[seems radically
insufficient]{.underline}** to the issues involved. Its time horizon is
too short and the strategic place of ill-informed undecided voters in
electoral politics skews campaigns too sharply. [Inequality has been
extended]{.underline}. The [lower reaches of society are left out in the
cold and often blamed for the suffering they undergo. The news media are
organized around scandal and a brief time horizon]{.underline}.
**[Racial differences are exploited to break up potential coalitions on
the left.]{.underline}** [A large slice of the population is
periodically suscep- tible to war fever. Climate change is widely
subjected to deferral, denial, or formal acceptance disconnected from
action. And the right wing actively promotes filibusters and legislative
stalemates to encourage more and more people to withdraw from
citizenship and to tolerate the privatization of more and more of
life.]{.underline} The sciences and professions with which you are
familiar are often too narrowly defined. Too many churches either
provide refuges from the world or serve as sites of aggressive attack on
ecological concerns, homosexu- ality, carriers of alternative faiths, or
poor minorities. You know what po- litical party you support; [you vote
regularly; and you give time and money to your party. But you also find
it difficult to connect the sentiments you profess to the role
expectations sedimented into your practices of work, church,
consumption, neighborhood association, investment portfolio, children's
school, artistic pursuits, and local news reporting. **[Now is the time
to join others in becoming role experimentalists]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
You may actively support the farm-to-table movement in the restaurants
you visit; you may support the slow food movement; you may frequent
stores that offer food based on sustainable processes; you may buy a
hybrid or, if feasible, join an urban zip-car collective, explaining to
friends, family, and neighbors what effect such choices could have on
late modern ecology if a majority of the populace did one or the other;
you may press your neighborhood association and workplace to buy solar
panels and install them yourself; you may use writing and media skills
developed in school to write for a blog; you may shift a large portion
of your retirement account into investments that support sustainable
energy; you may withdraw from aggressive investments that presuppose an
unsustainable growth pattern, threaten economic collapse, and/or
undermine the collec- tive future; you may bring new issues and visitors
to your church, temple, or mosque to support rethinking about
interdenominational issues and the contemporary fragility of things; you
may found, join, or frequent a repair club, at which volunteers collect
and repair old appliances, furni- ture, and vehicles to cut back on
urban waste and increase the longevity of these items; you may probe and
publicize the multimodal tactics by which twenty-four-hour news stations
work on the visceral register of their viewers, as you explore ways to
counter those techniques; you may travel to places where unconscious
American assumptions about world entitlement are challenged on a regular
basis; you may augment your pattern of films and artistic exhibits
attended to stretch your habitual powers of perception and to challenge
some affect-imbued prejudgments embedded in them; you may seek out new
friends who are also moving in these directions. You may regularly relay
pregnant essays you encounter to friends, colleagues, and relatives[.
**[A series of minor role experiments.]{.mark}** As we proceed our
aspirational selves may now begin to exceed our operational selves, and
the shame we feel about the discrepancy between these two aspects of the
self may **[generate energy to enter into yet new modes of role
experimentation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.6 [We]{.underline} thus [begin to
make ourselves and our engagements more experimental rather than simply
falling into a ready- made set of role expectations]{.underline}. We
have begun to become what Nietzsche calls "our own guinea pigs" rather
than merely being the guinea pigs of those in charge of these
institutions. [As such experiments accumulate, the ice in and around us
begins to crack]{.underline}. First, [[the **shaky
perceptions**]{.mark}, feelings, and beliefs [with which we started
these experimentations now become more refined]{.mark} and more
entrenched]{.underline}. Second, we are now better situated to forge
connections with yet larger constituencies engaging in similar
experiments. Third, [as these **connections** accumulate we may be more
inspired to join macropolitical movements that speak to the
issues]{.underline}. Fourth, [**[as we]{.mark}** now join protests,
slowdowns, and **[confront]{.mark}**ational meetings]{.underline} [with
**[corporate managers, church leaders, union officials, university
officials, and neighborhood leaders, we]{.mark}** may now **[become more
alert to]{.mark}** the **[institutional pressures that propel]{.mark}**
these **[constituencies forward]{.mark}** too]{.underline}. They are
also both enmeshed in a web of roles that en- able and constrain them
and often more than mere role bearers. These roles too exhibit varying
degrees of pressure and slack as they link the details of daily conduct
to the strategic practices of the larger political economy.

#### Saying that the state is always bad is a terrible misreading of Deleuze -- piecemeal reform is important and you should affirm it -- rejecting the state in a totalizing way means the aff links to itself, since they turn difference into opposition -- creativity with democratic politics solves all their offense 

**Patton, '05** (Paul Patton, *Deleuze and Democracy*, Contemporary
Political Theory,
http://www.palgrave-journals.com/cpt/journal/v4/n4/full/9300236a.html)

[[Mengue turns]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[difference into opposition in
suggesting]{.underline}]{.mark} that the position of majority is by
nature opposed to the creativity of the minoritarian: [[majoritarian
democratic politics inevitably \'crush]{.underline}]{.mark}es\'
[[creative becomings]{.underline}]{.mark} (Mengue, 2003, 102). According
to this view, to adopt the standpoint of the majority is always to
abandon the standpoint of the untimely and the creative in favour of the
state and established values. [[This is a **misrepresentation** of
Deleuze and Guattari\'s view and an implausible view of democratic
politics. Legislative measures introduced in]{.mark} a number of
[democracies]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years [[have served to
broaden the standard to include non-whites, non-males
and]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[to allow equal rights to homosexual
partners]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These measures suggest
that]{.underline}, [far from \'crushing novelty\']{.underline} as Mengue
suggests, **[[democratic politics can have its own forms of
creativity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. No doubt [such measures have been
implemented in response to micropolitical changes already
underway]{.underline}. For this reason, William Connolly reminds us that
in order to be responsive to new claims for the reconfiguration of the
standard [[democratic political life needs to be infused with a public
ethos of critical engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} (Connolly, 1999, 51).
For Deleuze and Guattari, the different forms of minority becoming
provide the impulse for change at the level of social and political
institutions, but [[this]{.mark} change [only occurs to the extent that
there is **adaptation and incorporation** on the side of the
majority]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When they say that the power of
minorities \'is not measured by their capacity to enter into and make
themselves felt within the majority system, nor even to reverse the
necessarily tautological criterion of the majority\', they mean that the
[majorities do not determine the limits of]{.mark} the potential for
[transformation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987, 471).
They do not mean to suggest that minorities do not enter into and
produce effects upon the majority. On the contrary[,]{.mark} **[[they
insist upon the importance of piecemeal changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to the form and content of a given majority: [[\'molecular escapes and
movements would be nothing if they did not return to the molar
organizations to reshuffle their segments]{.mark}, their binary
distributions of sexes, classes and parties\']{.underline} (Deleuze and
Guattari, 1987, 216--217).6 Deleuze and Guattari\'s insistence on the
transformative potential of minoritarian becomings does not imply a
refusal of democratic politics, much less a rejection of democratic
principles. The irreducible character of the difference in kind between
majority and minority aligns them firmly with the proponents of
democratic pluralism such as Connolly, for whom the key to an open-ended
democratic process lies in the \'productive tension\' between
majoritarian governance, rights and recognition on the one hand, and
minoritarian becoming on the other (Connolly, 2002, 172). For Deleuze
and Guattari, [it is precisely those excluded from the majority as
defined by a given set of axioms who are the potential bearers of the
power to transform that set]{.underline}, whether in the direction of a
new set of axioms or an altogether new axiomatic. [These are the source
of minoritarian becomings that carry the potential for new earths and
peoples unlike like those found in existing democracies]{.underline}.

#### Critique alone without action won't do anything to [mobilize]{.underline} lines of flight or political possibility.

**Adkin 16** (Laurie, teaches Political Science at the University of
Alberta, "Political Ecology and Counter-Hegemonic Politics" in A World
to Win, ed. by Carroll and Sarker, 2016, p. 109-110)

[[Political ecology is integral to]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[counter-hegemonic reform]{.underline}]{.mark} agenda [[because it
offers]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[substantive]{.underline}]{.mark} set of
[[directions for a post-capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}, ecologically
sustainable [[model of development]{.underline}]{.mark}. Returning to
the brief discussion of resource sector workers, above, and to Raymond
Williams\'s insistence that [people need to]{.underline} be able to
[believe that "practical alternatives" are available]{.underline}, [it
is clear that political ecologists must build coalitions to develop and
negotiate]{.underline} transitional plans as well as [new
institutions]{.underline}. The starting points for such coalitions may
be municipal or regional; the ways in which national and global
institutions (treaties, trade and investment agreements, WTO rules,
jurisdictional division of powers, etc.) constrain, obstruct (or
occasionally enable) changes at the local level will become clear soon
enough, and will point the way toward the coalitions and reforms needed
at other scales. [[What is important]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Williams
observed, [[is that]{.mark}: "while certain principles can be
established, all actual policies have to depend on new]{.underline} and
difficult audits of [resources, which must]{.underline} by definition
[be specific]{.underline}. We can look first at the principles, but
their full practical bearings cannot be set down except in this place
and that, by \[END PAGE 109\] this enquiry and that, in a sustained and
necessarily negotiated process" (1983: 256). [This conclusion directs
our attention to what are]{.underline}, in my view, [the critical tasks
of the organic intellectuals of counter-hegemonic politics. [There
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course, [[the need to **root political
discourse** in shared values and a common agenda of democratic
reforms]{.mark}. [Research must construct]{.mark} a solid account of the
political, economic, cultural and ecological relationships operative
[within a **given frame of action**]{.mark}, including the ways in which
these relationships cross multiple scales]{.underline} (from the local
to the global). [This foundation is essential to identifying the agency
of change and the resources needed to strengthen civil society, and to
develop a program and strategy for change. All of the social
movements]{.underline}, including the unions, [have]{.underline}
important, [**necessary** roles to play in]{.underline} such
[planning]{.underline} and negotiation.

Williams argued further that [[criticism of capitalism or enumeration of
the many horrors of the times]{.underline}]{.mark} (salient then, the
fear of nuclear war) [[would, **alone, do little to mobilize
people**]{.mark} to undertake collective action for a better
world]{.underline}. When he wrote these words, climate change and peak
oil were hardly on our radar, nor the risks of genetically modified
organisms, nor imminent mass extinctions of other species due to human
demands on the planet\'s carrying capacity. Chernobyl hadn\'t happened
yet. [Today]{.underline}, more than ever, [[counter-hegemonic politics
must be about "making hope practical, rather than despair
convincing]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Williams, 1983: 240). [[Political
ecology offers]{.underline}]{.mark} many of [[the tools we need to build
a world in which humans and all of nature are no longer
treated]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Williams put it, [[as "raw material for
production]{.mark},"]{.underline} but in which there is a "new
orientation of livelihood: of practical, self-managing, self-renewing
societies, in which people care first for each other, in a living world"
(1983: 262, 266).

David E. **McClean 1**, Society for the Advancement of American
Philosophy, "The Cultural Left and the Limits of Social Hope,"
<http://www.american->
philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2001/Discussion%20papers/david_mcclean.htm

Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in Richard Rorty\'s
Achieving Our Country, a book that I think is long overdue, **[leftist
critics continue to cite and refer to]{.underline}** the eccentric and
often a priori ruminations of people like those just mentioned, and a
litany of others including Derrida**[, Deleuze,]{.underline}** Lyotard,
Jameson, and Lacan, **[who are to me hugely more irrelevant than
Habermas in their narrative attempts to suggest policy
prescriptions]{.underline}** (when they actually do suggest them)
**[aimed at curing the ills of]{.underline}** homelessness, poverty,
market greed, **[national belligerence and racism]{.underline}**. I
would like to suggest that it is time for American social critics who
are enamored with this group, those who actually want to be relevant, to
recognize that they have a disease, and a disease regarding which I
myself must remember to stay faithful to my own twelve step program of
recovery. The disease is the need for elaborate theoretical \"remedies\"
wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic jargon. These elaborate
theoretical remedies are more \"interesting,\" to be sure, than the
pragmatically settled questions about what shape democracy should take
in various contexts, or whether private property should be protected by
the state, or regarding our basic human nature (described, if not
defined (heaven forbid!), in such statements as \"We don\'t like to
starve\" and \"We like to speak our minds without fear of death\" and
\"We like to keep our children safe from poverty\"). As Rorty puts it,
\"[**When one of today\'s academic leftists says that some topic has
been \'inadequately theorized,\' you can be pretty certain that he or
she is going to drag in either philosophy of language**, or **Lacanian
psychoanalysis**, or some **neo-Marxist version of economic
determinism**. . . . T**hese futile attempts to philosophize one\'s way
into political relevance are a symptom of what happens when a Left
retreats from activism and adopts a spectatorial approach to the
problems of its country.**]{.underline} Disengagement from practice
produces theoretical hallucinations\"(italics
mine).[(1)](file:///C:\WINDOWS\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\Content.IE5\OTKXU3YH\the%20city.htm#N_1_)
Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy,
\"I believe that **[philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a
historical cud]{.underline}** long since reduced to woody fiber, or an
apologetics for lost causes, . . . . **[or a scholastic, schematic
formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America\'s own
needs and its own implicit principle of successful
action]{.underline}**.\"

Those who suffer or have suffered from this disease Rorty refers to as
the Cultural Left, which left is juxtaposed to the Political Left that
Rorty prefers and prefers for good reason. Another attribute of the
Cultural Left is that its members fancy themselves pure culture critics
who view the successes of America and the West, rather than some of the
barbarous methods for achieving those successes, as mostly evil, and who
view anything like national pride as equally evil even when that pride
is tempered with the knowledge and admission of the nation\'s
shortcomings. In other words, **[the Cultural Left]{.underline}**, in
this country, **[too often dismiss American society as beyond reform and
redemption]{.underline}**. And Rorty correctly argues that this is a
disastrous conclusion, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think
**[it may also be disastrous for our social hopes]{.underline}**, as I
will explain.

**[Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents
to better use if they bury some of their cynicism about America\'s
social and political prospects and help forge public and political
possibilities]{.underline}** in a spirit of determination to, indeed,
achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of
John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard
Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater.
To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society,
the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the
\"beloved community,\" one woven with the thread of agape into a
conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less
than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex
unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same
social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are
not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same
answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism. **[We who fancy
ourselves philosophers would do well to create from within
ourselves]{.underline}** and from within our ranks **[a new kind of
public intellectual who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is
yet capable of seeing the need to move past high theory to other
important questions that are less bedazzling and \"interesting\" but
more important to the prospect of our flourishing]{.underline}** -
questions such as \"How is it possible to develop a citizenry that
cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the
Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?\" or \"How
can we square the political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a
missile defense system with the need to treat America as but one member
in a community of nations under a \"law of peoples?\"

[The new public philosopher might seek to understand labor law and
military and trade theory and doctrine as much as theories of surplus
value; the logic of international markets and trade agreements as much
as critiques of commodification, and the politics of complexity as much
as the politics of power (all of which can still be done from our arm
chairs.)]{.underline} **[This means going down deep into the guts of our
quotidian social institutions, into the grimy pragmatic details where
intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where]{.underline}** the officers
and **[bureaucrats]{.underline}** of those institutions [**take
difficult and often unpleasant, imperfect decisions that affect other
peoples\'** lives, and it means making honest attempts to truly
understand how those institutions **actually function** in the **actual
world** **before** howling for their overthrow commences. This **might
help keep us from being slapped down**]{.underline} in debates
**[by]{.underline}** true **[policy pros who actually know what they are
talking]{.underline}** about but who lack awareness of the dogmatic
assumptions from which they proceed, and [who have **not yet found a
good reason to listen to jargon-riddled lectures from philosophers** and
culture critics with their snobish disrespect for the so-called
\"managerial class.\"]{.underline}

#### Deleuzian philosophy [cedes the political]{.underline} -- the [abstract]{.underline} and [immaterial]{.underline} nature of the alternative is a [utopian distraction]{.underline}

**Hallward 6** -- Professor of Modern European Philosophy at Kingston
University, London (Peter, Out of This World: Deleuze and the Philosophy
of Creation, p161-162)

Now Deleuze understands perfectly well why 'most of the objections
raised against the great philosophers are empty'. Indignant readers say
to them: 'things are not like that \[...\]. But, in fact, it is not a
matter of knowing whether things are like that or not; it is a matter of
knowing whether the question which presents things in such a light is
good or not, rigorous or not' (ES, 106). Rather than test its accuracy
according to the criteria of representation, 'the genius of a philosophy
must first be measured by the new distribution which it imposes on
beings and concepts' (LS, 6). In reality then, Deleuze concludes, 'only
one kind of objection is worthwhile: the objection which shows that the
question raised by a philosopher is not a good question', that it 'does
not force the nature of things enough' (ES, 107; cC WP, 82).
[Deleuze]{.underline} certainly [forces the nature of things into
conformity with his]{.underline} own [question]{.underline}. Just as
certainly however, [his question **inhibits**]{.underline} any
[**consequential engagement** with the **constraints** of
our]{.underline} actual [world]{.underline}. For readers who remain
concerned with these con­straints and their consequences, Deleuze's
question is not the best available question. Rather than try to refute
Deleuze, this book has tried to show how his system works and to draw
attention to what should now be the obvious (and perfectly explicit)
limita­tions of this philosophy of unlimited affirmation. First of all,
since it acknowledges only a unilateral relation between virtual and
actual, [there is no place in Deleuze's philosophy for any]{.underline}
notion of [change]{.underline}, time or history that is [mediated by
actuality.]{.underline} In the end, Deleuze offers few resources for
thinking the consequences of what happens within the actually existing
world as such. Unlike Darwin or Marx, for instance, the adamantly
virtual orientation of [Deleuze's 'constructivism' does not allow him to
account for]{.underline} cumulative [transformation]{.underline} or
novelty in terms [of actual materials and tendencies]{.underline}. No
doubt few contemporary philosophers have had as an acute a sense of the
internal dynamic of capitalism --- but equally, few have proposed so
elusive a response as the virtual 'war machine' that roams through the
pages of Capitalism and Schizophrenia. Like the nomads who invented it,
this abstract machine operates at an 'absolute speed, by being
"synonymous with speed"', as the incarnation of 'a pure and immeasurable
multiplicity; an irruption of the ephemeral and of the power of
metamorphosis' (TP, 336, 352). Like any creating, a war machine consists
and 'exists only in its own metamorphoses' (T\~ 360). [By posing the
question of politics in]{.underline} the starkly [dualistic terms of war
machine or state]{.underline} --- by posing it, in the end, in the
apocalyptic terms of a new people and a new earth or else no people and
no earth --- the political aspect of [Deleuze]{.underline}'s philosophy
[amounts to little more than **utopian distraction**]{.underline}.
Although no small number of enthusiasts continue to devote much energy
and inge­nuity to the task, the truth is that [Deleuze's work
is]{.underline} essentially **[indifferent to the politics of this
world]{.underline}**. [A philosophy based on
deterritorialisation]{.underline}, dissipation [and flight can offer
only the most **immaterial**]{.underline} and evanescent [**grip** on
the]{.underline} [mechanisms of exploitation and domination
that]{.underline} continue to [condition]{.underline} so much of what
happens in [our world]{.underline}. Deleuze's philosophical war remains
'absolute' and 'abstract', precisely, rather than directed or 'waged'
\[menee\]. Once 'a social field is defined less by its conflicts and
con­tradictions than by the lines of flight running through it', any
distinctive space for political action can only be subsumed within the
more general dynamics of creation or life. And since these dynamics are
themselves anti-dialectical if not anti-relational, there can be little
room in Deleuze's philosophy for relations of conflict or solidarity,
i.e. relations that are genuinely between rather than external to
individuals, classes, or principles.

#### Micropolitics [fail]{.underline}\-\--if they're right that power is a [structural]{.underline} constraint they can't articulate new modes of existence

**Bayet 13**, PhD, Catherine and Bruce Bastian Professor of Global and
Transnational Studies at the Department of Sociology, University of
Illinois, (Assef, Life as Politics: How Ordinary People Change the
Middle East, Second Edition, Stanford University Press, pg. 41-46)

[The dearth of conventional collective action]{.underline}---in
particular, contentious protests among the subaltern groups (the poor,
peasants, and women) in the developing countries, together with a
disillusionment with dominant socialist parties, [pushed many radical
observers to \"discover\" and highlight different types of
activism,]{.underline} however small-scale, local, or even
individualistic. [Such a quest, meanwhile, both contributed to and
benefited from the upsurge of theoretical perspectives]{.underline},
during the 1980s, [associated with]{.underline} poststructuralism that
made **[micropolitics]{.underline}** [and **\"everyday resistance\"** a
popular idea]{.underline}. James Scott\'s departure, during the 1980s,
from a structuralist position in studying the behavior of the peasantry
in Asia to a more ethnographic method of focusing on individual
reactions of peasants contributed considerably to this paradigm shift.27
In the meantime, Foucault\'s \"decentered\" notion of power, together
with a revival of neo-Gramscian politics of culture (hegemony), [served
as a key theoretical backing for micropolitics, and thus the
**\"resistance\" perspective**. The notion of \"resistance\" came to
stress that power and counterpower were not in binary opposition, but in
a **decoupled**, complex, **ambivalent**, and perpetual \"dance of
control]{.underline}.\"28 It based itself on the Foucauldian idea that
\"wherever there is power there is resistance,\" although the latter
consisted largely of small-scale, everyday, tiny activities that the
agents could afford to articulate given their political constraints.
Such a perception of resistance penetrated not only peasant studies, but
a variety of fields, including labor studies, identity politics,
ethnicity, women\'s studies, education, and studies of the urban
subaltern. Thus, multiple researchers discussed how relating stories
about miracles \"gives voice to popular resistance\";29 how
disenfranchised women resisted patriarchy by relating folktales and
songs or by pretending to be possessed or crazy;-\"-1 how reviving
extended family among the urban popular classes represented an \"avenue
of political participation.\"31 The relationships between the Filipino
bar girls and Western men were discussed not simply in terms of total
domination, but in a complex and contingent fashion;32 and the veiling
of the Muslim working woman has been represented not in simple terms of
submission, but in ambivalent terms of protest and co-optation---hence,
an \"accommodating protest.\"33 Indeed, on occasions, both veiling and
unveiling were simultaneously considered as a symbol of resistance.
Undoubtedly, such an attempt to grant agency to the subjects that until
then were depicted as \"passive poor,\" \"submissive women,\"
\"apolitical peasant,\" and \"oppressed worker\" was a positive
development. The resistance paradigm helps to uncover the complexity of
power relations in society in general, and the politics of the subaltern
in particular. It tells us that we may not expect a universalized form
of struggle; that totalizing pictures often distort variations in
people\'s perceptions about change; that local should be recognized as a
significant site of struggle as well as a unit of analysis; that
organized collective action may not be possible everywhere, and thus
alternative forms of struggles must be discovered and acknowledged; that
organized protest as such may not necessarily be privileged in the
situations where suppression rules. The value of a more flexible,
small-scale, and unbureaucratic activism should, therefore, be
acknowledged.31 These are some of the issues that critiques of
poststruc-turalist advocates of \"resistance\" ignore.3\' Yet [a number
of conceptual and political problems also emerge from this
paradigm]{.underline}. [The immediate trouble is how to conceptualize
resistance,]{.underline} and its relation to power, domination, and
submission. James Scott seems to be clear about what he means by the
term: Class resistance includes a«/act(s) by member(s) of a subordinate
class that is or are intended either to mitigate or deny claims (tor
example, rents, taxes, prestige) made on that class by superordinatc
classes (for example, landlords, large farmers, the state) or to advance
its own claims (for example, work, land, charity, respect) vis-a-vis
these superordinate classes.36 (emphasis added) However, [the phrase
\"any act\" blocks **delineating between qualitatively diverse forms of
activities** that]{.underline} Scott lists. [Are we not to distinguish
between large-scale collective action and individual acts, say, of tax
dodging?]{.underline} [Do reciting poetry in private]{.underline},
[**however subversive-sounding**, and engaging in armed struggle have
identical value?]{.underline} [Should we not expect unequal affectivity
and implications from such different acts?]{.underline} [Scott was aware
of this, and so agreed with those who had made distinctions between
different types of resistance]{.underline}---for example, \"real
resistance\" refers to \"organized, systematic, preplanned or selfless
practices with revolutionary consequences,\" and \"token resistance\"
points to unorganized incidental acts without any revolutionary
consequences, and which are accommodated in the power structure.37 Yet
he insisted that the \"token resistance\" is no less real than the
\"real resistance.\" Scott\'s followers, however, continued to make
further distinctions. Nathan Brown, in studying peasant politics in
Egypt, for instance, identities three forms of politics: atomistic
(politics of individuals and small groups with obscure content),
communal (a group effort to disrupt the system, by slowing down
production and the like), and revolt (just short of revolution to negate
the system).38 Beyond this, [many resistance writers tend to **confuse
an awareness about oppression with acts of resistance against
i**t]{.underline}. The fact that poor women sing songs about their
plight or ridicule men in their private gatherings indicates their
understanding of gender dynamics. [This does not mean, however, that
they are involved in acts of resistance]{.underline}; neither are the
miracle stories of the poor urbanites who imagine the saints to come and
punish the strong. [Such an understanding of \"resistance\" fails to
capture the extremely complex **interplay of conflict and consent,** and
ideas and action, operating within systems of power.]{.underline}
Indeed, [the link between consciousness and action remains a major
sociological dilemma.\"]{.underline} Scott makes it clear that
resistance is an intentional act. In Weberian tradition, he takes the
meaning of action as a crucial clement. [This intentional-ity, while
significant in itself, obviously leaves out many types of individual and
collective practices whose intended and unintended consequences do not
correspond.]{.underline} In Cairo or Tehran, for example, many poor
families illegally tap into electricity and running water from the
municipality despite their awareness of their behavior\'s illegality.
Yet they do not steal urban services in order to express their defiance
vis-a-vis the authorities. Rather, they do it because they feel the
necessity of those services for a decent life, because they find no
other way to acquire them. But these very mundane acts when continued
lead to significant changes in the urban structure, in social policy,
and in the actors\' own lives. Hence, the significance of the unintended
consequences of agents\' daily activities. In fact, [many authors in the
resistance paradigm have simply **abandoned intent and meaning**,
focusing instead eclectically on both intended and unintended practices
as manifestations of \"resistance]{.underline}.\" There is still a
further question. [Docs resistance mean defending an already achieved
gain]{.underline} (in Scott\'s terms, denying claims made by dominant
groups over the subordinate ones) **[or making fresh
demands]{.underline}** (to \"advance its own claims\"), what 1 like to
call \"encroachment\"? In much of the resistance literature, this
distinction is missing. [Although one might imagine moments of overlap,
the two strategies, however, lead to **different political
consequences**;]{.underline} [this is so in particular when we view them
in relation to the strategies of dominant power.]{.underline} The issue
was so crucial that Lenin devoted his entire What Is to Be Done? to
discussing the implications of these two strategics, albeit in different
terms of \"economism/trade unionism\" vs. \"social democratic/party
politics.\" Whatever one may think about a Leninist/vanguardist
paradigm, it was one that corresponded to a particular theory of the
state and power (a capitalist state to be seized by a mass movement led
by the working-class party); in addition, it was clear where this
strategy wanted to take the working class (to establish a socialist
state). Now, what is the perception of the state in the \"resistance\"
paradigm? What is the strategic aim in this perspective? Where does the
resistance paradigm want Lo lake its agents/subjects, beyond
\"preventing\] the worst and promising\] something better\"?40 [Much of
the literature of resistance is based upon a notion of
power]{.underline} that Foucault has articulated, [that power is
everywhere, that it \"circulates\" and is never \"localized here and
there]{.underline}, never in anybody\'s hands.\"\'11 [Such a formulation
is surely instructive in transcending the myth of the powerlessness of
the ordinary and in recognizing their agency. Yet this \"decentered\"
notion of power, shared by many poststructuralist \"resistance\"
writers]{.underline}, **[underestimates state power]{.underline}**,
[notably its class dimension, since it fails to see that although power
circulates, **it does so unevenly**]{.underline}---[in some places it is
far weightier, more **concentrated, and \"thicker**]{.underline},\" [so
to speak, than in others]{.underline}. In other words, as a system of
power. [It is, therefore, not accidental that a theory of the state and,
therefore, an analysis of the possibility of co-optation]{.underline},
are absent in almost all accounts of \"resistance.\" [Consequently, the
**cherished acts of resistance float around aimlessly in an unknown**,
**uncertain**, and ambivalent universe of power relations, with the end
result an **unsettled, tense accommodation with the existing power
arrangement.** Lack of a clear concept of resistance, moreover, often
leads writers in this genre to overestimate and read too much into the
acts of the agents]{.underline}. The result is that almost any act of
the subjects potentially becomes one of \"resistance.\" Determined to
discover the \"inevitable\" acts of resistance, many poststructuralist
writers often come to \"replace their subject.\"42 While they attempt to
challenge the essentialism of such perspectives as \"passive poor\"
\"submissive Muslim women,\" and \"inactive masses,\" they tend,
however, to fall into the trap of essentialism in reverse---[by reading
too much into ordinary behaviors, interpreting them as necessarily
conscious or contentious acts of defiance. This is so because they
overlook the crucial fact that these practices occur mostly **within the
prevailing systems of power**]{.underline}.

#### Ethical projects of self-creation must be tethered from the outset to advocacy for institutional change\-\--the alt lapses into new-age individualistic therapy, which demolishes collective political action

**Myers '13** \[Ella; 2013; Assistant Professor of Political Science and
Gender Studies at the University of Utah; *Wordly Ethics: Democratic
Politics and Care for the World*, p. 44-45\]

Unfortunately, [Connolly]{.underline} is inconsistent in this regard,
for he also [positions]{.underline} Foucauldian [[self- artistry
as]{.mark} an "essential preliminary to," and even [the]{.mark}
necessary ["condition of," change at the macropolitical
level]{.mark}]{.underline}.104 That is, [although Connolly claims that
micropolitics and political movements work "in tandem]{.underline},"
each producing effects on the other,105 [he]{.underline} sometimes
[privileges "action by the self on itself]{.underline}" [**[as a
starting point]{.mark}** and]{.underline} **[necessary
prelude]{.underline}** [to macropolitical change. This approach [not
only]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[avoids]{.mark} the [question of]{.mark}
the [genesis]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of such reflexive action]{.mark}
and its possible harmful effects [but also indicates
that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[collective efforts]{.mark} to alter social
conditions]{.underline} **[actually [await]{.mark} proper [techniques of
the self]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, in a rich discussion of
criminal punishment in the United States, [Connolly contends that "today
the micropolitics of desire in the domain of criminal violence has
become a condition for a macropolitics that reconfigures existing
relations between class, race, crime and punishment]{.underline}."106
Here and elsewhere in Connolly's writing [the **sequencing** renders

[[How]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all, [[is such

[[that]{.mark} [attunement is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[fostered,]{.mark}

[Connolly]{.underline} sometimes [acknowledges that the arts of the self
he celebrates are]{.underline} **[not themselves the starting point of
collaborative action]{.underline}** [but instead exist in a dynamic,
reciprocal relation with cooperative and antagonistic efforts to shape
collective arrangements. Yet]{.underline} **[the self's relation with
itself is also treated as a privileged site]{.underline}**, the very
source of democratic spirit and action. [This [tendency
to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[prioritize the self's]{.mark} reflexive
[relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over other modes of relation
[defines]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[therapeutic
ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} that ultimately emerges out of Foucault's
and, to a lesser degree, Connolly's work. [[This]{.mark} ethics [not
only]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[elides differences between caring for

"**[ontologically prior]{.underline}**." [[An ethics centered on the

#### Ascribing violence to metaphysical concepts like the subject is essentialist and wrong\-\--ontology does not determine politics

**Schwartz 8** \[Joseph M., professor of political science at Temple,
*The Future of Democratic Equality*, p 59-60, google books\]

[[To contend that only an anti-foundationalist]{.underline}]{.mark},
anti-realist [[epistemology can sustain democracy]{.mark} is to
argue]{.underline} precisely [for a]{.underline} **[foundational
metaphysical grounding]{.underline}** [for the democratic project. **It
[is to contend]{.mark} that one's [epistemology determines]{.mark} one's
[politics]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Hence, Brown and Butler both spoke at
a spring 1998 academic conference at the University of California at
Santa Cruz where some attributed "reactionary" and "left cultural
conservatism" to belief in "reactionary" "foundationalist humanism"42
Post-structuralism cannot escape its own essentialist conception of
identity. For example, Butler contends in Feminist Contentions that
democratic feminists must embrace the post-structuralist
"non-definability of woman" as best suited to open democratic
constitution of what it is to be a "woman."43 But this is itself a
"closed" position and runs counter to the practices of many democratic
feminist activists who have tried to develop a pluralist, yet collective
identity around the shared experiences of being a woman in a patriarchal
society (of course, realizing that working-class women and women of
color experience patriarchy in some ways that are distinct from the
patriarchy experienced by middle-class white women).¶ One query that
post-structuralist theorists might ask themselves: [[has]{.mark} there
[ever]{.mark} existed [a]{.mark} mass social [movement]{.mark} that
[defined its primary]{.mark} "ethical" [values as]{.mark} being those of
"**[instability and flux]{.mark}**"?]{.underline} Certainly many sexual
politics activists are cognizant of the fluid nature of sexuality and
sexual and gender identity. But [[only a small]{.underline}]{.mark}
(disproportionately university educated) [[segment of the
women's]{.mark} and [gay and lesbian movement]{.mark} would [subscribe
to]{.mark}]{.underline} (or even be aware of) [the core principles of
[post-structuralist]{.mark} "anti-essentialist [epistemology." **Nor
would they be agnostic as to whether the state should protect**]{.mark}
**their [rights]{.mark} to express their sexuality.**]{.underline}
Post-structuralist theorists cannot avoid justificatory arguments for
why some identities should be considered open and democratic and others
exclusionary and anti-democratic. That is, how could post-structuralist
political theorists argue that Nazi or Klan "ethics" are antithetical to
a democratic society---and that a democratic society can rightfully ban
certain forms of "agonal" (e.g. harassing forms of behavior against
minorities) struggle on the part of such anti-democratic groups.¶ [A
politics of [radical]{.mark} democratic [pluralism **cannot
be**]{.mark}]{.underline} securely [**[grounded]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} ]{.mark}[a **whole-hearted epistemological [critique of
"enlightenment rationality."]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[For
implicit]{.mark} to any radical]{.underline} democratic [project
[is]{.mark} a [belief in the **equal moral worth of
persons**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [to embrace such a position renders
one]{.underline} at least [a]{.underline} "critical [defender" of
enlightenment values of equality and justice]{.underline}, even if one
rejects "enlightenment metaphysics" and believes that such values are
often embraced by non-Western cultures. Of course, [[democratic norms
are developed by political practice]{.mark} and struggle **[rather
than]{.mark} by [abstract]{.mark} philosophical
[argument]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But this is a sociological and
historical reality rather than a trumping philosophical proof. Liberal
democratic [[publics **rarely ground** ]{.mark}**their [politics in
coherent ontologies and epistemologies]{.mark}**;
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} even among trained philosophers [[there is
**no necessary connection between** ]{.mark}**one's [metaphysics
and]{.mark} one's [politics]{.mark}**[. There]{.mark}]{.underline} have,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}, and will be [Kantian
conservatives]{.underline} (Nozick), [liberals]{.underline} (Rawls),
[and radicals]{.underline} (Joshua Cohen; Sosuan Okin); [[teleologists,
**left, center, and right**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Michael Sandel,
Alasdair McIntyre, or Leo Strauss); [anti-universalist
feminists]{.underline} (Judith Butler, Wendy Brown) [and
quasi-universalist, Habermasian feminists]{.underline} (Seyla Benhabib,
Nancy Fraser).¶ [[Post-structuralists try to **read off
from**]{.underline}]{.mark} an epistemology or [**[ontology a

[[with postmodern]{.underline}]{.mark} (allegedly anti-)
[[meta-narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such [efforts represent an
idealist]{.underline} version of the materialist
[effort]{.underline}---which post-structuralists explicitly
condemn---[to read social consciousness off the structural position of
"the agent."]{.underline} A democratic political theory must offer both
a theory of social structure and of the social agents capable of
building such a society. In exchanging the gods of Weber and Marx for
Nietzsche and Heidegger (or their epigones Foucault and Derrida),
[[post-structuralist theory has **abandoned**]{.mark} **the
[institutional analysis of social theory]{.mark}** [for the **idealism
of abstract philosophy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Their theory is over-reductionist and can't ever materialize

**Oduor 21** (John Baptiste Oduor, Editor at Jacobin Magazine, 12-21-21,
Jacobin Magazine, \"How Leftist Theory Stopped Making Sense\",)

[Playfulness and a general lack of seriousness became another hallmark
of theory. French philosophers Deleuze and Félix Guattari,]{.underline}
perhaps the most infamous innovators of the genre, [insisted that their
anti-psychoanalytic tract Anti-Oedipus was not a work of philosophy, in
any traditional sense]{.underline}. By this they meant [it did not seek
to produce a unified worldview or to answer age-old questions about the
reality of freedom or the legitimate authority of the
state]{.underline}. [The task of philosophy was instead]{.underline},
the duo claimed in What is Philosophy?, [the creation of
problems]{.underline}. [Lost in this reformulation was any vision of
philosophy as an attempt to make sense of the human life, understood as
limited by specific anthropological or historical
constraints]{.underline}. Philosophy-as-theory was, Guattari claimed,
ideally addressed "to people who are now between 7 and 15 years old."
Clearly disingenuous, Guattari's comment did, however, say something
about the co-authors' commitment to a child-like playfulness, taking as
much from geology and mathematics as they did from philosophy. Unlike
the socialist political economy and philosophy of the early 20th
century, [postwar theory was propelled not by any kind of practical
engagement but by a constant demand for innovation and
newness]{.underline}, needed to keep up with a postwar political
landscape that was thoroughly fragmented. [The social transformations
that theory attempted to make sense of---disillusionment with communism,
anti-colonial movements, women's liberation, the existence of an
underclass, the continued existence of capitalism---undermined so many
assumptions about the world]{.underline} held across the political
spectrum that it was hard to see how any overarching ideas could
synthesize them, or whether theorists' inability to do so should be
considered a failure. Consequently, the portrait that Philipp Felsch
painted in The Summer of Theory: History of a Rebellion, 1960-1990, is
that of an open-ended journey rather than a decisive verdict on the
value and usefulness of theory. Felsch's account largely focuses on the
radical publishing house Merve, which made its name as a popularizer of
theory in the German-speaking world. Founded in 1970, Merve was created
by a generation for which the recent memory of the second world war was
still strong. [The divide between parents and their children, many of
whom perceived their elders to be bystanders to fascism, motivated many
postwar Germans to take up the political task of creating a liberal
public sphere in the present]{.underline}. A key feature of this public
sphere was an emphasis on discussion as conducive of civility and as an
antidote to authoritarianism. Throughout this period, the country's
leading intellectuals engaged in fierce public debates around the
relationship between fascism and German culture. [Theory]{.underline},
in Felsch's account, [emerges out of an attempt to take seriously that
which "the bourgeois relegate to non-working hours as
'culture]{.underline},'" as the German philosopher Theodor Adorno writes
in Minima Moralia. Art, literature, and music would, in the publishers'
catalogue, receive the same critical scrutiny previously reserved for
politics, following the example set by Adorno. Adorno's book, subtitled
Reflections on a Damaged Life, was a lodestar for a generation of young
Germans such as Merve co-founder Peter Gente, for whom the desire for
discussion had not yet broken down the traditional hierarchical
boundaries between intellectuals and their readership. These new readers
were still willing to look for validation in traditions incapable of
keeping up with the pace of societal transformation. (Felsch neatly
illustrates this new incongruence between past and present by recounting
episodes of various members of the growing public sphere seeking out
Adorno's advice on everything from sexual alienation to depression.
Adorno's response to these letters speaks both to the gap between
himself and his readership, and the sincerity with which he sought to
understand this chasm. One correspondent remarked, after meeting Adorno
in person, that she realized she had not been "looking for hope, but for
solidarity in my hopelessness.") The desire for community, already
present in the cultishness that developed around the work of Adorno,
remains inextricable from the story of theory. This is the source of the
ambivalence Felsch wrestles with throughout his narrative. [Theory
responded to a desire, completely understandable in the context of
postwar Germany, of many leftists to be part of a community of the
like-minded.]{.underline} It was [a desire exacerbated by the Social
Democratic Party's abandonment of socialism in 1959 and consolidated by
the hopelessness of left-wing terrorism during 1977's "German
Autumn]{.underline}." But was it powerful enough to compel those
would-be community members to ignore any scruples they would otherwise
have about the intellectual or political value of the community created?
Did theory advance a genuine critique of society, or did it simply
create subcultures unified by an increasingly self-referential use of
language? The specter of theory as mere fashion already loomed over
Merve as a negative exemplar. Merve's editors were, up until their last
days, insistent on describing themselves not as "professionals" but as
"bookworms." Merve's self-appointed task was, in Felsch's words, to
"jump-start German Marxism out of its dogmatic standstill with boosts
from Italy and France." Not content with abstract theorizing, Merve
understood itself as pursuing revolutionary politics through letters.
The political project the publisher sought to animate was one that
afforded special privilege to theoretical discussion. Never willing to
abandon the bourgeois idea of a public sphere being conducive to the
healthy functioning of a society, the collective, motivated by their
radical politics, sought interlocutors among the migrant workers
propping up postwar German industrial capitalism. In the northern city
of Wolfsburg, Merve's editors descended on the 6,000 odd Italian guest
workers employed in the local Volkswagen factory with the aim of
discussing the latest Marxist theory in proletarian pubs. Their hope was
that they would find there soil as fertile for political tumult as that
which existed in the European coffee shops of the 17th century. Not only
did this project in revolutionary outreach fail miserably, proximity to
the migrant workers during this sojourn exposed differences in outlook
between Merve's members. Shockingly, while the collective lay on shared
mattresses placed on the floor, one of its members admitted a secret
dream of having a family, children, and a garden. Bourgeois society had
clearly not been transcended. Fractures within the private sphere
continued to affect the project of building a public sphere. In the
mid-70s, Gente became romantically involved with a young student, Heidi
Paris, with whom he collaborated as a fellow editor. His wife at the
time, Merve Lowien, who lent her name to the publishing house, would
document the often-unsurprising gender dynamics at the company in
Feminine Productive Power---Is There Another Economy? Experience in a
Left Project. Market imperatives forced Merve to look for fresh theory,
a search that proved incompatible with the strictures of Marxist
politics, traditionally conceived. Of course, temperamentally Merve's
editors were already prone to searching for new trends. Drug addicts,
social rejects, and those deemed insane became the foci of Merve's books
and radical theory in the 1970s. [Jean-François Lyotard, author of The
Postmodern Condition, could proclaim during this period that all
thinking about universal subjects, such as the working class, the human
being, or the citizen, was "obsolete]{.underline}." [A hostility to the
guidance sought by Adorno's readers had started to emerge, and a general
skepticism towards the discipline present in education took the place of
this early desire for instruction]{.underline}. Subsequently, [the
writer as sage was replaced by the reader as the
participant]{.underline}. The shift here was that the pace of production
of new text meant that the only thing that remained fixed was the
readership. The latter were active as consumers of cultural content
while writers had to struggle to keep up with the latest trends.
Unmoored from any fixed institutions or political worldview, theory was
free to turn to areas that its origin as a response to the trauma of the
second world war had previously prevented it from engaging with. By the
late '70s, Merve was publishing books rehabilitating the conservative
philosopher Ernst Jünger and the Nazi legal philosopher Carl Schmitt.
Schmitt's anti-liberal decisionism would have run afoul of Merve's early
discussion-centered conception of politics. In the heady days of theory,
however, the far-right thinker's conceptualization of politics in terms
of opposition between friends and enemies proved perfectly amenable to
the iconoclasm of the 1980s. In The Summer of Theory's closing sections,
Felsch paints a portrait of an intellectual world completely detached
from any real constituencies: American artists and musicians schmoozing
in Berlin bars and discotheques with radical theorists speculating about
the end of art. The social forces that made this dealignment possible
are not, in Felsch's account, brought to the fore. What we are presented
with instead is an image of theory as a series of waves appearing above
a body of water, beneath which the quotidian realities of politics and
everyday culture clash vigorously. The goal of eliminating the
distinction between culture and politics results, ironically, in theory
distancing itself from both. Consequently, Felsch's narrative arc leaves
the reader with a decidedly pessimistic view of the relationship of
theory to politics and culture. At its very best theory seems to be a
balm for the despair caused by politics; at its worst, an accommodation
with an increasingly disorientating world. Unsurprisingly, [it was
theory's separation from Marxism, a worldview that thought seriously
about the relationship between ideas and politics, that left it
ill-equipped to understand the causes of its own
transformations.]{.underline} The same [holds true of attempts made by
contemporary progressives to overturn sedimented prejudice and
inequality by introducing concepts from the classroom]{.underline}.
Marxism has always contended that [social structures and institutions
constrain the way we think, not the other way around]{.underline}. [We
would do well to take this insight seriously if we are to try to bridge
the gap between theory and practice.]{.underline}

### AT: Future Military Tech Impacts\-\--2AC

#### No impact to future military tech -- it's non-unique and inevitable -- but, [testing]{.underline} and [safeguards]{.underline} solve. 

**Ackerman, 15**---senior writer for IEEE Spectrum's award-winning
robotics blog, Automaton (Evan, "We Should Not Ban 'Killer Robots,' and
Here's Why,"
<https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots>,
dml)

The problem with this argument is that **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**
letter, [**UN [declaration]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} even a **formal
[ban]{.mark}** ratified by multiple nations [is **going to
prevent**]{.mark} **people** from being able to build
[a]{.mark}utonomous, [w]{.mark}eaponized robot[s]{.mark}. [The
barriers]{.mark} keeping people from developing this kind of system
[are]{.mark} **just [too low]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consider the "armed
quadcopters." Today you can buy a smartphone-controlled quadrotor for US
\$300 at Toys R Us. Just imagine what you'll be able to buy tomorrow.
[This [tech]{.mark}nology [**exists**. It's **improving**]{.mark} **all
the time**. [There's]{.mark} simply **[too much]{.mark} commercial
[value]{.mark}** in creating]{.underline} quadcopters (and other robots)
that have longer endurance, more autonomy, bigger payloads, and
[everything]{.underline} else [that you'd also want in a military
system]{.underline}. And at this point, it's entirely possible that
small commercial quadcopters are just as advanced as (and way cheaper
than) small military quadcopters, anyway. [[We're **not going to
stop**]{.mark} **that research**, though, because everybody wants
delivery drones (among other things)]{.underline}. Generally speaking,
technology itself is not inherently good or bad: it's what we choose to
do with it that's good or bad, and you can't just cover your eyes and
start screaming "STOP!!!" if you see something sinister on the horizon
when there's so much simultaneous potential for positive progress.

What [we really need]{.underline}, then, is [a way of making autonomous
armed robots **ethical**, because we're **not going to be able to
prevent them from existing**]{.underline}. In fact, [the most
significant assumption]{.underline} that this letter makes [is
[that]{.mark} armed autonomous [robots]{.mark} are **inherently more
likely to [cause]{.mark} unintended [destruction]{.mark}** and **death**
than armed autonomous humans are. This may or may not be the case right
now, and either way]{.underline}, I genuinely believe that [it **[won't
be the case]{.mark}** in the future, perhaps the **very near
future**]{.underline}. I think that [it will be possible for robots to
be **as good** (or **better**) at identifying hostile enemy combatants
as humans, since there are rules that can be followed]{.underline}
(called Rules of Engagement, for an example see page 27 of this) [to
determine whether or not using force is justified]{.underline}. For
example, does your target have a weapon? Is that weapon pointed at you?
Has the weapon been fired? Have you been hit? [These are all things that
a robot can determine using any number of sensors that currently
exist]{.underline}.

It's worth noting that Rules of Engagement generally allow for
engagement in the event of an imminent attack. In other words, if a
hostile target has a weapon and that weapon is pointed at you, you can
engage before the weapon is fired rather than after in the interests of
self-protection. [[Robots could]{.mark} be **even more
cautious**]{.underline} than this: [you could **program them to [not
engage a hostile target]{.mark} with deadly force** unless they confirm
with whatever level of certainty that you want that the target is
actively engaging them already]{.underline}. Since robots aren't alive
and don't have emotions and don't get tired or stressed or distracted,
[[it's possible]{.mark} for them [to]{.mark} **just [sit]{.mark}
there**, **[under fire]{.mark}**, until **all necessary criteria for
engagement** are met. [Humans **can't**]{.mark} **do
this**]{.underline}.

[The argument against this is that a robot autonomously making a
decision to engage a target with deadly force]{.underline}, no matter
how certain the robot may be, [is **dangerous** and
**unethical**]{.underline}. It is dangerous, and it may be unethical, as
well. [However, is it **any more dangerous** or **unethical than asking
a human to do the same thing**?]{.underline} The real question that we
should be asking is this: [Could autonomous armed [robots **perform
better** than]{.mark} armed [humans]{.mark} in combat, resulting in
**fewer casualties**]{.underline} (combatant or non-combatant) [on both
sides?]{.underline} I believe so, which doesn't really matter, but so do
people who are actually working on this stuff, which does.

In 2009, Ronald C. Arkin, Patrick Ulam, and Brittany Duncan published a
paper entitled "An Ethical Governor for Constraining Lethal Action in an
Autonomous System," which was about how to program an armed, autonomous
robot to act within the Laws of War and Rules of Engagement. h+ Magazine
interviewed Arkin on the subject (read the whole thing here), and here's
what he said:

h+: Some researchers assert that no robots or AI systems will be able to
discriminate between a combatant and an innocent, that this sensing
ability currently just does not exist. Do you think this is just a
short-term technology limitation? What such technological assumptions do
you make in the design of your ethical governor?

RA: I agree this discrimination technology does not effectively exist
today, nor is it intended that these systems should be fielded in
current conflicts. These are for the so-called war after next, and the
DoD would need to conduct extensive additional research in order to
develop the accompanying technology to support the proof-of-concept work
I have developed. But [[I **don't believe there is any**]{.mark}
**fundamental scientific [limitation]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} achieving the
goal of these machines being able to **[discriminate better]{.mark} than
humans can** in the fog of war]{.underline}, again in tightly specified
situations. This is the benchmark that I use, rather than perfection.
But if [that]{.underline} standard is achieved, it [can **succeed** in
reducing noncombatant casualties]{.underline} and thus is a goal worth
pursuing in my estimation.

One way to [think about this]{.underline} is [like autonomous cars.
Expecting an autonomous car to keep you safe 100 percent of the time is
**unrealistic**. But, if an autonomous car is]{.underline} (say) [**5
percent more likely** to keep you safe than if you were driving
yourself, you'd still be **much better off** letting it take over.
Autonomous cars]{.underline}, by the way, [will likely be **much safer**
than that, and]{.underline} it's entirely possible that [**autonomous
armed robots will be**, **too**]{.underline}. And if autonomous armed
robots really do have at least the potential reduce casualties, aren't
we then ethically obligated to develop them?

[If there are **any doubts** about how effective or ethical [these
systems]{.mark} might be, just **[test]{.mark} them
[exhaustively]{.mark}**. **Deploy them**, **load them up with blanks**,
[and **watch**]{.mark} **how they do**]{.underline}. Will they screw up
sometimes? Of course they will, both during testing and after. But
setting aside the point above about relative effectiveness, [[the **big
advantage**]{.mark} of robots is that their behavior [is **traceable**
and]{.mark} they **learn [programmatic]{.mark}ally**: if one robot does
something wrong, [it's possible to **trace the**]{.mark} **chain of
[decisions]{.mark}** that it made]{.underline} (decisions programmed
into it by a human, by the way) [to find out what happened. Once the
error is located, it can be **resolved**, and you can be **confident**
that [the robot **will not make that**]{.mark} **same [mistake]{.mark}
again**. Furthermore, [you can **update every**]{.mark} **other [robot
at the same time]{.mark}**. This is **not something we can do with
humans**]{.underline}.

I do agree that [there is a potential risk with autonomous weapons of
making it **easier to decide to use force**. But, that's been true
**ever since someone realized that they could throw a rock at someone
else** instead of **walking up** and **punching them**. There's been
**continual development** of technologies that allow us to engage our
enemies while minimizing our own risk]{.underline}, and what with the
ballistic and cruise missiles that we've had for the last half century,
we've got that pretty well figured out. [If you want to argue that
autonomous drones or armed ground robots will lower the bar even
farther, then okay, but [it's a]{.mark} **pretty [low bar]{.mark}** [as
is]{.mark}. And]{.underline} fundamentally, [you're then placing the
blame on **technology**, **not the people**]{.underline} deciding how to
use the technology.

And that's the point that I keep coming back to on this: [[blaming
tech]{.mark}nology for the decisions that we make involving it
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} at best
**[[counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and at worst nonsensical.
[**[Any tech]{.mark}nology** [can be used for evil]{.mark}, and many
technologies that were [developed to kill people]{.mark} are [now
responsible for]{.mark} **some of [our greatest
achievements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from harnessing nuclear power to
riding a ballistic missile into space. If you want to make the argument
that this is really about the decision to use the technology, not the
technology itself, then that's awesome. I'm totally with you. But
[banning the technology is **not going to solve the problem** if [the
problem is the **willingness of humans** to use]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [for evil]{.mark}]{.underline}: we'd need a much
bigger petition for that.

Cyberwar Is Coming!" declared the title of a seminal 1993 article by the
RAND Corporation analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, who argued
that the nascent Internet would fundamentally transform warfare. The
idea seemed fanciful at the time, and it took more than a decade for
members of the U.S. national security establishment to catch on. But
once they did, a chorus of voices resounded in the mass media,
proclaiming the dawn of the era of cyberwar and warning of its
terrifying potential. In February 2011, then CIA Director [Leon Panetta
warned]{.underline} Congress that "[the **next Pearl Harbor could very
well be a cyberattack**]{.underline}." And in late 2012, Mike
[McConnell]{.underline}, who had served as director of national
intelligence under President George W. Bush, [warned]{.underline} darkly
[that the United States could not "wait for the cyber equivalent of the
collapse of the World Trade Centers]{.underline}." [Yet the
**[hype]{.mark}**]{.underline} about everything "cyber" [has
[obscured]{.mark}]{.underline} three [**[basic truths:]{.underline}**
[cyberwar has **never happened**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the past, [it
is **not occurring**]{.underline} in the present, [and it is **highly
unlikely**]{.underline} [that it will disturb the future]{.underline}.
Indeed, rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, [[so
far]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark}-era [has been defined by]{.mark} **the
opposite trend: [a computer-enabled assault on]{.mark} political
[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[diminish]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than accentuate **[political
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by making it easier]{.mark} for
states, groups, and individuals [to **engage in**]{.mark} **two kinds of
[aggression that do not rise to]{.mark} the level of [war]{.mark}:
sabotage and espionage**]{.underline}. [Weaponized computer code and
computer-based sabotage operations make it possible to carry out highly
targeted attacks on an adversary's technical systems **without directly
and physically harming human operators and managers**]{.underline}.
Computer-assisted attacks make it possible to steal data without placing
operatives in dangerous environments, [[thus **reducing**]{.mark} **the
level of**]{.underline} personal and political
**[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These developments represent important
changes in the nature of political violence, but they also highlight
[limitations inherent in cyberweapons]{.underline} that **[greatly
curtail the utility of cyberattacks]{.underline}**. Those limitations
seem to make it difficult to use cyberweapons for anything other than
one-off, hard-to-repeat sabotage operations of questionable strategic
value that might even prove counterproductive. And cyber-espionage often
requires improving traditional spycraft techniques and relying even more
heavily on human intelligence. Taken together, these factors call into
question the very idea that computer-assisted attacks will usher in a
profoundly new era. THE THIN CASE FOR CYBERWAR One reason discussions
about cyberwar have become disconnected from reality is that many
commentators fail to grapple with a basic question: What counts as
warfare? Carl von Clausewitz, the nineteenth-century Prussian military
theorist, still offers the most concise answer to that question.
Clausewitz identified three main criteria that any aggressive or
defensive action must meet in order to qualify as an act of war. First,
and most simply, all acts of war are violent or potentially violent.
Second, an act of war is always instrumental: physical violence or the
threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker's
will. Finally, to qualify as an act of war, an attack must have some
kind of political goal or intention. For that reason, acts of war must
be attributable to one side at some point during a confrontation. No
known cyberattack has met all three of those criteria; indeed, very few
have met even one. Consider three incidents that today's Cassandras
frequently point to as evidence that warfare has entered a new era. The
first of these, a massive pipeline explosion in the Soviet Union in June
1982, would count as the most violent cyberattack to date \-- if it
actually happened. According to a 2004 book by Thomas Reed, who was
serving as a staffer on the U.S. National Security Council at the time
of the alleged incident, a covert U.S. operation used rigged software to
engineer a massive explosion in the Urengoy-Surgut-Chelyabinsk pipeline,
which connected Siberian natural gas fields to Europe. Reed claims that
the CIA managed to insert malicious code into the software that
controlled the pipeline's pumps and valves. The rigged valves supposedly
resulted in an explosion that, according to Reed, the U.S. Air Force
rated at three kilotons, equivalent to the force of a small nuclear
device. But aside from Reed's account, there is hardly any evidence to
prove that any such thing happened, and plenty of reasons to doubt that
it did. After Reed published his book, Vasily Pchelintsev, who was
reportedly the KGB head of the region when the explosion was supposed to
have taken place, denied the story. He surmised that Reed might have
been referring to a harmless explosion that happened not in June but on
a warm April day that year, caused by pipes shifting in the thawing
ground of the tundra. Moreover, no Soviet media reports from 1982
confirm that Reed's explosion took place, although the Soviet media
regularly reported on accidents and pipeline explosions at the time.
What's more, given the technologies available to the United States at
that time, it would have been very difficult to hide malicious software
of the kind Reed describes from its Soviet users. Another incident often
related by promoters of the concept of cyberwar occurred in Estonia in
2007. After Estonian authorities decided to move a Soviet-era memorial
to Russian soldiers who died in World War II from the center of Tallinn
to the city's outskirts, outraged Russian-speaking Estonians launched
violent riots that threatened to paralyze the city. The riots were
accompanied by cyber-assaults, which began as crude disruptions but
became more sophisticated after a few days, culminating in a "denial of
service" attack. Hackers hijacked up to 85,000 computers and used them
to overwhelm 58 Estonian websites, including that of the country's
largest bank, which the attacks rendered useless for a few hours.
Estonia's defense minister and the country's top diplomat pointed their
fingers at the Kremlin, but they were unable to muster any evidence. For
its part, the Russian government denied any involvement. In the wake of
the incident, Estonia's prime minister, Andrus Ansip, likened the attack
to an act of war. "What's the difference between a blockade of harbors
or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government
institutions and newspaper websites?" he asked. It was a rhetorical
question, but the answer is important: unlike a naval blockade, the
disruption of websites is not violent \-- indeed, not even potentially
violent. The choice of targets also seemed unconnected to the presumed
tactical objective of forcing the government to reverse its decision on
the memorial. And unlike a naval blockade, the attacks remained
anonymous, without political backing, and thus unattributable. A year
later, a third major event entered the cyber-Cassandras' repertoire. In
August 2008, the Georgian army attacked separatists in the province of
South Ossetia. Russia backed the separatists and responded militarily.
The prior month, in what might have been the first time that an
independent cyberattack was launched in coordination with a conventional
military operation, unknown attackers had begun a campaign of
cyber-sabotage, defacing prominent Georgian websites, including those of
the country's national bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
launching denial-of-service attacks against the websites of Georgia's
parliament, its largest commercial bank, and Georgian news outlets. The
Georgian government blamed the Kremlin, just as the Estonians had done.
But Russia again denied sponsoring the attacks, and a NATO investigation
later found "no conclusive proof" of who had carried them out. The
attack set off increasingly familiar alarm bells within American media
and the U.S. national security establishment. "The July attack may have
been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar," an article in The New
York Times declared. Richard Clarke, a former White House cybersecurity
czar, warned that the worst was yet to come: the Georgian attack did not
"begin to reveal what the Russian military and intelligence agencies
could do if they were truly on the attack in cyberspace." Yet the actual
effects of these nonviolent events were quite mild. The main damage they
caused was to the Georgian government's ability to communicate
internationally, thus preventing it from getting out its message at a
critical moment. But even if the attackers intended this effect, it
proved short-lived: within four days after military confrontations had
begun in earnest, the Georgian Foreign Ministry had set up an account on
Google's blog-hosting service. This move helped the government keep open
a channel to the public and the news media. What the Internet took away,
the Internet returned. ISTOCK.COM / -ANTONIO- Overblown: keyboard as
grenade. IN CODE WE TRUST? Perhaps the strongest evidence presented by
advocates of the concept of cyberwar is the Stuxnet operation launched
against Iran by the United States and Israel. Stuxnet, part of a set of
attacks known as Operation Olympic Games, was a sophisticated multiyear
campaign to sabotage Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz by
inserting a harmful computer worm into the software that ran the
facility's centrifuges, causing them to overload. American and Israeli
developers started designing the project as early as 2005, and it
launched in 2007, growing more sophisticated until its discovery in
2010. The attack was groundbreaking in several ways. The developers
built highly target-specific intelligence into the code, enabling the
Stuxnet software to make autonomous decisions in its target environment.
Most important, Stuxnet represented the first and only physically
destructive cyberattack launched by one state (or, in this case, two
states) against another. Yet even [cyberattacks that cause damage do so
only **indirectly**]{.underline}. As an agent of violence, [[computer
code]{.mark} faces a very basic limit: it **[does not have its own
force]{.mark} or energy**]{.underline}. Instead, [any cyberattack with
the goal of material destruction or harming human life must utilize the
force or energy **embedded in its target**]{.underline}: for example,
shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or planes
to crash or disrupting a power plant and sparking an explosion. Yet
besides Stuxnet, [there is no proof that **anyone has ever successfully
launched a major attack of this sort**]{.underline}. [[Lethal
cyberattacks]{.mark}, while certainly possible, [remain]{.mark} the
**stuff of [fiction]{.mark}**]{.underline}: none has ever killed or even
injured a single human being. [Thanks to its lack of direct physical
impact, code-induced violence also has **less emotional
impact**]{.underline}. [It would be difficult for a cyberattack to
produce]{.underline} the level of **[fear]{.underline}** [that
coordinated]{.underline} campaigns of [terrorism]{.underline} or
conventional military operations [produce]{.underline}. Owing to their
invisibility, [[cyberweapons also lack]{.mark} the **[symbolic
power]{.mark}** of traditional ones]{.underline}. Displays of weaponry,
such as the elaborate military parades put on by China and North Korea,
sometimes represent nothing more than nationalist pageantry. But
revealing one's arsenal can also serve tactical and strategic ends, as
when countries deploy aircraft carriers to demonstrate their readiness
to use force or carry out operations designed to intimidate the enemy,
such as using military aircraft to conduct deliberately low flyovers.
Indeed, displaying weapons systems and threatening to use them can prove
more cost-efficient than their actual use. But cyberweapons are hard to
brandish. Perhaps the most crucial limitation of violence in cyberspace
is its almost entirely destructive quality: unlike traditional political
violence, which can maintain trust in institutions and states as well as
undermine it, violence in cyberspace can do only the latter. Any
established political order comes with a certain degree of inherent
violence; consolidated states, after all, survive only if they maintain
monopolies on the legitimate use of force. By encouraging trust in the
ability of state institutions to protect property and safeguard
citizens, this inherent violence buttresses a state's power and allows
the state to establish the rule of law. But cyber-violence lacks this
ability, since it does little or nothing to build up trust in
institutions; indeed, it is very difficult to imagine how cyberattacks
could be used to enforce rules or laws, either domestically or
internationally. Digital surveillance presents a more complicated
picture. In democracies, intelligence agencies tread a thin line between
providing security and eroding public trust in the state, as
demonstrated by the recent controversy over the U.S. National Security
Agency's data-collection practices. In authoritarian countries, digital
surveillance can assist the state's coercive use of force, but it cannot
replace it. Such limitations, however, should not lead anyone to dismiss
the corrosive potential of cyberattacks. Indeed, such assaults can
undermine social trust in a more direct way than traditional political
violence. Cyberattacks are more precise; they do not necessarily
undermine the state's monopoly of force in a wholesale fashion. Instead,
they can be tailored to attack specific companies or public-sector
organizations and used to undermine those groups' authority selectively.
Stuxnet provides a good example of this dynamic. Putting aside the
question of whether the attack was an act of war, its primary intention
was to undermine the trust of the Iranian scientists in their systems
and in themselves and the trust of the Iranian regime in its ability to
build nuclear weapons. The original intention was to cause physical
damage to as many Iranian centrifuges as possible. But the American and
Israeli attackers knew that the physical effect could be exploited to
unleash a much more damaging psychological effect. "The intent was that
the failures should make them feel they were stupid, which is what
happened," an American participant told The New York Times. The
Americans and the Israelis hoped that once a few machines failed, the
Iranian engineers would shut down more machines because they distrusted
their own technology or indeed their own skills. At the headquarters of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, rumors circulated
that the Iranians had lost so much confidence in their own systems and
instruments that the management of the Natanz facility took the
extraordinary step of assigning engineers to sit in the plant and radio
back what they saw to confirm the instrument readings. "They
overreacted," one of the attackers revealed to David Sanger of The New
York Times, "and that delayed them even more." The Iranians also began
to assign blame internally, pointing fingers at one another and even
firing some personnel. DIGITAL UNDERGROUND Damaging though it may have
been, Stuxnet, along with the cyber-scuffles in Estonia and Georgia,
represents not a new form of warfare but something more akin to other,
less lethal forms of aggression: sabotage and espionage. Unlike acts of
war, these political crimes, which are often committed by nonstate
actors, need not be violent to work. And although saboteurs and spies do
act politically, they often seek to avoid attribution, unlike those who
launch acts of war. For those reasons, the cyber-era has been a boon for
political crime. Consider sabotage. Before the computer age, saboteurs
had trouble calibrating and controlling the effects of their actions.
Sabotage had to target physical property and relied on physical
violence, which often proves unpredictable. During postal and railway
strikes in France in 1909 and 1910, for instance, saboteurs cut signal
wires and tore down telegraph posts. Destroying property risked running
afoul of public opinion, and the tactic ultimately divided the workers.
The strikes themselves, as a form of sabotage, also ran the risk of
leading to unpredictable violence: indeed, labor demonstrations often
intensified into riots, making it easier for opponents to portray the
strikers as uncompromising radicals. It is much easier for saboteurs to
avoid counterproductive side effects in the age of computer-assisted
attacks, which can contain violence and generally avoid it altogether.
Cyberattacks can maliciously affect software and business processes
without interfering with physical industrial processes, remaining
nonviolent but sometimes still causing greater damage than a traditional
assault. A 2012 attack against the computer network of the oil company
Saudi Aramco illustrates this potential. The attack physically harmed
neither hardware nor humans. Yet by allegedly erasing the hard disks of
some 30,000 computers, the attackers likely did much more monetary
damage to Saudi Aramco than they could have through an act of
traditional sabotage against machinery in one of the company's plants.
The oil giant reportedly had to hire six specialized computer security
firms to help with its forensic investigation and post-attack cleanup.
Despite such potential, it is also important to remember the inherent
limitations of computer-assisted political crime and to note that human
agents remain critical in the age of digital violence. Even Stuxnet, the
most successful example of cyber-sabotage, demonstrates this fact. For
the United States and Israel, the "holy grail," in the words of one of
the attack's architects, was getting a piece of malicious software into
the control system at Natanz. The Americans and Israelis needed
fine-grained data from inside the Iranian plant to develop their
weaponized code. The problem was that the control system was protected
by an air gap: it was not connected to the Internet or even internal
networks. As a result, the attackers had to deliver the malicious code
via a removable hard drive such as a USB flash drive \-- delivered by a
human hand. To make this happen, U.S. intelligence operatives first
obtained a list of the people who were visiting the targeted plant to
work on its computer equipment and who could carry the payload there.
"We had to find an unwitting person on the Iranian side of the house who
could jump the gap," one planner later told Sanger. The list of possible
carriers included engineers from the German company Siemens, who were
helping their Iranian colleagues maintain the control system \-- work
that required the Siemens engineers to bring portable computers into the
plant. Precisely how the U.S.-Israeli team managed to exploit this
vulnerability remains unknown. Suffice it to say that although "Siemens
had no idea they were a carrier," in the words of one U.S. official
quoted by Sanger, "it turns out there is always an idiot around who
doesn't think much about the thumb drive in their hand." SAFETY IN ONES
AND ZEROS [[If cyberattacks **reduce**]{.mark} **the amount of
[violence]{.mark} inherent in conflict**, and if they often take the
form of sabotage or espionage, then many [officials]{.mark} and
commentators who have been [warning about]{.mark} the dawn of [cyberwar
have been ringing false alarms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Digital violence
does have implications]{.underline} for ethics and for national security
strategy, however. [Weaponized code]{.underline}, or cyberattacks more
generally, [can **achieve goals that used to require conventional
force**]{.underline}. The most sophisticated [cyberattacks are highly
targeted]{.underline}, and cyberweapons are [unlikely to cause

Strategic and Moral Imperative." Philosophy & Technology, Feb. 2017.

3.4 [The **Failure of Cyber Deterrence?** The potency of cyber
deterrence is difficult to judge]{.underline}. This is partly [because
there exists no consensus on what constitutes an act of
sufficient]{.underline} cyber [aggression]{.underline}. Therefore, it is
not entirely clear what is to be deterred. Where exactly the threshold
for response should be will be discussed in section three of this paper.
[For now]{.underline}, we can state that **[low-level [nuisance
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.mark} a **[daily]{.mark}
occurrence**]{.underline}. For example, U.S. military networks are
probed and scanned millions of times each day (Work 2015, 1). Similarly,
[acts of cyber espionage are reasonably common]{.underline}.
[[However]{.mark}, what is also [evident is the **lack of
major**]{.mark} **cyber [attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For a while,
Stuxnet, Wiper, Shamoon and Bronze Soldier appeared to signal the rise
of cyber attack as a potent new instrument of policy. However, **medium
to [large]{.mark}-scale [attacks]{.mark} have essentially
[dried-up]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, reflecting the empirical
evidence, and marking a shift in tone, in his]{.underline} September
[2015 testimony]{.underline} to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Director of National Intelligence, James [[Clapper]{.underline},
**[talked down]{.underline}**]{.mark} the possibility of **[[an
'electronic Pearl Harbor']{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, he focused on
ongoing 'low-to-moderate' level threats (Clapper 2015, 2). What does
this all tell us? **[Is deterrence working?]{.underline}** If one
considers low-to-moderate threats as deterrable, then the answer would
seem to be no. From this perspective, and according to some policy
makers, deterrence is already failing. In a 2015 Senate Armed Services
Committee Hearing, Chairman John McCain was scathing in his assessment:
'Our adversaries view our response \... as timid and ineffectual. Put
simply, the problem is a lack of deterrence. The administration has not
demonstrated to our adversaries that the consequence of continued cyber
attacks against us outweigh the benefit.' (Takala 2015) However, [if we
take the view that cyber [deterrence should]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[[concern itself only with **large**]{.mark}**-scale
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the picture is]{.underline} more
**[positive]{.underline}**. Indeed, [Valeriano and
[Maness]{.mark}]{.underline} (2015) have
[[identified]{.underline}]{.mark} **[considerable]{.underline}** levels
of [**[restraint]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [state [cyber
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could be [[due to]{.mark} a **[lack
of confidence in the]{.mark} strategic [utility of]{.mark} cyber
[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It may also reflect]{.mark} the
development of **[norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
aggressive]{.underline} forms of [cyber behaviour [and]{.mark} the
efficacy of **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[norms]{.underline} increasingly [form part of '**complex deterrence'**,
within which military and non-military elements operate
together]{.underline}. In cyberspace, although a settled understanding
of universal rules of behaviour is still lacking, [[norms]{.mark} appear
to be [crystalis]{.mark}ing [around **acceptable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
forms of [**[intrusion]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a **blanket [non-use]{.mark} position**]{.underline} (Stevens 2012,
25). [[This]{.mark} may [explain]{.mark} the continuance of [lowlevel
probes]{.mark} whilst large attacks have trailed off.]{.underline}

but carrying a big stick -- and that very often encourages people to
negotiate" argued Sir Roger Carr at the recent BAE Systems annual
general meeting -- "[we try and provide our people, our government, our
allies with the very best weapons, the very best sticks they can have,
to encourage peace]{.underline}." Applying ethics of care principles to
the business of warmongering is useless in the realm of engineering,
rather, [one must take a pragmatic view of the ethical
cycle]{.underline}. The question of whether BAE Systems conducts its
advanced weaponry business ethically is grounded by the principle that
conflict will always exist; as such, it is human nature for distrust to
fester. Hence, a case can be made that [[to cease the supply of advanced
weaponry]{.mark} to responsible nations [would]{.mark} in fact not
[be]{.mark} principled martyrdom, but **[ethical
suicide.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As Carr points out, [[advanced weaponry
can]{.mark} often [prove a very **effective deterrent to
conflict**]{.mark} in the first place -- but furthermore, as an
influential western arms dealer, BAE Systems also has the opportunity to
**minimize collateral damage in war zones**.]{.underline} [The supply of
advanced weaponry with high levels of precision allows for targeted
airstrikes that eliminate the specific threat to life posed by the
target, with a **minimal loss of civilian life**]{.underline}. Now
contrast this with the alternative of withdrawing supply. Undoubtedly,
**[[unprincipled arms distributors would step into cover the gap in the
market, supplying less precise weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most
recent major example of aging, unguided weaponry being supplied to a war
zone is Russian support of President Assad's disputed and morally
reprehensible regime in Syria -- which has since caused a humanitarian
crisis in Aleppo. [[Permitting the growth of such regressive means of
conflict (potentially including]{.mark} the rise of [chemical weaponry)
is the alternative]{.mark} to BAE supplying advanced weaponry, and [so
abandoning western influence]{.mark} on the global arms market can only
lead one way -- to a **greater disregard for international humanitarian
law**.]{.underline} In any case, **[this [cannot be considered a morally
acceptable action]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and so by default, if
nothing else, the alternative of BAE Systems supplying sophisticated
weaponry must be considered ethical. Such rationality illustrates why
ethics of care fails to provide an acceptable moral solution in this
case. Utilitarianism and regulation of the arms market [From a
utilitarian viewpoint, the sustainment of powerful weaponry enables a
country to defend its people and provide assistance in foreign conflicts
where there is a suffering population. Doing so arguably **protects a
majority of people.**]{.underline} Furthermore, with the FTSE 100 index
about to suffer from Brexit uncertainty, the nation's industrial future
is at risk. BAE System's economic contribution is critical for jobs in
turbulent times. The UK defence industry employs 300,000 people,
supplies 10 per cent of the country's manufacturing and engineering
jobs, and has a turnover of £35bn through 9,000 different companies. BAE
Systems has a pivotal role in ensuring the UK economy's prosperous
future by being the real driver of the next skills generation: promoting
STEM subject pathways, through which graduates get into engineering.
Additionally, as a result of the profits from the manufacture and sale
of arms, BAE Systems provides a backbone of technical support to other
market sectors -- for example building solutions for other industries
such as transport; including the digital transformation of the UK rail
network. There are a number of key international weapons regulations,
whereby some governments have very robust arms trade control systems in
place, but [other governments are fuelling the illicit and irresponsible
trade in arms by having weak control systems or none at
all]{.underline}. BAE [Systems ensures risks like this are minimised by
implementing an Arms Trade Treaty that reduces and prevents excessive
conflict, via making it difficult for armed groups that commit human
rights abuses to acquire a ready flow of arms.]{.underline} The treaty
provides an important framework for well-regulated defence trade and the
reduction of illegal arms sales around the world. Money should be
invested in diplomacy instead of fuelling war and destruction. BAE
Systems deals with numerous countries which do not rank favorably on the
human freedom index. The sale of advanced weaponry demonstrates, solely,
an archaic form of diplomacy which is not apt for the modern world,
where conflict is rife and human life is priceless. **[Arms do not have
to be the prime medium through which diplomacy is
navigated.]{.underline}** The UK should explore other avenues; China for
all its prowess utilizes Pandas as a bargaining tool to advance their
agenda with other world powers. Joseph Nye, named this "Soft Power". [By
using civilian instruments of national security such as strategic
communications, foreign assistance, civic action and economic
reconstruction -- relationships are built on the exchange of culture and
knowledge as opposed to exploiting their perceived
insecurity.]{.underline} BAE Systems could incorporate promotion of this
moral intellectualism into their budget, where **[[exchange of
intelligence and civic action lead to stronger mutual relationships
developing without the transfer of arms]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Destruction created by the weaponry not only physically affects those
that are targeted but also creates a long-term drop in quality of life
for citizens. Millions of civilians have fled Syria due to the
destruction of their homes and lack of basic amenities. Around two
million people struggle to find clean water in Aleppo, as airstrikes
have been targeted the water infrastructure of the city and this has cut
civilian access to clean drinking water. Furthermore, refugee camps such
as those in Za'atari camp in Jordan contain only temporary solutions for
progressively longer-term issues such as maternity centres and wash
blocks. This is the environment the next generation are being born into
and are therefore starting life with an inherent ~~handicap~~. BAE
Systems could adopt an ethics of care framework which would allow them
to reconsider and understand the severity of the consequences of their
actions; principally selling such weapons. [[There is no foolproof way
of determining the end user of advanced weaponry]{.mark}, or of usage
intentions -- but by not producing such weaponry, BAE Systems could
avoid any risk of misuse.]{.underline}

### AT: Kroker\-\--2AC

#### Kroker's thesis is wrong and they devolve into the same humanistic principles he criticizes

James **Steinhoff 16**, The University of Western Ontario, "Exits to the
Posthuman Future," Canadian Journal of Communication, Vol. 41, No. 3,
2016, p. 533-536

In Exits to the Posthuman Future (2014), Arthur [[Kroker
deploys]{.underline}]{.mark} a mutant strain of Marshall McLuhan's
(McLuhan and McLuhan 1988) medium theory to paint [[a dark picture
of]{.mark} high-technology [capitalist societies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
At its most dire points [this]{.underline} book [appears to be an
affirmation of]{.underline} Friedrich Nietzsche (1964) and Jean
[Baudrillard's]{.underline} (1994) [theses that God is dead and meaning
is impossible. Advanced [tech]{.mark}nology [is the primary cause of
this condition]{.mark}, [which is the posthuman era]{.mark}. Kroker
contends that previous conceptions of the posthuman were misguidedly
optimistic and that the posthuman must be grasped as a state of total
indeterminacy in which a literally **living technology dominates human
agency**. Yet, [there is a **tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout
the text there are moments of tangible hope for a traditionally
humanistic future and, perplexingly, [[the book closes with an explicit
call to recover]{.mark} the social and ethical [values lost in]{.mark}
the ravages of [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the end, it is hard
to say what this book is intended to do. [Kroker's dark posthumanist
prognosis [stands starkly juxtaposed with his latent
humanism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arthur Kroker is a postmodernist Canadian
theorist who has been studying the intersections of technology and
culture since the mid-1980s. This new book consists of several essays
comprised of original material and new versions of previously presented
material. It is wide-ranging in topic, roving from drone warfare to
Obama's political rhetoric to media theory. In a high-speed and prolix
style that recalls William Gibson's cyberpunk fiction and the work of
McLuhan and Paul Virilio, [[Kroker sets out a way of thinking]{.mark}
about contemporary high-technological society\' [that follows
the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}McLuhanian [[insistence on the
constant and unavoidable influence of media on humans]{.mark}---but
inverts it]{.underline}. The theoretical linchpin of this text is the
"dark tetrad" (p. 25), Kroker's inversion of McLuhan's four laws of
media. McLuhan asserted that all media have four effects on individuals
and societies: to enhance something, to obsolesce something, to retrieve
something that was previously obsolesced, and to intensify something to
the point of its reversal (McLuhan & McLuhan, 4988). Kroker presents
another side to the tetrad, which he describes, following Jacques
Derrida (2006), as "hauntological" (p. 193). The dark tetrad describes
disappearance instead of enhancement, substitution instead of
obsolescence, abandonment instead of retrieval, and stasis instead of
reversal (Kroker, 2014). These four functions describe the actions of
media from a non-anthropomorphic standpoint. This dehumanization of
McLuhan is necessary, Kroker asserts, because a fundamental feature of
the posthuman era is that technology has "in the most literal sense \...
now come alive" (p. 28). Yet Kroker's main interest here is not the
autonomous artificial intelligences of transhumanist speculation, nor is
it the academic posthumanisms of Katherine Hayles (2008) or Donna
Harraway (2000). [[Kroker's posthuman age is]{.mark} "[that]{.mark}
historical [moment when the power of tech]{.mark}nology [turns back on
itself]{.mark}, effectively [undermining traditional concepts such as
**subjectivity**]{.mark}, **[privacy]{.mark}**, **[and bounded
consciousness]{.mark}** in order to render all things truly uncertain
and unknowable"]{.underline} (p. 7). It is a "dystopian phase of
information technology" in which "the informatics of domination has
appropriated the resistance spirit of the borderlands" (p. 96). [Kroker
argues that the permeable human/machine boundaries]{.underline} of
Hayles and Hanaway [have been superseded by]{.underline}7
all-encompassing [machinic control]{.underline}. Kroker's posthuman is
thus a dark time for beings that still think of themselves as human. It
is also a dark time because it is quite literally haunted. Kroker holds
that: "the essence of the posthuman axiomatic inheres in the fact that
technology now eagerly seeks out that which was previously marginalized
as simultaneously ways of mobilizing itself as it effectively recodes
every aspect of social and nonsocial existence" (p. 6). This is the
hauntological aspect of media: that which was previously marginalized is
resurrected by technologies to serve as their contents and reasons for
being with no logic discernable to humans. [The result is the
bewildering posthuman era, which Kroker adumbrates using the concepts of
acceleration, drift, and crash]{.underline}. Acceleration will be
familiar to readers of other postmodernist technology theorists, such as
Virilio, and needs little elaboration. Crash depicts the collision
between accelerated technologies and traditional human qualities. Drift
is Kroker's most compelling contribution to thinking the posthuman.
[[Drift describes the perturbations of a society no longer directed by
human intention]{.mark}, but by myriad, incremental, and unpredictable
mutations in the codes that underlie molar reality]{.underline}. Code
drift "is the spectral destiny of the story of technology," (p. 50) but
it is also "nothing new," (p. 52) in that human evolution is a history
of sampling errors. The posthuman era is described as one of "drift
culture" in that the randomness and non-teleological nature of the
molecular realm takes over the molar. The dark tetrad is thus to be
understood as a schematic of how code drift rearranges the world without
intention or consciousness. Code drift converts humans to "data flesh"
that fully absorbs the primary modernist disavowal---the sense of the
absurd in all the great referentials---as its key conditions of
possibility" (p. 53). Drift culture is the technological proof of
existentialism. [[Kroker is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[brief on
suggesting how we ought to proceed with social life]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the drifting absurdity of the posthuman era. He devotes only a
four-page epilogue to the question of what is to be done now. [Not
surprisingly, given the existentialist tone of the work, he advocates an
aesthetic comportment toward the posthuman]{.underline}. Specifically,
he endorses an aesthetics based on Jean-Frangois Lyotard's (2011) notion
of the "figural" or adiscursive gestalt---presumably adapting it to
grasp the adiscursivity of ubiquitous code: "Art of this (posthuman)
order recodes the question of aesthetics by the creation of a mode of
perception that fully opens to the discontinuous, tire fragmentary, the
uncertain, the reversal" (Kroker 2014, P-197)- [[This call for extreme
openness evokes]{.mark} Nietzsche's [Dionysian]{.mark} mode of
[being]{.mark}, [in which destruction and creation possess equal
valence]{.mark}]{.underline}, but Kroker quickly qualifies this,
asserting that since: the posthuman condition has revealed decadence
\... as the basic ontology of late capitalism, the point of a figural
art that would "harden, worsen, accelerate decadence" would be precisely
the reverse, that is to say, it would draw into a greater visibility
those intangible, but very real, impulses to social solidarity and
ethical probity that haunt the order of the real. (p. 198) [[This foray
into the]{.mark} supposedly [posthuman ends with a call for]{.mark} the
[reinstatement of the most humanistic]{.mark} of [principles]{.mark}.
The idea seems to be that the novel form of living in the posthuman era
is analogous to the collective yearnings of the "spirit of
'68."]{.underline}

#### AND, it's [biologically impossible]{.underline}\-\--the thing that makes humans not chimpanzees [is instrumental rationality]{.underline} \<\<\< -- they'll assert that this argument naturalizes our model of thinking BUT that's not a bad thing since we're right -- it's their burden to prove efficacy in the short-term or the case obviously outweighs \>\>\>

Søren **Riis 11**, Carlsberg Research Fellow and Assistant Professor of
Philosophy and Science Studies at Roskilde University, Ph.D. from
Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, "Towards the origin of modern
technology: reconfiguring Martin Heidegger's thinking," 2-8-2011

Moreover, Heidegger maintains: ''Readiness-to-hand is the way in which
entities as they are 'in themselves' are defined
ontologico-categorially.''47 According to Heidegger's fundamental
phenomenology, which he unfolds in detail in Being and Time and
reaffirms a decisive part of in ''The Question Concerning Technology,''
[nature is]{.underline} ''primally'' [revealed in its
''usability'']{.underline} and ''serviceability-for-;'' [that is to
say]{.underline}, ['['nature'' is a resource **long before the**]{.mark}
**actual [rise of]{.mark} modern and ancient [tech]{.mark}nology**,
namely **[simultaneously with the]{.mark} very [origin of human]{.mark}
being[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That something is primordially revealed
in its ''usability'' and ''serviceability-for-'' does not imply that it
is actually used or serves accordingly, but that it is revealed as
standing ready to be utilized in the corresponding context. As such, it
is revealed as ''standing-reserve.'' This, for example, also
[corresponds to the **[empirical fact]{.mark}** that **[prehistoric
humans]{.mark}**]{.underline} settled close to woods and rivers. In
these areas they [[**always** had **stockpiles of timber**]{.mark},
power for [**transportation**, and]{.mark} easy **[access to drinking
water]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Based on ''The Question Concerning
Technology'' and completed through references to Being and Time, we now
have an interpretation of the origin of the essence of modern
technology, which traces back the characteristic revealing of das
Gestell to the beginning of humankind.48 This does not imply that
prehistoric technology is identical with contemporary technology; rather
the third [[genealogy]{.underline}]{.mark} of the rule of das Gestell
[[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[when ''we]{.mark} still more
primally'' [try to consider the origin of the challenging revealing
characterizing the rule of das Gestell]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[we]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in fact [rediscover that it is connected
to being human]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The rule of das Gestell **[has
challenged humans as long as they have existed]{.mark}**. In this sense,
**[humans first and foremost exist under the rule of das
Gestell]{.mark}**]{.underline}.49 [This]{.underline} also [entails a
revision]{.underline} and precision [of Heidegger's renowned formula
characterizing the world-connectedness of human existence:
being-in-the-world]{.underline}. Based on the comparison of ''The
Question Concerning Technology'' and Being and Time, [human existence is
better described as being-under-the-spell-of-das-Gestell.]{.underline}
Trying to understand the various more-or-less explicit accounts of the
origin of the rule of das Gestell in ''The Question Concerning
Technology'' and the resulting ambiguity is not just an exercise, nor
only a way to criticize Heidegger. Rather, it is a way to better
understand the nuances and layers in Heidegger's thinking concerning
technology and to warn against a short-sighted ''saving'' from an
alleged danger. If the challenging revealing of nature, which
characterizes the rule of das Gestell is taken seriously, then we cannot
avoid it just by revolutionizing our technology, instead, we must revise
our very human existence.

#### Kroker is wrong -- doesn't understand biotechnology, doesn't understand his own philosophy, and ignores that the will to technology is inevitable

**Glynn 19** (Andrew Glynn PhD -- Doctorate in Philsophy and
meta-physician, "Arthur Kroker's "The Will to Technology", Dasein42, 13
February 2019,
<https://dasein42.medium.com/arthur-krokers-the-will-to-technology-97057aab9f7d>,
MG)

Kroker is correct that the science most prevalent in the 20th century is
that of biology rather than physics, and the most controversial
technology therefore bio-technology. [Kroker, like much of the public
**not actually versed** in the technology part of bio-technology, jumps
to the assumption that the small successes (such as bio-engineering
bacteria to produce insulin) indicate that large scale human
bio-engineering is 'just around the corner'. The reality is **far
different**]{.underline} --- having just completed a short stint at a
firm involved with Google in producing a genome variant search engine
that meets all the security and identity management requirements that
each genetic database owner puts on their data, [we're **not even at the
point** where a reasonably simple search for a given genome variant can
be accomplished.]{.underline}

Biology itself is in much the same state as physics in 1900 when Planck
first called for a quantum theory --- there's a strong sense that our
past biology is overly simplistic, but not a clear path forward.

The human genome project has taught us plenty of things, but the most
important of those is that most genes or [gene combinations are
interpreted dynamically in some way based on the environment, and since
we know **neither the meaning of most of the genetic code, nor how the
interpreter works**, and we have no Rosetta Stone to give us a clue to
either, bio-engineering at the human level is going to remain relatively
simplistic for some time. We're not in the bionic age quite yet, though
Kroker appears to believe we are]{.underline}. There are genes that map
directly to phenotypes, such as eye colour, but that appears to be
largely true only in phenotypes that are relatively unimportant, again
such as eye colour, which makes little difference to anyone other than
cosmeticians.

[I won't go into the number of more important predictions made by
Heidegger in particular that **Kroker is apparently completely oblivious
to**,]{.underline} despite many of them having already come to pass in
the short time since his death in 1976, or in danger of coming to pass
imminently. [However omissions such as the identity of the 'last god';
the 'thin wall' that separates our pure imagination (as in dreams) with
our experience of reality; and the notion of Being as change are
somewhat]{.underline} [unforgivable]{.underline}. Of course, that takes
us back to the omission of Hegel and the light Hegel's work shines on
the three thinkers Kroker does deal with.

[Kroker seems to miss that for Heidegger technology is a 'destining',
i.e. a dispensation of Being itself (and in some senses the most overt
manifestation of Being in postmodern times), and therefore **not
something to be either for or against**, but something one needs to
discover a "free relation" to. This destining subverts the title of the
work itself, in that technology as a dispensation of Being has nothing
to do with will in Nietzsche's sense, where will to power reverts almost
immediately to will to will, since power is only the ability to will
more.]{.underline}

[He also skims over the important notion of the ontological transparency
of technology, i.e. given an iPhone, nearly **anyone can see almost
immediately how it could be better**, how it doesn't (yet) quite
substitute for the essence of technology, though we do use specific
technological artifacts of that kind in substitution for technology as a
whole in our daily speech without thinking much if anything about it.
The same cannot be said when we look at a tree or a horse, for
instance.]{.underline}

The book is written in a fast-paced style apparently intended to get
average readers interested in the work of these thinkers and how it both
affects and is affected by events in the world since their work was
written. In some ways it works, in others [it seems to cause Kroker to
skim over some of the **most crucial concepts**.]{.underline}

abstractions, [**[more calculative thinking]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
**[more en-framing]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline} **[stronger

[[when it comes to]{.mark} the [wars]{.mark} [in Iraq]{.mark} and
Afghanistan, Katrina, global warming, and a variety of other events, [it

[impossibility of calculative thought]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Perhaps [our project]{.mark} going further [is]{.mark}]{.underline} to,
as Isabelle Stengers has argued, **[[to calculate
again]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This is not the calculative thought of
the capitalist cost-benefit system, but a **different
calculation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is, to steal a phrase from Jane
Bennett, [[about **mutually enabling
instrumentalizations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Long quotation from
Stengers ahead, so bear with me: The cosmopolitical Parliament is not
primarily a place where instantaneous decisions are made, but a
delocalized place. It exists every time a \"we\" is constructed that
does not identify with the identity of a solution but hesitates before a
problem. I associate this \"we\" with the only slogan Leibniz ever
proposed: Calculemus. [Let us calculate]{.underline}. It\'s an odd
expression, constructed to conceptualize the possibility of peace during
a time of war. But Leibniz was a mathematician, not an accountant or
statistician. For him, calculation was not a mere balance sheet
contrasting homogeneous quantities, calculations of interest or benefits
that were presented as being commensurable. For a mathematician, the
accuracy of a calculation and the validity of its result are relatively
simple questions, \"trivial\" in the language of mathematics. What is
important, and which is not in the least trivial, is the position of the
problem that will, possibly, allow it to be calculated, the precise
creation of relationships and constraints, the distinction between the
various ingredients, the exploration of the roles they are liable to
play, the determinations or indeterminations they engender or bring
about. There is no commensurability without the invention of a
measurement, and the challenge of Leibniz\'s calculemus is, precisely,
the creation of a \"we\" that excludes all external measures, all prior
agreements separating those who are entitled to \"enter\" into the
calculation and those subject to its result. \[\...\] Calculemus,
therefore, does not mean \"let us measure,\" \"let us add,\" \"let us
compare,\" but, first and foremost, let us create the \"we\" associated
with the nature and terms of the operation to be risked. It is not a
question of acting in the name of truth and justice, but of creating
commensurability. It is a question of knowing that the \"truth\" of the
created common measure will always be relative to what such creation
will have been capable of, knowing also that a radical heterogeneity
preexists such creation, the absence of any preexisting shared measure
among the ingredients to be articulated. (Cosmopolitics II, pp.
399-401).

A further line of political deflection is the accelerationist strategy.
There are quasi-leftist accelerationists (Mackay and Avanessian). [We
should **take seriously** the proposition that the **only way to save
the planet** is to **accelerate** the pace of **technological
innovation**]{.underline}. On one view, the only way to save the planet
from global warming is by developing nuclear fusion technology. This
points down the pathway of the Hadron collider and big science. But
there is another acceleration that would decommission all forms of
nuclear technology, and rather than imitating the sun, seek renewable
forms of symbiosis with solar energy. A global diversion of military and
industrial resources into renewable and sustainable energy forms would
constitute a technological acceleration coupled with a radical
deceleration in fossil fuel consumption, perhaps even putting the brakes
on the fallacy of economic growth. What quickly emerges is that [there
are **choices to be made** across contested terrains. The forms of
acceleration are **political choices**, choices of **great urgency**,
but to **thematise**]{.underline} "acceleration" as such [provides
**scant critical purchase** on different forms]{.underline} of
acceleration. [What is needed are **nuanced mediations** of the science
and technology **currently available**, along with **global democratic
decision making** on those technologies we choose to **accelerate** or
**slow down**]{.underline}.

[Another version of the "accelerationist" argument]{.underline} captures
some of the ideological workings of the term. In Marxist circles, an
"accelerationist" [is someone who thinks that the collapse of capitalism
will be **hastened** by allowing reactionary forces to **speed up
capitalism's self-destruction**. There are occasions when such an
argument has validity]{.underline}: nothing about the form of the
argument makes it inherently or structurally wrong. There are
revolutionary moments when allowing capitalism to collapse in order to
rebuild a socialist society is a better path than propping up a failing
capitalist regime. The judgement is political rather than philosophical.
[In **most contexts**, however, the accelerationist argument, especially
as a political principle, is **deeply dangerous**. It would be
**better**, for example, to **preserve a failing US capitalist
regime**]{.underline} while building social forces to take it over,
[than to allow the nuclear weapons of the United States to **fall into
the hands of a**]{.underline} suicidal [**\[self-destructive\] military
rearguard** or some **counter-revolutionary terrorist organisation**.
Preserving the possibility of human life **might involve propping up
collapsing capitalist institutions**, not least the **nuclear safety
inspectorate**, rather than **allowing humanity to be swallowed up by
some death spiral of presidential dictators** in fear of being toppled.
These are **critical judgements** that could arise at **any moment**,
with **real risks** that poor judgements will **hasten a nuclear
confrontation** that leads to **mutually assured annihilation**. The
**formal shape** of an accelerationist argument needs to be understood
**strategically** and **politically** if it is to address nuclear
questions.]{.underline}

[The accelerationist view]{.underline} that the deepening of capitalism
could hasten its self-destructive tendencies and lead to its collapse
[is **not inherently suicidal**, but consideration of what the
collapse]{.underline} of capitalism [might mean for the **global stock
of nuclear weapons** and **nuclear power stations indicates
dangers**]{.underline}. Amid the collapse of capitalism, [**securing the
safety of nuclear resources** is a **fundamental priority**,
and]{.underline} preparing a decelerationist strategy is [an **essential
political position** for **any radical formation** serious about nuclear
safety. Against the horizon of nuclear crisis, we **rely on workers** to
know how to **manage** and **decommission nuclear weapons**, **silos**
and **power stations**. This requires "**good**" science and ongoing
struggles to **control the decision making** around weapons and energy
systems. **Concrete consideration** of **what happens to ageing nuclear
systems** in an imploding political system has been **tested** in the
fall of the Soviet Union. Imagine the **retrenchment of reactionary
forces** around nuclear installations threatening **suicidal political
terrorism on a global scale**. The risks of a collapsing]{.underline}
capitalist [system **taking the world down with it** are
**clear**]{.underline}. Chernobyl and Fukushima, moreover, stand as
metonyms of the risks involved in systems that were apparently
functional and yet spiralled out of control even in what might be called
peacetime. The risks of the US or the Chinese nuclear androids imploding
involve different decisions. Again, [the need is for **nuanced political
judgements** and **strategies**, involving **scientific expertise**
along with solidarity between scientists, workers and new social
formations.]{.underline}

[The need for **nuanced political engagement** with "good" science
suggests some of the risks in **any thematisation**]{.underline} of
science [within **archaic philosophical paradigms**. One form of nuclear
denial is the **reluctance to engage** with the **concrete
consequences** of scientific knowledge, preferring to **retreat behind
the limited competence of the humanities scholar**. It takes **some
hubris of philosophical interpretation** to suggest that **literary
studies** can offer to **understand the fictional heart** of the nuclear
threat **despite knowing very little** about the science and technology
involved. There will, **doubtless**, be **philosophical**,
**ontological** and **metaphysical questions** that science and
technology cannot answer]{.underline}. Nuclear arguments may carry
within their forms and conditions of possibility the illusions of
Western metaphysics, and decommissioning nuclear metaphors could turn
out to be as significant as criticising the public lies of nuclear
policy: but the nuclear android also imposes less philosophical
imperatives to engage with science, from medical science to nuclear
waste disposal, and through the critique of the political economy of the
nuclear android. [None of this suggests that metaphysics **should** or
**could be deleted**. To **deflect engagement** with the existing
mess]{.underline} of the nuclear android [back into **metaphysical** and
**literary questions** nevertheless threatens to **evade the existing
threats**, not just of **nuclear annihilation** but of **Indigenous
rights**, **environmental politics**, and the **raft of mediations** and
**regulative practices on which any amelioration of nuclear damage
depends**. Nuclear war remains an **imminent threat**, but so does the
persistence of practices and strategies that **contribute to maintenance
of the spectacle** of the nuclear rather than its **disarmament** and
**decommissioning**. To reduce the problem to the "threat" of nuclear
war is to imagine that the **actually existing industrial behemoth** of
nuclear production is a **fiction**. **It isn't**. Nuclear weapons
testing and the history of nuclear accidents **were not just fables**,
and nor was the arms race a war of **sophistry** and **rhetoric**,
however much sophistry and rhetoric were deployed]{.underline} to
disguise the ecocidal tendencies of the nuclear android.

[[We are cautioned]{.mark} by Heidegger [not to rush]{.mark} headlong
[into action]{.mark} aimed at solving an evident but. he assures
us]{.underline}, nonetheless [inessential problem such as the
destruction of a river valley]{.underline} through the construction of a
hydroelectric dam. [Heidegger insists that in our urgent hurry we will
miss the real threat]{.underline}, [which is not to the
valley]{.underline} or even its displaced human residents, [but to the
pos­sibilities for]{.underline} human [thinking]{.underline} itself.
[[Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} there can be no doubt that **[[our decision
to sit]{.mark} quietly [meditating]{.mark} on our breath or poetry
[involves]{.mark} many [difficult practi­cal choices. To sit
still]{.mark}]{.underline}** *in the* midst of the restlessness of the
technological world is as much‑indeed, [[is]{.mark} more‑ [deliberate
action]{.mark} than rushing out the door]{.underline} brandishing a
placard. [**[Simply sitting and reading]{.mark}** Heidegger
[implies]{.mark} a host of [practical judgments]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
put aside books on integrated business management and be bothered with
Heideggers ontological questions at all runs counter to the
self‑assuredness and instrumentalism of the latemodern world. And
remain­ing open to these questions, if we choose to be so bothered, is
difficult amid the burly burly of technological life?r Contrary to
Dreyfus. [I consider]{.underline} that \"[ecological destruction,
inextricably **ontological and corporeal**]{.underline}.The literature
of radical ecophilosophy attests to this being so. My concern about the
accumulation of carcino­genic *pesticides* and heavy metals in the
tissues of my children is at once a concern with the technological
diminishment of human pocsibilities and a concern with the practical
task of living in more sane, more careful ways. Certainly [my
preoccupation with]{.underline} the [well‑being]{.underline} of my
children [could be nar­rowly construed as a mere instrumentalizing
concern with]{.underline} the [survival]{.underline} of my genes
Similarly ambivalent are alternatives to harmful, unsustainable
practices offered via the ecomodernist drive for ecoefficiency. If I can
afford them. I can choose from alternatives such as genetically
engineered pest resistance, the sub­stitution of timber in my house, and
of lead in petrol and paints, by more sophisticated synthetic products
of industrial laboratories. However, history has shown the propensity of
such solutions to create new sets of problems, for which new *sets* of
technological solutions are soon required. This is, after all, the
dynamic of technological profligacy that *defines* modernity There is
thus much weight to Dreyfus\' argument that to attempt to solve our
problems in this way is to move another step further clown the path to
fully technologized forms of life that obliterate the possibility of our
encountering our relational selfhood. But where does this leave us as we
negotiate the ambiguities of daily life? [[If I choose to reduce
toxicity]{.mark}]{.underline} in my family\'s diet by the collection of

**Schulman 18**, Deputy Director of Studies and Leon E. Panetta Senior
Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, co-host of the
national security podcast Bombshell, held senior staff positions at the
National Security Council and Department of Defense (Loren DeJonge

Foreign Policy ⁠--- Progressives Should Embrace the Politics of
Defense,\" Texas National Security Review,
https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-progressive-foreign-policy/)

[These policy positions require little analytical effort or
**p**olitical **c**apital, and let Democrats occasionally posture as
morally superior by emphasizing "non-military tools" of foreign policy.
[The]{.mark} **opposite [alt]{.mark}**ernative **[of]{.mark} a more
rigid pacifism** and **[anti-militarism]{.mark}**, though common in the
grassroots progressive community, [has **no** ]{.mark}**consistently
[organized political presence]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the Hill
[and]{.underline} thus also **[escapes thorough
interrogation]{.underline}**.75 For those outside the Beltway,
[[opposition to **all things military** offers the refuge of principle
**without**]{.mark} **critical [justification]{.mark}** [or
**analysis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For many Democrats, the Obama model
was a strangely tolerable middle ground: a bipartisan budget mess made
while a "responsible" president ramped up security interventions in
enough secrecy to avoid nagging scrutiny or self-examination.
[Re-Politicizing Defense Despite the valiant efforts of some
individuals, [there is no political home for **responsible defense
debate**]{.mark}]{.underline}, oversight, and accountability.76 Yet,
[[with determination, the left might find]{.mark} a real [foothold in
defense policy]{.mark} --- **without compromising progressive values**.
To be clear: There is **substantial work** to be done on figuring out
what cohesive view of America's role in the world the left can tolerate
and advance. [There is]{.mark} even [great]{.mark}er [work to be done
on]{.mark} determining [how to]{.mark} **renew**, **reuse**, and
**[reform]{.mark} international [institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.77
[[But any]{.mark} such [agendas would be well served by
**embracing**]{.mark} **a set of [principles]{.mark}** [that make
clear]{.mark}]{.underline}~~-eyed~~ [**[debate and evaluation of defense
policy]{.mark}** and **execution an asset**]{.underline}, not an
unforgiveable sin. [[Critical analysis of defense affairs is **too often
left to the technocratic** and]{.mark} **comparatively powerless
["blob,"]{.mark}** []{.mark}which can **write a mean op-ed** or
**tweet**, [but has **limited ability to engage the**]{.mark} **American
[people]{.mark} on its will** and **interests**]{.underline}. And
[although]{.underline} [[Congress has]{.mark} willfully declawed itself
so that it cannot maintain meaningful oversight of national
security]{.underline},78 [its ability [to]{.mark} stage and **[amplify
policy debate]{.mark}** for the American people is without parallel, and
[it has]{.mark} tremendous latent [potential to **restore**]{.mark}
**greater [balance]{.mark} in c**ivil-**m**ilitary **r**elations.
Congress's absence and the **associated de-politicization of national
security affairs** is **costly**]{.underline}. For instance,
[[the]{.mark} American [public is]{.mark} deeply [ambivalent
about]{.mark} the 17-year conflict in [Afghanistan and]{.mark}
**generally [ignorant]{.mark}** []{.mark}of the widespread activities of
the [war on terror]{.mark}]{.underline}.79 [**This is unsurprising**:
Congress, too, is disaffected, often ignorant of where the U.S. military
is even engaged]{.underline},80 [and has made little headway into
questioning or shaping this intervention. The most **substantive** and
**serious debate** about executive war authorities and the effectiveness
of U.S. counterterrorism strategy has resulted in little more than a
reauthorization proposal]{.underline} that still failed to move
forward.81 [Too many examples of political leaders' **stand-off** or
**superficial approach to defense policy** and execution abound.
Military superiority is generally viewed as sacrosanct, placed on "so
high a pedestal as to **render real debate
meaningless**]{.underline}."82 [That reverence **infantilizes defense
budget debates**]{.underline}. Thanking troops for their service is a
politicized ritual that divorces politicians and their constituents from
the intent and costs of that service. With decisions on the needs of the
U.S. military and sustaining legacy systems openly linked to the
economies of congressional districts, it's understandable that skeptics
of utilizing military tools have been unwilling to evaluate their
merits. **[[These must]{.mark} all [change]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
While, at its worst, [the political right treats the use of force abroad
as a metric of patriotism and the size of the force as the measure of
one's love of America, the political left ought to draw from its
skepticism toward intervention and its faith in institutions to advance
a more rational and accountable approach to national
security]{.underline}. For years, Robert Farley has highlighted that
"progressives consistently underestimate the importance of discussions
about military doctrine and technology,"83 taking what Michael Walzer
calls "shortcuts"84 [in their critiques of defense policy that relieve
them from contributing to key debates. **Instead of excusing
themselves**, **[the left should]{.mark} instead [propose legitimate
questions]{.mark} about major shifts in force employment** and
**development**: Will it work? What are its goals? What is the U.S.
national security apparatus learning? Why didn't it work? Were U.S.
objectives wrong? What did America change when it didn't work? Will
America do it again? What could be improved? **What should America do
now?** Joining the Conversation]{.underline} Jackson's notion of what a
progressive "wager" on national security might look like in practice is
useful, filling the gap between the "Republican-lite" default and the
stubbornness of anti-militarism. But the left's diversity of thought can
accommodate a wider playing field of potential alternative approaches to
security than even he proposes. [[A]{.mark} true [pacifist
movement]{.mark} on the Hill and on the campaign trail, [dedicated to
the advancement of non-military approaches]{.mark} but [premised on
**analysis** and logical **arg**]{.mark}ument[**s**, **would be a
serious advancement in national security** and **should be
welcomed**]{.mark} **by the most ardent military
advocates**]{.underline}. Likewise, [a more **prudent middle ground
approach** --- one that is skeptical of, but open to, military
might]{.underline} and intervention [and demands a better return on
investment of national security tools]{.underline} --- [should **play a
more prominent political role**. The full range of the left's national
security spectrum should forcefully engage in **oversight of the
rationale for** and **quality of American forces**]{.underline} and
interventions abroad. [The left should therefore consider adopting a
series of principles on defense matters]{.underline} --- [including
criteria for the use of force]{.underline} --- [that apply to the
military-friendly and anti-militarist left alike]{.underline}. In
practice, [[this means acknowledging]{.mark} that [there are
valid]{.mark} political [positions on]{.mark} matters of [defense that
**lie**]{.mark} **somewhere in between "[yes, and]{.mark}" and "[no
never]{.mark}"** and that trivializing them is harmful to America's
national security]{.underline}. There are alternatives to today's
counterterror strategy and it would not be an insult to the military to
debate them. It's entirely legitimate to study whether the military is
equipped to face today's threats without being accused of retreating
from the world or starting with an artificial budget cut. It's sensible
to consider whether the planned growth of ground forces, a 350-ship
Navy, or a 386-squadron Air Force are the right investments or political
benchmarks.85 [These questions involve choices and values and should not
be avoided under the umbrella of a supposed technocratic bipartisan
agreement]{.underline}. Just as important, [[it's **essential** that the
left **avoid becoming a caricature**]{.mark} **of itself [that promotes
simplistic]{.mark}** [and **superficial positions** that set **rigid**,
**unserious standards**.]{.mark} The left may not agree on the size or
purpose of the military, but it can agree America should strive for
**informed oversight** and **accountability**]{.underline}.

University, September 18, 2017. "Agents provocateurs and the
manipulation of the radical left."
https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/agents-provocateurs-and-the-manipulation-of-the-radical-left/)

Right now, there is considerable discussion going on about the best way
to do all these things. [**[Tactics]{.underline}** [that make us **feel
good**]{.underline}]{.mark} [because they are exhilarating [are
not]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [the same as]{.underline}
**[[effective]{.mark} tactics]{.underline}**. [They can]{.underline}, in
fact, [be]{.underline} precisely **[the opposite]{.underline}**. History
teaches us is that the ruling class, [the]{.underline}
**[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}** and non-state institutions it controls,
as well as the right [[have learned]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[political judo]{.underline}]{.mark}** [whereby the [left's actions
may]{.mark} [be **turned around**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and used to
**strengthen the right**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and weaken the
left]{.underline}. Specifically, [we should learn from the history of
the **[agent provocateur]{.mark}**, a specialist in **[manipulating
conflict]{.mark}** so as to benefit our enemies]{.underline}. **[Agents
provocateurs]{.underline}** [are not merely enemy spies]{.underline}
within the people's movement. [The]{.underline}
**[provocateur]{.underline}** [has an]{.underline} even more **[sinister
mission]{.underline}**, which sometimes has deadly results. What [the
**provocateur** frequently [provoke]{.mark}s is [actions that]{.mark}
either [discredit the left]{.mark} or the people's movement in the eyes
of large numbers of people, or which **[entrap]{.mark}** the [unwary
into acts that]{.mark} will **[allow police to pounce]{.mark}**, accuse
activists of plotting violent or other anti-social acts, and then **lock
them up**]{.underline}. Agents provocateurs have been known for well
over a century, in many countries; the breed was especially rife in
tsarist Russia in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In the United States,
agents provocateurs often targeted labor union organizing efforts. Since
the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War,
[there are **many accounts**]{.underline} [of the **FBI**]{.underline},
[other police bodies]{.underline}, the military, and private right-wing
vigilante groups [sending agents provocateurs into people's
**organizations**]{.underline} [with the purpose of **dividing,
disrupting, and discrediting**]{.underline} [them and then laying them
**open to arrest**]{.underline} and prosecution, or worse. More radical
than thou In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a great outpouring of
grassroots rejection of the policies, domestic and international, of the
Cold War. [The **[Civil Rights Movement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [plus
the [movement against]{.mark} the [Vietnam War]{.mark}]{.underline},
[brought millions into the streets protesting courageously against the
many injustices of our society. The Cold Warriors and the **[ruling
class]{.mark}** did not like this, as they saw their
interests]{.underline} threatened. So they
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} open and **[[covert
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for [undermining]{.mark} the [new
radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as the "old left" (communists
and socialists). [The idea was to make sure that the left did not
continue to win over the support of the mass of the people of the United
States to progressive and ultimately, revolutionary, socialist
ideas.]{.underline} The "new left" tendencies that arose at this time
included many positive features but had some dangerous flaws also. One
flaw was that too often, a fetish was made of the absolute right of
anybody involved in an organization to express his or her opinion no
matter how divergent from the main goals of the organization, or to
engage in any activity which was "radical" regardless of whether it
helped or harmed the cause. This extreme liberalism laid many
organizations open to manipulation of some of their weakest elements by
agents provocateurs. [There was also a [tendency to **compete to see who
was most radical**]{.mark}. The competition for revolutionary "cred" was
a godsend for agents provocateurs, who actively encouraged such
competition]{.underline}. The lack of connections, especially among
campus-based white radicals, to the working class and its politics
exacerbated this trend by eliminating an important reality check.
Picking off leaders and undermining public support There also tended to
be a cult of leadership within many radical organizations which put
their leaders into a vulnerable position in which they could be targeted
for neutralization so as to undermine the whole movement. J. Edgar
Hoover's FBI, for instance, put a huge amount of effort into
neutralizing leaders. [The **[agents provocateurs]{.mark}** were
deployed in such a way as to [discredit]{.mark} the leaders and their
[organizations]{.mark}, to [create splits]{.mark} in the movement, and
in some cases to [provoke violence]{.mark} which would lead to physical
elimination of leaders plus a societal repudiation of the
movement.]{.underline} The 1960s campus-based movement against the
Vietnam War was a top target for agents provocateurs. There were several
at work, but one, known as "[Tommy the
Traveler](https://jeffsharletandvietnamgi.blogspot.com/2011/04/tommy-traveler.html)"
was particularly memorable. He, too, [concentrated on]{.underline}
**[enticing]{.underline}** impressionable young would-be
"**[revolutionaries]{.underline}**" [to commit acts that would divide
the movement]{.underline} while [landing them in **jail**]{.underline}.
Hoover, a crusading anti-communist and paranoid racist, paid particular
attention to **[[disrupting]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the]{.underline}
[[highly-effective](http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/want-to-punch-a-nazi-think-twice/)
[African American people's movement]{.mark}]{.underline}, [often
employing agents provocateurs to create friction within and between
liberation organizations]{.underline}. [This led to several
murders]{.underline}. In 1967, for example, agents provocateurs,
especially a certain [William
O'Neal](https://www.thenation.com/article/was-fred-hampton-executed/),
described in a Nation article as "infatuated with weapons," played a
role in the police murder of Illinois Black Panther Party leaders Fred
Hampton and Mark Clark. Hampton had been suspicious of O'Neal because of
his violent talk, but others did not see through him, with tragic
results. O'Neal's promotion of crackpot violent schemes should have been
a giveaway. When O'Neal set up Hampton and Clark for a brutal murder by
police acting under the orders of Cook County State's Attorney Ed
Hanrahan, the perpetrators were able to convince sectors of the public
that the Panthers were prone to violence and shot first, which was
untrue. Another example was the crime of Cerro Maravilla, in Puerto
Rico, on July 25, 1978. An agent provocateur, [Alejandro González
Malavé](https://nacla.org/article/cerro-maravilla-deaths-police-cover-rock-puerto-rico),
working undercover for the Puerto Rican police, enticed two idealistic
young supporters of independence for Puerto Rico into a reckless act
that cost them their lives. One was Carlos Enrique Soto Areví, the son
of one of Puerto Rico's most important literary figures, the novelist
Pedro Juan Soto. The second was a self-taught worker, Arnaldo Dario
Rosado. Both were on fire with indignation at the colonialist treatment
that Puerto Rico received at the hands of the United States (treatment
which continues today). They wanted to demonstrate this indignation in
some dramatic way. Their lack of practical political experience made
them easy prey for González Malavé. He persuaded them that a noble act
for their homeland would be to destroy some communications towers on the
top of a hill called "Cerro Maravilla." This was supposed to express
solidarity with some imprisoned Puerto Rican independence fighters. The
three kidnapped a taxi driver and forced him to drive them up to Cerro
Maravilla. But when they arrived, they found they had been led into a
police ambush. As the armed police approached, González Malavé
identified himself as an agent, but Soto and Rosado were killed, and the
"official" story was put out that they had been shot in a firefight with
the cops. The right-wing, pro-statehood governor at the time, Carlos
Romero Barceló, hailed the police as heroes, and the FBI helpfully
pitched in to support the Puerto Rican Justice Department with the
cover-up. However, the police had left a "loose end," namely the taxi
driver, who spoke to the press and revealed that in fact González Malavé
was a police agent and that the two young men were still alive when he
left the place. The police had entrapped the two men, then murdered them
after they surrendered. This became a big scandal, and eventually led to
prosecutions and the defeat of Romero Barceló's party in the next
elections. But the use of agents provocateurs to divide and isolate the
Puerto Rican left has been unrelenting, both before and after that
incident. Disrupting today's movements Such **[agent
provocateur]{.underline}** [tactics]{.underline} [surfaced]{.underline}
again [during the protests against the **[Iraq
War]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [and in]{.underline} the
"**[[Occupy]{.underline}]{.mark}**" movement. [In each case, glib
charismatic strangers wormed their way into protest organizations, and
then entrapped inexperienced young radicals to get involved in plans,
which were sometimes really just talk, to engage in
violence]{.underline}. A typical case is that of the "[Cleveland bomb
plot](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/02/nation/la-na-nn-fbi-stings-20120502)"
of 2012. Another is the San Francisco [Mission District
riot](https://missionlocal.org/2012/05/occupysf-reacts-to-monday-nights-destruction-of-valencia/)
of May 2012, when a mysterious black-clad contingent hijacked part of a
peaceful "Occupy" demonstration and turned it toward random violence. In
both cases, [the purpose of the provocateurs was to discredit the
movement in the eyes of the public, which otherwise might have been
receptive to Occupy's "99 percent versus one percent"
message]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} kind of
**[manipulation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [still
[continues]{.mark}]{.underline} by all accounts. [As before, the purpose
is to discredit the movement, divide it, deprive it of allies, and set
up leaders and organizations for repressive action while making sure
that this repression will not produce a wave of public
indignation]{.underline}, as happened with the Cerro Maravilla case. The
right and the ruling class always try to portray these people's
movements as violent, because this is the alchemy best suited to turn
public opinion against them. This is the main lesson to be learned from
the agent provocateur experiences of the past. In the conditions of our
country today, [injecting violent tactics into the mass movement of
protest undermines that movement and plays the enemy's
game]{.underline}. Loose talk about violence can be just as dangerous.
This danger is multiplied by the development of online communications
and social media---there are no secrets now. Hijacking other people's
protest actions to "move them to a higher level," meaning toward violent
confrontations, is really a dirty kind of pseudo-left politics. What is
needed now is to build the movement into a great wave of rejection
against the reactionary policies of the ruling class, the right, and the
Trump administration and its allies. Let us work on that basis and avoid
tactics that undermine it.

theorist, "Cruel Optimism," 2011)//Townes

Yet **[Bush's wish to skirt the filter]{.underline}** [points to
something profound]{.underline} in the desire for the political. [**He
wants to transmit** not the message but **the noise.**]{.underline}
**[He wants the public to feel the funk]{.underline}**, [the live
**intensities**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[desires]{.underline}**
[that make **messages affectively immediate**]{.underline}, seductive,
and binding.3 In his head a [public's binding to the political is best
achieved]{.underline} neither [by]{.underline} policy nor ideology but
**[the affect of feeling political together]{.underline}**, an effect of
having communicated true feeling without the distancing mediation of
speech.4 The transmission of noise performs political attachment as a
sustaining intimate relation, without which great dramas of betrayal are
felt and staged. In The Ethical Soundscape, Charles Hirschkind talks
about the role of "maieutic listening" in constructing the intimate
political publics of Egypt.5 There, the feeling tones of the affective
soundscape produce attachments to and investments in a sense of
political and social mutuality that is performed in moments of
collective audition. [This process involves taking on listening together
as itself an object/scene of desire]{.underline}. The attainment of that
attunement produces a sense of shared worldness, apart from whatever aim
or claim the listening public might later bring to a particular
political world because of what they have heard.

From Hirschkind's perspective [**the social circulation of noise, of
affective binding**, converts the world to a **space of moral action**
that seems juxtapolitical---proximate to, **without being compromised
by**, the **instrumentalities of power** that **govern** social
**life**]{.underline}.6 Speaking above the filter would
**[confirm]{.underline}** to Bush's whole listening audience that they
already share an **[affective environment]{.underline}**;
[mobilizing]{.underline} "the ethical and **[therapeutic
virtues]{.underline}** of the ear"7 would accomplish the visceral
transmission of his assurance not only that he has made a better good
life possible for Americans and humans around the globe, but that,
affectively speaking, there is already a better sensorial world right
here, right now, more intimate and secure and just as real as the world
made by the media's anxiogenic sensationalist analysis. [This vision
locates]{.underline} the [desire for the political in]{.underline} an
**[alternative commons]{.underline}** in the present that the senses
confirm and circulate as though without mediation.

What exactly is the problem with "the filter"? The contemporary filtered
or mediated political sphere in the United States transmits news 24/7
from a new ordinary created by crisis, in which life seems reduced to
discussions about tactics for survival and who is to blame. The filter
tells you that the public has entered a historical situation whose
contours it does not know. It impresses itself upon mass consciousness
as an epochal crisis, unfolding like a disaster film made up of human-
interest stories and stories about institutions that have lost their
way.8 It is a moment on the verge of a postnormative phase, in which
fantasmatic clarities about the conditions for enduring collectivity,
historical continuity, and infrastructural stability have melted away,
along with predictable relations between event and effect.

**[Living amidst war and environmental disaster]{.underline}**, [people
are shown constantly being surprised at what does and does not seem to
have a transformative impact]{.underline}. Living amid economic crisis,
people are shown constantly being surprised at the amount, location, and
enormity of moral and affective irregulation that come from fading rules
of accountability and recognition. What will govern the terms and
relations of reliable reciprocity among governments, intimates, workers,
owners, churches, citizens, political parties, or strangers? [What forms
of life will secure the sense of affective democracy that people have
been educated to expect from their publics?]{.underline} Nobody knows.
The news about the recent past and the pressures of the near future
demand constant emergency cleanup and hyperspeculation about what it
means to live in the ongoing present among piles of cases where things
didn't work out or seem to make sense, at least not yet. There are
vigils; there is witnessing, testimony, and yelling. But there is not
yet a consensual rubric that would shape these matters into an event.
[The affective structure of the situation is therefore anxious and the
political emotions attached to it veer wildly from recognition of the
enigma that is clearly there to explanations that make sense, the kind
of satisfying sense that enables enduring.]{.underline}

[Uncertainty is the material that Bush wished to bracket]{.underline}.
[His desire for]{.underline} a politics of **[ambient
noise]{.underline}**, prepropositional transmission, and intuitive
reciprocity [sought to displace]{.underline} the filtered story of
**[instability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[contradiction]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the center of
**[sociality]{.underline}**. He also wishfully [banished]{.underline}
**[self- reflexive,]{.underline}** cultivated **[opinion]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[judgment]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} their
central **[public- sphere function]{.underline}**. In short, as Jacques
Rancière would put it, **[Bush's]{.underline}** wishful
**[feeling]{.underline}** [was to separate **the political from
politics**]{.underline} as such.9 In so doing he would cast the ongoing
activity of social antagonism to the realm of the epiphenomenal, in
contrast to which the affective feedback loop of the political would
make stronger the true soul- to- soul continuity between politicians and
their public. Foucault used to call "sexuality" that noisy affectivity
that Bush wanted to transmit from mouth to ear, heart to heart, gut to
gut.10 From his perspective, at least, the political is best lodged in
the appetites.

These are not politically tendentious observations. Perhaps when Bush
uttered his desire for affective communication to be the medium of the
political, [he was trying cynically to distract]{.underline} **[the
public gaze from some of his particular actions]{.underline}**. But the
wish to inhabit a vaguely warm sense of alreadyestablished, autonomic,
and atmospheric solidarity with the body politic is hardly his special
desire. Indeed, in his preference for the noise of immediacy, he has
many bedfellows in the body politic with whom he shares little else
politically, namely, the ones who prefer political meetings in town
halls, caucuses, demonstrations, and other intimate assemblies to the
pleasure of disembodied migratory identification that constitutes mass
publics. He also joins his antagonists in the nondominant classes who
have long produced [**intimate publics** to **provide** the **feeling**
of **immediacy** and **solidarity** by **establishing** in the **public
sphere** an **affective register of belonging** to inhabit **when there
are few adequate normative institutions to fall back on, rest in, or
return to.**]{.underline}

Public spheres are always affect worlds, worlds to which people are
bound, when they are, by affective projections of a constantly
negotiated common interestedness. But an intimate public is more
specific. In an intimate public one senses that matters of survival are
at stake and that collective mediation through narration and audition
might provide some routes out of the impasse and the struggle of the
present, or at least some sense that there would be recognition were the
participants in the room together.11 **[An intimate public promises the
sense of being held in its penumbra]{.underline}**. [You **do not need**
to audition for **membership**]{.underline} in it. Minimally, **[you
need just to perform]{.underline}** audition, to listen and to be
interested in the scene's visceral impact.12 You might have been drawn
to it because of a curiosity about something minor, unassociated with
catastrophe, like knitting or collecting something, or having a certain
kind of sexuality, only after which it became a community of support,
offering tones of suffering, humor, and cheerleading. Perhaps an illness
led to seeking out a community of survival tacticians. In either case,
[any person can **contribute** to an intimate public a personal **story
about not being defeated by what is overwhelming**]{.underline}. More
likely, though, participants take things in and sometimes circulate what
they hear, captioning them with opinion or wonder. But they do not have
to do anything to belong. They can be passive and lurk, deciding when to
appear and disappear, and consider the freedom to come and go the
exercise of sovereign freedom.

Indeed, in liberal societies, **[freedom includes freedom from the
obligation to pay attention]{.underline}** to much, whether personal or
political---**[no- one is obliged to be]{.underline}** conscious or
socially **[active]{.underline}** in their modes and scenes of
belonging. For many this means that political attention is usually
something delegated and [politics is]{.underline} something
**[overheard]{.underline}**, [encountered]{.underline}
**[indirectly]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[unsystematically]{.underline}**, [through]{.underline} a kind of
**[communication]{.underline}** more **[akin to gossip]{.underline}**
than to cultivated rationality.13 But there is nothing fundamentally
passive or superficial in overhearing the political. What hits a person
encountering the dissemination of news about power has nothing to do
with how thorough or cultivated their knowledge is or how they integrate
the impact into living. Amidst all of the chaos, crisis, and injustice
in front of us, [the **desire** for **alternative filters** that
**produce** the sense---if not the **scene**---of a more **livable** and
intimate **sociality** is **another** **name** for the desire for the
**political**.]{.underline}

This is why an **[intimate attachment to the political can amount to a
relation of cruel optimism]{.underline}**. [I have argued throughout
this book that an **optimistic attachment** is **cruel** when the
**object/scene of desire** is itself an **obstacle** to **fulfilling**
the very **wants** that bring people to it: but its **life- organizing
status** can trump **interfering** with the **damage** it
**provokes**.]{.underline} It may be a relation of cruel optimism, when,
despite an awareness that the normative political sphere appears as a
shrunken, broken, or distant place of activity among elites, members of
the body politic return periodically to its recommitment ceremonies and
scenes. Voting is one thing; collective caring, listening, and scanning
the airwaves, are others. [All of these **modes of orientation** and
having a feeling about it confirm our **attachment** to the **system**
and thereby **confirm** the **system** and the **legitimacy** of the
**affects** that make one feel bound to it, even if the **manifest**
content of the binding has the **negative** force of **cynicism** or the
dark **attenuation** of **political depression**.]{.underline}

How and why does this attachment persist? Is it out of habit? Is it in
hopes of the potentiality embedded in the political as such? Or, from a
stance of critical engagement, an investment in the possibility of its
repair? The exhausting repetition of the politically depressed position
that seeks repair of what may be constitutively broken can eventually
split the activity of optimism from expectation and demand.14
Maintaining this split enables one to sustain one's attachment to the
political as such and to one's sense of membership in the idea of the
polity, which is a virtual---but sensual, not abstract---space of the
commons. And so, detaching from it could induce many potential losses
along with new freedoms.

Grant Farred calls **[fidelity to the political without expectation of
recognition]{.underline}**, representation, or return a profoundly
ethical act.15 His exemplary case [derives from]{.underline} voting
patterns of African Americans in the 2004 presidential election, but the
anxiety about the costs of this ethical commitment has only increased
with the election of Barack **[Obama]{.underline}** [as the]{.underline}
**[President of the emotional infrastructure]{.underline}** of the
United States as well as of its governing and administrative ones.16
What is the relation between the "**[Yes We Can!"]{.underline}**
optimism for the political and how politics actually works? What is the
[effect]{.underline} of Obama's optimization of political optimism
against the political depression of the historically disappointed,
especially given any President's limited sovereignty as a transformative
agent in ordinary life? How can we track the divergences between
politically orchestrated emotions and their affective environments?
Traditionally, political solidarity is a more of a structure than a
feeling---an identification with other people who are similarly
committed to a project that does not require affective continuity or
warm personal feeling to sustain itself. But maintaining solidarity
requires skills for adjudicating incommensurate visions of the better
good life. [The atrophy of these skills is at risk when politics is
reduced to the demand for affective attunement, insofar as the sense of
belonging is threatened by the inconvenience of antagonistic
aims]{.underline}. Add to this the possibility that **["the political"
as we know it in mass democracy requires such a splitting of attachment
and expectation]{.underline}**. [**Splitting** off political **optimism
from the way things** are **can sustain** many kinds of the **cruelest
optimism.**]{.underline}

#### Objectivity in debate is good:

#### Ks of objectivity present themselves as objectively true -- this offense links to them

#### It creates the best model of debate -- it forces detachment which creates a safer space for minority debaters to present the facts of their existence AND means we have to evaluate the implications of our ethical paradigms -- appealing to non-objective outcomes means people agree with the War on Terror while objectivity and testing mean we can see its inevitable violent conclusions

DEBATING MEETS DEMAND-DRIVEN RHETORIC OF SCIENCE")

. [Public policy [planners are tested]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in
like manner [[when they]{.mark} attempt to [stitch
together]{.mark}]{.underline} institutional [[arguments from
various]{.mark} and sundry [inputs]{.mark}]{.underline} ranging from
expert testimony, to historical precedent, to public comment. Just as
intelligence managers find that [algorithmic, [formal methods]{.mark} of
analysis [often don't work]{.mark} when it comes to the task of
interpreting and synthesizing copious amounts of disparate
data]{.underline}, public-policy planners encounter similar challenges.
[In fact, [the argumentative turn]{.mark}]{.underline} in public-policy
planning elaborates an approach to public-policy analysis that
[[foregrounds]{.mark}]{.underline} deliberative interchange and critical
thinking as [[alternatives to]{.mark} "decisionism," the
[formulaic]{.mark} application of "objective" decision
[algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline} to the public policy process. Stating
the matter plainly, Majone suggests, "whether in written or oral form,
[argument is central in all stages of the policy process]{.underline}."
Accordingly, he notes, "[[we miss a great deal if we]{.mark} try to
[understand policy]{.mark}-making **[solely in terms of power]{.mark}**,
influence, and bargaining, [to the exclusion of]{.mark} debate and
[argument]{.mark}]{.underline}."51 One can see similar rationales
driving Goodwin and Davis's EPA debating project, where debaters are
invited to conduct on-site public debates covering resolutions craft ed
to reflect key points of stasis in the EPA decision-making process. [For
example, [in the 2008 Water]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Wars
[[debates]{.mark} held [at EPA]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}headquarters in Washington, D.C., [[resolutions were
crafted]{.underline}]{.mark} to focus attention on the topic of water
pollution, with one resolution focusing on downstream states' authority
to control upstream states' discharges and sources of pollutants, and a
second resolution exploring the policy merits of bottled water and
toilet paper taxes as revenue sources to fund water infrastructure
projects. In the first debate on interstate river pollution, the team of
Seth [Gannon and]{.underline} [Seungwon]{.underline} [Chung]{.underline}
from [Wake]{.underline} Forest University argued in favor of downstream
state control, with the [Michigan State]{.underline} University team of
Carly [Wunderlich]{.underline} and Garrett [Abelkop]{.underline}
providing opposition. In the second debate on taxation policy, Kevin
[Kallmyer and]{.underline} Matthew Struth from University of Mary
Washington [defended taxes on bottled water and toilet
paper,]{.underline} while their opponents from Howard University,
[Dominique Scott and Jarred McKee, argued]{.underline} against this
proposal. Reflecting on the project, Goodwin noted how [the
intercollegiate]{.underline} Switch-Side Debating Meets Demand-Driven
Rhetoric of Science 107 [debaters' ability to act as "honest brokers" in
the policy arguments contributed positively to internal EPA
deliberation]{.underline} on both issues.52 Davis observed that since
the invited debaters "didn't have a dog in the fight," they were able to
give voice to previously buried arguments that some EPA subject matter
experts felt reticent to elucidate because of their institutional
affiliations.53 [Such findings are consistent with the views of policy
analysts advocating the argumentative turn in policy
planning]{.underline}. As Majone claims, "[[Dialectical
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark} between generalists and experts
[[often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions]{.mark},
conflicting interpretations of the facts, [and]{.mark} the
[risks]{.mark} posed by new projects]{.underline}."54 Frank Fischer goes
even further in this context, explicitly appropriating rhetorical
scholar Charles Willard's concept of argumentative "epistemics" to flesh
out his vision for policy studies: Uncovering the epistemic dynamics of
public controversies would allow for a more enlightened understanding of
what is at stake in a particular dispute, making possible a
sophisticated evaluation of the various viewpoints and merits of
different policy options. In so doing, the differing, oft en tacitly
held contextual perspectives and values could be juxtaposed; the
viewpoints and demands of experts, special interest groups, and the
wider public could be directly compared; and the dynamics among the
participants could be scrutizined. [This would by no means sideline or
even exclude scientific assessment; it would only situate it within the
framework of a more comprehensive evaluation.]{.underline}55 As Davis
notes, institutional constraints present within the EPA communicative
milieu can complicate eff orts to provide a full airing of all relevant
arguments pertaining to a given regulatory issue. Thus, [intercollegiate
[debaters can play key roles]{.mark} in retrieving and [amplifying
positions that might **otherwise remain sedimented** in]{.mark} the
[policy]{.mark} process]{.underline}. The dynamics entailed in this
symbiotic relationship are underscored by deliberative planner John
Forester, who observes, "If planners and public administrators are to
make democratic political debate and argument possible, they will need
strategically located allies to avoid being fully thwarted by the
characteristic self-protecting behaviors of the planning organizations
and bureaucracies within which they work."56 Here, an institution's need
for "strategically located allies" to support deliberative practice
constitutes the demand for rhetorically informed expertise, setting up
what can be considered a demand-driven rhetoric of science. As an
instance of rhetoric of science scholarship, this type of "switch-side
public 108 Rhetoric & Public Affairs debate" differs both from insular
contest tournament debating, where the main focus is on the pedagogical
benefit for student participants, and first-generation rhetoric of
science scholarship, where critics concentrated on unmasking the
rhetoricity of scientific artifacts circulating in what many perceived
to be purely technical spheres of knowledge production.58 As a form of
demand-driven rhetoric of science, [switch-side debating connects
directly with the communication field's performative tradition of
argumentative engagement]{.underline} in public controversy---[a
different route]{.underline} of theoretical grounding [than rhetorical
criticism's tendency to locate its foundations in]{.underline} the
English field's tradition of [literary criticism and textual
analysis]{.underline}.59 Given this genealogy, it is not surprising to
learn how Davis's response to the EPA's institutional need for
rhetorical expertise took the form of a public debate proposal, shaped
by Davis's dual background as a practitioner and historian of
intercollegiate debate. Davis competed as an undergraduate policy
debater for Howard University in the 1970s, and then went on to enjoy
substantial success as coach of the Howard team in the new millennium.
In an essay reviewing the broad sweep of debating history, Davis notes,
"Academic debate began at least 2,400 years ago when the scholar
Protagoras of Abdera (481--411 bc), known as the father of debate,
conducted debates among his students in Athens."60 As John Poulakos
points out, "older" [[Sophists]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Protagoras
[[taught]{.mark} Greek students [the value of dissoi logoi, or **pulling
apart complex questions by debating two sides**]{.mark} of an
issue]{.underline}.61 The few surviving fragments of Protagoras's work
suggest that his notion of dissoi logoi stood for the principle that
"two accounts \[logoi\] are present about every 'thing,' opposed to each
other," and further, that humans could "measure" the relative soundness
of knowledge claims by engaging in give-and-take where parties would
make the "weaker argument stronger" to activate the generative aspect of
rhetorical practice, a key element of the Sophistical tradition.62
Following in Protagoras's wake, Isocrates would complement this
centrifugal push with the pull of synerchesthe, a centripetal exercise
of "coming together" deliberatively to listen, respond, and form common
social bonds.63 Isocrates incorporated Protagorean dissoi logoi into
synerchesthe, a broader concept that he used flexibly to express
interlocking senses of (1) inquiry, as in groups convening to search for
answers to common questions through discussion;64 (2) deliberation, with
interlocutors gathering in a political setting to deliberate about
proposed courses of action;65 and (3) alliance formation, a form of
collective action typical at festivals,66 or in the exchange of pledges
that deepen social ties.67 Switch-Side Debating Meets Demand-Driven
Rhetoric of Science 109 Returning once again to the Kettering-informed
sharp distinction between debate and deliberation, [one sees
in]{.underline} Isocratic [synerchesthe,]{.underline} as well as in the
EPA debating initiative, a [fusion of debate with deliberative
functions]{.underline}. Echoing a theme raised in this essay's earlier
discussion of intelligence tradecraft , such a fusion troubles
categorical attempts to classify debate and deliberation as
fundamentally opposed activities. Th e significance of such a finding is
amplified by the frequency of attempts in the deliberative democracy
literature to insist on the theoretical bifurcation of debate and
deliberation as an article of theoretical faith. [Tandem analysis
of]{.underline} the EPA and intelligence community [debating initiatives
also brings to light]{.underline} dimensions of contrast at the third
level of Isocratic synerchesthe, alliance formation. Th e intelligence
community's Analytic Outreach initiative invites largely one-way
communication flowing from outside experts into the black box of
classified intelligence analysis. On the contrary, the EPA debating
program gestures toward a more expansive project of [deliberative
alliance building]{.underline}. In this vein, Howard University's
participation in the 2008 EPA Water Wars debates can be seen as the
harbinger of a trend by historically black colleges and universities
(hbcus) to catalyze their debate programs in a strategy that evinces
Davis's dual-focus vision. On the one hand, Davis aims to recuperate
Wiley College's tradition of competitive excellence in intercollegiate
debate, depicted so powerfully in the feature film The Great Debaters,
by starting a wave of new debate programs housed in hbcus across the
nation.68 On the other hand, Davis sees potential for these new programs
to complement their competitive debate programming with participation in
the EPA's public debating initiative. Th is dual-focus vision recalls
Douglas Ehninger's and Wayne Brockriede's vision of "total" debate
programs that blend switch-side intercollegiate tournament debating with
forms of public debate designed to contribute to wider communities
beyond the tournament setting.69 Whereas the political telos animating
Davis's dual-focus vision certainly embraces background assumptions that
Greene and Hicks would find disconcerting---notions of liberal political
agency, the idea of debate using "words as weapons"70---there is little
doubt that the project of pursuing environmental protection by tapping
the creative energy of hbcu-leveraged dissoi logoi differs significantly
from the intelligence community's eff ort to improve its tradecraft
through online digital debate programming. Such diff erence is
especially evident in light of the EPA's commitment to extend debates to
public realms, with the attendant possible benefits unpacked by Jane
Munksgaard and Damien Pfister: 110 Rhetoric & Public Affairs [[Having
a]{.mark} public [debater argue **against their

[Arthur [**Kroker** suggests]{.mark} that the genetic engineering of the
"codes" of life in humans and other organic resources, at one end, and
the monitoring, surveillance and precision targeting of the global
population in space-based network warfare through full spectrum global
dominance at the other, represent the two extremes of [this way of being
in the world]{.mark}]{.underline} (legitimated in terms of "openness" of
scientific inquiry and "security" of individuals and the species). Here
life itself is pictured as both a network and an object of manipulation
and control by informational technologies. Human nature and the
environment are absorbed into culture, and so culture/nature is pictured
as a kind of standing reserve of manipulable networks. \[21\] \[22\]
[This is not a form of subjectivity and intersubjectivity that a person
bears in one particular role among many. It [is a **communicative
habitus** that **communicators**]{.mark} tend to [**operate within** at
**work and leisure**]{.mark}, on the home computer, the cell phone, the
wireless laptop, and the BlackBerry. When networkers put these more
interactive modes of communication down, they tend to turn to the
technology of the communication of "affects": radio, television, movies
and videos. As a result, this worldview and skill set is carried into
other areas of life, either colonizing them or disregarding them if they
are inaccessible through the network technology]{.underline}. [[The form
of subjectivity]{.mark} and intersubjectivity of network communicators
[is not an ideology]{.mark} or a worldview in the traditional sense. [It
is rather the opposite: a mode of being that is **skilled in**]{.mark}
and accustomed to **["worldviewing" --- surfing through]{.mark},
interacting with [and negotiating a kaleidoscope of shifting
ideologies]{.mark}** and worldviews. [Secular modernists]{.mark},
western [scientists]{.mark}, indigenous peoples, [neo-liberals]{.mark},

hyper-globalisers, [deep ecologists]{.mark}, apocalyptic religious
fundamentalists in the Bush administration and Bin Laden terrorist
networks [are all]{.mark} at home [in this habitat]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Yet, it is not a neutral, all-inclusive medium of communication. It
substantially modifies the pre-network forms of subjectivity it
includes, transforming them into contingent and malleable worldviews,
civilizations, codes, programs, and "scapes", [[yet, **paradoxically,
placing beyond question its own background horizon of disclosure of the
world as a complex system of**]{.mark} **contingent and [programmable
networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This taken-for-granted form of
subjectification tends to come with the network and goes without saying.
It is the characteristic form of subjectivity of network imperialism. We
are just beginning to study and make explicit the tacit ways
communication networks are re-organizing human subjectivity. Boaventura
de Sousa Santos and other [critical sociologists of network
communication and control argue that the net brings with it, in tandem
with programmability, other taken-for-granted ways of organizing and
imagining experience, privileging certain forms of communication,
communicative rationality, knowledge, problem solving, cooperation and
competition]{.underline}, and production and consumption, and
discounting or excluding others.\[23\] [Finally, [although this is a
powerful]{.mark} new [form of]{.mark} subjectivity and [social ordering,
it is one form among many that we bear as modern subjects, and **we are
not passive recipients of it**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as we will see in
section 3).

It is not just my opinion, or yours]{.underline}. But of course it may
not be true. [Or it may be partially true - in which case it absolutely

all. [Defenders of]{.mark} **absolute [truth]{.mark}** [are not]{.mark}
necessarily **[dogmatists]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In any case,
[dogmatism does just not mean thumping the table with one hand and

means refusing to give grounds for your beliefs, appealing instead
simply to authority. [There are plenty of courteous, soft-spoken

and argument, and **[refusing]{.mark}** in any circumstances [to]{.mark}
[**concede**]{.mark} that [you are **mistaken**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Those who believe in absolute truth may]{.underline}]{.mark} [well
[be]{.mark} the kind of people who are [pathologically cautious about
**accepting anything as true**]{.mark} unless it seems **plainly

scepticism and a miasma of doubt. [It is just]{.underline} that [when
they do]{.underline}, **[perhaps once every decade or so]{.underline}**,
[come grudgingly to accept a proposition such as 'The head gardener has
just shot himself through the foot' as true, they recognize that its
opposite cannot also be true]{.underline}, [and that its **being true
for them means** its being **true for everyone else as
well**.]{.underline} [Nor does 'absolutely true' mean true independently
of any context. We can only judge the world from within some kind of
framework]{.underline}. But this does not necessarily mean that what is
true from one viewpoint is false from another. [Elephants may be sacred
for you but not for me, if this represents a difference between our ways
of signifying them]{.underline}. **[But it cannot be true that elephants
really are sacred,]{.underline}** [in the same way that they really have
four legs]{.underline}, and that they are in the same sense not sacred.
[Cultures make sense of the world in different ways]{.underline}, [and
what some see as a fact others do not]{.underline}; **[but if truth
simply means truth-for-us]{.underline}**, **[then there can be no
conflict between us and other cultures]{.underline}**, since truth is
equally just truth-for-them. [This is tolerable enough when it comes to
the sacred status of elephants, as well as being extremely convenient
for us if we hold that forcing sexual relations on toddlers contributes
to their emotional well-being and psychological stability in later
years, and the culture next door does not]{.underline}. Since their view
is entirely relative to their own way of life, [it can naturally have no
effect on our behaviour.]{.underline} In any case, [if each cultural
framework constructs the world differently enough, it is hard to see how
they could share the same proposition in common. A different world
yields a different meaning. **Absolute truth has nothing to do with
fanaticism.**]{.underline} It does not necessarily mean the kind of
truth to which you are fervently committed. 'Erlangen is in Germany' is
absolutely true, but one would not go to one's death for it. [It is not
the kind of truth which sets the blood coursing and quickens the
heartbeat]{.underline}. **[It does not have the same emotional force as
'You strangled my great-aunt, you despicable bastard!]{.underline}**'
**[[Most absolute truths are pretty trivial]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Much
the same goes for the word 'absolute' when used in some moral discourse.
For Thomas Aquinas, '**[absolutely]{.underline}** wrong' [does not
necessarily mean '**very, very wrong'**]{.underline}. The word
'**[[absolute']{.mark} here [is not an
intensifier]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [It just means 'shouldn't
be done under any circumstances']{.underline}. Aquinas thought rather
strangely that lying was absolutely wrong, but not killing; but he did
not of course believe that lying was always more grievous an offence
than killing. Being of reasonable intelligence, he appreciated well
enough that lying is sometimes pretty harmless. It was just that for him
it was absolutely wrong. **[[Absolute truth is not]{.mark} truth
[removed from time]{.mark} and change]{.underline}**. Things that are
true at one time can cease to be true at another, or new truths can
emerge. [The claim that some truth is absolute is a claim about what it
means to call something true, not a denial that there are different
truths at different times]{.underline}. [Absolute truth does not mean
non-historical truth: it does not mean the kind of truths which drop
from the sky]{.underline}, [or which are vouchsafed to us by some bogus
prophet from Utah]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[they are]{.mark}
truths which are [discovered by **argument, evidence, experiment,
investigation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A lot of what is taken
as]{.mark} (absolutely) [true]{.mark} at any given time [will]{.mark} no

watertight scientific hypotheses have turned out to be full of
holes]{.underline}**. [Not everything which is considered to be true is
actually true. But it remains the case that it cannot just be raining
from my viewpoint.]{.underline} Why does any of this matter? It matters,
for one thing, because it belongs to our dignity as moderately rational
creatures to know the truth. And that includes knowing the truth about
truth. It is best not to be deceived if we can possibly help it. But it
also matters because a ludicrous bugbear has been made of the word
\'absolute\' in this context; and because if the relativist is right,
then truth is emptied of much of its value. As Bernard Williams points
out, **[relativism is really a way of explaining away
conflict]{.underline}**.2 [If you maintain that democracy means everyone

#### The imagination and debate over competing words is artistic, playful, and scholarly simultaneously. 

**Chia, 96.** (Robert Chia, University of Stirling. "The Problem of
Reflexivity in Organizational Research: Towards a Postmodern Science of
Organization" Organization, Volume 3, No. 1, February. SAGE Journals.
Online.)

One more recent development in organizational theorizing results from
taking the problem of reflexivity seriously. Such organizational writers
accept that both their own accounts and those generated by others are
first and foremost linguistic constructions which operate according to
established conventional linguistic codes. Theories of organization are
deemed to be self-­justifying \'intelligible narratives\' which enable a
community of inquirers to arrive at some consensus regarding their
social experiences. As Gergen (1992) puts it: If there is one theme that
unites most of those confronting the postmodern irony, it is a **certain
sense of ludic humility. The view of knowledge‑making as a
transcendental pursuit removed from the trivial enthralments of daily
life, pristinely rational and transparently virtuous**, becomes so much
puffery. We should view these bodies of language we call knowledge in a
lighter vein‑as ways of putting things together, some pretty and others
petty. (Gergen, 1992: 215) **[Hence, \'irony\', \'self‑reflection\' and
\'playful seriousness\' replace the rational quest for \'certain\' or
even \'partially true\' knowledge of an external organizational reality.
For these \'meta­reflexive\' theorists, both the bodyof‑knowledge claims
in organization theory and their own claims are to be understood in a
lighter vein as artistically crafted pieces of work in their own right.
Theories generated mirror the concerns and preoccupations of the
theorists themselves and do not, as such, claim any absolute, groun­ded
connexion with a reality beyond. Such writers would argue that these
crafted pieces of \'linguistic web\' contribute to the making of our
organizational reality.]{.underline}**

JM: One of the things that I think is interesting about [the approach
is]{.underline} that it [is both concerned with the **creative
limitations** required for **producing an event**, and also **concerned
with how various events resonate with each other and amplify each
other**]{.underline}. This seems to bring us back to the problem we
discussed earlier regarding how [an affective politics may have a global
presence, or work up to a scale larger than a single event.]{.underline}
BM: Yes, [a micropolitical event can have broad range. What qualifies it
as micropolitical is the way it happens, not the dimensions it takes. By
micropolitical we mean returning to the generative moment of experience,
at the dawning of an event, to produce a modulatory commotion internal
to the constitution of the event. **It's a question of reconnecting
processually with what's germinal in your living, with the conditions of
emergence of the situations you live**]{.underline}. [The idea is then
to find a mechanism to pass that reconnection forward. Not impose it,
not even suggest it as a general model. **Rather, to give it as a gift,
a gift of self- renewing process**]{.underline}. [This question of
event-propagation, of processual seeding as part of a gift economy of
revivifying experience, is the problem of a large-scale
micropolitics]{.underline}. The process itself has to be
self-valorizing. It has to have a value in itself because the situation
of the world, Obama notwithstanding, is not overall one of hope. **[The
situation of the world is desperate. There's no rational ground for
hope]{.underline}**. [If you look at things rationally, if you look at
the increasing disparities of wealth and health in the world, if you
look at the spreading environmental destruction, if you look at the
looming disasters in the foundations of the economy, if you look at the
the energy crisis and the food crises affecting the globe, and
especially if you look at the way they interrelate, if you look at the
virulence of renascent nationalist sentiment and of the culture of war,
**there is no hope**]{.underline}. So **[the micropolitical question is
how to live more intensely, live more fully, with augmented powers of
existence, within the limits of that desperate situation, while finding
ways to continue nevertheless, chipping away at the macro
problems]{.underline}**. [There's a certain incompleteness to any
micropolitical event]{.underline}, like the events I was talking about.
A lot of things that you feel were on the verge of taking shape didn't
quite happen. Potentials that you could just glimpse didn't come into
focus. [The goal is not to overcome the incompleteness. It's to **make
it compelling**. **Compelling enough that you are moved to do it again,
differently, bringing out another set of potentials, some more formed
and focused, others that were clearly expressed before now
backgrounded**]{.underline}. That creates a small, moveable environment
of potential. **[The goal is to live in that moveable environment of
potential]{.underline}**. [If you manage to, you will **avoid the
paralysis of hopelessness**]{.underline}. **[Neither hope nor
hopelessness---a pragmatics of potential]{.underline}**. [You have to
live it at every level. In the way you relate to your partner, and even
your cat. The way you teach a class if you're a professor. The way you
create and present your art if you're an artist. If you participate in
more punctual events like the ones I was describing, this will provide a
continuous background for what comes of those events to disseminate into
and diffuse through. **A symbiosis of the special event and the
day-to-day, in creative connivance. This is not to say that operating in
a more macro, top-down manner, is wrong or should not be undertaken.
It's just to say that if it's done to the exclusion of micropolitical
activity it's mortifying, even when it's done for survival's
sake**]{.underline}. [Sometimes there is no alternative but to centrally
impose certain enabling constraints. For example, I'd be very happy if
the transition to a renewable energy future or a global redistribution
of wealth or a non-growth paradigm were imposed on the capitalist
system]{.underline}. But **[high-level solutions of that kind are only
part of the political equation, and it's not the part that the affective
politics we've been talking about specifically addresses]{.underline}**.
**[Micropolitics is not programmatic]{.underline}**. **[It doesn't
construct and impose global solutions]{.underline}**. But [it would be
naïve to think that is separate from that kind of
macro-activity]{.underline}. [Anything that augments powers of existence
creates conditions for micropolitical flourishings. No body flourishes
without enough food and without health care. Micropolitical
interventions need macro solutions. But **success at the macropolitical
level is at best partial without a complementary micropolitical
flourishing**]{.underline}. **[Without it, the tendency is toward
standardization]{.underline}**. **[Since macropolitical solutions are
generally applicable by definition, by definition they act to curtail
the variety and exuberance of forms of life]{.underline}**.
[Macropolitical intervention targets minimal conditions of survival.
**Micropolitics complements that by fostering an excess of conditions of
emergence**]{.underline}. **[That inventiveness is where new solutions
start to crystallize]{.underline}**. The potentials produced at the
micropolitical level feed up, climbing the slope that macropolitics
descends. **[Micropolitical and macropolitical go
together]{.underline}**. One is never without the other. They are
processual reciprocals. They aliment each other. [At their best, they
are mutually corrective. Even macro solutions designed to curtail
micropolitical activity often end up feeding it by making it a necessity
to invent new ways of getting by and getting around. **Creative
variation is the only real constant of politics**]{.underline}. Deleuze
and Guattari often made this point, for example in their slogan that
that [the State is built on what escapes it. It has become a commonplace
recently to say that we are in a situation where the end of the world is
now imaginable---but the end of capitalism isn't. That is definitely one
"solution" that is not likely to come programmatically, top-down---
**given who's on top**]{.underline}. The dismantling of capitalism is a
"corrective" that will only come from a breaking of the reciprocity I
was just talking about between the macro- and micropolitical. [The
prevailing operating conditions of macro/micropolitical reciprocity
should not be taken to imply that the symmetry is never broken, that a
bifurcation can never occur. The complementarity can be broken in both
directions. When **macrostructures miniaturize themselves and work to
usurp the ground of the micropolitical with scaled-down versions of the
dominant generalities, that is fascism**]{.underline}. **[When
micropolitical flourishings proliferate to produce a singularity, in the
sense of a systemic tipping point, that's revolution]{.underline}**.
**[The ultimate vocation of micropolitics is this: enacting the
unimaginable]{.underline}**. [The **symmetry-breaking point**, the
**point at which the unimaginable eventuates**, is but **a cut**,
"**smaller**" than the smallest historically perceivable
interval]{.underline}. That is to say, qualitatively different. **[A
moment of a different color, one you never see coming, that comes when
it's least expected]{.underline}**. Inevitably, [a next micro/macro
complementarity will quickly settle in. But it will take a form that
could not have been predicted, but is now suddenly doable and thinkable.
**Micropolitics is what makes the unimaginable practicable. It's the
potential that makes possible.**]{.underline}

#### Perm do the aff and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the alt- Glezos concludes that totalizing accounts are bad

**Glezos 20** (Simon Glezos, Ph. D. in political theory and
international relations from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
10-5-2020, Routledge, \"Speed and Micropolitics Bodies, Minds, and
Perceptions in an Accelerating World, pp 11-12\", )//guyB

What is more, [our discussion in the previous section of the kinds of
tools which can help deal with the political problem of urgency makes
clear]{.underline} [the **variety of tempos** at which such political
practices take place]{.underline}. [Sometimes it is a matter of
embracing techniques and technologies which can accelerate our response
times]{.underline}. [**Sometimes** it is a matter of working vigorously
to **introduce institutional and political mechanisms** which can **slow
down** the pace of events]{.underline}. [**Sometimes** it is a matter of
creating **slow spaces** which can **allow us to cultivate particular
affects** and habits through which we can respond effectively to an
accelerating and uncertain world]{.underline}. Most importantly, it
always involves pushing for circumstances in which questions of
technological acceleration are increasingly subject to democratic
control rather than the vicissitudes of the market, or control of the
militaristic wings of the state. Again, Wajcman is thoughtful on the
question of accelerating technology: I want to argue that [**a more
well-rounded understanding** of the relationships between temporality
and technology must inform an emancipatory politics of
time]{.underline}. This involves the democratization of technoscience,
deciding what sort of technologies we want and how we are going to use
them. Resisting technological innovation and calling for deceleration or
a digital detox is an inadequate intellectual and political response.
Indeed, wistfully looking back to idealized slower time and mourning its
passing has long been the preserve of conservative political theory.
(26--27) Again, [this does not mean an uncritical embrace of
accelerative technologies. It means, rather, an approach which refuses
to presume a fundamental or necessarily 'human' pace which requires a
unilateral deccelerationist stance]{.underline}. Indeed, [if at times
this text seems to be more of a 'pro-speed' manifesto, this is only
because, as Sharma points out, it is fighting against a more broadly
'anti-speed' tendency in the literature]{.underline}. But **[this should
not be mistaken for an uncritical or unthinking
accelerationism]{.underline}**. Indeed, at several points throughout the
text, I will point to either specific contexts in which we might wish to
reject or challenge accelerative technologies, as well as provide
general theoretical rubrics which might help us to judge the value and
desirability of certain types of technological change. [This **rejection
of an 'either/or'** response to the question of speed and politics is
another case in which our historical approach to speed is
enlightening]{.underline}. Recognizing [the reoccurring engagement with
the political problem of speed throughout human history helps to show
the insufficiency of either a pro- or anti-speed approach]{.underline}.
It shows the way in which [anti-speed accounts' nostalgia for the
slowness of the past was rarely experienced by the actual participants
of those periods themselves]{.underline}. [And for those who wish a
vision of social acceleration as tied to a vision of human progress, we
see how repeated human societies articulate questions of speed in terms
of danger and violence]{.underline}. Ultimately what this means is that,
in interrogating the question of speed and politics, **[we must go
beyond fast and slow]{.underline}**. [We must refuse to see it as a
matter of either embracing speed or negating]{.underline} it but rather
developing [a nuanced and complex account of the ways in which social
acceleration shapes bodies, minds, communities, and
futures]{.underline}, and [develop theories and tools which can tell us
when we might want to accelerate and when we want to slow
down]{.underline}, [when we want to embrace speed and when we want to
reject it]{.underline}

### Tech Good\-\--2AC

#### Using technical data and information to drive policymaking is good

**Reiter 15**---Professor of Political Science at Emory University
\[Dan, "Scholars Help Policymakers Know Their Tools," *War on the
Rocks*, 27 Aug,
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/>,
accessed 11 Jan 2017\]

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign [policy choices are
**not sui generis**]{.mark}, there are [patterns]{.mark} across space
and time that **[inform decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Policymakers recognize this and routinely draw lessons from history when
making foreign policy decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other
areas such as development and public health routinely rely on broader,
more general studies to craft policy. And, [[**broader scholarship** can
**improve** foreign policy performance]{.mark}, as [evidenced by the
ability of]{.mark} IR [academics to build on their]{.mark} own [work to
**predict outcomes**]{.mark}, including for example forecasting the
lengths of the conventional and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq
conflict in the 2000s]{.underline}.

But, even if one were to accept the limits of general work, there is a
growing body of academic work that evaluates foreign policy tools as
applied to a specific country or region. These studies ask questions
such as whether:

Development projects reduced insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone
strikes reduced insurgent violence in Pakistan; Development programs
increased civic participation and social capital in Sudan; Building cell
phone towers in Iraq reduced insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate
combatants into society in Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in
Liberia increased the legitimacy of the government there; Road projects
in India reduced insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's
failure in Congo; Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent
attacks from militants.

This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective.

A third critique is that much of this academic work on foreign policy
tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too quantitative and
technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik Voeten, [[there
is a **danger** in **not appreciating** the importance of rigorous
research design]{.mark}, including sophisticated [quantitative
techniques, for **crafting effective policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Sophisticated [research]{.mark} design is not the enemy of effective
policy, it [is **critically necessary**]{.mark} for it]{.underline}.
Certainly, [the current academic focus on building research designs that
permit causal inference speaks exactly to what policymakers care about
the most: if implementing a certain policy will cause the desired
outcome]{.underline}.

Or, put differently, [**[bad research]{.mark}** designs [make for **bad
public policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A classic example is school
busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some cities adopted
voluntary integration programs for public schools]{.underline}, in which
families could volunteer to bus their children to schools in
neighborhoods with different racial majorities. [Policymakers used the
favorable results for the voluntary programs to make the improper
inference that mandatory busing policies would also work]{.underline}.
[The result was bad public policy and violence]{.underline} in the
streets.

[Sophisticated [technical methods]{.mark} can [improve our ability to
make **causal inferences**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} can help
[[solve]{.underline}]{.mark} other **[[empirical
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consider that the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. [Assessing whether certain policies do win
public support requires collecting opinion data]{.underline}. A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques
have been used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

[Going forward, we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in
which mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective
than male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion
in combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians?

[Certainly, **[other areas]{.mark}** of public policy [understand the
importance]{.mark} of rigorous research design]{.underline}. [Economic
and development policy communities read the work of and employ economics
Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [[Policymakers incorporate the findings of]{.mark}
sophisticated [studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**,
**gender empowerment**, and **foreign aid**]{.mark}, knowing the best
policy decisions must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}.

Or consider public health policy. [**[Lives are literally on the
line]{.mark}** as [decision-makers must make decisions about]{.mark}
issues such as [**vaccinations**, **nutritional recommendations**, and
**air quality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Policymakers know they must use
sophisticated technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other
public health academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}.

Critics will argue that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from
contemporary academic IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics
let go of an obsession with technique, they will then be better able to
connect with policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree
that IR academics need to find ways to communicate their results in
clear, non-technical language. But [[the **technical
components**]{.mark} of the work **[need to be
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Stripping them out **directly
undermines** the ability of the research to give the **right**]{.mark}
kinds of policy **[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Let me conclude by noting that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR
academics should think about the big picture as well as smaller
questions, the forest of grand strategy as well as the trees of foreign
policy tools. [IR [academics have the potential to **make real
contributions** to]{.mark} big picture
**[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of
grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates
foreign policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}.

Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers need to know their
tools]{.underline}. [Rigorous IR research is the only way to evaluate
them effectively]{.underline}.

[[Many are]{.underline}]{.mark} understandably [[pessimistic
about]{.underline}]{.mark} platforms and
[[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. This year has been a tough one, [from
Cambridge Analytica and Russian trolls to]{.underline} the
implementation of [GDPR and data breaches]{.underline} galore. Those who
think about the world, about the problems that we see every day, and
about their own place in it, will quickly realize the immense frailty of
humankind. Fear and worry makes sense. We are flawed, each one of us.
And technology only seems to exacerbate those problems. [[But life is
getting better]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Poverty continues
nose-diving]{.mark};]{.underline} adult literacy is at an all-time high;
[[people]{.mark} around the world [are living
longer]{.mark}]{.underline}, living in democracies, and are better
educated than at any other time in history. Meanwhile, [[the digital
revolution has resulted in]{.underline}]{.mark} a glut of
[[informational abundance, helping to correct]{.mark} the informational
[asymmetries that]{.mark} have long [plagued
humankind]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem we now face is not how to
address informational constraints, but how to provide the means for
people to sort through and make sense of this abundant trove of data.
These macro trends don't make headlines. [[Psychologists know]{.mark}
that people love to read negative articles. [Our brains are wired for
pessimism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the shadow of a year of bad news, it
helpful to remember that Facebook and Google and Reddit and Twitter also
support humane conversations. Most people aren't going online to talk
about politics and if you are, then you are rare. These sites are places
where families and friends can connect. They offer a space of solace --
like when chronic pain sufferers find others on Facebook, or when widows
vent, rage, laugh and cry without judgement through the Hot Young Widows
Club. Let's also not forget that Reddit, while sometimes a place of rage
and spite, is also where a weight lifter with cerebral palsy can become
a hero and where those with addiction can find healing. And in the
hardest to reach places in Canada, in Iqaluit, people say that "Amazon
Prime has done more toward elevating the standard of living of my family
than any territorial or federal program. Full stop. Period"
Three-fourths of Americans say major technology companies' products and
services have been more good than bad for them personally. But when it
comes to the whole of society, they are more skeptical about technology
bringing benefits. Here is how I read that disparity: Most of us think
that we have benefited from technology, but we worry about where it is
taking the human collective. That is an understandable worry, but one
that shouldn't hobble us to inaction. Nor is technology making us
stupid. Indeed, quite the opposite is happening. Technology use in those
aged 50 and above seems to have caused them to be cognitively younger
than their parents to the tune of 4 to 8 years. While the use of Google
does seem to reduce our ability to recall information, studies find that
it has boosted other kinds of memory, like retrieving information. Why
remember a fact when you can remember where it is located? Concerned how
audiobooks might be affecting people, Beth Rogowsky, an associate
professor of education, compared them to physical reading and was
surprised to find "no significant differences in comprehension between
reading, listening, or reading and listening simultaneously."
Cyberbullying and excessive use might make parents worry, but NIH
supported work found that "Heavy use of the Internet and video gaming
may be more a symptom of mental health problems than a cause. Moderate
use of the Internet, especially for acquiring information, is most
supportive of healthy development." Don't worry. The kids are going to
be alright. And [yes, [there is a lot]{.mark} we still need [to fix.
There is]{.mark} cruelty, [racism]{.mark}, sexism, and poverty of all
kinds [embedded in]{.mark} our [tech]{.mark}nological [systems]{.mark}.
But [the best way to handle]{.mark} these [issues is]{.mark} through the
application of [human ingenuity]{.mark}. Human ingenuity begets
technology in all of its varieties]{.underline}. When Scott Alexander
over at Star Slate Codex recently looked at 52
[[startups]{.underline}]{.mark} being groomed by startup incubator Y
Combinator, he rightly pointed out that many of them were working for
the betterment of all: Thirteen of them [[had an
altruistic]{.underline}]{.mark} or international development
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Neema, an app to help poor
people without access to banks gain financial services; Kangpe,
[[online]{.mark} health [services for people]{.mark} in Africa [without
access to doctors]{.mark}]{.underline}; Credy, a peer-to-peer lending
service in India; Clear Genetics, [[an automated gene]{.mark}tic
[counseling tool]{.mark} for at-risk parents]{.underline}; and Dost
Education, helping to teach literacy skills in India via a \$1/month
course. Twelve of them seemed like really exciting cutting-edge
technology, including CBAS, which describes itself as "human bionics
plug-and-play"; Solugen, which has a way to manufacture hydrogen
peroxide from plant sugars; AON3D, which makes 3D printers for
industrial uses; Indee, a new genetic engineering system; Alem Health,
applying AI to radiology, and of course the obligatory drone delivery
startup. Eighteen of them seemed like boring meat-and-potatoes companies
aimed at businesses that need enterprise data solution software
application package analytics targeting management something something
something "the cloud". As for the other companies, they were the kind of
niche products that Silicon Valley has come to be criticized for
supporting. [Perhaps the Valley deserves some criticism, but perhaps it
deserves more credit than it's been receiving as-of-late. Contemporary
tech criticism displays a kind of anti-nostalgia]{.underline}. Instead
of being reverent for the past, anxiety for the future abounds. In these
visions, the future is imagined as a strange, foreign land, beset with
problems. And yet, to quote that old adage, tomorrow is the visitor that
is always coming but never arrives. The future never arrives because we
are assembling it today. We need to work diligently together to piece
together a better world. [But [if we]{.mark} constantly [live in fear of
what comes next]{.mark}, [that future won't be built. Optimism needn't
be pollyannaish]{.mark}. It only needs to be hopeful of a better
world]{.underline}.

**[Through policy debate, [students can]{.mark} develop information
literacy and [learn]{.mark} how to make critical [arguments]{.mark} of
fact. [This]{.mark} experience [is politically empowering]{.mark} for
students who will also build confidence for political
engagement.]{.underline}** Information literacy **[While there are many
definitions of information literacy, the term generally is understood to
mean that a student is "able to recognize when information is needed,
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
information needed" for problem- solving and
decision-making]{.underline}** (Spitzer, Eisenberg, & Lowe, 1998, p.
19). Information exists in a variety of forms, in visual data, computer
graphics, sound-recordings, film, and photographs. Information is also
constructed and disseminated through a wide range of sources and
mediums. Therefore, "information literacy" functions as a blanket term
which covers a wide range of more specific literacies. Critiques of
service-learning's knowl- edge-building power, such as those articulated
by Eby (1998) and Colby (2008), are chal- lenging both the emphasis the
pedagogy places on information gained through experience and the limited
scope of political information students are exposed to in the process.
**[Policy debate can augment a student's civic and political learning by
fostering extended information literacies]{.underline}**. [Snider and
Schnurer]{.underline} (2002) [identify policy debate as an especially
research intensive form of oral discussion which requires extensive time
and commitment to learn the dimensions of a topic]{.underline}.
**[Understanding policy issues calls for contemplating a range of
materials, from traditional news media publications to court
proceedings, research data, and institutional propaganda]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[[the nature of policy debate]{.mark}, which involves public

topic]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Dybvig & Iverson, n.d.). [This type of
work differs from traditional research projects where students gather
only the materials needed to support their argument while **neglecting
contrary evidence**]{.underline}. Instead, [the "debate research process
encourages a kind of holistic approach, where students need to pay
attention to the critics of their argument because they will have to
respond to those attacks]{.underline}" (Snider & Schnurer, 2002, p. 32).
**[In today's attention economy[, cultivating a sensibility for well-
rounded info]{.mark}rmation [gathering can]{.mark} also [aid students in
recognizing]{.mark} when and [how the knowledge produced in their social
environments can be effectively translated to specific
contexts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The "cultural shift in the production
of data" which has followed the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies means
that all students are likely "prosumers"---that is, they consume,
produce, and coproduce information online all at the same
time]{.underline} (Scoble, 2011). Coupling service- learning with policy
debate calls on students to apply information across registers of public
engagement, including their own service efforts and their own public
argumentation, in and outside of their debates. **[[Info]{.mark}rmation
is used in the service experience, which in turn, informs the use of
information in debates, where students then produce new information
through their argumentation]{.underline}**. The process is what Bruce
(2008) refers to "informed learning," or "using information in order to
learn." **[[When individuals move]{.mark} from learning how [to gather
materials for a task to a cognitive awareness]{.mark} and understanding
of how the information-seeking process shapes their learning, [they are
engaged in informed learning]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Through this
process, students can come to recognize that information management and
credibility is deeply disciplinary and historically con- textual (Bruce
& Hughes, 2010). This understanding, combined with practical experience
in locating information, is a critical missing element in contemporary
political engage- ment. Over 20 years ago, Graber (1994) argued that one
of the biggest obstacles to political engagement was not apathy, but a
gap between the way news media presents information during elections,
and the type of information voters need and will listen to during
electoral campaigns. The challenge extends beyond elections into
policy-making, especially as younger generations continue to revise
their notions of citizenship away from institutional politics towards
more social forms of activism (Bennett, Wells, & Freelon, 2011). For
stu- dents to effectively practice more expressive forms of citizenship
they need experience managing the breadth of information available about
issues they care about. As past research indicates a strong correlation
between service-learning experience and the motiv- ation and desire for
post-graduation service, it seems likely that students who debate about
policy issues related to service areas will continue their informed
learning practices after they have left the classroom (Soria &
Thomas-Card, 2014). Arguing facts [In addition to building information
literacies, students who combine policy debate with service-learning can
practice "politically relevant skills," which will help them have
confidence for political engagement in the future]{.underline}. As Colby
(2008) explains, this confidence should be tempered by tolerance for
difference and differing opinions. **[On the surface, [debating about
institutional politics might seem counterintuitive]{.mark} to this goal.
Politicians and the press have a credibility problem among college-aged
students, and this leaves younger generations less inclined to feel
obligated to the state or to look to traditional modes of policy- making
for social change]{.underline}** (Bennett et al., 2011; Manning &
Edwards, 2014). **[This lack of faith in government and media outlets
also makes political argument more difficult]{.underline}** (Klumpp,
2006). **[Whereas these institutions once served as authoritative and
trustworthy sources of information, the credibility of legislators and
journalists has decreased]{.underline}** over the last 40 years or so.
**[Today, politicians and pundits are viewed as political actors
interested in spectacle, power, and profit rather than truth-seeking or
the common good.]{.underline}** While some political controversies are
rooted in competing values, Klumpp (2006) explains that **[arguments
about policy are more often based in fact]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[when engaged in public arguments over questions of policy, people
tend to "invoke the authority of facts to support their
positions]{.underline}**." Likewise, "**[[the gov]{.mark}ernmental
sphere [has]{.mark} [developed]{.mark} elaborate [legal]{.mark} and
deliberative [processes]{.mark} in recognition of the power of facts as
the basis for a decision]{.underline}**." **[Yet, [while shared values
are often quickly agreed upon, differences over fact are more difficult
to resolve.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Without credible institutions of
authority that can disseminate facts, public deliberation requires more
time, information-gathering, evaluation, and reasoning]{.underline}**.
**[The Bush administration's decision to take military action in Iraq,
for example, was presumably based on the "fact" that Saddam Hussein had
acquired weapons of mass destruction. This has now become a classic
example of poor policy-making grounded in faulty factual evidence.
[This]{.mark} shortcoming [is]{.mark} precisely [why]{.mark} [policy
debate is a valuable complement]{.mark} to service- learning
activities]{.underline}**. **[Not only can students use their developing
literacies to better understand social problems, they can also learn to
access a broader range of knowledge sources, thereby mitigating the
absence of fact-finding from traditional institutions]{.underline}**.
Fur- thermore, [policy advocacy gives students experience testing the
reasoning underlying claims of fact]{.underline}. [Issues of source
credibility, analogic comparisons, and data analysis are three examples
of the type of critical thinking skills that students may need to apply
in order to engage a question of policy]{.underline} (Allen, Berkowitz,
Hunt, & Louden, 1999). While the effect may be to undermine government
action in some instances, in others students will gain a better
understanding of when and where institutional activities can work to
make change. [As students gain knowledge about the relationship between
institutional structures and the communities they serve, they grow
confidence in their ability to engage in future conversations about
policy issues]{.underline}. Zwarensteyn's (2012) research high- lights
these sorts of effects in high school students who engage in competitive
policy debate. Zwarensteyn theorizes that **[[even minimal increases in
technical knowledge about politics can translate to significant
increases in a student's sense of self-efficacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Many students start off feeling very insecure when it comes to their
mastery of insti- tutional politics; policy debate helps overcome that
insecurity]{.underline}**. Moreover, [because training in policy debate
encourages students to address issues as arguments rather than partisan
positions, it encourages them to engage policy-making without the
hostility and incivility that often characterizes today's political
scene]{.underline}. Indeed, [it is precisely that perceived hostility
and incivility that prompts many young people to avoid politics in the
first place.]{.underline} I do not mean to imply that students who
debate about their service-learning experi- ences will draw homogenous
conclusions about policies. Quite the contrary. Students who engage in
service-learning still bring their personal visions and history to bear
on their debates. As a result, students will often have very different
opinions after engaging in a shared debate experience. More importantly,
[the practice of debating should operate to particularize students'
knowledge of community partners and clients, working against the
destructive generalizations and power dynamics that can result when
students feel privileged to serve less fortunate "others]{.underline}."
[For civic and political engagement through service-learning to be
meaningful and productive, it must do more to challenge students'
concepts of the homogenous "we" who helps "them]{.underline}." Seligman
(2013) argues that [this civic spirit can be cultivated through the core
pedagogical principle of a "shared practice," which emphasizes the
application of knowledge to purpose]{.underline} (p. 60). [Policy debate
achieves this outcome by calling on students to consider and reconsider
their understanding of themselves, institutions, community, and policy
every time the question "should" may arise]{.underline}. As Seligman
writes: \... [the orientation of thought to purpose (having an
explanation rest at a place, a purpose) is of extreme
importance]{.underline}. **[We must recognize that [the orientation of
thought to purpose is to recognize moving from providing a knowledge of,
to providing a knowledge for]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This means that in
the context of encountering difference it is not sufficient to learn
about (have an idea of) the other, rather it means to have ideas for
certain joint purposes---for a set of "to-does." A purpose becomes the
goal towards which our explanations should be oriented. (p. 61) Put
another way, **[policy debate challenges students "to maintain a sense
of doubt and to carry on a systematic and protracted inquiry" in the
process of service-learning itself]{.underline}** (Seligman, 2013, p.
60). This is precisely the type of complex, ongoing, reflective inquiry
that John Dewey had in mind. Political engagement through policy debate
This essay began with a discussion of the growing attention to civic
engagement programs in higher education. [The national trend is to
accomplish higher levels of student civic responsibility during and
after their time in college through service-learning experiences tied to
curricular learning objectives. A challenge for service-learning
scholars and teachers is to recognize a distinction between civic
activities that are accomplished by helping others and political
activities that require engagement with the collective institutional
structures and processes that govern social life. **Both are necessary
for democracy to thrive**. Policy debate pedagogy can help
service-learning educators accomplish these dual
objectives]{.underline}. [To call policy debate a pedagogy rather than
just a style of debate is purposeful]{.underline}. **[A pedagogy is a
praxis for cultivating learning in others]{.underline}**. The pedagogy
of service-learning helps students to know and engage social conditions
through physical engagement with their environments and communities.
**[Policy debate pedagogy leads students to know and engage these same
social conditions while also challenging them to apply their knowledge
for the purpose of political advocacy]{.underline}**. These pedagogies
are natural compliments for cul- tivating student learning. Therefore,
future studies should explore how well service-learn- ing combined with
policy debate can resolve concerns that policy debate alone does not go
far enough to invest students with political agency (Mitchell, 1998).
The present analysis suggests the potential for such an outcome is
likely. Moreover, research is clear that the civic effects of
service-learning as an instructional method are improved simply by
increasing the amount of time spent on in-class discus- sion about the
service work students do (Levesque-Bristol, Knapp, & Fisher, 2010).
[Policy debates related to students' service can accomplish this goal
and more]{.underline}. **[Policy debates can also facilitate the
political learning students need to build their political efficacy and
capacity for political engagement]{.underline}**. [Through informed
learning about the political process---especially in the context of
service practice---students develop literacies that will extend beyond
the classroom]{.underline}. **[Using this knowledge in reasoned public
argument about policy challenges invites students to move beyond cynical
disengagement towards a productive recognition of their own potential
voice in the political world]{.underline}**. [Policy debate pedagogy
brings unique elements to the process of political
learning]{.underline}. **[By emphasizing the conditional and dynamic
nature of political arguments and processes, debates can work to relieve
students of the misconception that there is a single "right answer" for
questions about policy-making and politics, especially during election
time]{.underline}**. [The communication perspective on policy debates
also highlights students' collective involvement in the ever-changing
field of political terms, symbols, and meanings that constitute
interpretations of our social world]{.underline}. In fact, **[the
historical roots of the term "communication" seem to demand that speech
and debate educators call for such emphasis on political
learning]{.underline}**. "To make common," the Latin interpretation of
communicare, situ- ates our discipline as the heart of public political
affairs (Peters, 1999). **[Connecting policy debate to service-learning
helps highlight the common purpose of these approaches in efforts to
promote civic engagement in higher education.]{.underline}**

REVIEWERS' OVERALL FEEDBACK

These comments are the overall assessment of scientists on the article,
they are substantiated by their knowledge in the field and by the
content of the analysis in the annotations on the article.

Amber Kerr, Researcher, Agricultural Sustainability Institute,
University of California, Davis:

The content of the IFLScience article is mostly an accurate
representation of the contents of the Breakthrough report, but [the
article tends to gloss over **important caveats and
probabilities**]{.underline} that are [given in the report]{.underline}.
The least accurate part of the IFLScience article is the headline, which
is an outright misrepresentation of the report. The article title states
that there is, overall, [**a "high probability"** of human civilization
coming to an end]{.underline} in 30 years. This [is **extremely
misleading**]{.underline}. What the Breakthrough report actually says is
that, [in **the most unlikely, "long-tail" biophysical scenario** where
**climate feedbacks** are **much more severe than we expect**, **THEN**
there is a]{.underline} high [likelihood]{.underline} of human
civilization coming to an end. [But the report authors **explicitly
state** that **this "high-end scenario"** is **beyond**]{.underline}
their [capacity to model or to **quantitatively estimate**]{.underline}.

Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

The article uncritically reproduces claims from a recent report released
by an Australian thinktank regarding the purported "end of human
civilization" due to climate change over the next 30 years. [While there
is plenty]{.underline} of [scientific evidence]{.underline} that
[climate change will pose]{.underline} increasingly [**existential
threats** to **the most vulnerable individuals in society**]{.underline}
and to key global ecosystems, [**even these dire outcomes** aren't
**equivalent** to the "**annihilation of intelligent
life**,"]{.underline} as is claimed in the report.

Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:

The report this article is based on describes a scenario which is
unlikely, but several aspects of what is included in the report are
likely to worsen in coming decades, such as the occurrence of deadly
heatwaves. [**The [conclusion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **a high
[likelihood]{.mark}** that **human [civilisation]{.mark}** [will end is
**false**]{.mark}, although there is **a great dea**l of
evidence]{.underline} that [there will be]{.underline} many **[damaging
consequences]{.underline}** to continued global warming over the coming
decades.

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

I don't think it's so easy to discount the essential warning of this
report. However, it would have been stronger if the authors were more
careful not to mention the unsupported concept of near-term human
extinction, and the unsupported probabilistic claim that there is a
"high likelihood" of their 2050 scenario which includes the collapse of
civilization. [I do not understand why **[non-scientist
writers]{.mark}**]{.underline} (neither report author is a scientist)
[feel a need to [**exaggerate** sound]{.mark} scientific
[findings]{.mark}]{.underline}, when those findings are already quite
alarming enough. I feel that humanity should undertake urgent climate
action just as the report authors do, but I feel that [misrepresenting
the science is **unhelpful** and **unnecessary**]{.underline}.

2\. The [**Empirical Evidence**: Is Inequality **Really
Growing**?]{.underline}

All of the [[papers]{.underline}]{.mark} discussed above
[[assume]{.mark} that **[inequality]{.mark}** has **[increased]{.mark}**
in recent years]{.underline}. This [view is fairly common among
economists and would seem to be borne out as seen in Figure 2 below,
which presents the **Gini coefficient** for U.S. incomes]{.underline}
for the last fifty years.166

Figure 3, which plots the ratio of the share of US income among the
fifth quintile of income-earning households to the share among the first
quintile of households167 tells a similar story.

Robert Kaestner and Darren Lubotsky underscore the point that
[inequality measures can be **significantly affected** by a failure to
account for **government transfers** and **employee benefits** that
presumably **substitute** for **cash income**]{.underline}.168 [Given
that healthcare costs have grown faster than inflation in recent years,
a **failure** to account for **health insurance benefits** could
significantly affect economic inequality measures. Reviewing estimates
from the literature]{.underline}, Kaestner and Lubotsky find that
[including health insurance **substantially reduces** the **gap**
between incomes at the high end of the distribution and those at the low
end]{.underline}.169 Interestingly, however, the authors find that
[there is still an **upward trend** in inequality over time when the
cash equivalent of health insurance and government transfers are
included]{.underline}.170 [The [trend]{.mark}, **however**, [is]{.mark}
**substantially [muted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.171 Specifically,
[including government transfers and the **imputed value** of employer
subsidized health insurance]{.underline}, Kaestner and Lubotsky
[indicate that [the]{.mark} [ratio]{.mark} of income between households
at the ninetieth percentile and the tenth percentile was about **five**
in 1995, growing to **5.2** in 2004 and to **5.6** in
2012]{.underline}.172

Although yearly estimates of this more complete measure of income
inequality are not available, and the time series span is somewhat
limited, another approach might be to examine consumption inequality
since consumption will be a function of effective income, and
consumption data are more readily available. Also, [consumption might be
a better measure of welfare]{.underline} as argued by Bruce Meyer and
James Sullivan.173 [When determining the desirability of **antitrust
enforcement** to address economic inequality, presumably one not only
wants to examine the **indirect effects** on people's **incomes** and
**wealth**]{.underline}, but also the direct effect on consumer welfare,
for which consumption might be a useful proxy.

Considering the arguments raised above regarding the desirability of
using antitrust to fight inequality, [one might reason that **higher
prices** coming from increased concentration make both the well-off
investors and executives and the lowly consumer **worse off**, **but**
the investors and executives are **compensated** through high incomes
due to their **monopoly profits**]{.underline}. Under these arguments,
[we should see an **upward trend** in the consumption ratio between the
haves and the have-nots. Figure 4]{.underline}, which uses data on
average consumption by households in the various income quintiles from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey,174 [shows
that while the ratio has grown over time, the [growth is **much
smaller**]{.mark} than that found [for **income**
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further, [unlike income, the [growth is
**not**]{.mark} **nearly as [consistent]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} periods
of **[increasing inequality]{.mark}** and **decreasing inequality**
alike.]{.underline}

### AT: Alt\-\--2AC

#### Alt has [zero chance]{.underline} of success\-\--prefer quantitative studies that analyze [one-thousand years]{.underline} of data\-\--gradual reforms

**Calnitsky '21** \[David; August 8; Assistant Professor in the
Department of Sociology at Western University; *Critical Sociology,*
"The Policy Road to Socialism," Sage Online\]

David Calnitsky, Published August 8, 2021

I do not, however, think that **[[the rev]{.mark}olutionary road
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** implausible. Rather, it is
**[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least [inside the rich
capitalist democracies]{.underline}. [And between the implausible and
the impossible the choice is clear.]{.underline}

Again, [this can be framed as an empirical hypothesis]{.underline}:
**[[You do not see rev]{.mark}olution[s]{.mark} [in developed capitalist
democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Przeworski and Limongi (1997)
have written, [there has **never** been a revolution in a moderately
middle-class democracy]{.underline} (see also Przeworski, 2019).
[[Drawing on a **thousand years of data**]{.underline}]{.mark},
cumulatively collected across 37 democratic countries, [they show that
[**not one had collapsed** with]{.mark} a per-capita [GDP higher
than]{.mark} that of [Argentina]{.mark} in 1976. A]{.underline}mong
countries with half that figure, collapse was exceedingly rare. Even a
modest GDP brings with it an enormous amount of regime stability.
[[These]{.mark} data in fact [include **any kind of regime
collapse**]{.mark};]{.underline} [narrowing the data to socialist
revolution makes the empirical case against it even more
impressive.]{.underline} Any case for revolution must begin by
acknowledging rather than ignoring this evidence.

To look at this question in a different way, I draw on the
Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive, which contains information on
revolutions (rather than government collapse) for over 200 countries
since 1919. [Their definition of revolution is very broad]{.underline}
(see footnote 7) [and includes "attempts" to overthrow government as
well as "unsuccessful" rebellions]{.underline}. The data were compiled
from newspaper sources and warrants caution, but nonetheless constitutes
the most systematic evidence available for these questions. In Figure 9,
I present the GNP per capita distribution of revolutions, from 1919,
where GNP is first available, to the present. By considering only those
country-years with revolutions I reduce the observation count from
17,520 to 184. Unlike Przeworski, I do not further restrict the data to
democracies. The graph displays an extreme skew: The vast, overwhelming
majority of cases of revolutionary threat occur in countries with a per
capita GNP below \$5,000 USD. For reference, the figure for the US in
the data is about \$65,850 in 2019. The hypothesis above---that we do
not see revolutions in developed democracies---seems borne out by the
evidence.

figure

Figure 9. Histogram of country-years with revolutions.

Source: Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive. Data drawn from 200
plus countries between 1919 and 2018 are then restricted to
country-years (N = 184) in which there were "revolutions," as well as a
"major government crisis" and "anti-government protests."

Why exactly is this true and what are the mechanisms to explain it? Why
is the revolutionary strategy impossible for a country like the US?
There are, at bottom, three reasons, each of which stands alone as a
sufficient condition to snap the last threads of one's revolutionary
faith.23 The first two suggest that revolution is unachievable, and the
last suggests that even if it is achievable, socialism by revolutionary
means is unachievable. [The revolutionary road is closed on the
following grounds:]{.underline}

(1) **[Workers do not want it]{.underline}**

(2) **[Capitalists would sooner grant reforms]{.underline}**

(3) **[[A smashed state is]{.mark} more [likely to result in
tyranny]{.mark}]{.underline}** than deep democracy

[[Not only has there never been a successful revolution]{.mark} in a
developed democracy, **[there has never]{.mark} been [a working class
that]{.mark} has [wanted one]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Erikson and
Tedin, 2015; Sassoon, 1996).24 There are no clear cases where the
dominant inclination of the working class in a developed democracy was
revolutionary. Recall that the above graph also includes attempts and
unsuccessful cases. It is self-evident that workers have not joined
revolutionary groups en masse at any point in the context of a rich
democracy. Nor were their aspirations to join such groups thwarted by
violence or ideology. When gains inside a capitalist democracy are
available---either individual or collective ones, and this has been true
even through the neoliberal period, where median living standards have
continued to (slowly) go up and not down---it is not worth risking
everything for an uncertain future (Thewissen et al., 2015).25 More
important than the dynamic point is the static one: When standards of
living are moderately high, as shown in Figure 9, the modal worker has
more to lose than her chains. This is not an argument against socialism;
but to revise Werner Sombart, the life raft of revolution really was
shipwrecked on shoals of roast beef and apple pie.

Therefore[, the reasons workers are not revolutionary are materialist in
character. Explaining their reformist politics does not require appeal
to venal trade union leaders or false consciousness. Most people wish to
**minimize risk** in their lives, and **[rev]{.mark}olution
[involves]{.mark} taking on [colossal risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For
example, [home-ownership in the developed world hovers around 70%; this
means that **a lot of [people have a lot to lose]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

By contrast, [the materialist case for revolution proposes that people
favor it when their expected post-revolutionary standards of living are
greater than their current standard]{.underline} (Roemer, 1985). But
[when we add moderate risk- and loss-aversion the calculation
changes]{.underline} (Kahneman and Tversky, 1991). Say you have a low
income, but own a few assets, maybe a house, a car, and perhaps you also
have a child; what risk profile would you require to gamble your modest
holdings for an uncertain future which might be better but might be
worse? Even if you are certain that the probability of better is greater
than the probability of worse, you have to envision workers as a class
of inveterate gamblers to take the bet. Moderately cautious people who
prefer a bird in the hand will still view the downside risk as too
great. Equal gains and losses are not experienced equally. This is the
loss aversion phenomenon. But the assumption of a population confident
about improved standards of living---and a willingness to take risky
strategies to achieve them---is itself unwarranted. This is the risk
aversion phenomenon. The modal worker is of course correct to suspect
that her post-revolutionary welfare is uncertain; socialists after all
do not have satisfactory answers to the problems of coordination,
motivation, and innovation under socialism (for attempted answers that
are provocative and oftentimes brilliant, see Albert, 2004; Cottrell and
Cockshott, 1992; Corneo, 2017; Roemer, 1994; and Wright and Hahnel,
2016). When one compares the status quo to a future where both heaven
and hell are seemingly plausible, it is perfectly rational that people
everywhere would abandon the barricades. And abandon them they did.

Now perhaps the revolutionaries have persuaded us that negative outcomes
are far-fetched, that we are very confident that revolution will usher
in, eventually, the land of milk and honey. It is still the case that in
this model the promised land will only be reached after a social
breakdown of unknown duration: A complete overhaul in the organization
of production will lead to some middle period of deteriorating material
welfare as capitalists rapidly exit the economy. This means chaos and
uncertainty, but it could also mean war. The interregnum could last a
year, but it might last two decades, and however optimistic we are about
the end point, we cannot in advance know how long this interim phase
will persist. In the meantime, revolutionary enthusiasm will wane,
erstwhile supporters will decamp, a "stay-the-course" electoral strategy
will be outflanked by competitor parties promising a return to normalcy,
and the desire to consolidate gains will make the authoritarian impulse
greater. From a materialist perspective, the uncertain passage through
what Przeworski (1986) calls the "transition trough" makes the journey
less appealing.26

To my mind, these factors explain why **[[all working classes]{.mark} in
all developed democracies [have been]{.mark} decidedly
[reformist]{.mark} in orientation]{.underline}**. [The reason why
revolutionary socialism has always been marginal in rich capitalist
economies]{.underline}---and will always be outflanked by
reform-oriented socialism---[is that only the latter consistently
deliver hi]{.underline}gh (and usually increasing) standards of living
and low (and usually decreasing) levels of risk. As long as the Mad Max
world of catastrophic collapse can be avoided, reform-oriented parties
will always better capture the enthusiasm of poor and working people.

Thus, when we try to explain the non-revolutionary attitudes of our
working-class friends and family, we do not need to lean on the false
consciousness account, for there is a more parsimonious materialist
explanation. As such, any case for revolution must be non-materialist in
character: You can be a materialist or a revolutionary, but not both.

This is the dilemma the revolutionaries must consider: [Revolution is
only possible when the forces of production are underdeveloped, but it
can only be successful when they are sufficiently developed to make
socialism]{.underline} (or communism) [objectively
viable]{.underline}.27 As Elster (1986) has argued, [the circumstances
under which revolutions **spark and succeed never
coincide**.]{.underline}

What about the **[[capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Under these
circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that they [will [fight]{.mark}
[**far harder** against a revolution than]{.mark} they would against
[reformist drives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [ignoring the response
from capitalists violates Elster's first law of political rationality:
Never assume your opponent is less rational than you. [If revolution
were the alt]{.mark}ernative]{.underline}, [[employers would grant
every]{.mark} imaginable **[reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from far
higher taxes to the rejiggering of power relations in the workplace. In
a mugging, most people will surrender their wallet before their life.

Actors in the state ought to respond in more or less the same way---that
is, as long as you admit your adversary the competence to read the
situation as well as you. If our theory of the state suggests that it
acts on behalf of the capitalist class, its apparatchiks would
anticipate and preempt any revolutionary crusade with a cocktail of
concession and repression. And while it will certainly contest reforms,
it will devote all of its resources to break the revolution.
Nonetheless, this means that revolutionaries can play a crucial role,
even if it is not to foment revolution. Militancy is a powerful strategy
to foment reform (for an argument about the history of social democracy
along these lines, see Piketty, 2014).

Thus far, the main reason revolution is off the table is because no one
wants it---not workers, nor employers, nor the state.

The third point above asks us to imagine the prospects for revolutionary
success even if we ignore the wrinkle that workers have neither an
interest nor capacity to make it. But let us pretend they did:
**[Why]{.underline}** then would [we imagine that total social breakdown
would prompt a deepening of [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} [rather than
**authoritarian entrenchment**]{.underline}? [This happy outcome [has
never]{.mark} before [emerged in the]{.mark} [wake of social
collapse,]{.mark}]{.underline} and there is little reason why the final
showdown with the American military ought to produce fertile ground for
deepening democracy in all spheres of life. In fact, evidence from the
General Social Survey suggests that in response to recession and
economic downturn people tend to become less altruistic and less
concerned with questions of fairness.28 After situations of economic
crisis, voters tend to shift to the right (Lindvall, 2014). The old
union song cries out that "we can bring to birth a new world from the
ashes of the old," but life is not birthed on ash. None of the
historical case studies track this narrative, and indeed everything we
know about human psychology suggests that social devastation makes
people more, not less, prone to demagoguery. This means that even if a
revolution were achievable, it is probably undesirable.

The argument I have thus far laid out against revolution contends only
that it is off the table in middle-class democracies. I have in mind
social dynamics within developed capitalist democracies, countries "like
the US," but the premise no longer holds true if we imagine a society
that has already suffered some sort of catastrophic societal
disintegration---at that point all bets are off. We are of course now
talking about a world we are not living in, but it is worth considering
the thought experiment nonetheless.

It is possible that America, after some world-historic environmental or
economic collapse, begins to look something more like Russian feudalism
than contemporary developed capitalism. Revolution then might again be
on the table, but the context of desperation and scarcity in this
scenario gives little reason to expect it would incubate an egalitarian
democratic society. The historical evidence is unambiguous: None of the
communist revolutions of the 20th century ushered in deeply democratic
egalitarian social structures. Not only are there no examples, but there
are also no clear mechanisms on offer.

The fact that this scenario generates an interest in bringing about an
egalitarian society by means of revolution does not mean there will be a
capacity to do so. The theory is little more than "where there is a will
there is a way." But, as Elster (1980: 124) argues, the general
interests of society do not secrete the conditions for their
fulfillment. Interests and capacities need not overlap.

There is a final reason to be skeptical of non-evolutionary strategies:
The highly dubious premise that the system we erect the morning after
will actually work. [A [socialist economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, if
plopped down tomorrow, [[would be]{.mark} so [rife with **unintended
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} and pathologies that [it is easy to
imagine a democracy voting its way back into capitalism]{.underline}.
[This is true even if we believe]{.underline} (mistakenly, in my view)
[that the socialist calculation debate is solvable in the age of big
data]{.underline} (Morozov, 2019). Interlocutors in the calculation
debate have had very little to say about the politics of transition.
Indeed, [[it is hard to **imagine success**]{.underline}]{.mark} of any
kind [[without]{.mark} a **slow and [incremental]{.mark}
[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [experimenting with bits and
pieces along the way]{.underline}---as we have been doing for the past
century[. An experimental approach is likely [the only way to
avoid]{.mark} **devastating [blunders]{.mark}** that **undermine the
whole project**]{.underline}. [Moments of institutional upheaval and big
change may at times be necessary, but to be successful they will have to
rest on a foundation of smaller changes that have been
tested.]{.underline}

Global Unrest

There are many contradictions in the capitalist system, and some are
more salient than others. The incredible class and social inequalities
and collapsing environmental conditions are obvious priorities. But then
comes the "too big to fail, too monstrous to survive" contradiction.
Neither the social inequality nor environmental degradation issues can
be addressed without taking on this underlying contradiction. [A
socialist and anti-capitalist program will have to negotiate a
knife-edge path between preserving that which services the world's
population and which appears too big and foundational to fail while
confronting the fact that it is becoming **too monstrous** to survive
without sparking geopolitical conflicts that will likely turn the
innumerable small wars and internal struggles already raging across the
planet into a **global conflagration**]{.underline}.

This is the core of the problem. [**[In Marx's time]{.underline}**, [if
there was a **sudden collapse**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[of
capitalism]{.underline}**, [[most people]{.mark} in the world
[would]{.mark} still [have been able to feed]{.mark} [themselves]{.mark}
and reproduce.]{.underline} They were reasonably self-sufficient in
their local area procuring the kinds of things they needed to live and
reproduce. [[People could put]{.mark} some sort of [breakfast on]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}ir [table]{.mark} irrespective of what was going on in the
**global economy** and in **global markets**]{.underline}. [[Right
now]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[that's no longer the
case]{.underline}]{.mark} in many parts of the world. [[Most]{.mark}
[people in the]{.mark} **U**nited **S**tates, in much of
[Europe]{.mark}, in Japan, and now increasingly in [China]{.mark},
[India]{.mark}, Indonesia, [and]{.mark} in Latin [America]{.mark} are
[depend]{.mark}ing more and more [on]{.mark} the delivery of [food
through]{.mark} the circulation of [capital]{.mark}. In Marx's time,
perhaps 10 percent of the global population was vulnerable to
disruptions in the circulation of capital, as opposed to many more who
were subject to famines, droughts, epidemics, and other environmental
disruptions]{.underline}. The crisis of European capitalism in 1848 was
part a product of harvest failures and part produced by a speculative
crash focused on railroad finance. [Since then, [capital]{.mark}
operating in the world market has largely [eliminated]{.mark} the
prospect of [starvation]{.mark} due to supposedly natural causes. If
there is famine the underlying causes]{.underline} (as opposed to the
immediate triggers) [can invariably be traced to failures in the social
and political system of capitalist governance and
distribution.]{.underline} [Much of [the world]{.mark}'s population
[is]{.mark} now [dependent upon]{.mark} the circulation of capital to
procure and ensure its food supply, access the fuels and the
[energy]{.mark} required [to support daily life]{.mark}, and to maintain
the elaborate structures and equipment of communication that facilitate
the coordination of basic production requirements]{.underline}.

[Capital]{.underline}, right now, [may be too deeply implicated in the
**reproduction of daily life** to fail. [The]{.mark} economic
consequences and social impacts and [costs of a]{.mark} massive and
prolonged [failure in the continuity of capital circulation will be
catastrophic and]{.mark} potentially **[lethal]{.mark}** for a
significant portion of the world's population.]{.underline} To be sure,
indigenous and peasant populations in the Andean highlands may survive
quite well, but [if the flow of capital shuts down]{.underline} for any
prolonged period, then [**maybe [two-thirds of the world's population
would within a few weeks be threatened with starvation]{.mark},**
deprived of fuel and light, while being rendered immobile and deprived
of almost all capacity to reproduce their conditions of existence
effectively]{.underline}. **[[We cannot]{.mark} now
[afford]{.mark}]{.underline}** any kind of [sustained and prolonged
attack upon or [disruption]{.mark} of capital circulation [even if
the]{.mark} more **[egregious forms of accumulation are strictly
curbed]{.mark}**. [The]{.mark} kind of [fantasy]{.mark} that
[revolutionaries]{.mark} might once have [had]{.mark} -- which was that
capitalism could be destroyed and burned down]{.underline} overnight and
that something different could immediately be built upon the ashes --
[**[is impossible today]{.mark}** even supposing there ever was a time
when such a revolutionary overthrow might have happe]{.underline}ned.
Some form of the circulation of commodities and therefore of money
capital has to be kept in motion for some considerable time lest most of
us starve. It is in this sense that we might say that [[capital
appears]{.mark} to be now **[too big to fail]{.mark}.**]{.underline} We
[may aspire to make our own history, Marx observed, but this can never
be done under conditions of our own choosing. These conditions dictate a
politics that is about sustaining many existing commodity chains and
flows while socializing and perhaps gradually modifying them to
accommodate to human need]{.underline}s. As Marx noted in his commentary
on the Paris Commune,

in order to work out their own emancipation, and along with it the
higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending by its own
economical agencies, they \[the working classes\] will have to pass
through long struggles, through a series of historic processes,
transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realize, but
to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing
bourgeois society is pregnant.

[[The task is to]{.mark} identify that which **lays latent in our
existing society to [find a peaceful transition to a more socialist
alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Revolution
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[a]{.mark} long [process not an
event]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**Wilkinson, 17**---Vice President for Policy at the Niskanen Center
(Will, October 24, "PUBLIC POLICY AFTER UTOPIA,"
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/public-policy-utopia/>, dml)

Many political philosophers, and most [adherents of radical political
ideologies, tend to think that an **ideal vision** of the
best]{.underline} social, economic, and political [system serves a
**useful** and **necessary orienting function**]{.underline}. [The idea
is that reformers **need to know what to aim at** if they are to make
**steady incremental progress** toward the maximally good]{.underline}
and just [society. If you don't know where you're headed---if you
**don't know what utopia looks like**---how are you supposed to know
**which steps to take next**? [The idea that a vision of an ideal
society can serve as a]{.mark} **moral** and **strategic [star]{.mark}**
[to steer by]{.mark} is both intuitive and appealing. But it **turns out
to be wrong**. This]{.underline} [sort of political ideal actually
[**can't help us find our way** through the **thicket of real-world
politics**]{.mark} into the clearing of justice]{.underline}. I've
discussed the problems with ideal theory at length, in the context
Gerald Gaus' tremendous book The Tyranny of the Ideal, in a Vox column.
This piece will be easier to understand if you read that first. Jacob
Levy's paper, "There's No Such Thing as Ideal Theory," is an outstanding
complement. And, on the more technical side, the work of UCSD's David
Wiens is state of the art, and adds texture to Gaus' critique. A major
paradigm shift in political theory is underway, and [it's **all over but
the shoutin'** for ideal theory. But **it takes a while for the shoutin'
to peter out**. [New paradigms can take **a generation or more** to
**trickle down**]{.mark} through the intellectual culture. So we've
**barely begun to grasp** what it means to give up on ideal
theory]{.underline}, especially in public policy. It's a bit dramatic to
say that the death of ideal theory changes everything, but it changes a
lot. It definitely changes what it means to be an ideologically
principled think tank. If you agree with Gaus, as I do, then you will
think that there's a pretty major intellectual mistake lurking within
the ideal-theoretic version of libertarianism that the most prominent
institutions of the "freedom movement" were built to promote. Again,
this has nothing to do with libertarianism, per se. Gaus' argument is
general. [It **doesn't matter which normative standard you use** to rank
possible social systems. It could be the orthodox libertarian conception
of freedom as non-coercion]{.underline}, John Rawls' two principles of
justice, [or a **radically egalitarian conception of material
equality**. It doesn't matter. In order to say that **any particular
system is the best** in terms of your chosen normative standard, you've
**got to be able** to **rank rival systems against that
standard**]{.underline}. Doing that ranking in a principled,
non-arbitrary way requires evidence of what the realization of your
favorite possible social world would actually look like. Otherwise you
can't really say that it does better in terms of your chosen standard
than competing systems. Utopia is a guess [The fact that **all our
evidence** about how social systems **actually work** comes from
**formerly** or **presently existing systems** is a **huge problem** for
anyone committed to a **radically revisionary ideal** of the morally
best society. [The **further a** ]{.mark}**possible [system is from a
histori]{.mark}cal system**, and thus from our base of evidence about
how social systems function, [the **more likely we are to be mistaken**
about how it would work if it were realized. And]{.mark} the more likely
we are to be mistaken about how it would actually work, [the **more
likely we are to be mistaken** that it is]{.mark} **more free**, or
**more equal**, or **[more]{.mark} socially [just]{.mark}** than other
systems, possible or actual]{.underline}. Indeed, there's basically no
way to rationally justify the belief that, say, "anarcho-capitalism"
ranks better in terms of libertarian freedom than "Canada 2017," or the
belief that "economic democracy" ranks better in terms of socialist
equality than "Canada 2017." [You may think you can imagine how
anarcho-capitalism or economic democracy would work, but **you can't**.
You're **really just guessing**---extrapolating **way beyond your
evidence**. [You **can't just stipulate** that it works the way you want
it to work]{.mark}. **Rationally speaking**, you **probably shouldn't
even suspect** that your favorite system comes out **better than an
actual system**. **Rationally speaking**, your favorite **probably
shouldn't be your favorite**. **Utopia is a guess**]{.underline}. Again,
this is a general problem. But it does hit especially hard for those who
appreciate the unpredictability of complex systems and the inevitability
of unintended consequences. It's no coincidence that Gaus is a Hayekian.
As my colleague Jeffrey Friedman argues, expert predictions about the
the likely effects of changing a single policy tend to be pretty bad.
I'll use myself as an example. I've followed the academic literature
about the minimum wage for almost twenty years, and I'm an experienced,
professional policy analyst, so I've got a weak claim to expertise in
the subject. What do I have to show for that? Not much, really. I've got
strong intuitions about the likely effects of raising minimum wages in
various contexts. But all I really know is that the **[context matters a
great deal]{.underline}**, that [a lot of **interrelated factors**
affect the dynamics of]{.underline} low-wage [**labor markets**,
and]{.underline} that [I **can't say in advance** which margin will
adjust]{.underline} when the wage floor is raised. Indeed, whether we
should expect increases in the minimum wage to hurt or help low-wage
workers is a question Nobel Prize-winning economists disagree about.
[Labor markets are complicated! Well, the **comprehensive political
economies** of nation-states are **vastly more complicated**. And that
means that our predictions about the outcome of radically changing the
entire system are **unlikely to be better than random**. If your
favorite system is **quite a bit different** from any system that has
existed, then **even if it were true** that it would rank **numero uno**
in terms of your favorite normative standard, you're **not in a position
to rationally believe it**. Clearly then, it's **not actually useful to
aim toward a distant ideal** when you **don't really have a good
reason** to believe that it's **better than actually existing systems**
in terms of liberty or equality or nationalist solidarity or whatever it
is you care about]{.underline}. This is a hard lesson for ideologues to
swallow. I still haven't totally digested it. But a number of things
have become much clearer after giving up on my sinful, ideal-theoretic
ways. Analysis after ideal theory: measurement and comparison [The death
of ideal theory implies a **non-ideological**, **empirical**,
**comparative approach** to political analysis. That **doesn't mean
giving up** on]{.underline}, say, the value of [freedom]{.underline}. I
think I'm more libertarian---more committed to value of liberty---than
I've ever been. [But that **doesn't mean being committed**
to]{.underline} an eschatology of liberty, [a picture of an **ideally
free society**]{.underline}, or a libertarian utopia. [We're **not in a
position** to know what that looks like. The **best we can do** is to go
ahead and try to **rank social systems** in terms of the values we care
about, and then see what we can learn]{.underline}. The Cato Institute's
Human Freedom Index is one such useful measurement attempt. What do we
see? Look: Every highlighted country is some version of the
liberal-democratic capitalist welfare state. Evidently, this general
regime type is good for freedom. Indeed, it is likely the best we have
ever done in terms of freedom. Moreover, Denmark (#5), Finland (#9), and
the Netherlands (#10) are among the world's "biggest" governments, in
terms of government spending as a percentage of GDP. The "economic
freedom" side of the index, which embodies a distinctly libertarian
conception of economic liberty, hurts their ratings pretty
significantly. Still, according to a libertarian Human Freedom Index,
some of the freest places in on Earth have some of the"biggest"
governments. That's unexpected. This is why we need to try to rank
social systems in terms of our prized political values. Our guesses
about which systems lead to which consequences are likely to be pretty
bad. Suppose we were to poll a bunch of American libertarians, and ask
them to tell us which country enjoys more freedom, according the Cato
Institute's metrics. The United States or Sweden? The United States or
Germany? The United States or Canada? The United States or Lithuania?
I'm pretty sure almost all of them would get it wrong in each of these
pairwise comparisons. Why? Because typical libertarians carry an
ideal-theoretic picture of the "the free society" around in their heads,
and (for some reason!) a minimum of taxation and redistribution is among
the most salient aspects of that picture. And that means that Denmark,
say, doesn't seem very free relative to that picture. But there's a
great deal more to freedom than fiscal policy. And we see that, as a
matter of fact, the country with the biggest-spending government in the
world is among the freest countries in the world, and ranks first in
personal freedom. That is our basic data. It doesn't necessarily imply
that the United States ought to do more redistributive social spending.
But when a freedom index, built from libertarian assumptions, shows that
freedom thrives in many places with huge welfare states, it should lead
us to downgrade our estimate of the probability that liberty and
redistribution are antithetical, and upgrade our estimate of the
probability that they are consistent, and possibly complementary. That's
the sort of consideration that mainly drives my current views, not
ideal-theoretical qualms about neo-Lockean libertarian rights theories.
Though libertarianism is of personal interest to me, I want to emphasize
again that [my larger point has **nothing to do with
libertarianism**]{.underline}. The same lesson applies to alt-right
ethno-nationalists dazzled by a fanciful picture of a homogenous,
solidaristic ethno-state. [The **same lesson applies** to
**progressives** and **socialists** in the grip of **utopian pictures of
egalitarian social justice**]{.underline}. Of course, [**nobody knows**
what an ideally equal society would look like]{.underline}. If we stick
to the data we do have, and inspect the top ranks of the Social Progress
Index, which is based on progressive assumptions about basic needs, the
conditions for individual health, well-being, and opportunity, you'll
mostly find the same countries that populate the Freedom Index's
leaderboard. Here: The overlap is striking. And this highlights some of
the pathologies of ideal theory: irrational polarization and the
narcissism of small differences. Some pathologies of ideal theory, both
personal and political Ideal theory can drive political conflict by
concealing overlapping consensus. Pretty much any way you slice it,
Denmark is an actually-existing utopia. But so is Switzerland. So is New
Zealand. The effective difference between the Nordic and Anglo-colonial
models, in terms of "human freedom" and "social progress" is
surpassingly slight. Yet passionate moral commitment to purist ideals of
justice can lead us to see past the fact that the liberal-democratic
capitalist welfare state, in whatever iteration, is awesome, and worth
defending, from the perspective of multiple, rival political values. We
miss the fact that these values fit together more harmoniously than our
theories lead us to imagine. I suspect this has something to do with the
fact that utopia-dwellers around the world seem to be losing faith in
liberal democracy, and the fact that "neoliberalism" can't get no love,
despite the fact that they measurably deliver the goods like crazy. Yet
ideologues interpret this loss of faith as evidence of objective
failure, which they diagnose as a lack of satisfactory progress toward
their version of utopia, and push ever more passionately for an agenda
they have no rational reason to believe would actually leave anyone
better off. [It is **intellectually corrupt** and **corrupting** to
define liberty or equality or you-name-it in terms of an **idealized**,
**counter-factual social system** that **may** or **may not do
especially well** in delivering the goods. [Commitment to a vision of
the perfect society is **more likely than not to lead you
astray**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider how unlikely it is for a typical
libertarian to correctly predict more than a couple of the top-ten
freest countries on the libertarian freedom index. [[The fact
that]{.mark} ideological [radicals are]{.mark} **pretty [unreliable at
ranking]{.mark} existing social [systems]{.mark}** in terms of their
favored values **ought to make us skeptical** of claims that highly
counterfactual systems would rank first. And it [**ought to lead us to
suspect** that ideal]{.mark}-theoretical political [theorizing **leads
us to see the actual world less clearly than we might**, due to
**cherry-picking** and **confirmation bias**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [If
you've **already irrationally ranked a fanciful social system
tops**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in terms your favored value,
[you've]{.mark} **effectively [committed]{.mark}** [to the idea that the
world works in a certain way **without**]{.mark} **sufficient [evidence
that it actually does]{.mark}**. This is **almost always a commitment of
identity** and **group membership rather than a judgment of reason**.
And it leads you to **cast about for evidence** that the world **does
work the way it would need to work** in order to vindicate your ranking.
[You]{.mark} end up **[lend]{.mark}ing a great deal of
[cred]{.mark}ibility [to comforting evidence]{.mark}**[, while
**ignoring** and **dismissing evidence** that the world **doesn't work
that way you'd like it**]{.mark} **to work**. The result is that your
ideal-theoretic commitment ends up **driving your model of the world**.
[But if your]{.mark} ideal [theory is]{.mark} **likely to be [wrong in
the first place]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} using it as a **filter for
evaluating evidence** is going to leave you with a **disastrously
distorted picture** of the way the world actually works. And that means
[you're going to make **systematically terrible predictions** about the
**likely consequences**]{.mark} of this or that policy change. [You may
want to]{.mark} identify reforms most likely to [promote]{.mark} liberty
or equality, or [whatever, but **you'll end up really bad at this**
because your **distorted ideological model** of the world will leave you
**unable to evaluate evidence objectively**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Progress in policy requires idealistic moral passion without
preconceived ideals For me, the death of ideal theory has meant adopting
a non-speculative, non-utopian perspective on freedom-enhancing
institutions. [If **you know that you can't know in advance** what the
freest social system looks will look like, you're unlikely to see
evidence that suggests that policy A]{.underline} (social insurance,
e.g.) [is freedom-enhancing, or that policy B]{.underline} (heroin
legalization, e.g.) [isn't]{.underline}, as threats to your identity as
a freedom lover. [[Uncertainty]{.mark} about the details of the freest
feasible social scheme [**opens you up** to looking at evidence in a
**genuinely curious**, **non-biased way**. And it frees you from the
anxiety that]{.mark} genuine [experts]{.mark}, people with merited
epistemic authority, [will say things you don't want to hear.
This]{.mark} in turn [**frees you from the urge** to wage **quixotic
campaigns** against]{.mark} the authority of legitimate
[experts]{.mark}. **You can start acting like a rational person**! You
can simply **defer to the consensus of experts** on empirical questions,
or **accept that you bear an extraordinary burden of proof** when you
disagree]{.underline}. I think [the reign of ideal theory in political
philosophy turned lots of incredibly smart, principled, morally
motivated people into **unreliable**, **untrustworthy
ideologues**]{.underline}. [This has **left the field of rational policy
analysis** to **utilitarian technocrats**, who have **their own serious
problems**]{.underline}. Long story short, [we ended up with a sort of
**divide** in public policy between **morally passionate advocates
trapped in epistemic bubbles** and **technicians capable of objective
analysis but devoid of guiding vision**]{.underline}. [What [we
need]{.mark} are [folks]{.mark} who are **passionate**]{.underline}
about freedom, or social justice (or what have you) [[who **actively
seek solutions**]{.mark} to **domination** and **injustice**, [but who
**also don't think** they **already know exactly what ideal**]{.mark}
**liberation** or **social [justice look like]{.mark}**[, and are
**therefore motivated** to **identify our real alternatives** and to
**evaluate them objectively**.]{.mark} The space of possibility is
**infinite**, and it takes **energy** and **enthusiasm** to want to
explore it. **Imaginative hypothesis generation is the great intangible
without which progress is impossible** or **maddeningly slow**. The
**technicians**, the **quants**, the **lab rats** tend to be **awful**
at dreaming up hypotheses. **Ideological moral passion** is the
**perfect wild horse to harness**; it could **power the exploration** of
the **near frontier of the feasible**. But thanks to the tyranny of the
ideal, it's a source of intellectual energy **more often wasted hooked
up to a wagon train headed off the map to Shangri-La**.]{.underline}

Feng's claim is simply that AI oligarchs are bad and the only credible
fix is a "socialist market economy" governed by a Marxist one-party
state. This is a false dichotomy; our choice is not between these two
extremes. We agree that AI oligarchs are an unattractive prospect.
However, [there are existing remedies for cartels, monopolies, and
harmful AI products in the pluralist West]{.underline}.
**[[Targeted]{.mark} [regulation is a better fix for capitalism's
defects]{.mark}]{.underline}** than a revolution led by an alliance of
workers and peasants. As a result of Frances Haugen's testimony, many in
the US Congress are looking to clip the wings of social media. The EU
has led the world in regulating AI products, introducing rights to
explanations, rights to be forgotten, and rights to data privacy. The
Australian government has released draft legislation to expose anonymous
trolls to defamation actions by removing the "platform" shield of social
media and making them "publishers" accountable for the views their users
post just like traditional media. The "wild west" days of the
information age are over.

But [Feng offers [a typical]{.mark}ly Marxist "[all or nothing]{.mark}"
[arg]{.mark}ument. To fix the problems of competitive]{.underline}
[capitalism, his solution is a Marxist political monopoly]{.underline}
based on the revolutionary expropriation of the expropriators. His
argument is unconvincing because it [[is based on]{.mark} a hopelessly
dated caricature of capitalism.]{.underline} "Laissez-faire capitalism
as we have known it," he says, "can lead nowhere but to a dictatorship
of AI oligarchs who gather rents because the intellectual property they
own rules over the means of production."

The obvious problem with this argument is that **[[laissez-faire
cap]{.mark}italism [is extinct]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [long since
abandoned in favour of regulation]{.underline}, **[anti-trust
legislation]{.underline}**, [and redistribution]{.underline} through the
welfare state. Feng overstates the market power of the [AI
oligarchs,]{.underline} most of whom [make their money selling ads in a
competitive market.]{.underline} He says nothing about [the coercive
power of a political monopoly]{.underline}, that [can silence policy
competition by throwing it into the gulag.]{.underline}

[[The most **sinister** aspect of]{.mark} current [AI is what a
**one-party state** can do with it]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Silicon Valley
has given China the technical tools to set up the world of
1984.]{.underline} Now the party telescreen can monitor the likes of
Winston Smith 24/7. [Instead of a screen on the wall, it's the mobile
phone in your pocket connected to the Internet that can be used to track
you and monitor what you click on,]{.underline} who and what you
message, and keep you and all your fellow citizens under constant
surveillance for "counter-revolutionary" views. In China, the Internet
and social media have evolved to be a tyrant's dream. Comrade political
officers in technology firms monitor online posts for "objectionable"
material and have unlimited powers of "moderation."

[The Achilles heel of this political strategy is that [it creates a
culture in which people are **afraid to think**]{.mark} **and speak
freely**]{.underline}. [[When you]{.mark} have to [filter every]{.mark}
[word you say]{.mark} in case it offends the powers that be, [you
are]{.mark} **strongly [motivated to avoid risky creative
thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In a society where the state can
control everything and purge celebrity and wealth, [talented people
**vote with their feet** and]{.mark}]{.underline} [migrate to places
where they can get rich and famous and **say what they
think**]{.underline}. [[Those that remain settle for]{.mark} the safety
of government-approved **[groupthink]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As a
result of [this]{.mark} systemic [**dampening of creativity**,]{.mark}
the economy **[stagnates]{.mark}** in the long run.]{.underline}

Aspects of contemporary AI theory align with the intuitions of Karl
Popper as expressed in The Open Society and Its Enemies. Driven mostly
by reaction to the totalitarian horrors of fascism and communism in
World War II, Popper intuited that social truth is best served by policy
competition and piecemeal social engineering not policy monopoly.
Contemporary AI, in the form of discussion of the
exploration/exploitation tradeoff in reinforcement learning (a variant
of ML), explains why.

Exploitation is a strategy whereby the AI takes a decision assumed to be
optimal based on data observed to date. In essence, it is about trusting
past data to be a reliable guide to the future, or at least today.
Exploration, by contrast, is a strategy that consists of not taking the
decision that seems to be optimal based on existing past data. The AI
agent bets on the fact that observed data are not yet sufficient to
correctly identify the best option. Obviously, exploitation works better
in closed and well-understood systems, but exploration is a better bet
in those that are open and poorly understood.

Even if decisions are made by the most generally intelligent AI
possible, the optimal strategy for that AI is to subdivide tasks,
duplicate itself, and specialize for local conditions. In other words, a
swarm of individuals each making their own choices can learn from the
best of what its population tries. If all individuals are constrained,
then the ability of the swarm to learn and change is crippled. There are
exceptions, particularly where the cost of an individual failing is so
high it is comparable to the whole population failing (for instance,
letting more people have access to a button that ends the world is worse
than letting fewer people have access to this button). But, generally
speaking, **[more distributed control consistently beats more
centralised control]{.underline}**. [By employing **many different**,
often contradictory policies at once, we constantly **explore as we
exploit**.]{.underline} Applying this recent technical insight
retrospectively to history, [it explains the sustained stagnation of
Marxist economies]{.underline}.

Presently, no functioning state has either completely central or
distributed control. We are all somewhere in between. In the mid-19th
century, when The Communist Manifesto was published, there was hardly
any spending on social services. Income tax was three percent in the UK,
there was no such thing as company tax, and the welfare state did not
exist. What existed was the parish and the poorhouse. In the days of
Gladstone and Disraeli, with property-based suffrage and a budget than
went mostly on the Army, the Navy, and servicing debt incurred during
the Crimean War, one could plausibly claim, as Marx and Engels did, that
"the executive of the modern state was nothing but a committee for
managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie." In the 19th century,
spending by the UK government was less than a 10th of GDP. Today it is a
third. Half the UK budget, one-sixth of GDP, goes on health, education,
and welfare.

A degree of central planning is desirable to provide infrastructure, to
support basic research, and to ensure that everyone has access to
education and health services. Regulation is required to enforce
contracts, to facilitate cooperation, to provide minimum standards for
products and services, and to enforce rules on safety, pollution, and so
on. However, as an overall policy, maximising individual autonomy within
reason, erring towards computational efficiency and distributed control,
will yield dramatically better outcomes than central control by the AI
of a one-party state.

[[Central planning ignores]{.underline}]{.mark} what is arguably
[the]{.underline} greatest [advantage of distributed control and
local]{.underline} [adaptation: **[error
correction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It also ignores the fact that
"fairness" is notoriously hard to define in AI terms, assuming resources
are to be fairly allocated. [A central planner might select what is best
for an average human, but what is best is often far from obvious.
[Humans are]{.mark} quite **[dissimilar]{.mark}** from one another. We
share goals only in the most general sense]{.underline} (for example, we
seek to avoid pain, find food, take shelter, and so forth). [[We rarely
agree on what we want]{.mark} to do today or any other day]{.underline},
and our beliefs about how to achieve things are often inconsistent.

[The best possible central planner]{.mark}[, mathematically, [is]{.mark}
a [pareto-optimal]{.mark} super-intelligence]{.underline}. This is a
software agent that learns faster to predict more accurately than any
other agent, on average across all possible tasks. This is the
theoretical upper limit of intelligence (allowing for debate over the
exact definition of intelligence itself). However, [[even this]{.mark}
theoretical perfection [will]{.mark} [always be out-performed]{.mark} by
those with a more specifically relevant inductive bias toward a given
task]{.underline} (those who are less intelligent in general, but more
suited to the task at hand). In other words, even the most intelligent
being possible would make mistakes when compared with the possibilities
presented by distributed control, localised adaptation, and selective
evolution. The same goes not just for correcting mistakes, but for
improving our lot in life. Every beneficial innovation in history was an
instance of an individual breaking ranks to correct a perceived flaw in
the norm, to adapt to the specific situation at hand. [**[Innovation
requires disobedience]{.underline}**. **[To centralise control
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to encourage
[stagnation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The problem with **[[state-run monopolies]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that
they [are inherently inefficient because they [lack]{.mark} the **[error
correction]{.mark} provided by competition**]{.underline}. [Markets
provide error correction in the form of people deciding products suck
and buying elsewhere]{.underline}. In the realm of ideas, error
correction occurs when people say a party's policy does not work, but
this option is removed when free speech is curtailed. In China, [those
who criticise government policy]{.underline} (or government officials)
[disappear and get silenced.]{.underline} Only a lucky few like Peng
Shuai have global profiles high enough to get noticed. Notwithstanding
their claims about "participatory" democracy, in the one-party state,
dissidents and innovators are purged in darkness.

The history of the communist world is replete with economic disaster.
Millions died as a result of famines caused by Stalin and Mao. Marxist
doctrine underlies the economic underperformance of China compared to
Taiwan. [[AI cannot save Marxism, but it can be used by
Marxists]{.underline}]{.mark} to serve their agendas of surveillance and
social control. AI can be used to bring about the death of democracy
[[and enable]{.underline}]{.mark} the rule of a **[[digital Big
Brother]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Private telecom is key\-\--their alt wrecks global cybersecurity 

**Marar '20** \[Satya; October 17; policy analyst at Reason Foundation
and a Young Voices tech policy fellow; "5G nationalization will leave
America behind,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/521502-5g-nationalization-will-leave-america-behind\]

The Department of Defense (DOD) is currently considering a proposal
that'll effectively nationalize 5G technology and networks in the United
States. [[By abandoning the **market-driven
strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark} that won the 4G race for the nation,
[[America would]{.underline}]{.mark} merely [[be]{.underline}]{.mark}
undermining its own progress --- and [[losing to
China.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This is especially concerning since [[China sees itself as]{.mark} a
[**rival** to]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony [and is]{.mark}
increasingly [exerting its]{.mark} diplomatic and military [influence in
a **brazen** way. It]{.mark} has launched cyberattacks and [attempted to
acquire]{.mark} sensitive [military]{.mark} secrets]{.underline} and
[[intel]{.underline}]{.mark}ligence. It has already made strides in the
5G race and is rapidly acquiring key 5G patents. Its flagship
telecommunications giant is propped-up by \$75 billion in subsidies and
was slated to build the UK's 5G network this year. The British
government only reneged after U.S. diplomatic pressure.

Concerningly, [[Chinese laws]{.mark} effectively [compel Huawei to hand
over]{.mark} user [data]{.mark}]{.underline} and to assist it in
industrial espionage and state surveillance. If the world becomes
increasingly reliant on Chinese government-controlled and operated
telecommunications infrastructure, then that will leave U.S.
manufacturers and innovators at an ever-increasing disadvantage. With 5G
technology expected to contribute \$2.2 trillion, roughly 5 percent of
global GDP, to the world economy within 15 years, this is a race America
must win.

Troublingly enough, the DOD suggests a move that mirrors China in many
ways. It'd replace the existing Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
plan to auction off frequency ranges within the mid-band spectrum to
private companies who can then develop the necessary infrastructure
networks, which is ideal for 5G development. Instead, a network built
and deployed by the U.S. government would act as a wholesaler to
telecommunications companies who could turn around and sell 5G plans to
retail consumers.

But [national 5G [networks are]{.mark} already being [built across the
country with]{.mark} private [investment totaling
billions]{.mark}]{.underline} of dollars. Why would taxpayers pay such a
hefty sum for something that American companies are already developing?
Conversely, government agencies have already compromised the nation's
position in the 5G race by allocating mainly less-than-ideal low-band
and high-band frequencies for 5G development. Unlike the mid-band
spectrum that the U.S. military largely monopolizes, low-band
frequencies mean slow connections. High-band frequencies are localized
and require significantly more infrastructure investment to cover the
same range. By contrast, China has utilized its mid-band spectrum for 5G
deployment.

This is why a lone Chinese cellular tower now covers the same range as
100 high-speed American towers.

[The U.S. should be auctioning frequency ranges]{.underline} within the
mid-band spectrum to companies that are already equipped to build
infrastructure. [[If the U.S. wants to "**catch-up**" with
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [[it should be **taking advantage** of
the]{.mark} already **[robust]{.mark} American [private]{.mark}
[sector]{.mark}** [instead of]{.mark} adopting China's strategy of
**[state control]{.mark}**, **debt-funded subsidies** [and
**loans**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[A federal]{.mark} government [**5G** network could take **decades** to
build]{.mark} and could be [replete with setbacks]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- [at the expense of consumers and taxpayers.]{.underline}

Take a look at [[South Africa and Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark} for proof.
Those are two countries where [[national]{.underline}]{.mark}ized
[[telecom]{.underline}]{.mark}munications networks
**[[failed]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Or look to Australia, where the "National Broadband Network" turned into
a financial disaster. Originally projected to cost \$29.5 billion in
2013, it was completed only this year, with the final cost running past
\$51 billion. And that's not counting a recently announced \$4.5 billion
upgrade since the technology is out of date already. But it's not
politicians and bureaucrats' own money they're playing around with. It's
taxpayers' dollars on the line.

Conversely, proponents of a nationalized 5G network claim that
auctioning off spectrum to private network builders could leave
consumers worse off, since there's theoretically nothing stopping them
from charging high prices once they own the network. After all, American
mobile services are relatively more expensive than those in many
European nations.

Yet, this can hardly be blamed on privately owned network infrastructure
when infrastructure in European countries with significantly cheaper
mobile service is also privately owned. After all, American prices are
influenced by the relatively higher costs of extending coverage across a
nation that's so vast, unevenly populated and geographically diverse.

Moreover, European regulations that are designed to lower prices for
consumers by boosting retail competition (such as the UK rule requiring
network owners to sell access to competitors at cost) come at the
expense of decreased network investment that left Europe years behind
the United States in 4G development. This trade-off may be undesirable,
given how important fast, reliable and expansive 5G networks are for
keeping innovative companies and industries in the United States
competitive.

Nationalization also won't uphold security since **[[a
single]{.mark}]{.underline}** nationwide
**[[network]{.underline}]{.mark}**, government-owned or otherwise,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} even **[[more vulnerable to
hacking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore, infrastructure builders and
equipment providers who raise national security concerns are already
prohibited from purchasing spectrum licenses.

### AT: Innovation K / Innovation Links\-\--2AC

#### Group their critiques of innovation\-\--any less capitalist or less growth-oriented model wrecks it, which impoverishes society and ensures violent conflict 

**Tudoreanu '20** \[Mihnea; 9/23/20; doctoral candidate in economics at
the University of Massachusetts Amherst; David M. Kotz; professor
emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst;
\"Stable Jobs or iPhones? The Dilemma of Innovation in Socialism,\"
Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 52, Vol. 4, p. 642-649\]

**Note: DPS = Democratically Planned Socialism**

[One]{.underline} of the [advantage]{.underline}s [for
[innovation]{.mark} in DPS is]{.underline} that [it can]{.underline}
effectively [take into account social and environmental
costs,]{.underline} including the jobs lost or disrupted by the
introduction of a new technology.8 [But this can also be
**problematic**, in that it [is]{.mark} likely to make **innovation
[slower]{.mark}** [in **socialism**]{.mark} than in **capitalism**.
[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [majorities are **not immune**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} some of [the **same [factors]{.mark}** [that
caused **Soviet**]{.mark} **manager[s]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark}
technologically [conservative]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On the one hand, DPS should not suffer from taut planning, unrealistic
plan targets imposed from the top down, or an incentive structure that
discourages risk-taking by trying out new technologies. But on the other
hand, [[innovation is]{.mark} **always [disruptive]{.mark}** [in
**any**]{.mark} kind of **[economic system]{.mark}**. As old
technologies are **superseded**, product lines become **obsolete** and
production processes are changed, and as a result certain]{.underline}
kinds of [jobs are **no longer needed**. [Even with]{.mark}]{.underline}
an [[employment guarantee]{.mark}, the [loss]{.mark} of one's job
[may]{.mark} have to [involve]{.mark} **retraining**,
**[changing]{.mark} careers**[, or **moving**]{.mark}]{.underline}
across the country. So, [it is reasonable to expect]{.underline} that
[workers will **resist new technologies**]{.underline}.9 Yet at the same
time, in their capacity as consumers, they will demand new and better
products.

[This is]{.underline} the "[Stable jobs or iPhones?" dilemma. We can
prioritize]{.underline} cutting-edge [consumer products, or]{.underline}
we can prioritize [stable employment, but]{.underline} perhaps **[not
both]{.underline}**.10 In DPS, the people will be able to decide between
one and the other, on a case-by-case basis, so that [some
innovations]{.underline} will be pursued, others [will be scrapped
because of their **disruptive effects**, and some]{.underline} will be
[introduced at a **deliberately slow pace**. Meanwhile, capitalism
always comes down in favor]{.underline} of the iPhones despite the
conflict with stable jobs. [Since socialism will not]{.underline} always
do this, [it is likely that socialism will have]{.underline} more job
security but [fewer **cutting-edge**]{.underline} consumer [products
than capitalism]{.underline}.

[[If there is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**[international
rivalry]{.mark}** between **socialism** and **capitalism**, the
[citizens]{.mark} of the two]{.underline} kinds of [societies
will]{.underline} be able to [[compare]{.mark} their
[lifestyles]{.mark}]{.underline} with those in the other economic
system. Workers living under capitalism may be attracted by the stable
jobs, shorter working hours, democratic workplaces, and social benefits
provided by socialism. However, [[those]{.underline}]{.mark} living
[[under socialism will]{.mark} likely also [be **attracted** by]{.mark}
the **rapid [introduction]{.mark}** of new]{.underline} consumer [goods
under capitalism]{.underline}. Moreover, [as long as the **speed of
innovation** in socialism is **lower**]{.underline} than that in
capitalism, [the "**consumer gap**" with capitalism would
**grow**]{.underline} over time.

This may not be considered a problem for socialism if most of the
population value stable jobs more than iPhones, but there would likely
be a minority who do not. If the consumer gap is large enough, and/or
that dissenting minority has an overriding preference for new consumer
goods, then [we have a category of people with a **material interest**
in **supporting capitalism**, which values a **new
technology**]{.underline} over job stability, [even though they are part
of the working class]{.underline}.

[[A common response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[flaws]{.mark} of
Soviet socialism [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} to [propose **[other
models]{.mark} of socialism** that would not have those **flaws**. [But
the **trade-off** between **job security** and **innovation** is
not]{.mark} one that can be **[easily eliminated]{.mark}** within
socialism. It is not due to]{.underline} the [overly centralized or
undemocratic nature of Soviet socialism]{.underline}.

Furthermore, there is **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[military]{.underline}]{.mark} aspect to the
[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} problem. Innovations that aid the
military are also likely to have a disruptive effect on employment, as
in the case of consumer-oriented innovations. This is a problem because
it might [[put DPS at]{.mark} a **military [disadvantage]{.mark}** with
respect to capitalism, [which would **hurt** the **socialist side** in
**i**]{.mark}**nternational [r]{.mark}elations** [even if no]{.mark}
military [conflict takes place.]{.mark} If [one side]{.mark} knows it
would **lose any war**]{.underline} that did take place, then [that side
[will **act timidly**]{.mark} and avoid even nonviolent
confrontation]{.underline}, so as [to **avoid provoking** the other
side]{.underline} into war. [For both sides to stand]{.underline} a
[good chance of success in a peaceful rivalry, they must be]{.underline}
more or less [evenly matched]{.underline} militarily, [so that neither
feels that it can do whatever it wants with impunity]{.underline} or
that it must tread lightly to avoid confrontation.

[[The Cold War was]{.underline}]{.mark} a [multifaceted
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} between two different systems. [[Any
future socialist]{.mark} economic [order will]{.mark} most
[likely]{.mark} face capitalism in a]{.underline} somewhat [[similar
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}. Can such a struggle be won by socialism
without matching capitalism's rate of technological development? That is
the question.

Beginning with the dreams and funding by successful tech entrepreneurs,
enormous venture investments are already delivering wondrous benefits to
the world.

Commercial Space -- Profit and Non-Profit

There are really two major categories in the commercial sector, the
profit driven and the non-profit. The classic for-profit companies
include not only those designing, building, launching, and operating
satellites but also [the [tech]{.mark} sector]{.underline} that [[is
**turning**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**raw [space data into
gold]{.mark}** through machine-learning analytics]{.underline}. Since
for-profit companies are no longer dependent upon the revenues generated
by the Cold War space race culture of a bygone era, this new generation
of space companies is able to more efficiently capitalize on Moore's
Law, the nonstop exponential growth in chip density, and the associated
networking technology co-evolving with it. This new generation is
[building profitable businesses]{.underline} helping [[to **clean
up**]{.mark} **our [oceans]{.mark} of garbage**]{.underline} and debris
[with satellite [surveillance]{.mark}, reconnoitering to]{.underline}
assist in **[[enforc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[laws that]{.mark}
protect our oceans from illegal]{.underline}**, unregulated, unlicensed
**[fishing]{.underline}**, something [that is **rapidly depleting** the
**world's most valuable and essential lifeforms**]{.underline}. It's
[leading]{.underline} in [the innovative use of low-cost satellite
constellations to produce **ubiquitous remote-sensing data**, [enabling
**small business**]{.mark} owners [to be]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and less wasteful. For example,
precise timing signals from space are already optimizing transportation
of people, goods, and services, with even further gains anticipated with
the introduction of artificial intelligence to assist drivers, perhaps
even someday replacing them entirely.

The non-profit sector is the other side of commercial space, concerned
more for the general welfare of society, but every bit as integral to
this new space enterprise. Much **[like every century]{.underline}**
before it [in human history, ours is not without its **unique
challenges**]{.underline}, [some of which have been a consequence of the
last, and **all of which the space [data]{.mark} domain [can be
leveraged to]{.mark}**]{.underline} help [**[solve]{.mark}**. Examples
are **endless**, but one challenge that this new space community is
uniquely well-adapted for is to]{.underline} further [inform **worldwide
[resource allocation]{.mark}** for the **21st century and
beyond**]{.underline}. These [two primary resources are **[sustainable
water]{.mark}** and the materials needed for **adequate
[housing]{.mark}** []{.mark}for an **ever-increasing human population**.
As cities and urbanization continue to expand, **governmental planning**
challenges]{.underline} such as transportation design optimization for
goods and services [are **only**]{.underline} the
**[beginning]{.underline}**. [Additionally, through]{.underline} using
[inexpensive remote sensing]{.underline} technologies, some [members are
designing space data analytics to **[mitigate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
human suffering from [**[plagues]{.mark}**, **contain
[outbreaks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [combat]{.underline}ing
[**illegal [poaching]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Some are connecting with
other non-profits to [curtail **human
[trafficking]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the sex trade [or]{.underline}
forced labor for migrant debt repayment. Still others are helping
non-governmental organizations in their work to [expose the use of
**child**]{.underline}ren as [**soldiers**. Addressing these challenges
has little to do with resuscitating dreams]{.underline} conceived [by
long deceased science-fiction writers and much]{.underline} more [to do
with **turning "swords back into plowshares**" to **solve real [threats
to humanity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Other non-profit initiatives include pursuing an even more foundational
understanding of who we are and how to be the best custodians of our
environment. Much as exploring and monitoring the world's oceans has
advanced civilization through a better understanding of human life and
the planet, so too does exploring and monitoring from space. Low Earth
orbit (LEO) provides a unique vantage point to look back on the planet
and understand what is happening, anticipate what might happen and
prepare for the future. In addition to better understanding Earth,
responsible and rapid exploitation of the low Earth orbit domain will
enhance the understanding of the solar system and the rest of the
universe. Small satellites already offer low-cost platforms to study and
explore what lies beyond the Earth. Other members are pioneering the use
of zero-carbon, hydrogen-based reusable propulsion systems to ensure we
don't worsen our atmosphere using kerosene-fueled rockets for the coming
tsunami of satellite launches. [Finally, a mission
**[ensuring]{.mark}**]{.underline} the general welfare and [**[planet
survival]{.mark}** for the **next thousand years** is **finally

#### Space resource extraction solves sustainability. 

**Whittington '20** \[Mark; November 22; writes frequently about space
and politics, has published a political study of space exploration
entitled Why is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon and is published in
the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Hill, USA Today, the LA Times, and
the Washington Post, among other venues; The Hill, "How space
exploration will help to address climate change,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/527058-how-space-exploration-will-help-to-address-climate-change/\]

The Biden approach to NASA seemed to be expressed best by Lori Garver,
who served as NASA's deputy administrator during the Obama
administration. According to the Space Review, she said, "If we don't
put some really significant resources into allowing humanity to be
sustained on this planet, we're not going to have the time to leave it.
You can't really do one without the other."

That last sentence is truer than, perhaps, Garver realizes. An article
in Astronomy Magazine suggests that [[the]{.mark} ultimate
[solution]{.mark} to climate change [will be to move]{.mark} **resource
[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **heavy industry [off]{.mark}
the [planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The notion seems like science
fiction, but some very serious people are looking at the idea of **[[a
space-]{.mark}based industrial [revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Jeff
Bezos, who made his billions from Amazon.com and now runs a space launch
company called Blue Origin, [suggests "zoning" Earth for
residential]{.underline} [areas and "light industries."]{.underline}
[Mining and manufacturing]{.underline}, two of [[the **biggest
sources**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} environmental
[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[would move]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[off]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The moon and asteroids are the sources of untold mineral wealth. A
single asteroid, 16 Psyche, is said to contain 10,000 quadrillion
dollars' worth of metals. The quoted figure is somewhat misleading. If
one were to bring all the gold on 16 Psyche to Earth, its price would
collapse, making it into a cheap, industrial metal.

The point, however, is that [[only]{.mark} by turning humankind into a
**[space]{.mark}-faring civilization** [can]{.mark} we **[avoid]{.mark}
environmental [catastrophe]{.mark} while maintaining technological
progress.**]{.underline} The fact further suggests that the Artemis
program has an environmental dimension that Team Biden would do well to
recognize and to consider when formulating space policy for the incoming
administration.

American law already recognizes the right of companies to extract
resources from the moon and other celestial bodies, thanks to Title IV
of the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. The act was
passed in 2015 on a bipartisan basis and signed into law by Obama.

Currently, [NASA has been attempting to gain international recognition
of Earth humans' right to extract and own space resources]{.underline}
as part of the Artemis Accords. The accords have been signed by nine
nations, besides the United States, with more to follow.

The point of all of this, going back to what Garver said, is that
climate change and space exploration are inseparably linked. She likely
meant that Earth needs to be sustained so that humankind can expand into
space. However, the opposite is also true. **[[Humankind must expand
into space so]{.mark} that [the Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the pale
blue dot that the late-Carl Sagan once celebrated, [[can be]{.mark}
[preserved]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Space Internal\-\--1AR

#### Socialist space development is [designed to fail]{.underline} and results in [disasters]{.underline} that shut down the space program. 

**Nelson '20** \[Peter Lothian and Walter Block; 2020; professional
engineer; Space Capitalism: How Humans will Colonize Planets, Moons, and
Asteroids, Palgrave McMillan, ch. 1-2\]

Precisely. **[[You will not find]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ever,
[[capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark} entrepreneur[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[price]{.underline}]{.mark} tag. Or,
if you do, you will find them soon in the throes of bankruptcy, therein
no longer able12 to effectively serve their customers.

It cannot be denied that millions of people, nay, hundreds of millions,
were thrilled that members of their species walked on the Moon. Such
persons were particularly proud that \"we,\" our nation, had performed
this adventure. But, they had no way of plunking down any cash on the
barrel-head to demonstrate (Rothbard 1997a) that this was so. In
contrast, every time they go to a movie, or a Super Bowl, matters are
entirely different. In these latter cases, we have direct, objective
evidence as to the benefits of these expenditures. In the case of the
moon landing, we did not.

Of course, the **[[Challenger and Columbia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
debacles must be counted on the debit side of the ledger for NASA. Were
a calamity of this sort to have taken place in the private sector, it
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[have spelled the death knell for the
company]{.underline}]{.mark} responsible. But **[[this rarely
occurs]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[public
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}. There, catastrophes abound, and there is no
automatic feedback mechanism of profit and loss that all but guarantees
the exit of those responsible.

The fact to keep in mind is that Challenger, and even Columbia, by
itself does not represent half the problem. **[[The Space
Shuttle]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is designed to
fail]{.underline}]{.mark} and do so spectacularly with excessive bells
and whistles. The first obvious failure mechanism is lift-off. Once
achieved, [it allows no escape method for about two minutes until
booster separation]{.underline}. Even then the crew could not simply
stop. [They would have had to burn off excess fuel from the external
tank prior to jettisoning]{.underline} it, which is then followed by
nearly impossible maneuvers (Dunn 2014). [Engineers call a system with
no way out or no backup plan: \"designed to fail.\"]{.underline} For two
minutes, on the most dangerous part of the flight, there was no plan B.

As if that were not bad enough, [there is really no reasonable way to
retro-fit an escape mechanism. Since the crew cabin was an integral part
of the spaceship, such a system would require the ability to lift the
entire unit with payload.]{.underline} Presumably, the external fuel
tank and boosters could be jettisoned at the same time, but then NASA
would have had two uncontrolled rockets doing cartwheels in the sky with
a massive explosive bomb (the external fuel tank) in the middle of it
all. Any Mercury-style escape tower would have had to be sufficiently
large compared to the size of the vehicle to lift it out of the
maelstrom prior to the impending collision of one of the missiles with
the tank. The only genuine answer would have been a complete redesign to
include an escape pod for the astronauts. One wonders whether a good
system would also include the ability to recover the payload when the
launch was aborted.

In addition, the practicality of the entire spaceplane is questionable
for simple tasks. It has a huge cargo bay plus a seven-person crew
cabin. Thus, it is an exceedingly large and expensive transportation
system that can only achieve low earth orbit. In addition to being
impractical, with a 1.5% failure rate, it can be regarded as unreliable.

A less spectacular NASA failure is represented by the Liberty Bell. This
Mercury capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on July 21, 1961.
The official, disputed, story is that the hatch malfunctioned and
admitted sea water causing it to sink. Gus Grissom narrowly managed to
escape (NASA 2000).

A hair-raising event on Apollo 13 garnered worldwide attention when a
liquid oxygen tank exploded. The crew managed to survive by using the
lunar lander as a \"lifeboat.\" Prior to the flight, the problem
container had suffered numerous glitches, but was deemed \"safe\" and
used anyway (NASA 2009).

A truly bad day for NASA and the European Space Agency was when the
**[[Hubble]{.underline}]{.mark}** Space Telescope [[started to
broadcast]{.underline}]{.mark} images [[from space]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[They were blurry]{.underline}]{.mark}. The device was proclaimed to be
able to produce exceptionally clear photographs free from atmospheric
distortion. These pictures were anything but. The Hubble became the butt
of jokes (Fox News 2009). Its mirror had the incorrect focal length
making it nearsighted. Some people suggested it had been **[[designed by
Mr. Magoo]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This was an optical error, of the most
basic, bone-headed variety, rendering the exceedingly expensive
instrument useless. Fortunately, it could be fixed by the installation
of some corrective lenses. Oops, that meant an additional high-cost,
high-risk, space shuttle launch and spacewalk to install the fix (Pearce
2012).

#### Commercial space is crucial\-\--their ev makes fun of revolutionary tech changes that socialists could only dream of innovating. 

**Rinehart '21** \[William and Adam Thierer; August 5; "Why Capitalists
in Space Are Good for Americans' Future,"
https://regproject.org/blog/why-capitalists-in-space-are-good-for-americans-future/\]

But the harshest critics have the story backwards. [[We are on the
precipice of an **epochal shift**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that will help
make space travel cheaper, safer, and more accessible]{.underline}.
Thanks to nearly two decades of reform at NASA, American
entrepreneurialism and ingenuity are flourishing in space. The story is
told as a failure, but it is actually a sign of success.

While many praised Bezos, Branson, and Elon Musk of SpaceX for using
their fortunes to advance private space travel and exploration, with the
goal of even getting to Mars, a [vocal group of detractors blasted these
capitalists for having the audacity to look toward the stars at
all.]{.underline}

[[Discouraging **private space**]{.mark} **exploration**]{.underline}
[[would]{.mark} be a step backwards]{.underline} and
**[[undo]{.underline}]{.mark}** positive [**[reforms]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[made space more]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[accessible]{.underline}]{.mark} and affordable. The way that
[NASA]{.underline} did things [changed]{.underline} dramatically [in
2005]{.underline} when Mike Griffin took over as Administrator. In early
2006, the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services
(**[[COTS]{.underline}]{.mark}**) program was announced, which
[[aimed]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} spend \$500
million to [[develop]{.mark} and demonstrate **[commercial space]{.mark}
launches**]{.underline}. It was unlike anything NASA had tried before.
Instead of detailed requirements which were typical at the time, COTS
spent only three pages to lay out broad cargo and crew transportation
capabilities. [[Private industry was **left to innovate**]{.mark} on
their own to meet those requirements.]{.underline}

[These contractual [tweaks seem minor]{.mark}, [but they've been
**revolutionary**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for NASA and [for the space
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. [COTS pushed SpaceX and Blue Origin to
begin **developing reusable rockets**]{.underline}. [[SpaceX's Falcon
9]{.underline}]{.mark} rocket [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} since
**[[become a workhorse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, supplying the
International Space Station (ISS) and launching satellites into orbit.
Another milestone was reached last year when Americans were launched to
the ISS on a reused Falcon 9, the first time a U.S.-built space vehicle
accomplished this feat since the shuttering of the Shuttle program.

COTS and its follow-on programs demonstrate what innovation can
accomplish when coupled with policy reforms. About a decade ago, NASA
ran the numbers on Falcon 9 and estimated its traditional system of
contracting would have cost taxpayers \$4 billion. SpaceX did it for
\$443 million, a tenth of the cost. NASA estimated that COTS' successor,
the Commercial Crew program, saved the agency some \$20 billion to \$30
billion over its lifetime, ultimately reducing the cost of launching
hardware into space.

[[Cheap launches mean]{.underline}]{.mark} Starlink
[[broadband]{.underline}]{.mark} internet [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
potentially [[feasible]{.underline}]{.mark} for rural regions. Cheap
launches mean satellites like Sentinel 6 which track climate change are
easier to deploy. They mean [[more experiments in space and a]{.mark}
**[better understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of our
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. But yes, cheap launches also mean
billionaires can hitch a ride to space, even if some mistakenly claim
it's just the rich living out their fantasies.

#### Commercial space is vital to developing efficient and resilient techs capable of developing space. 

**Nelson '20** \[Peter Lothian and Walter Block; 2020; professional
engineer; Space Capitalism: How Humans will Colonize Planets, Moons, and
Asteroids, Palgrave McMillan, ch. 1-2\]

[This **entire history of [space launches]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[illustrate]{.mark}s [the problem with]{.mark} all [government
programs]{.mark}]{.underline}. A letter from von Braun to Lyndon Johnson
(Von Braun, W. 1961) marvelously demonstrates the ossified thinking that
afflicted the plans for space travel of both Russia and the United
States. In a missive intended to answer questions put forward by John F.
Kennedy and forwarded by Johnson, von Braun spelled out the capabilities
and needs of the space program as compared to the Soviet Union. In this
letter, there are alternatives suggested: multi-stage super-rockets with
liquid fuel, rendezvous in Earth\'s orbit to enable the use of smaller
launch vehicles, strapping together several small rockets, nuclear fuel,
and solid chemical propellants. This document goes on to discuss work
hours, shifts, and whether \"we are making a maximum effort? Are we
achieving necessary results?\"

[The \"ossified\" response dismisses these alternative]{.underline}s to
a large, multistage, liquid-fueled super-rocket, though it would be fair
to say that some previous investigations might have looked more
extensively at those approaches. In other words, the dismissals might
not have been totally cavalier. More to the point, [there is **no
mention** at all of achieving space travel using any method other than
vertical take-off rocketry.]{.underline} However, as history amply
demonstrates, other methods are not only conceivable, but eminently
viable.

But are not the present authors guilty of foisting on our readers a sort
of self-contradiction with our previous comments? A critic might say of
us that on the one hand we maintain that private rocketry is good, the
governmental version thereof bad. And, that we use von Braun as an
example of the former. On the other hand, we also maintain that his
thinking was \"ossified,\" and this phenomenon must of course be placed
not in the asset column, but in the debit one. No, we reject this
possible criticism. We want to have our cake and eat it too; we stick to
both sides of this story. Yes, [this rocket scientist initially worked
mostly on his own separated from government, and we welcomed this
occurrence. On the other hand, when he later worked for government, he
became fossilized, and there was little or nothing that backward-looking
institution could or did do to counteract this difficulty.]{.underline}

Market Competition

Adolf Hitler had it all wrong. He was a power junky. As such, he had to
control everything in which he was involved, using a top-down approach.
He needed to win the war. To accomplish that task, he collected
brilliant people to perform the necessary tasks. One such person was
Wernher von Braun who had made noteworthy progress based on his own
prior interests in rocketry. Rockets had enormous potential in military
applications. If anyone could bomb enemies of Germany from the sky
without warning, using methods that at the time were the stuff of
science fiction, von Braun would be the man. He was that brilliant and
creative. So the Chancellor appointed him to pursue that goal. The
mistake is the classical assumption shared by all central planners that
their system of command, control, and regulate can better accomplish an
arduous task than can the free-enterprise system. [Both the United
States and the U.S.S.R. fell right into that very same trap, demanding
their own V-2\'s and continued manufacturing bigger]{.underline},
vertical-launch, liquid-fueled launch [platforms well past the time when
they made sense.]{.underline}

**[The [better]{.mark} way]{.underline}**, [and one of the main reasons
your authors advocate private space exploration]{.underline}, **[[is
market competition]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Rather than]{.mark} search
for \"**the [one best\" creative innovator]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[let anyone]{.mark} interested [develop]{.mark}]{.underline}** his
own solution to the problem. Of course, the statists of the world will
misinterpret that statement. Their half-way response will be to host a
contest wherein people will submit ideas to accomplish a given goal. Why
is that half-way? The authorities will still leave themselves in charge
of selecting \"the best\" alternative. One could argue that at least it
would open more potential designs to consideration; that may be, but in
the end only one program is executed, or attempted. Inevitably using
cronyism, the supposed best theory is that presented either by the
finest salesman or the most well-known, good old boy---not the most
efficient concept.

Real market competition, not a crony capitalist approach, means that the
individuals set **[the agenda]{.underline}**. A Howard Roark (Rand, A.
1943) may conceive of a new product. He can, if he wishes, research the
market to find whether anyone is interested and proceed by implementing
this idea. If not self-financed, he would seek venture capitalists who
for their own protection vet his creation and determine its
practicality.

The mistake made by the statists in this regard is to fail to realize
that the free-enterprise system constitutes an ongoing process.
Government bureaucrats may choose an entrepreneur who has succeeded in
the past.

But this is no guarantee of future attainment. In the marketplace, the
businessman must prove himself every moment. Previous profitability is
no guarantee of a good bottom line even the very next day. The Fortune
500 changes, drastically, every decade. Where are the Packards or Trans
World Airlines and their ilk nowadays? This brutal market test of profit
and loss is ongoing. A businessman selected by the state apparatus no
longer must please customers, employees, suppliers. He is himself now a
bureaucrat, no longer a part of the marketplace.

[[Rather than focus]{.mark} the entire space effort [on
a]{.mark}]{.underline} rather **[[silly]{.underline}]{.mark}**
adolescent **[[goal]{.underline}]{.mark}** [such as beating Russia to
the Moon]{.underline}, this book affirms that the private entrepreneur
should set up shop there for no other reason than that he thinks it has
exciting potential. In his view, numerous people would want to go there
and harvest all that green cheese. More seriously, [there are many
legitimate]{.underline} reasons that potential customers may wish to
travel to that brilliant orb; and entrepreneurs able to do so will step
up to provide that service. **[[Given economic freedom, many
programs]{.mark} will [operate in parallel]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As
[time passes, [some of those will fall]{.mark} [by the
wayside]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The most **efficient** and
**resilient**]{.underline}]{.mark} [will [remain]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Some may even be found to address profitable goals other than space
travel. [It is **impossible to know before**]{.mark}**-
hand**]{.underline} [[what]{.underline}]{.mark} inventions [[might
come]{.underline}]{.mark} to the fore, but two speculative launch
platforms, which we shall now discuss, are aircraft and elevators.

### Space Impact\-\--1AR

#### Capitalist space development solves extinction. 

**Nelson '20** \[Peter Lothian and Walter Block; 2020; professional
engineer; Space Capitalism: How Humans will Colonize Planets, Moons, and
Asteroids, Palgrave McMillan, ch. 1-2\]

Pretty much anything touched by government comes with fatal flaws
starting with corruption and compulsion.
[[Eliminating]{.underline}]{.mark} state involvement in space frees
people rather than limits them. Besides, the ruling powers notoriously
mismanage all enterprises. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,
because that very incompetence makes the venture appear far more
expensive than it really needs to be.

[The record of \"**[picking winners]{.mark}**\" on the part of governing
establishments **[does not engender]{.mark}** much [confidence]{.mark}
in government\'s]{.underline} [capacity to promote this]{.underline}
[goal]{.underline}. Nor is \"contracting out\" to private interests
likely to provide efficiency in this context. If government cannot do
the job itself, there is no reason to believe it will be effective in
choosing and funding collaborators. In addition, we believe that even if
the state could be effective in promoting such tasks, it would still be
improper for it to do so, since its funds are mulcted, unwillingly, from
their rightful owners, the long-suffering taxpayers (Rothbard, M. 1998).

In addition to the two primary themes, in a third we note that [[our
species]{.underline}]{.mark}, while admirable in many ways such as the
need to explore, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also often [quite silly and
even more **[destructive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[We have developed
**w**]{.mark}eapons of **[m]{.mark}**ass
**[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline}, and one despicable government
apparatus, venerated by many worldwide, even used them, twice, in 1945.
But [[we do not need]{.mark} to resort to such high technology [to
murder]{.mark} our [fellow creatures]{.mark}. We are fully capable of
doing so on a massive scale]{.underline}, without such sophistication.
Estimates are that governments have done away with almost 200 million of
their citizens in the twentieth century, and this is apart from wars8
and traffic fatalities on public highways.

In support of this contention, much in the following pages details the
violent nature and destructive results of states. The same applies to
would- be governments like ISIS and others that go around shooting
police officers. In recent days and months, the evening news (of
whichever source the reader consults) has been filled with graphical
depictions of bombings and shootings. These are being done by those who
do not so much disapprove of government per-se but who do not like this
state and wish to substitute their own. In addition to being anarchists,
we do not approve of would-be states either. As Shaw (1903) said: \"He
who slays a king and he who dies for him are alike idolaters.\" We
concur completely that one who ambushes or kills or purposely injures
policemen simply lowers himself to the level of these idolaters. To be
libertarian requires adoption of the Non-Aggression Principle. That in
turn does not admit of murder, assault, or aggression in any way
whatsoever against even those of whom we most strongly disapprove.

[[How will space]{.mark} travel [help alleviate mankind\'s]{.mark}
[tendency to kill]{.mark} us]{.underline}? Simple. [[If we can
establish]{.mark} [colonies]{.mark} starting with the Moon,]{.underline}
Venus, and Mars, and then later, as improved technology will permit, on
other planets and moons, [[the odds will improve that if]{.mark} [people
blow up any one home]{.mark} of the human race, **[there will still be
others]{.mark}**, so that our species will still \"live long and
prosper]{.underline}.\"

#### Only [commercial]{.underline} space can facilitate [space-for-space industry]{.underline}\-\--that solves economic [sustainability]{.underline}. 

**Sarang '21** \[Mehak and Matt Weinzierl; Feb 12; Research Associate at

In 2019, 95% of the estimated \$366 billion in revenue earned in the
space sector was from the space-for-earth economy: that is, goods or
services produced in space for use on earth. The
[[space]{.underline}]{.mark}-for-earth economy includes
telecommunications and internet infrastructure, earth observation
capabilities, national security satellites, and more. [This economy [is
booming]{.mark}, and [though]{.mark} research shows that [it faces the
**challenge**]{.mark}**s** [of]{.mark} overcrowding and
**[monopolization]{.mark}**]{.underline} that tend to arise whenever
companies compete for a scarce natural resource, [projections for its
future are **optimistic**. [Decreasing costs for launch]{.mark} and
space hardware in general have [enticed **new entrants**]{.mark} into
this market, and [companies]{.mark} in a variety of industries
[have]{.mark} already [begun]{.mark} leveraging]{.underline}
[[sat]{.mark}ellite [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [and access to
space [to **drive innovation**]{.mark} and **efficiency**]{.underline}
in their earthbound products and services.

In contrast, the space-for-space economy --- that is, goods and services
produced in space for use in space, such as mining the Moon or asteroids
for material with which to construct in-space habitats or supply
refueling depots --- has struggled to get off the ground. As far back as
the 1970s, research commissioned by NASA predicted the rise of a
space-based economy that would supply the demands of hundreds,
thousands, even millions of humans living in space, dwarfing the
space-for-earth economy (and, eventually, the entire terrestrial economy
as well). The realization of such a vision would change how all of us do
business, live our lives, and govern our societies --- but to date,
we've never even had more than 13 people in space at one time, leaving
that dream as little more than science fiction.

Today, however, there is reason to think that [we may]{.underline}
finally be [reach]{.underline}ing the first stages of [a true
**space-for-space economy**]{.underline}. SpaceX's recent achievements
(in cooperation with NASA), as well as upcoming efforts by Boeing, Blue
Origin, and Virgin Galactic to put people in space sustainably and at
scale, mark the opening of a new chapter of spaceflight led by private
firms. These firms have both the intention and capability to bring
private citizens to space as passengers, tourists, and --- eventually
--- settlers, opening the door for businesses to start meeting the
demand those people create over the next several decades with an array
of space-for-space goods and services.

Welcome to the (Commercial) Space Age

In our recent research, we examined how the model of centralized,
government-directed human space activity born in the 1960s has, over the
last two decades, made way for a new model, in which public initiatives
in space increasingly share the stage with private priorities.
[[Centralized]{.underline}]{.mark}, government-led space
[[programs]{.mark} will [**inevitably** focus on **space-for-earth
activities**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that are]{.underline} [[in the public
interest]{.mark}, such as national security, basic science, and national
pride]{.underline}. [This is only natural, as expenditures for these
programs must be justified by demonstrating benefits for
citizens]{.underline} --- and the citizens these governments represent
are (nearly) all on earth.

[**[In contrast]{.mark} to governments**, [the private sector is
**eager** to put people in **space**]{.mark} to pursue their own
personal interests, not the state's --- and then supply the demand they
create. This is the vision driving SpaceX, which in its first twenty
years has entirely upended the rocket launch industry]{.underline},
securing 60% of the global commercial launch market and building
ever-larger spacecraft designed to ferry passengers not just to the
International Space Station (ISS), but also to its own promised
settlement on Mars.

Today, [the space-for-space market is limited to supplying the people
who are already in space]{.underline}: that is, the handful of
astronauts employed by NASA and other government programs. While SpaceX
has grand visions of supporting large numbers of private space
travelers, their current space-for-space activities have all been in
response to demand from government customers (i.e., NASA). But [as
decreasing launch costs enable [companies]{.mark} like SpaceX to
[leverage]{.mark} **economies of [scale]{.mark}** []{.mark}and put more
people into space, [growing private]{.mark} sector
[demand]{.mark}]{.underline} (that is, tourists and settlers, rather
than government employees) [could turn these]{.underline}
**[proof-of-concept initiatives]{.underline}** [[into]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **[[sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[large-scale
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This model --- of selling to NASA with the hopes of eventually creating
and expanding into a larger private market --- is exemplified by SpaceX,
but the company is by no means the only player taking this approach. For
instance, while SpaceX is focused on space-for-space transportation,
another key component of this burgeoning industry will be manufacturing.

Made In Space, Inc. has been at the forefront of manufacturing "in
space, for space" since 2014, when it 3D-printed a wrench onboard the
ISS. Today, the company is exploring other products, such as
high-quality fiber-optic cable, that terrestrial customers may be
willing to pay to have manufactured in zero-gravity. But the company
also recently received a \$74 million contract to 3D-print large metal
beams in space for use on NASA spacecraft, and future private sector
spacecraft will certainly have similar manufacturing needs which Made In
Space hopes to be well-positioned to fulfill. Just as SpaceX has begun
by supplying NASA but hopes to eventually serve a much larger,
private-sector market, Made In Space's current work with NASA could be
the first step along a path towards supporting a variety of
private-sector manufacturing applications for which the costs of
manufacturing on earth and transporting into space would be prohibitive.

Another major area of space-for-space investment is in building and
operating space infrastructure such as habitats, laboratories, and
factories. Axiom Space, a current leader in this field, recently
announced that it would be flying the "first fully private commercial
mission to space" in 2022 onboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon Capsule. Axiom
was also awarded a contract for exclusive access to a module of the ISS,
facilitating its plans to develop modules for commercial activity on the
station (and eventually, beyond it).

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} infrastructure [[is likely to **spur
investment**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [a wide array
of]{.underline} complementary [services]{.underline} to supply the
demand of the people living and working within it. For example, in
February 2020, Maxar Technologies was awarded a \$142 million contract
from NASA to develop a robotic construction tool that would be assembled
in space for use on low-Earth orbit spacecraft. Private sector
spacecraft or settlements will no doubt have need for a variety of
similar construction and repair tools.

And of course, [the private sector isn't just about industrial
products]{.underline}. [Creature comforts also promise to be an area of
rapid growth, as [companies]{.mark} endeavor to [support]{.mark} the
human side of life in [the **harsh environment**]{.mark} **of
space**]{.underline}. In 2015, for example, Argotec and Lavazza
collaborated to build an espresso machine that could function in the
zero-gravity environment of the ISS, delivering a bit of everyday luxury
to the crew.

To be sure, people have dreamt of using the vacuum and weightlessness of
space to source or make things that cannot be made on earth for half a
century, and time and again the business case has failed to pan out.
Skepticism is natural. Those failures, however, have been in
space-for-earth applications. For example, two startups of the 2010s,
Planetary Resources, Inc. and Deep Space Industries, recognized the
potential of space mining early on. For both companies, however, the
lack of a space-for-space economy meant that their near-term survival
depended on selling mined material --- precious metals or rare elements
--- to earthbound customers. When it became clear that demand was
insufficient to justify the high costs, funding dried up, and both
companies pivoted to other ventures.

These were failures of space-for-earth business models --- but the
demand for in-space mining of raw building material, metals, and water
will be enormous once humans are living in space (and are therefore far
cheaper to supply). In other words, when people are living and working
in space, we are likely to look back on these early asteroid mining
companies less as failures and more as simply ahead of their time.

Seizing the Space-for-Space Opportunity

The [opportunity presented by the **[space-for-space]{.mark}
economy**]{.underline} [is huge]{.underline} --- [but it [could]{.mark}
**easily [be missed]{.mark}**. To seize this moment, policymakers must
provide **regulatory**]{.underline} [and **institutional
frameworks**]{.underline} [that will [enable]{.mark} the
**[risk-taking]{.mark}** and **innovation**]{.underline} [necessary [for
a]{.mark} decentralized, [private]{.mark}-sector-driven [space
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are three specific policy areas we
believe will be especially important:

1\. [Enabling private individuals to take on greater risk than would be
tolerable for **government-employed astronauts**.]{.underline}

First, as part of a general shift to that more decentralized,
market-oriented space sector, policymakers should consider allowing
private space tourists and settlers to voluntarily take on more risk
than states would tolerate for government-employed astronauts. In the
long run, ensuring high safety levels will be essential to convince
larger numbers of people to travel or live in space, but in the early
years of exploration, [[too great an **aversion**]{.mark} [**to risk**
will stop progress]{.mark} before it starts.]{.underline}

An instructive analogy can be found in how NASA works with its
contractors: In the mid-2000s, NASA shifted from using cost-plus
contracts (in which NASA shouldered all the economic risk of investing
in space) to fixed-price contracts (in which risk was distributed
between NASA and their contractors). Because of private companies'
greater tolerance for risk, this shift catalyzed a burst of activity in
the sector --- sometimes referred to as "New Space." [A similar shift in
how we approach **voluntary risk-taking**]{.underline} [by
private-sector astronauts may be necessary in order to launch the
space-for-space economy]{.underline}.
