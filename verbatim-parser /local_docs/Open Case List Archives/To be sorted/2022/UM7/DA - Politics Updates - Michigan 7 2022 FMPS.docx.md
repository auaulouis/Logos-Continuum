### Midterms 2AC -- Dems Losing Now

#### Democrats are losing now -- Biden's disapproval ratings are higher than ever. 

**Lindsay 7-19** (James M. Lindsay, 7-19-2022, \"A Midterm Election
Update,\" Council on Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/midterm-election-update)

Back in March, I reviewed what we know about U.S. congressional midterm
elections. [The big takeaway was that the president's party generally
loses House seats, but not necessarily Senate seats. **That is
especially true when the president is struggling in the
polls**.]{.underline} [With President Joe Biden's approval rating at 42
percent eight months out from Election Day, that historical pattern was
**bad news for Democrats and good news for Republicans**.]{.underline}
The one bright spot for Democrats was that the decennial redistricting
of House seats looked to be going in their favor. So where do things
stand three and a half months from Election Day? [**The picture appears
to have gotten darker for the Democrats**---at least when it comes to
holding onto the House. Biden's average public approval rating now
stands at 38 percent, and **his average disapproval rating at 57
percent**. To put those numbers in perspective, **no elected president
since World War II has been lower in the polls at this point in his
presidency.**]{.underline} (Scientific polling didn't begin until the
1940s, so we can't compare Biden's numbers with, say, James Buchanan's.)
Barring a turn in events, Biden is more likely to hurt than help the
chances of Democratic congressional candidates. [**The bad news doesn't
end there for Democrats.** **The once-promising results of decennial
redistricting have dimmed.** New York State's Court of Appeals tossed
out a redistricting plan drafted by the state's Democratic-controlled
legislature that would have added as many as three Democratic seats to
New York's congressional delegation. New York instead adopted a
redistricting plan drawn up by a court-appointed special master that
created more competitive districts and opened up the possibility that
Republicans might gain seats. In Maryland, a court struck down the
Democratic-controlled state legislature's initial redistricting proposal
as "extreme partisan gerrymandering."]{.underline} The revised plan
passed by the Maryland legislature likely will preserve the state's one
Republican congressional seat. [**Republicans, meanwhile, got good news
on the redistricting front.** The most significant development was in
Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis used his veto to force the
Republican-controlled state legislature to abandon a redistricting plan
that had only a slight Republican bias. After much back-and-forth, the
legislature approved the plan that DeSantis drew up. It's projected to
give Florida Republicans four more House seats than they had under the
old map.]{.underline}

#### Republicans are on track to winning both the House and the Senate. 

**Roche 7-7** (Darragh Roche, 7-7-2022, \"Democrats\' worst case
scenario for the midterms,\" Newsweek,
https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-worst-case-scenario-midterms-joe-biden-republicans-1722543)

[**Democrats are widely expected to suffer defeats in the upcoming 2022
midterm elections, with Republicans aiming to retake the House of
Representatives and the Senate.** The serving president\'s party usually
performs poorly during midterms and while **it seems likely President
Joe Biden will see major losses this November**, it\'s not clear just
how bad things will be for the Democrats. Polls suggest the
**Democrats** are on course for disappointment and that the party
**could potentially lose control of both chambers of Congress and see
newly empowered Republican majorities stymying Biden\'s agenda in the
run up to the next presidential election**.]{.underline} A GOP gain in
either chamber would hamstring the Biden administration, but the worst
case scenario would see comfortable Republican majorities in both
chambers, potentially leading to a slew of investigations and possibly
even impeachment of the president.

Losing the Senate

[**Poll tracker FiveThirtyEight\'s 2022 election forecast rates the
Senate as a toss up with 35 seats up for re-election**.]{.underline}
Fourteen are currently held by Democrats and 21 by Republicans.

[FiveThirtyEight gives Republicans an 80 percent chance of holding
between 47 and 54 seats. If that latter figure is reached, **it would
represent a major defeat for Biden\'s party.**]{.underline}

The Senate is currently divided between 50 Republicans, 48 Democrats and
two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Vice President Kamala
Harris has had to use her casting vote on a number of occasions and a
single Democratic loss in the midterms would hand control to the
Republicans.

[FiveThirtyEight rates the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and
Pennsylvania as toss-ups. **If Republicans can win all four, it would be
a major loss for the Democrats.**]{.underline}

Three of those seats are held by incumbent Democrats, while Republican
Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania is retiring.

However, it\'s highly unlikely that Republicans could gain enough seats
in November to secure a 60-vote, filibuster proof majority. This means
Democrats are likely to deploy the filibuster if the GOP retakes the
chamber.

Nonetheless, a Republican-led Senate could hold up Biden\'s judicial
nominees and potentially prevent him filling any vacant seats that might
arise on the U.S. Supreme Court, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell did in 2016 when he was majority leader.

A Republican House

[**Republicans are favored to win the House,** according to
FiveThirtyEight, while Democrats currently hold 220 seats to
Republicans\' 210, with five seats vacant.]{.underline}

[The poll tracker\'s analysis gives Republicans an 80 percent chance of
holding between 215 and 258 seats. If the larger figure proves accurate,
that would be a huge gain for the GOP,]{.underline} though it remains an
outside possibility.

The single worst midterm loss of House seats occurred in 2010 when
Democrats lost 63 seats under then President Barack Obama. However,
Obama\'s party retained control of the Senate until the 2014 midterms.

**[It seems likely that Republican gains this year will be more modest
but that the GOP will still win the House.]{.underline}** That will
allow House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to become speaker for the
first time and possibly mean the end of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s
political career.

FiveThirtyEight\'s generic congressional ballot shows Republicans with
44.8 percent support to the Democrats\' 43.2 percent, as of July 6 - a
margin of just 1.7 percent.

#### Republicans are widely expected to win despite minor fallbacks. 

**Marriner and Reklaitis 7-22** (Katie Marriner, Victor Reklaitis,
7-22-2022, \"Republicans still favored in midterm elections, but their
chances for taking back Senate are dropping,\" MarketWatch,
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/republicans-still-favored-in-midterm-elections-but-their-chances-for-taking-back-senate-are-dropping-11657887755)

[**Republicans are widely expected to score wins in this November's
midterm elections, thanks in large part to Americans' frustrations with
raging inflation.** High prices for gasoline RB00, -0.05% and other
essentials are helping to **keep President Joe Biden's approval ratings
low** --- and giving a talking point for Republicans to use against
Biden and his fellow Democrats.]{.underline} But the GOP's odds for
taking back control of the Senate have fallen significantly this month,
as shown in the chart below that's based on data from betting market
PredictIt. They're down to just above 60%, off from nearly 80% in
mid-June. **[Republicans' odds for regaining the House haven't seen that
type of drop and remain strong, staying well above 80%.]{.underline}**

Odds

Here are the chances that Republicans or Democrats will have control of
the\...

Senate The decline in the GOP's Senate odds has come as polls in some
key races favor Democrats. In Pennsylvania's Senate race, for example,
polls have given Democratic candidate John Fetterman 6- and 9-point
advantages over GOP nominee Mehmet Oz. In Georgia's contest, incumbent
Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has a 3-point edge over Republican
candidate Herschel Walker, according to a RealClearPolitics average of
surveys. [**To be sure, the GOP still looks likely to take back the
50-50 Senate, which Democrats currently control only because Vice
President Kamala Harris can cast tiebreaking votes. It's tough for
Democrats to keep their grip on the chamber** "in a situation where
Senate outcomes correlate heavily with presidential job approval," said
Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, in a column
last week.]{.underline} "While Republican candidate quality is an issue,
good analysis should not lose sight of the fact that environment matters
as well, and probably more so these days," Trende wrote. "While we
should give more than a cursory nod to the possibility that Democrats
will hold the Senate (unlike the possibility that Democrats will hold
the House, which is barely worth that nod), **[we should also say with
some confidence that Republicans are the favorites to
win]{.underline}**," he also said. The additional charts below shows key
Senate races to watch, as well as the performance of each party in a
generic congressional ballot.

### Midterms 2AC -- House GOP Winning

#### Republicans are winning the House now. 

**Gonzales 7-14** (Nathan L. Gonzales, 7-14-2022, \"Ratings show GOP
taking House control, but no red wave --- yet,\" Roll Call,
https://rollcall.com/2022/07/14/ratings-show-gop-taking-house-control-but-no-red-wave-yet/)

ANALYSIS --- **[If the election were held today, it looks as if
Republicans would gain seven House seats, according to Inside Elections'
individual race ratings.]{.underline}** While that would be enough for
the majority, it certainly wouldn't qualify as a red wave. [**Still,
that doesn't mean Democrats can rest easy, and GOP gains are likely to
be higher.** If you tally all the races rated as Solid Republican,
Likely Republican, Lean Republican and Tilt Republican, and split the 18
Toss-up races evenly, **Republicans would have 221 seats. That would be
a net gain of seven seats**. They need a net gain of only four for the
majority.]{.underline} Of course, Republicans wouldn't turn that down,
but it would be a minuscule gain and a massive disappointment for the
GOP because the expectations and current projections are high. Over the
past century, the president's party has lost an average of 30 House
seats in midterm elections. Midterm elections are typically performance
reviews on the sitting president, and Joe Biden's job rating is in rough
shape. He's at 39 percent approve and 56 percent disapprove, according
to the latest FiveThirtyEight average, with no sign of a rebound.
[**Seventy-five percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong
track**, compared with just 18 percent who believe the country is headed
in the right direction, according to the RealClearPolitics average.
**That's usually not good for the party in power**, and Democrats
control the executive and legislative branches of government. **When
people are asked which party they want in control of Congress,
Republicans have a 1.9-point lead**, according to the averages on
FiveThirtyEight and on RealClearPolitics]{.underline}. At least one
model, from Emory University professor Alan Abramowitz, suggests that a
generic ballot lead of that size should power Republicans to a 19-seat
gain in the House.

### Midterms 1NC -- Dems Winning

#### Dems are closing up the gap because of Roe v. Wade. 

**Landen 7-23** (Xander Landen, 7-23-2022, \"Democrats narrow Congress
poll gap to Republicans, closest for 6 months,\" Newsweek,
https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-narrow-congress-poll-gap-republicans-closest-6-months-1727397)

[**Democrats are narrowing the gap with Republicans in polling ahead of
this year\'s midterm congressional races**, according to analysis from
FiveThirtyEight. FiveThirtyEight, which compiles generic congressional
ballot polls, shows that as of July 22, Republicans have a 1-point lead
over Democrats, with 44.2 percent of voters saying that they\'d back GOP
candidates while 43.2 percent say they\'d support Democrats. The latest
numbers mark the closest the polling average has been since January,
when surveys showed Republicans had only a slight advantage over
Democrats.]{.underline} In early January, Republicans were up by only
0.5 percent in the polls. Republicans\' lead grew in February to nearly
3 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight, before remaining at around 2
percent for months.

Democrats Narrow Congress Poll Gap to Republicans

[**Democrats are narrowing the gap** with Republicans in polling ahead
of the 2022 midterm congressional races, according to analysis from
FiveThirtyEight. Above, a voter casts her ballot at a polling station
during the midterm primary election on June 21 in Alexandria,
Virginia.]{.underline} On July 4, FiveThirtyEight analysis showed
Republicans with 44.8 percent support on the generic congressional
ballot Democrats enjoyed support from 42.8 percent of Americans---a lead
of 2 percent for the GOP. [It\'s unclear what has led to the narrowing
in polling averages. However, some analysts have suggested that the
**Supreme Court\'s decision overturning the landmark abortion-rights
ruling Roe v. Wade in June could help Democrats win in the midterms.**
Rebecca J. Kreitzer, associate professor of public policy at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told Newsweek this month
that the development may help **\"mobilize support\" for Democratic
candidates more than Republican ones.**]{.underline} \"Time will tell if
Democrats are about to maintain the current levels of outrage among the
mass public. The news cycle moves incredibly fast in this era,\"
Kreitzer said. \"However, **[this is the first time in our history that
a fundamental constitutional right was taken away.\"\\]{.underline}**

#### Now is key for the Dems -- GOP approval rates are plummeting. 

**Ramos 7-15** (Kristian Ramos, 7-15-2022, \"Democrats\' time to pounce:
Republicans suddenly find themselves vulnerable ahead of midterms ,\"
Salon,
<https://www.salon.com/2022/07/15/democrats-time-to-pounce-suddenly-find-themselves-vulnerable-ahead-of-midterms/>)

[With the **approval of the Republican Party plummeting and gas and
commodity prices declining**, **Democrats suddenly have an opportunity
to go on offense** this midterm cycle by touting the success of the
pandemic recovery]{.underline} --- and contrasting that with the
draconian proposals offered by the alternative.

[To do this, Democrats must center the innovation and grit of the
American people and show how we are transitioning from a rapid recovery
to sustainable growth. Republicans, by contrast, have devolved into a
cult beholden to Donald Trump, doubling down on their support for him
despite the shocking revelations of the January 6
commission]{.underline}.

[Should they retake Congress, Republicans\' economic plan consists of
taxing the lower and middle class and offering no solution for dealing
with inflation. **The one thing they can claim credit for, successfully
striking down Roe V. Wade, is one of the most wildly unpopular actions
ever taken by the Supreme Court.**]{.underline} [The Supreme Court\'s
decision to **overturn Roe is driving voter motivation for Democrats.**
62% of voters say they are more motivated to vote in November after the
decision. 62% say they are more motivated to vote for Democrats,
including 55% of Independents.]{.underline} Just 27% say it makes them
more likely to vote for Republicans in November.

According to veteran Democrat political strategist Simon Rosenberg,
recent polling data suggests the race has moved 3-5 points to the
Democrats in recent weeks. [11 polls have been released on the generic
congressional perference since Roe ended. Seven of the 11 polls ---
**more than half** --- **show meaningful movement towards the Democrats
and give significant leads in the generic polling.**]{.underline}

[In new comprehensive polls of battleground states, Future Majority
found the generic ballot for congressional preference shifting from 43
Democrat - 45 Republican in March to 44-42 now**, a four-point swing**.
Another new survey of voters from Navigator finds a 24 point drop in GOP
favorability with independents and 10 points overall. This shift is very
significant in a short time and further confirms data that the
**national landscape is suddenly becoming better for
Democrats**.]{.underline}

[A review of recent Senate polling suggests that if the election were
held today, Democrats would retain the Senate and perhaps even pick up a
few seats. The New York Times gave a significant Senate overview, which
showed that in Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, and Nevada, **Democrats
are leading their GOP counterparts**.]{.underline} With Republicans
cratering with Independents and Democrats consistently leading in the
generic ballot, it is a new, competitive cycle. Democrats now must seize
this moment and make our case to voters about how left-leaning policies
have strengthened our country\'s economy.

In 2020 the economy was in free fall. The racial employment gap was
historically high. We have closed that gap today, adding 372,000 jobs to
a strong labor market in June. The unemployment rate is currently 3.6%
for the fourth month, just above a 50-year low. Average hourly wages
grew 5.1% in June compared to last year. [President Biden has created
4.5 times more jobs in 17 months than the previous 3 GOP Presidents
combined over 16 years.]{.underline}

Gas and commodity prices have finally begun to decrease, in a needed
reprieve from rising inflation and a hopeful sign that it may be
starting to level off. Crude oil has fallen more than 8% and is trading
at less than \$100 per barrel for the first time since early May. U.S.
oil production is at an all-time high, and the national average gas
price declined for the third week after increasing following Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine. The average price of a gallon of gas is now sitting
at about \$4.70, more than 33 cents less than when prices peaked last
month.

While commodity and gas prices continue to drop, we are increasing
domestic economic output. The construction of new manufacturing
facilities in the U.S. has soared 116% over the past year, dwarfing the
10% gain on all building projects combined. Massive chip factories are
being built in Phoenix: Intel is making two outside the city. Aluminum
and steel plants are being erected all across the south. This new
semiconductor and steel output will help increase economic productivity
domestically. Perhaps the most obvious sign that things are improving:
this July, the baby formula plant at the center of recent shortages
reopened this month. Finally, our global supply chain is improving; \$
20,000 container import costs are now down to \$10,000, and shipping
times are down by 35%. While we are not yet back to pre-pandemic times,
things are trending in the right direction.

[**Democrats have helped lead a strong recovery** and have made critical
investments in our economy and the American people. They have
effectively led Americans through tough challenges -- COVID, Ukraine,
and the ups and downs of the economy.]{.underline}

#### Roe v Wade is helping the Democrats -- they'll slowly getting closer to a win. 

**Walker 6-30** (Chris Walker, 6-30-2022, "Dems Close Gap on GOP in
Midterm Poll Following Supreme Court's Upending of Roe",
https://truthout.org/articles/dems-close-gap-on-gop-in-midterm-poll-following-supreme-courts-upending-of-roe/)

[New polling continues to show that the 2022 midterm election outcome
will be a close one, as both Democratic and Republican parties appear to
be in a statistical tie on who voters prefer to run Congress next
term.]{.underline}

**[The Supreme Court's decision to end abortion rights protections
appears to be helping Democrats' numbers.]{.underline}**

In an Emerson College poll published on Friday, respondents were asked
who they would vote for today, if the midterms were happening right now.
Voters were split nearly evenly on the question, with 43.7 percent
saying they'd back the Democratic candidate in their House race versus
44.7 percent saying they'd prefer the Republican candidate to win.

The 1 point difference is within the survey's 2.9 point margin of error,
which means the two parties are essentially tied, according to the poll.

[Both parties' voters appear equally motivated to vote]{.underline},
with 93.4 percent of Democratic-leaning voters saying they are very or
somewhat motivated, and 93.2 percent of Republican-leaning voters saying
the same.

[Although showcasing a statistical tie between the two major parties,
**the news is probably more welcomed by Democrats**, as Emerson College
polls throughout the year have suggested Republicans were likely to lead
in the midterms. In February, Republicans led Democrats by 9 points**,
but that lead has gradually shrunk over the intervening
months**.]{.underline}

[Those supporting Democrats appear to be motivated in large part by the
Supreme Court's upending of abortion rights recognitions in a decision
issued last month.]{.underline} According to Spencer Kimball, executive
director of Emerson College Polling, ["**those who say abortion is the
top issue facing the nation are more motivated to vote this November
than any other issue group."**]{.underline}

"Among the nearly 1 in 10 voters for whom abortion is the top issue, 89%
are very motivated to vote this November; comparatively, 76% of voters
who say the economy is the top issue are very motivated to vote,"
Kimball said, adding that "voters who say abortion is the most important
issue break for the Democratic congressional candidate over Republicans
80% to 8%."

[The new polling numbers suggest it will be a tight race**, though
prognosticators continue to say that the midterms are the GOP's to
lose**.]{.underline} [Typically, the party of an incumbent president
tends to lose seats in the first midterm of their tenure --- **but this
year appears to be an atypical one, as this and other polls have
shown.**]{.underline}

### Midterms 1NC -- AT: Trump ahead now

#### Trump is slightly ahead now but the tables are turning because of abortion rights and gun control. 

**Cohn 7-16** (Nate Cohn, 7-16-2022, \"The Key Insights From Our First
Poll of the 2022 Midterms,\" The New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/16/upshot/poll-analysis-2022-midterms.html)

Which side has the most energy heading into November? More polls will
come as the midterm elections near, but for now we've wrapped up our
first New York Times/Siena survey, and here are some notable takeaways:
Voters are not happy. Just 13 percent of registered voters said America
was heading in the right direction. Only 10 percent said the economy was
excellent or good. And a majority of voters said the nation was too
politically divided to solve its challenges. As a point of comparison,
each of these figures shows a more pessimistic electorate than in
October 2020, when the pandemic was still raging and Donald J. Trump was
president. Joe Biden is in trouble. His approval rating in our poll was
in the low 30s. That's lower than we ever found for Mr. Trump. Democrats
would rather see someone else get the party's nomination in 2024. Mr.
Biden's age was as much of an issue among voters as his overall job
performance. Of course, he probably would have trailed "someone else"
ahead of the last presidential primary as well, but he still won the
nomination because his opposition was weak or fractured. Still, it's a
sign that Mr. Biden is much weaker than the typical president seeking
re-election. It could augur a contested primary. Democrats' Reasons for
a Different Candidate What's the most important reason you would prefer
someone other than Joe Biden to be the Democratic Party's 2024
presidential nominee? Asked of 191 respondents who said they planned to
vote in the 2024 Democratic primary and who preferred a candidate other
than Joe Biden in a New York Times/Siena College poll from July 5-7,
2022.By The New York Times **[Trump isn't doing great, either. Like Mr.
Biden, Mr. Trump has become less popular over the last two
years.]{.underline}** The number of Republicans who hold an unfavorable
view of him has doubled since our final polling in 2020. He's now under
50 percent in a hypothetical 2024 Republican primary matchup. Gov. Ron
DeSantis of Florida is already at 25 percent in an early test of the
Republican primary. [Mr. Trump may still be the front-runner, but the
polls increasingly look more like the early surveys from the Democratic
primary in 2008 --- when Hillary Clinton found herself in an extremely
close race and ultimately lost to Barack Obama --- than the polls ahead
of the Democratic primary in 2016, when she won a protracted battle
against Bernie Sanders.]{.underline} Many voters do not want to see a
2020 rematch. Mr. Biden still led Mr. Trump in a hypothetical 2024
matchup, 44 percent to 41 percent. What was surprising: Ten percent of
respondents volunteered that they would not vote at all or would vote
for someone else if those were the two candidates, even though the
interviewer didn't offer those choices as an option. [The midterm race
starts out close, with voters nearly evenly divided on the generic
congressional ballot]{.underline} [(voters are asked whether they prefer
Democrats or Republicans to be in control of Congress).]{.underline}
That's a little surprising, given expectations of a Republican landslide
this year.

elections?

from July 5-7. [The news is helping Democrats.]{.underline} The news has
been bad for Democrats, from recent court rulings to their frustrations
in trying to stop mass shootings, but for the moment it may be helping
the Democratic Party. [**Around 30 percent of voters combined said
topics related to guns, abortion and democracy were the most important
problem facing the country, and Democrats had a wide lead among these
voters.** **It's a big change from earlier in the cycle**, when
immigration, crime and questions about school curriculums seemed likely
to dominate the campaign --- and help Republicans. **Support for
abortion rights is up in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to
overturn Roe v. Wade.** **Sixty-five percent said they thought abortion
should be completely or mostly legal, up from 60 percent** in the last
Times/Siena poll that asked about the issue, in September
2020.]{.underline}

#### New DSCA initiatives require more human resources and oversight---the plan trades off

Arms Monitors to Ukraine,\" Defense One,
https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2022/06/pentagon-agency-wants-send-arms-monitors-ukraine/368867/

[DSCA]{.underline}, the agency in charge of foreign US arms sales,
[currently has no on-the-ground access to US-donated weapons to Ukraine
and whether they are being used as intended]{.underline}. This was
stated by Jed Royal, deputy director of the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency \[DSCA\] to journalists during a round table meeting last
Thursday \[June 30\]. Due to the war in Ukraine, no toolkit works as it
did in peacetime, i.e. going to a foreign country, opening military
warehouses, tracking serial numbers, the state of weaponry, its
availability, etc. Royal confirmed the view that currently in this
situation, **[DSCA officials are "somewhat limited" in their ability to
carry out more robust monitoring of weapons supplied to
Ukraine]{.underline}**. BulgarianMilitary.com recalls that in recent
weeks there have been allegations of illegal arms trade during wartime.
As we wrote, sources claim that Ukraine sold Russia two self-propelled
French Caesar howitzers. Ukraine \[France too\] rejects this claim. Last
month, a Javelin anti-tank guided missile system appeared for sale on
the darknet, with the place of purchase being Kyiv, the capital of
Ukraine. Jed Royal told reporters that officials will have to be more
creative in carrying out their duties, but only if the agency sends more
people into the field to conduct inspections. "Once we have more people
in the country, we should be in a position to actually go do more
physical validation \[and\] verification, going forward," he said.
"That's the kind of thing that we're looking for here. It still won't be
like a peacetime environment for it. So we're going to have to get
creative in how we do this." It has not yet been decided how and when
**[DSCA officials will begin inspections of weapons delivered to
Ukraine]{.underline}**. Royal is hoping to get a cooperation office in
Ukraine to house examiners, a practice worldwide carried out by the
agency. However, Royal does not want to send a "task force". Ukraine

solid and satisfactory". **[Congress wants the same]{.underline}**

under pilot project,\" No Publication,
https://sports.yahoo.com/news/u-approves-sale-bombs-nato-182401360.html?guccounter=1

WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved
the potential sale of precision guided munitions and equipment worth
[\$231 million]{.underline} to NATO\'s support and procurement agency,
[under a pilot program]{.underline} where the organization acts as a
lead buyer for member countries, the Pentagon said on Thursday.

The U.S. government last year announced **[a two-year project aimed
at]{.underline}** making it easier for [NATO and member
countries]{.underline} to share costs and buy weapons as a group as they
struggle to stretch scarce defense budgets.

U.S. arms sales have historically been conducted with individual
countries rather than alliances, in part because of concern about
transfers of technology to third parties.

But group procurements could help NATO meet U.S. demands for NATO
members to bolster spending on defense.

The **[U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency]{.underline}**, which
implements foreign arms sales, said the weapons would be transferred to
eight countries including Spain, Portugal and Denmark.

\"The proposed sale **[improves NATO members\' capability to meet
current and future ground threats with precisio]{.underline}**n,\" the
agency said.

Boeing Co and Raytheon Co will be the principal contractors for the
sale, the agency said in a notice to lawmakers posted on its website.

#### Fix and Kimmage 22(Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, Resident Fellow at the German Marshall Fund, Professor of History at the Catholic University of America, 2-18-2022, Foreign Affairs, "What if Russia Wins",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-02-18/what-if-russia-wins?check_logged_in=1&utm_medium=promo_email&utm_source=lo_flows&utm_campaign=registered_user_welcome&utm_term=email_1&utm_content=20220722)

[If Russia gains control of Ukraine or manages to destabilize it on a
major scale]{.underline}, a new era for the United States and for Europe
will begin. U.S. and European leaders would face the dual challenge of
rethinking European security and of not being drawn into a larger war
with Russia. [All sides would have to consider the potential of
nuclear-armed adversaries in direct confrontation.]{.underline} These
two responsibilities---robustly defending European peace and prudently
[avoiding military escalation with Russia---will not necessarily be
compatible]{.underline}. The United States and its allies could find
themselves deeply unprepared for the task of having to create a new
European security order as a result of Russia's military actions in
Ukraine.

For Russia, victory in Ukraine could take various forms. As in Syria,
victory does not have to result in a sustainable settlement. It could
involve the installation of a compliant government in Kyiv or the
partition of the country. Alternatively, the defeat of the Ukrainian
military and the negotiation of a Ukrainian surrender could effectively
transform Ukraine into a failed state. [Russia could also employ
devastating cyberattacks and disinformation tools, backed by the threat
of force, to]{.underline} ~~cripple~~[\[weaken\] the country and induce
regime change. With any of these outcomes, Ukraine will have been
effectively detached from the West.]{.underline}

If Russia achieves its political aims in Ukraine by military means,
Europe will not be what it was before the war. [Not only will U.S.
primacy in Europe have been qualified; any sense that the European Union
or NATO can ensure peace on the continent will be the artifact of a lost
age.]{.underline} Instead, security in Europe will have to be reduced to
defending the core members of the EU and NATO. Everyone outside the
clubs will stand alone, with the exception of Finland and Sweden. This
may not necessarily be a conscious decision to end enlargement or
association policies; but it will be de facto policy. Under a perceived
siege by Russia, [the EU and NATO will no longer have the capacity for
ambitious policies beyond their own borders.]{.underline}

[The United States and Europe will also be in a state of permanent
economic war with Russia.]{.underline} The West will seek to enforce
sweeping sanctions, which Russia is likely to parry with cyber-measures
and energy blackmailing, given the economic asymmetries. China might
well stand on Russia's side in this economic tit for tat. Meanwhile,
domestic politics in European countries will resemble a
twenty-first-century great game, in which Russia will be studying Europe
for any breakdown in the commitment to NATO and to the transatlantic
relationship. Through methods fair and foul, [Russia will take whatever
opportunity comes its way to influence public opinion and elections in
European countries. Russia will be an anarchic presence---sometimes
real, sometimes imagined---in every instance of European political
instability.]{.underline}

[Cold War analogies will not be helpful in a world with a Russianized
Ukraine]{.underline}. The Cold War border in Europe had its flash
points, but it was stabilized in a mutually acceptable fashion in the
Helsinki Final Act of 1975. By contrast, Russian suzerainty over Ukraine
would open a vast zone of destabilization and insecurity from Estonia to
Poland to Romania to Turkey. [For as long as it lasts, Russia's presence
in Ukraine will be perceived by Ukraine's neighbors as provocative and
unacceptable and, for some, as a threat to their own
security.]{.underline} Amid this shifting dynamic, order in Europe will
have to be conceived of in primarily military terms---which, since
Russia has a stronger hand in the military than in the economic realm,
will be in the Kremlin's interest---sidelining nonmilitary institutions
such as the European Union.

Russia has Europe's largest conventional military, which it is more than
ready to use. The EU's defense policy---in contrast to NATO's---is far
from being able to provide security for its members. [Thus will military
reassurance, especially of the EU's eastern members, be
key.]{.underline} Responding to a revanchist Russia with sanctions and
with the rhetorical proclamation of a rules-based international order
will not be sufficient.

#### Russian victory hurts Germany and tanks the global economy 

#### Fix and Kimmage 22 (Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage, Resident Fellow at the German Marshall Fund, Professor of History at the Catholic University of America, 2-18-2022, Foreign Affairs, "What if Russia Wins",https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-02-18/what-if-russia-wins?check_logged_in=1&utm_medium=promo_email&utm_source=lo_flows&utm_campaign=registered_user_welcome&utm_term=email_1&utm_content=20220722)

[In the event of a Russian victory in Ukraine, Germany's position in
Europe will be severely challenged.]{.underline} Germany is a marginal
military power that has based its postwar political identity on the
rejection of war. The ring of friends it has surrounded itself with,
especially in the east with [Poland and the Baltic states, risks being
destabilized by Russia.]{.underline} France and the United Kingdom will
assume leading roles in European affairs by virtue of their
comparatively strong militaries and long tradition of military
interventions. [The key factor in Europe, however, will remain the
United States. NATO will depend on U.S. support]{.underline} as will the
anxious and imperiled countries of Europe's east, the frontline nations
arrayed along a now very large, expanded, and uncertain line of contact
with Russia, including Belarus and the Russian-controlled parts of
Ukraine.

[Eastern member states, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
and Romania, will likely have substantial numbers of NATO troops
permanently stationed on their soil]{.underline}. A request from Finland
and Sweden to gain an Article 5 commitment and to join NATO would be
impossible to reject. In Ukraine, EU and NATO countries will never
recognize a new Russian-backed regime created by Moscow. But they will
face the same challenge they do with Belarus: wielding sanctions without
punishing the population and supporting those in need without having
access to them. Some NATO members will bolster a Ukrainian insurgency,
to which Russia will respond by threatening NATO members.

Ukraine's predicament will be very great. Refugees will flee in multiple
directions, quite possibly in the millions. And those parts of the
Ukrainian military that are not directly defeated will continue
fighting, echoing the partisan warfare that tore apart this whole region
of Europe during and after World War II.

[The permanent state of escalation between Russia and Europe may stay
cold from a military perspective. It is likely, though, to be
economically hot.]{.underline} The sanctions put on Russia in 2014,
which were connected to formal diplomacy (often referred to as the
"Minsk" process, after the city in which the negotiations were held),
were not draconian. They were reversible as well as conditional.
[Following a Russian invasion of Ukraine, new sanctions on banking and
on technology transfer would be significant and permanent]{.underline}.
They would come in the wake of failed diplomacy and would start at "the
top of the ladder," according to the U.S. administration. [In response,
Russia will retaliate, quite possibly in the cyber-domain as well as in
the energy sector. Moscow will limit access to critical goods such as
titanium, of which Russia has been the world's second-largest
exporter]{.underline}. This war of attrition will test both sides.
Russia will be ruthless in trying to get one or several European states
to back away from economic conflict by linking a relaxation in tension
to these countries' self-interest, thus undermining consensus in the EU
and NATO.

Europe's strong suit is its economic leverage. Russia's asset will be
any source of domestic division or disruption in Europe or in Europe's
transatlantic partners. Here Russia will be proactive and opportunistic.
If a pro-Russian movement or candidate shows up, that candidate can be
encouraged directly or indirectly. If an economic or political sore
point diminishes the foreign policy efficacy of the United States and
its allies, it will be a weapon for Russian propaganda efforts and for
Russian espionage.

Much of this is already happening. But a war in Ukraine will up the
ante. [Russia will use more resources and be unchained in its choice of
instruments]{.underline}. The massive refugee flows arriving in Europe
will exacerbate the EU's unresolved refugee policy and provide fertile
ground for populists. [The holy grail of these informational, political,
and cyberbattles will be the 2024 presidential election in the United
States.]{.underline} Europe's future will depend on this election. The
election of Donald Trump or of a Trumpian candidate might destroy the
transatlantic relationship at Europe's hour of maximum peril, putting
into question NATO's position and its security guarantees for Europe.

### DSCA AT: Ukraine Impact

#### More aid to Ukraine coming now

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [The White House announced Friday that the U.S. is
sending an additional \$270 million in security assistance to Ukraine, a
package that will include additional medium range rocket systems and
tactical drones.]{.underline} The latest tranche brings the total U.S.
security assistance committed to Ukraine by the [Biden administration to
\$8.2 billion, and is being paid for through \$40 billion in economic
and security aid for Ukraine approved by Congress in May. The new
package includes four High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS
and will allow Kyiv to acquire up to 580 Phoenix Ghost drones, both
crucial weapon systems that have allowed the Ukrainians to stay in the
fight despite Russian artillery supremacy,]{.underline} according to
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's coordinator for
strategic communications. The latest assistance also includes some
36,000 rounds of artillery ammunition and additional ammunition for the
HIMARS. ["The president has been clear that we're going to continue to
support the government of Ukraine and its people for as long as it
takes," Kirby said.]{.underline} Ukrainian forces have used U.S.-made
rocket launchers and tactical drones to destroy dozens of Russian
targets and hold at bay Russia's larger and more heavily equipped
forces.

### DSCA 2AC -- Turn 

#### DSCA increasing security cooperation weakens already fragile states and causes democratic backsliding 

Barbara **Salera 22**, 7-18-2022, \"The Case Against Security
Cooperation in Fragile States,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/07/the-case-against-security-cooperation-in-fragile-states/

A dark cloud hangs over the Department of Defense. After the "strategic
failure" that was Afghanistan, the department is struggling to figure
out how not to repeat it. In particular, the **[Defense Security
Cooperation Agency,]{.underline}** the lead agency for advising,
training, and equipping foreign governments, has taken a number of key
steps to prevent this from reoccurring. My fellow colleagues in the
agency, **[whose key mission is to build the military capacity of
foreign partners]{.underline}**, took the collapse in Afghanistan
particularly hard. After the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act the
agency established certification programs for its workforce and
introduced new concepts such as "building capacity" and "full-spectrum
capability." This is in addition to various other initiatives, such as
changing security cooperation planning methods and requiring the
assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of outcomes. Though these
initiatives predate the recent events in Afghanistan, they symbolize a
widespread recognition of a problem with how the United States conducts
military assistance, a recognition grimly underscored by the collapse of
the Afghan security forces in August 2021 and the failures of Iraqi
reconstruction. BECOME A MEMBER For years, [the United States has
struggled with how best to build foreign militaries, with minor
successes here and there but nothing substantial over the long
term.]{.underline} These noted difficulties have led to what Jahara
Matisek has called the "Faberge Egg army problem, an expensively built
military ... easily broken by insurgents." Some have argued that to
address these poor outcomes the [United States should consolidate and
simplify the complicated domestic processes used to execute security
cooperation]{.underline}, in addition to augmenting programs by building
the capacity of formal defense institutions. However, military
assistance outcomes will not improve simply by making the foreign
military sales process faster or by improving a country's defense
institutions, as argued by Jeremy Gwinn. Many past articles on security
cooperation focused on the minutiae of how to improve the process as
opposed to asking **[whether security cooperation is the best means by
which to accomplish national security objectives. Security cooperation
analyses have a tendency to focus on the "tactical" level of security
cooperation and concentrate on how to get the equipment to countries
faster, or what other augmentations or incentives the United States
should add to make it work]{.underline}**. My argument focuses on the
strategic use of security cooperation to accomplish wider American
interests in fragile states. By fragile states, I specifically reference
those countries that are dealing with "extensive corruption and criminal
behavior, inability to collect taxes or otherwise draw on citizen
support, large-scale involuntary dislocation of the population, sharp
economic decline, group-based inequality, institutionalized persecution
or discrimination, severe demographic pressures, brain drain, and
environmental decay." Rather than being a key foreign policy tool, the
[United States should carefully consider the ramifications of increasing
security cooperation in fragile states]{.underline}. For one, the
**[partner nation will likely be unable to sustain this newfound
military capacity]{.underline}**. Second, **[miliary assistance is
likely to lead to an increase in political instability, corruption,
human-rights abuses, and incidences of political
oppression.]{.underline}** This is because, at its core, the U[.S.
approach to security cooperation is contradictory and
anachronistic]{.underline}. It is based on faulty assumptions about
conditions in partner nations, often designed to defeat an enemy the
partner nation does not have, and rooted in American models of defense
institutions that do not exist. Even during the era of great-power
competition, it is not clear that U.S. interests are best served by
sending millions of dollars in defense articles and training to fragile
states under the guise of "regional stability," with the primary purpose
of keeping Russia and China out. Inherent in the definition of security
cooperation are explicit goals to "build capacity," which often
translate to ensuring that foreign countries can use, maintain, and
sustain the equipment that the United States has transferred to them,
either through grant assistance or by foreign military sales. **[Given
the internal instability of fragile states, most military capabilities
that the United States is seeking to foster are for the purposes of
internal defense, counter-insurgency, or
counter-terrorism]{.underline}**. The [suite of programs used to
transfer training and equipment are referred to as "building partner
capacity" or "train and equip programs]{.underline}." Often [recipients
of these programs are states that cannot or will not provide basic
services for their population or control their own territory, because
the government lacks either the resources, the authority, or the trust
of many of its citizens]{.underline}. While the state exists de jure,
there is no state de facto. The idea of transferring millions of dollars
of state-of-the-art American equipment to a country that cannot provide
the most basic services to its population seems counter-intuitive. How
is the recipient country expected to maintain it? While the issue of
sustainment is important, let's sidestep it and focus on what happens
after the equipment is delivered and the training has been completed.
There [may be anecdotal evidence of how security cooperation programs
have been "successful" in building military capacity, but numerous
commentaries and studies argue that the outcomes of this newfound
capacity have been less than ideal.]{.underline} According to these
studies, **[an increase in security cooperation and security assistance
correlated with an increased incidence of military coups, political
oppression, human-rights violations, and other forms of political
instability]{.underline}**. For example, a 2020 study conducted by
Patricia Sullivan, Leo Blanken, and Ian Rice analyzing post-conflict
countries between 1956 and 2012 found a statistically significant
increase in incidences of torture, extra-judicial killings,
disappearances, political imprisonment and executions, and incidents of
genocide among recipients of military assistance. A second study,
analyzing U.S. security assistance to 150 countries, found a similar
result: An increase in military assistance (security cooperation)
correlated with worse performance on human rights. Both of these studies
include years in which United States security cooperation programs were
tied to Leahy Amendment conditions concerning human rights that barred
sending material to units on a human-rights watch list and having every
recipient of training vetted. Regardless, the results of these studies
should not be surprising. Fragile states in which leaders lack resources
to provide basic services for their population often turn to
well-resourced (thanks to military assistance) militaries to repress
restless populations and target political opponents. Political leaders
in fragile states often use newfound military capacity to shore up
power. Moreover, if political leaders can depend on an outside donor,
like the United States, to resource their military, as opposed to taxes
or some other internal resources, it further severs the tie between the
government and its citizens. Regardless of these outcomes, the primary
purpose of security cooperation is "to build partner nation capacity
consistent with \[American\] defense objectives." While the National
Defense Strategy outlines numerous defense objectives, in regions with
fragile states these objectives often include promoting regional
stability, counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, and even policing
(countering human trafficking and drug trafficking). Therefore, the
purpose of building military capacity in weak and failed states is
mostly to ensure the internal security of that state. However, **[the
American military, by law and tradition, is not designed to play an
internal security role.]{.underline}** When the United States has
engaged in building foreign militaries, it has tended to reflect the
American way of war centered around playing its economic strength and
technological advantage into a tactical advantage on the battlefield.
From doctrine to defense institutions and logistics systems, the
**[entire Department of Defense is built around this American way of
war]{.underline}**. In fact, for U.S. forces counter-insurgency was a
subset of total war until the late 2000s. Through building partner
capacity programs, especially those under Department of Defense
authorities, the approach to security cooperation has been to mirror
American ways of war, doctrine, logistics systems, and training by
asking American military members and institutions to help to build the
capacity of defense institutions. In Afghanistan in particular, the
Department of Defense sought to build a military "that was modeled on
the centralized command structures and complex bureaucracy of the
Defense Department" rather than build a military to defeat the specific
threat(s) that Afghanistan faces rooted in defense institutions that
Afghanistan could support. The U.S. implementers drew on what they knew,
which resulted in Afghan forces not being able to function without
American support operationally and logistically. Ultimately, once the
United States withdrew, the Afghan forces fell quickly. U.S. security
practitioners specializing in institutional capacity-building point to
Afghanistan as an example of not taking institutional capacity-building
seriously, therefore dooming the rebuilding of the Afghan military, and
not necessarily of broader security cooperation failure. **[Congress
listened, and required frequently used security cooperation programs to
address institutional capacity-building, which advocates argue can even
help to prevent human rights abuses]{.underline}**, mostly through
education or some sort of subject-matter expert or military advisor
exchanges. However, institutional capacity-building is not the panacea
to the security cooperation dilemma that many within the Department of
Defense think it is. Institutional capacity-building programs still
focus on the technical aspects of institutions, or give cursory
education on issues such as the law of armed conflict. But these
programs fail to consider the politics of how authority within states
emerges, develops, or changes in order to institutionalize these newly
introduced practices. To be clear, I am not arguing that security
cooperation planners do not consider politics at all. In fact, U.S. law
requires the Department of Defense to "jointly consider political,
social, economic, diplomatic, and historical factors, if any, of the
foreign country that may impact the effectiveness of the program."
However, assessments of these factors are often shallow and concentrate
on the politics of formal institutions, overlooking the importance of
informal institutions and how power and authority is actually wielded in
fragile states. In order to understand the deep politics of fragile
states, it is crucial to have an understanding of what a state is. The
noted sociologist Max Weber defined the state as a "human community that
(successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical
force within a given territory." The key for the Weberian conception of
the state is the term legitimate use of force. Weber argued that even
states that appear to be authoritarian will seek to root their claim of
legitimacy in one of three "pure" types of authority: legal,
traditional, or charismatic. [Authority in the American state most
closely aligns itself with legal legitimation, meaning that U.S.
citizens see the American state and government as legitimate because a
leader's power is derived from written laws, procedures, and
regulations]{.underline}. Leaders in fragile states often try to
legitimize their rule not through legal means, but in a
sub-categorization of traditional authority: the neo-patrimonial system.
Leaders in neo-patrimonial states, while having a veneer of bureaucracy,
also seek to remain in power through clientelism, or the exchange of
goods and services for political support. Neo-patrimonial governments
also prefer to keep state institutions weak by stacking bureaucracies,
like defense institutions, with supporters and encouraging competition
amongst individuals to keep them divided and therefore not a threat to
their rule. This allows key military leaders to be dependent on the
ruler for their wealth while also keeping "national armies divided and
faction-ridden." **[U.S. military assistance is especially prone to
contribute to corruption as often this assistance accounts for a large
portion of defense budgets. "Ghost soldiers]{.underline}**" (nonexistent
military personnel manufactured by corrupt officials to pocket their
salary**[) in Iraq and Uganda are two well-known examples of how easy it
can be for military institutions to engage in corruption.]{.underline}**
Clientelism is not considered corruption, but just the way governance is
done in states in which the central government competes with local
actors for legitimacy. The Taliban understood this and struck deals
"with low-level representatives of the standing Afghan government
through bribes or safety guarantees" in order to quickly seize control
of various regions. With this understanding of the state, a deeper look
into the approach to institutional capacity-building still shows the
failures of security cooperation. [According to the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, institutional capacity-building initiatives are to
be "driven by U.S. interests and values" but at the same time avoid "the
projection or imposition of United States' models, which may not fit an
ally or partner's specific context." How can institutional
capacity-building be driven by U.S. values while also not be driven by
U.S. models?]{.underline} Often Americans sent to help build
institutions are subject-matter experts in developing and running
logistics systems, human resource institutions, and other formal defense
institutions in the United States, not state-building or political
development scholars with a deep understanding of the informal politics
of the state. These gaps in knowledge are then filled in by their
experience in running institutions in the United States, resulting in
foreign defense institutions modeled on the complex American
bureaucratic system, a system rooted in rational legitimacy.
Additionally, institutional capacity programs are often aimed at
improving the skills of functionaries and/or rewriting laws, processes,
or regulations that improve the veneer of the neo-patrimonial system
without necessarily shifting governance style further down the legal
continuum. This veneer serves to further enhance a leader's
international legitimacy while doing nothing to improve their domestic
legitimacy, to say nothing of the standard of living of the country's
citizens. Security cooperation observers may point to Ukraine as an
example of successful security cooperation, with the United States
providing military assistance to deny Russia an easy win, and so far it
seems to be working. Observers did not expect Ukraine to do so well
against Russia. However, this is the exception that proves the rule.
Ukraine by most measures is not a deeply fragile state. In fact,
according to the fragile state index, where a lower number indicates
less fragility, it has ranked anywhere from 86 to as low as 117 out of
179 countries. Currently, about 88 out of 179 countries are deemed more
fragile than Ukraine. Compared to countries like the Philippines,
Nigeria, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iraq, and many African countries, it was
relatively more stable. Second, American defense articles and services
are being used to fight off an external threat. Third, government
legitimacy is not in question. The reason that security cooperation is
"working" is that Ukrainian citizens see the government as trying to
provide them with protection against the Russian invasion: They see an
arrangement in which they (the Ukrainians) are giving their blood, with
much of the treasure being provided by the United States. After the war,
Ukraine may come out with a stronger nation-state identity and perhaps a
less corrupt government. In addition, following the path identified by
Charles Tilly, becoming efficient and effective at war contributes to
moving states further down the legal legitimacy continuum. The issue
with many fragile states, especially in African countries, is that their
citizens see a variety of actors as legitimate governors, not the
central government. In turn, often, governments of fragile states see
their own citizens and groups as potential political rivals, not
communities to be served. Some fragile states are only states because
international society says so, not because their citizens believe them
to be, unlike in Ukraine. Engaging in security cooperation in fragile
countries is a wicked problem, in that any approach the United States
takes will invariably not be good enough to achieve the lofty goals
outlined in the National Security Strategy. When the United States helps
to build foreign militaries it cannot help but use an American model,
one that also assumes an objective control of civil-military relations,
which neo-patrimonial regimes do not follow. Political leaders in
fragile states will gladly take whatever military training and equipment
that the United States is willing to give while also ensuring they can
still hold on to power, through various forms of patronage and/or
coup-proofing. In addition, Chinese and Russian military and economic
assistance is waiting in the wings to supplement or even supplant
American assistance. **[Suggestions to tie continued U.S. security
cooperation to improvement in domestic conditions may not work, as
fragile states often use the threat of going to Russia or China to gain
concessions. U.S. policymakers need to rethink their approach to
security cooperation by first deciding whether keeping Russia and China
out is enough of a national interest to justify providing support to
specific fragile states]{.underline}**. [Despite great-power
competition, U.S. interests may be best served by abandoning
security-cooperation efforts in fragile states.]{.underline} Arguments
to improve the foreign military sales process or incentivize a country's
behavior are largely irrelevant and will not lead to better security
cooperation outcomes, at least not within the timelines imposed by U.S.
government programs. It is very difficult to build a sustainable
military capacity in fragile countries whose governments lack resources,
both monetary and human, and to do so against the desires of political
leaders who may see keeping institutions weak as a way to stay in power.
The United States should only choose to conduct security cooperation,
especially if paid for by taxpayer dollars --- because not all programs
are, and some are funded by the foreign governments themselves --- in
very specific cases that truly serve national interests. [U.S.
policymakers should also be prepared for the fallout that comes with
increasing military capacity in states that cannot provide basic needs
for their own population or have governments that lack legitimacy,
namely human-rights abuses, corruption, and general regional
instability]{.underline}. When the United States does choose to pour
millions of taxpayer dollars into the security sector of a fragile
state, it should be ready to make a long-term commitment and embed any
approach in both the formal and informal political structures of the
state.

[private property rights protected by the legal system **[encourage
entrepreneurship and small business development]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[both of which are **key to a growing and modernizing
economy**]{.underline}. As a result, [democracies tend to be wealthier
and more economically stable than their autocratic
counterparts.]{.underline} This is fundamentally in the interest of the
United States in that both private and public investors have an interest
in seeing returns on their investments, [thereby potentially making
**countries less willing to go to war if that would require severing
economic ties**]{.underline}. Democratic institutions ensure that
citizens with both economic and political power are heard.

[Democracies also **[invest in public goods]{.mark} at much higher rates
than autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [Because politicians must
cater to the median voter, they **approve policies that invest in public
education and healthcare**]{.underline}, [both of which promote
long-term growth and development]{.underline}. Public education invests
in a country's human capital, setting the stage for long-term
innovation, adaptability, and advancement. [Public healthcare,
meanwhile, has been shown to **[increase overall societal
productivity]{.mark}** and well-being as people take fewer sick days,
citizens are able to afford their healthcare without going bankrupt, and
ultimately, [the overall **costs of healthcare are driven down**]{.mark}
as citizens become healthier]{.underline}. Productive, innovative
societies are also better for the United States --- [innovation around
the world improves global quality of life, results in more educational
and vocational opportunities for Americans]{.underline} (both because
other universities and jobs become more attractive to Americans who want
to go abroad and because potential immigrants are more likely to want to
stay in their own country, opening up opportunities for U.S. citizens at
home), [and may reduce friction between countries over resources and
labor]{.underline}.

[Democracies are also generally more politically stable because regular
election cycles ensure an established process for the habitual and
peaceful removal of leaders from power.]{.underline} [Elections ensure
the non-violent transition of power and reduce the need for mass
protest, rioting, and revolution --- which **[makes countries more
politically stable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further, when citizens are
granted rights and protections from government abuse, enforced by an
independent judiciary, they have fewer grievances against the government
and are thus less able to mobilize large numbers of people to violently
overthrow the regime. [Revolution, while not always violent, often leads
to political instability, challenges to growth, **[increased incentives
for diversionary war and conflict]{.mark}**, and oftentimes civil
war]{.underline}. The externalities of civil war and international
conflict then put pressure on the United States to intervene, protect
human rights, and otherwise expend resources on other countries' issues.
[Further, civil wars are highly destructive to institutions, human
capital, and resources, and can have significant security spillover
effects, increasing global risk of political [instability and **violent
extremism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This political stability, in addition to institutional checks and
balances, makes **democracies better international partners and allies
in the long-term**]{.underline}. Treaties ratified by multiple branches
of government are more durable than executive agreements signed by a
single leader who may be replaced within a short period of time. [While
democracies may be more reluctant to commit to alliances and formal
security pacts, once a party to them, they are more dependable than
other states with concentrated power at the executive
level]{.underline}. **[These [kind of durable commitments are of
interest to the United States as it seeks to preserve the liberal world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [it is far more effective to ally with
partners whose institutions make withdrawal from the alliance
costly]{.underline}.

Finally, [it has been empirically observed that **[democracies do not go
to war with one another]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While there is a robust
debate around the exact nature of the so-called "democratic peace," it
[appears that there are qualities particular to democracies that make
war between them particularly unlikely: a **dovish public constrains
leaders' ability to wage war**]{.underline}, [competitive elections and
a free press make it **easier to credibly communicate resolve to
potential adversaries**]{.underline}, [consolidated democracies tend to
be **more wealthy and economically interdependent**]{.underline},
[like-minded people are more hesitant to wage war against one another,
and so on]{.underline}. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, however, a
[world of democracies is inherently safer, more prosperous, and less
likely to initiate a war against the United States --- a key factor in
protecting American security and interests]{.underline}.

The sale comes as governments around the world are watching Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine and grow more willing to invest in weapons systems
The U.S. State Department has approved the potential **[sale of more
than \$2 billion worth of arms and equipment, including Patriot missiles
for the Netherlands, cruise missiles for Australia, and oceanographic
observation equipment for the United Arab Emirates,]{.underline}** the
Pentagon said on Thursday. The sale comes as governments around [the
world are watching Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine and grow more willing
to invest in weapons systems]{.underline}. The package for the
Netherlands would include [96 Patriot ballistic missiles]{.underline}
and related equipment, the Pentagon said. If finalized, Raytheon
Technologies would be the prime contractor for the deal, which could be
worth as much as \$1.2 billion. Australia was approved to buy 80 Joint
Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, or extended-range cruise missiles.
Made by Lockheed Martin Corp, the missiles can be launched from F/A-18
Super Hornets and F-35s. That deal could be worth as much as \$235
million. The United Arab Emirates was approved to buy an oceanographic
observation equipment system which includes multisite sensors and remote
data collection facilities for a total cost of \$206 million. Lockheed
Martin is the prime contractor for that system. The State Department
also authorized the sale of as much as \$397 million worth of various
Raytheon- and Lockheed-made munitions to Kuwait. The weapons include
air-to-air missiles, bombs, and kits that make bombs more precise and
lethal. The Pentagon\'s [Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified
Congress of the possible sale on Thursday]{.underline}.Despite approval
by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a
contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.

Thursday. The UAE also requested technical and logistics support and
other related services under the FMS deal, which will provide the
country with access to real-time oceanographic data to protect natural
resources, maritime boundaries and ports[. The potential contract calls
for the deployment of two contractor representatives to the UAE for a
period of two and a half years.]{.underline} DSCA does not expect the
sale to alter the basic military balance in the region.

### DSCA 2AC -- AT: Link 

#### Plan not DSCA

**DSCA ND** \"Chapter 1,\" No Publication,
https://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-1

The [Secretary of Defense establishes military requirements and
implements programs to transfer defense articles and services to
eligible foreign countries and international organizations. Within DoD,
the principal responsible agencies for Security Cooperation (SC) are the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the Combatant Commands
(CCMDs), the Joint Staff, the Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs),
and the Military Departments (MILDEPs).]{.underline}

#### O&M and different implementing agencies mean no link to the DA 

**McInnis and Lucas 15** (Kathleen McInnis is an analyst in
international security, Nathan Lucas is a section research manager,
"What Is 'Building Partner Capacity?' Issues for Congress",
Congressional Research Service, 12-18-15, Accessed on 7-22-19,
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44313.pdf>, DP)

[Security assistance, by contrast, is defined as a group of programs
authorized by Title 22 of the U.S. Code, as amended, or other related
statutes by which the United States provides defense articles, military
training, and other defense-related services by grant, loan, credit,
cash sales, or lease, in furtherance of national policies and
objectives.17]{.underline}

[Security assistance is a subset of security cooperation, 18 and BPC, in
its current formulation, appears to be associated with those security
cooperation and assistance activities designed to enable weakened or
fragile states to manage their own security challenges.]{.underline}
**[Although all DOD aspects of security assistance programs are
administered by DSCA, the agency is not responsible for the department's
broader strategy and non-programmatic elements of security cooperation
or building partner capacity]{.underline}**.19

As with all federal agencies, DSCA allocates its resources according
only to the authorities Congress has provided. The authorities
associated with security cooperation and security assistance are often
described as a "patchwork" of authorities and programs, only some of
which are exclusively within DOD's purview. Others are either (1)
managed by the State Department, (2) managed by the State Department and
executed by DOD (such as Foreign Military Sales programs), or (3)
jointly managed by the State Department and DOD, requiring both
departments' concurrence to authorize specific activities. Table 2
depicts some of the key programs and authorities in the security
assistance toolkit, including from where each program derives its legal
authority.

Examining Table 2, one could make two observations. [First, after the
9/11 attacks, the number of security assistance programs
proliferated.]{.underline} Of the 31 programs listed above 17 were
created after 9/11, suggesting that the United States government
believed that its traditional, pre-9/11 security assistance portfolio
was necessary but insufficient to meet the challenges of an increasingly
interdependent and complex world[. Second, the majority of these
programs established after 9/11 were additional authorities given to the
Department of Defense, suggesting that DOD plays a greater role in
security cooperation today than the one it historically
played.]{.underline} [The latter observation is borne out by the current
manifestations of BPC across the DOD's activities.]{.underline} Although
the programs and authorities listed above are the focus of most analysis
and discussion with respect to BPC, they do not capture the full extent
of DOD's activities and expenditures in this area. [This is because DOD
has integrated BPC---in its various guises and manifestations (security
cooperation, assistance, foreign internal defense, security force
assistance, and so on)---across a wide range of its operations and
activities (see "DOD Activities That Build Partner
Capacity").]{.underline} In order to do so, different DOD components
utilize a variety of funding sources. For example, according to a 2013
RAND study, [rather than using DSCA earmarked funds for specific
activities with partners, Most \[BPC\] programs are funded by other,
less narrow \[funding\] sources, such as operations and maintenance
funds]{.underline}. Examples include exercises overseen by the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and military-to-military contacts, which
are often (but not always) funded by Traditional COCOM Activity
Authority. In each of these cases, DoD uses a specific authority to use
its operations and maintenance funds for a given security cooperation
activity. In some cases, these funds are then reimbursed, but more often
than not, the security cooperation activity comes at the expense of
another defense priority.20

### BBB 2AC -- UQ 

#### BBB is dead until midterms at leads -- Manchin funding opposition

**Budryk 7-14** -- *reporter at the Hill* (Zack, 7-14-2022, \"Manchin
will not support climate spending in reconciliation package,\" Hill,
https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3560404-manchin-will-not-support-climate-spending-in-reconciliation-package-reports/)//KH

Sen. Joe [**Manchin** (D-W.Va.) **will not support climate spending** as
part of a reconciliation package]{.underline}, likely [dooming any major
climate legislation before the 2022 midterms]{.underline}, a Democrat
briefed on the conversation confirmed to The Hill Thursday night.

The [West Virginia Democrat told Democratic leaders on Thursday that he
was unwilling to support a spending package with either climate
provisions or new tax increases on corporations or wealthy
individuals.]{.underline}

Manchin said last December that he would not back the \$2 trillion Build
Back Better package, which included major climate provisions, seemingly
killing its chances in the 50-50 Senate. Since then, Manchin has
returned to the negotiating table with both Senate Majority Leader
Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and a bipartisan group of senators.

Manchin [had previously expressed doubt about new spending Wednesday
following the report that **inflation surged 9.1 percent** over the last
year, the highest annual rate since 1981]{.underline}. Following the
release of the report, the centrist senator suggested he was [only sold
on a proposal to reduce prescription drug prices.]{.underline}

"We know what we can pass is basically the drug pricing, OK? --- on
Medicare," Manchin told reporters Wednesday. "Is there any more we can
do? I don't know but I am very, very cautious."

The reported [stalemate comes less than four months ahead of the 2022
midterms. Should Democrats lose their slim majority in one or both
houses of Congress, Manchin's announcement would likely **close the door
on any new climate spending** for the remainder of Biden's
term]{.underline}. Progressives and environmental activists have faulted
what they have said is Biden's overly cautious approach to climate
issues, and said it risks dampening voter enthusiasm among many of the
voters who elected him in 2020.

The Hill has reached out to Manchin and Schumer's offices for comment,
as well as the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee, which Manchin
chairs.

Better,\" global,
https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1570692.html)//KH

Build Back Better Revival. [Senate Democrats behind the scenes continue
to work on navigating their slimmed-down Build Back Better (BBB)
legislation through the complicated rules of budget
reconciliation,]{.underline} which will allow them to pass the bill with
just 50 votes (instead of the de facto 60 vote threshold that applies to
most legislation in the Senate). We expect the [final BBB bill to be
considered by the Senate beginning the week of August 1. It will take
that entire week]{.underline} (and possibly the next) [to reach a
conclusion. The smaller BBB most notably would include prescription drug
pricing reforms]{.underline} that will allow Medicare to achieve cost
savings for the government. Those savings will be applied to an
extension of federal subsidies under Obamacare. There may be a few other
provisions that are not controversial, but importantly, we do not expect
any tax increases on wealthier individuals or businesses to be included
in this bill (unlike earlier versions). W[hile the smaller bill is no
doubt a disappointment to many Democrats who still favor the \$1.75
trillion bill passed by the House last fall, it still will be a **major
accomplishment** for Democrats to tout to voters this year if it can
pass in the Senate, which we **believe is likely.**]{.underline}
