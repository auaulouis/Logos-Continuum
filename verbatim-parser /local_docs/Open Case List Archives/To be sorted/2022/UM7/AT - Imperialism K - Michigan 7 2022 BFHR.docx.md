More is the pity that such irrational and obviously abstruse debate
should so occupy us at a time of great global turmoil. That it does and
continues to do so reflect our lack of judicious criteria for evaluating
theory and, more importantly, the lack of attachment theorists have to
the real world. Certainly, it is right and proper that we ponder the
depths of our theoretical imaginations, engage in
**[[epistemological]{.mark} and ontological
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and analyze the sociology of our
knowledge. But [to support]{.underline} that [this is the **only task**
of international theory]{.underline}, let alone the most important one,
[[smacks of]{.mark} **intellectual [elitism]{.mark}** [and
displays]{.mark}]{.underline} a certain [[**contempt** for
those]{.mark}]{.underline} who search for guidance [[in]{.mark} their
[]{.mark}**daily [struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline} as actors in
international politics. [[What do]{.mark}es Ashley's
project]{.underline}, [his **deconstructive
[efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or valiant fight against positivism
[[say to the]{.underline}]{.mark} truly marginalized,
**[[oppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and destitute[[**?** How does it

refugees, [the **casualties of [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or the

[speak]{.mark}** [to those who]{.mark}se actions]{.underline} and
thoughts [[comprise]{.mark} the **[policy]{.mark} and
practice**]{.underline} of international relations?

On all these questions one must answer **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This is not to say, of course, that all theory should be judged by its
technical rationality and problem-solving capacity as Ashley forcefully
argues. But [[to support that **problem-solving**]{.underline}]{.mark}
technical [[theory is]{.underline}]{.mark} not necessary---or in some
way [[bad---is a]{.mark} **contemptuous [position]{.mark}** [that
**abrogates** any **hope**]{.mark} **of [solving]{.mark}**]{.underline}
some of the [**nightmarish [realities]{.mark}** [that **millions

of these theorists and their theories the ultimate question, "So what?"
To what purpose do they deconstruct, problematize, destabilize,
undermine, ridicule, and belittle modernist and rationalist approaches?
Does this get us any further, make the world any better, or enhance the
human condition? [[In what sense can]{.mark} this ["debate toward

These [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} or quasi-government think tank
[**[simulations]{.mark}** often [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} very
similar [[**lessons** for]{.underline}]{.mark} high-level players as are
learned by **[[students]{.underline}]{.mark}** in educational
simulations. Government [[participants learn]{.mark} about [the
**importance** of]{.mark} **understanding [foreign
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the need to practice internal
coordination, [[and the **necessity** to **compromise**]{.mark} **and
coordinate**]{.underline} with other governments in negotiations and
crises. During the Cold War, political scientist Robert Mandel noted how
**[crisis [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}** and war games
[[forced]{.underline}]{.mark} government officials to overcome
''bureaucratic myopia,'' moving beyond their normal organizational roles
and thinking more creatively about how others might react in a crisis or
conflict. [The **skills of [imagination]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
subsequent [ability to predict]{.mark} **foreign interests and
[reactions]{.mark}** [remain critical for]{.mark} **real-world foreign
[policy makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, simulations of the
Iranian nuclear crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings
Institution's Saban Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center,
and involving former US senior officials and regional
experts\*highlighted the dangers of misunderstanding foreign
governments' preferences and misinterpreting their subsequent behavior.
In both simulations, the primary criticism of the US negotiating team
lay in a failure [[to **predict**]{.mark} **accuratel[y]{.mark}**
[how]{.mark} **other [states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both
[**[allies]{.mark} and adversaries**[, would behave **in response** to

often [[have a]{.mark} **pre-defined [view]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**international [affairs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the literature on

**force students** to challenge]{.mark} **their [assumptions]{.mark}**
[about how]{.mark} other [governments **behave** and]{.mark} how their
own government [work]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Since simulations became
more common as a teaching tool in the late 1950s, educational literature
has expounded on their benefits, from encouraging engagement by breaking
from the typical lecture format, to improving communication skills, to
promoting teamwork. More broadly, [**[simulations]{.mark}** can [deepen
**understanding** by asking **students** to link **fact and
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}, providing a context for facts while
bringing theory into the realm of practice. These exercises are
particularly valuable in teaching international affairs for many of the
same reasons they are useful for policy makers: [they force
**[participants]{.mark}** to [''grapple with]{.mark} the issues arising
from **[a world in flux.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Simulations have been
used successfully to teach students about such disparate topics as
European politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US response to the mass
killings in Darfur. Role-playing [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}
certainly [[encourage **students** to learn **political**]{.mark} **and
technical [facts]{.mark}**]{.underline}\* but they learn them [[in
a]{.mark} **more [active style]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rather than
sitting in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, [students
actively research]{.underline} ''their'' government's positions
[and]{.underline} actively [argue]{.underline}, brief, and negotiate
with others. Acts can change quickly; [[**simulations** teach]{.mark}

**Craps '12** \[Steph; 2012; Professor of English at Ghent University,
Director of Centre for Literature and Trauma; *Postcolonial Witnessing:
Trauma Out of Bounds*, *Palgrave*, "Conclusion," p. 126-127; GR\]

Cogent though these various critiques are in their own terms, it seems
to me that they unduly homogenize and simplify different forms of
interest in and inquiry into trauma. While it is true, of course, that
trauma research does not in and of itself lead to political
transformation, I would argue that a **[[trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**
theory revised along the lines I have suggested [[is not]{.mark}
destined to serve as the handmaiden of the status quo or [a]{.mark} mere
academic [**alibi** for]{.mark} the indulgence of **[voyeuristic
inclinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[it can]{.mark}
help identify and [understand]{.mark} situations of
**[exploitation]{.mark} and abuse**[, and act as]{.mark} an
[**incentive** for]{.mark} the kind of sustained and systemic [critique
of]{.mark} **societal [conditions]{.mark}** called for by Berlant and
Brown]{.underline}. In fact, [the expanded **model of [trauma]{.mark}**
I have proposed, [based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the work of Laura Brown,
Frantz [**[Fanon]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} others, bears a close
resemblance to the model of suffering that [Berlant [puts
forward]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[an
**alt**]{.mark}**ernative**]{.underline} to the (traditional) trauma
model, which she finds inadequate: \"[a model of suffering, whose
etymological [articulation of **pain**]{.mark} and patience [draws its
**subject** less as an **effect** of]{.mark} an act of [**violence** and
more as]{.mark} an effect of [a]{.mark} **general [atmosphere]{.mark}**
[of it, peppered by **acts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to be sure, but not
contained by the presumption that trauma carries, that it is an effect
of a single scene of violence or toxic taxonomy\" (338). Berlant\'s
observation that \"the pain and suffering of subordinated subjects in
everyday life is an ordinary and ongoing thing that is underdescribed by
the (traumatic) identity form and its circulation in the state and the
law\" (344) is perfectly in line with the argument I have presented in
this book.

[That **trauma [research]{.mark}** [can act as a **catalyst**
for]{.mark} astute **[political]{.mark} analysis** and **meaningful
[activism]{.mark}**]{.underline} would seem to be borne out by the \[END
PAGE 126\] development in Fanon\'s writing, from Black Skin, White
Masks, which describes the psychological impact of racial and colonial
oppression, to the overtly political The Wretched of the Earth, which
confronts the source of the mental strife he saw in the clinic.3 Since
Douglas Crimp\'s plea for \"\[m\]ilitancy, of course, then, but mourning
too: mourning and militancy\" (18) in relation to the AIDS movement back
in 1989, several scholars have argued that an interest in issues of
[trauma, loss, and mourning is in fact compatible with a commitment to
radical activism. A desire [to make **visible** the]{.mark} creative and
[**political**-rather than **pathological**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and
negative-aspects of an [**attachment** to loss]{.mark}]{.underline} is
the thread that binds together the essays gathered in David Eng and
David Kazanjian\'s volume Loss: The Politics of Mourning (2003), which
seeks to \"extend\[\] recent scholarship in trauma studies by insisting
that ruptures of experience, witnessing, history, and truth are, indeed,
a starting point for political activism and transformation\" (10). Eng
and Kazanjian see their collection as moving \"from trauma to prophecy,
and from epistemological structures of unknowability to the politics of
mourning\" (10). As one of the contributors, Ann Cvetkovich, puts it,
[trauma can be \"the provocation [to create]{.mark} **alternative
[lifeworld's]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (\"Legacies of Trauma\" 453).

[Recognition of suffering serves as [a]{.mark} **necessary first
[step]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}wards the [amelioration]{.mark} of that
suffering]{.underline}. In Judith Butler\'s words, \"The recognition of
[**shared [precariousness]{.mark}** [introduces]{.mark} strong
[normative]{.mark} commitments of [equality]{.mark} and invites a more
robust universalizing of rights that seeks [to address basic]{.mark}
**human [needs]{.mark}**]{.underline} for food, shelter, and other
conditions for persisting and flourishing\" (28-29). Without wishing to
overstate its likely impact, I believe that rethinking trauma studies
from a postcolonial perspective and providing nuanced readings of a wide
variety of narratives of trauma and witnessing from around the world can
help us understand that shared precariousness. By fostering attunement
to previously unheard suffering and putting into global circulation
memories of a broad range of traumatic histories, an inclusive and
culturally sensitive trauma theory can assist in [raising awareness of
injustice]{.underline} both past and present [and opening up the
possibility of a more just global future]{.underline}-and, in so doing,
remain faithful to the ethical foundations of the field.5

**[FW --- Scenario Planning]{.underline}**

**Scenario planning is good -- a model of dialectical negation enables
the transcendence of entrenched political ideologies and trains debaters
to imagine radical alternative worlds guided by pragmatic strategy --
their author concedes we're right.**

**Ossewaarde '17** \-- Associate professor in governance, society and
technology, University of Twente (Marinus Ossewaarde, 7-21-2017,

'Local Governments of the Future' program", Futures, Volume 93, pg.

[Scenario planning can be understood as a dialogical enterprise or
'dialectical negotiation']{.underline} (Bowman 2016: 90). It therefore
[involves the 'art of friendly dispute' or 'clash of minds', which in
turn enables the critique, negation, and transcendence of established
ideologies, imaginaries and frames that determine the present and
future. Scenario planning is a quest for alternative]{.underline}, still
to be decided, [open futures, in which different understandings of the
world are reconciled]{.underline} through compromises. Chosen courses of
actions informed by various (conflicting) possible scenarios reflect
such compromises. As Habegger (2010: 51) emphasizes, in scenario
planning 'there is no such thing as "the future".' [Clashes between
ideologies, imaginaries and frames, accordingly, are not problems a
scenario planning must get rid of; instead, they must be embraced as a
sine qua non for advancing the knowledge of futures, if only because
such contradictions or different intellectual orientations increase the
awareness of possible future worlds]{.underline} (cf. Mannheim 1954:
241). [There is no one necessary or inevitable path to one future. A
scenario planning is a dialectical process involving the creative quest
for futures]{.underline} (Barber 1998). Contemporary scholars therefore
draw a parallel between scenario planning and the writing of futuristic
stories (Korte and Chermack 2007). Science fiction, for instance, is
widely recognized as a valuable asset for envisioning undetermined or
undecided futures and stimulating utopian (or, dystopian) enquiries
(Birtchnell and Urry 2013). Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George
Orwell's 1984 are examples of literary works that provide the
imaginative component of scenario planning (cf. Schulz, 2015: 133). The
purpose of scenario planning is, of course, not to produce science
fiction-like stories as such; 'scenarios are far more than stories'
(Chermack and Coons 2015: 189). Instead, [scenario planning generates
scenarios that are not simply linear extrapolations of the present. It
involves reckoning with -- imagining -- unpredictable or possible
events. The resulting scenarios, in turn, entail and demand a wide range
of policies hitherto unheard of]{.underline} (Volkery and Ribeiro 2009;
Habegger 2010[). The imaginative part of scenario planning is therefore
intimately connected to world-making, to decisions and strategic
actions, which are directed to changing the course of
history]{.underline} (Korte and Chermack 2007; MacKay and McKiernan
2010; Amer, Daim and Jetter 2013). Along this line, [scenario planning
always involves and requires (1) new imagination of future worlds, (2)
debate about alternative futures, and (3) the creation of manoeuvring
room for strategic actions that correspond to different
scenarios]{.underline} (Chermack 2004; Korte and Chermack 2007; Volkery
and Ribeiro 2009). The imagination of future worlds is enabled by
literary methods that evoke distrust of fixed images and iconic
representations (Shapiro 2016). Hence, parables, the articulation of
paradoxes, allegories, symbolisms, and metaphors make it possible to
understand and reckon with ambiguous, elusive, or latent (not yet fully
manifest) phenomena in scenario planning (Levine 1985: 29; 218).
Literary methods, and writers (poets in particular) can inspire truly
new insights and strengthen the belief in different possible worlds,
past, present and future. In other words, in these works, the reader
comes to the realization that what is, or what has passed, could have
been different; or what possibilities have been missed (MacKay and
McKiernan 2010; Dufva and Ahlqvist 2015; Shapiro 2016). From such
literary angle[, futures unfold when events -- which may be the results
of strategic decisions -- rupture ongoing trends and disrupt established
patterns.]{.underline} In contrast with trends, events happen suddenly
and can evoke shocks (MacKay and McKiernan 2010; Schulz 2015). A
scenario planning has to include the possibility of such surprising
historical moments through organizing so-called 'what if' scenarios, and
must, accordingly, be organized in 'an atmosphere detached from daily
routines' (Dufva and Ahlqvist 2015: 265). In this way, the enthusiasm
for and openness to unexpected events, for ungrounding the present and
the emergence of newness and radical transformations, is not stifled.
[The imagination of futures beyond current trends require a particular
kind of radicalism from participants in the scenario planning process,
namely, the transcendence of their current assumptions regarding the
world.]{.underline} In other words, their capacity to invent new futures
depends on their willingness and capacity to critically re-examine what
they conceptualized as trends that would continue into the future
(Chermack 2004; Korte and Chermack 2007; Van Wijck and Niemeijer 2016;
Bowman 2016). They must, accordingly, abandon any pretence of knowing
the 'laws' of the world, thereby leaving open the possibility that the
world might have been very different if other power constellations had
been in place. Concretely, [such attitude requires giving up biases,
dogmas, ideological distortions, and compulsive identifications with a
particular (well-known) order, stereotypes, and clichés. Indeed, it is
only through the critique, negation and transcendence of established
conceptual frameworks, practices and current policies that it is
possible to generate new ways of seeing the world, and hence to envision
alternative worlds (]{.underline}Amer, Daim and Jetter 2013).
Ideological discourses freeze (reify) established patterns (typically
described as 'progress,' 'development,' or 'transformation') and obscure
ambiguities. Scenario planning results in increased scope for strategic
action to realize undetermined possible futures. Though it tends to
limit itself to descriptions of alternative futures (Amer, Daim and
Jetter 2013; Van Wijck and Niemeijer 2016; O'Brien 2016), without
prescriptive claims, it is a powerful instrument that can serve or
undermine democracy and its future (Barber 1998). Its liberating
potential depends on the range of different accounts of the world and of
possible future worlds that is taken into account during the process.
The exclusion of alternative images of the future on the basis of
current assumptions and beliefs -- for instance, the salvation of the
world lies in technology -- from scenario planning makes the latter a
sham. Since the inclusion of conflicting worldviews is the hallmark of
democracy, [a pseudo-scenario planning that presumes and legitimizes one
desirable future clearly undermines the democratic ideal of debate or of
the publics]{.underline} (cf. Ravetz, 2011).

[[Every policy is a **prediction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Tax

[[Sanctions]{.mark} will [slow Iran's nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Travel bans will limit]{.mark} the
**spread of [COVID]{.mark}-19**]{.underline}. These [[claims all posit a
**causal relationship**]{.mark} between **means** and
**ends**]{.underline}. Regardless of party, ideology, or motive, no
policymaker wants ~~his or her~~ \[their\] recommended course of action
to produce unanticipated consequences. This makes [[every policymaker a
**forecaster**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [But forecasting is
difficult]{.underline}, [[particularly when it comes to
**geopolitics**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a domain in which the rules of
the game are poorly understood, information is invariably incomplete,
and expertise often confers surprisingly little advantage in predicting
future events.

These challenges present practical problems for decision-makers in the
U.S. government. On the one hand, the limits of imagination create blind
spots that policymakers tend to fill in with past experience. They often
assume that tomorrow's dangers will look like yesterday's, retaining the
same mental map even as the territory around them changes dramatically.
On the other hand, if policymakers addressed all imaginable threats, the
United States would need so large and expensive a national security
establishment that the country could do little else. By many measures,
it is nearing this point already. The United States has military bases
in more than 70 countries and territories, boasts more than four million
federal employees with security clearances, and fields 1.3 million
active-duty troops, with another million in reserve. According to one
estimate, the United States spends \$1.25 trillion annually on national
security. When it comes to anticipating the future, then, the United
States is getting the worst of both worlds. It spends untold sums of
money preparing yet still finds itself the victim of surprise ---
fundamentally ill equipped for defining events, such as the emergence of
COVID-19.

There is a [[better way]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that would [allow the
United States [to make decisions based not on **simplistic
extrapolations**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the past [[but]{.mark} on
**smart [estimates]{.mark}** [of the future]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} reconciling two approaches often seen to
be at philosophical loggerheads: [[**scenario planning** and
**probabilistic forecasting**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each approach has a
fundamentally different assumption about the future. Scenario planners
maintain that there are so many possible futures that one can imagine
them only in terms of plausibility, not probability. By contrast,
forecasters believe it is possible to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes, thereby transforming amorphous uncertainty into quantifiable
risk. Because each method has its strengths, the [optimal
approach]{.underline} is [to **combine them**]{.underline}. This
**[[holistic method]{.underline}]{.mark}** would [[provide policymakers
with]{.underline}]{.mark} both a [[range of **conceivable futures**
and]{.mark} regular updates as to [which]{.mark}]{.underline} one [[is
likely to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. For once, they could
[make]{.underline} shrewd [bets about tomorrow]{.underline},
[today]{.underline}.

PLANNING FOR UNCERTAINTY

Although widely used in business today, the first element of this duo
--- [[scenario planning]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grew out
of]{.underline}]{.mark} post--World War II national security concerns,
specifically the [**overwhelming [uncertainty]{.mark}** of the nuclear
revolution]{.underline}. Previously, martial experience was thought to
offer some guidance through the fog of war. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, however, [presented a novel problem]{.underline}.
With the newfound ability to destroy each other as functioning societies
in a matter of minutes or hours, the United States and the Soviet Union
[faced an **unprecedented situation**]{.underline}. And unprecedented
situations are, by definition, uncertain. They lack any analogy to the
past that would allow decision-makers to calculate the odds of possible
outcomes.

Still, early U.S. efforts at nuclear-war planning sought to turn that
problem into a calculable one. During World War II, the Allies had great
success with the new field of operations research, the application of
statistical methods to improve the outcome of tactical engagements.
After the war, the RAND Corporation --- a "think factory" that the U.S.
Air Force established as a repository for leading researchers --- hoped
to parlay this success into a new, more rational approach to war, based
less on the intuition of generals and more on the quantification
afforded by models and data.

Unfortunately, methods that worked at the tactical level proved nearly
farcical at the strategic level. As the historian David Jardini has
chronicled, RAND's first attempt to model a nuclear strategy ignored so
many key variables that it nonsensically called for deploying a fleet of
aging turboprop bombers that carried no bombs because the United States
did not have enough fissile material to arm them; the goal was simply to
overwhelm Soviet air defenses, with no regard for the lives of the
pilots. In the wake of such failures, it became clear that [[analysts
could not]{.mark} **entirely [banish]{.mark}**
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1960, even Charles Hitch, a man
predisposed to calculation by dint of being RAND's top economist and
president of what was then the Operations Research Society of America,
cautioned, "[No other characteristic of decision-making is as
**pervasive** as uncertainty]{.underline}."

That, of course, [[raised]{.mark} the [question of how to formulate
**sensible strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unexpectedly, it was a RAND
mathematician and physicist, Herman Kahn, who offered an answer. If the
lived past could not shape strategy, perhaps [[the **imagined
future**]{.mark} could]{.underline}. Frustrated with RAND's attempts to
scientize war, Kahn devoted himself to [[crafting
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} in the pursuit of "ersatz experience"
that would [[prepare the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [for the
future through]{.mark}]{.underline} what were essentially [[thought
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[use]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[scenarios
as]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[artificial]{.underline}]{.mark} '[case
histories]{.underline}' [and]{.underline} '[historical
[anecdotes]{.mark}]{.underline},'" Kahn wrote, thus [[making up
for]{.mark} a [lack of **actual examples** or]{.mark} **meaningful
[data]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They would [provide analogies where there
were none]{.underline}.

Early methods of generating scenarios were often freewheeling and
discursive. But after scenario planning migrated to the business world,
it took on more structured forms. The most recognizable is a two-by-two
matrix in which planners identify two critical uncertainties and, taking
the extreme values of each, construct four possible future worlds.
Regardless of the specific shape they take, [**[rigorous
scenario-planning]{.mark}** exercises]{.underline} all involve
[[identifying key **uncertainties** and]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[imagining]{.mark} how [different combinations]{.mark}]{.underline}
could [[yield situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[vastly
different from]{.underline}]{.mark} what [**[mere
extrapolation]{.mark}** of the present]{.underline} would suggest. By
then "backcasting" --- taking one of these imagined futures as a given
and asking what conditions produced it --- [scenario planners
[derive]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[a **story** and a
**system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They come up with a plausible narrative
of how a future happened and an internal logic that describes how it
operates. [[Scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} are not supposed to be
predictive. They are meant to be provocative, [[challenging]{.mark}
**planners' [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[shaking]{.underline}]{.mark} up their [**mental [models]{.mark}** [of
how the world works]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[giving
them]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cognitive flexibility to better
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[shape]{.mark}, [and adapt to the]{.mark}
**emerging [future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The pandemic has occasioned a renaissance in the use of scenarios, as
organizations from think tanks to technology companies grapple with the
question of what a "new normal" might look like and how soon it might
arrive. But the national security community has long used scenarios to
address some of its most wicked problems --- particularly high-stakes
issues that are in flux, such as the U.S.-Chinese relationship. This
past summer, RAND released a report on Chinese grand strategy. It
concluded with four scenarios that offered brief vignettes of China's
possible place in the world 30 years from now. "Triumphant China"
dominates the world stage in most domains, with a modern military and an
innovative economy. "Ascendant China" is the preeminent power not only
in Asia but in other regions, as well. "Stagnant China" has suffered
from low growth and faces social unrest. And "Imploding China"
experiences a crisis of existential proportions, in which domestic
instability undercuts the country's international influence.

Although comprehensive, the wide range of these scenarios highlights the
chief challenge of the method: If China's potential futures encompass
rise, fall, and everything in between, how can they aid in the
formulation of strategy and policy? Although this cornucopia of
scenarios could lead policymakers to develop strategies that would
improve the United States' position no matter which future comes to
pass, in practice, having too many different versions of the future can
make it nearly impossible to act. [**Good [scenario planning]{.mark}**
[puts boundaries on the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, but those limits
are often not enough [[for **decision-makers** to work
with]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} need to [[know
which future is **most likely**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[TURNING **UNCERTAINTY** INTO **RISK**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the second element
of the duo --- tries to [[address]{.mark} that
**[shortcoming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forecasters see scenario
planning as]{.underline} maddeningly vague or, worse, [dangerously
misleading]{.underline}. They not only point to the lack of consistent
evidence to support the alleged benefits of scenario planning; they also
argue that the compelling nature of a good story can trigger a host of
biases. Such biases fuel irrationality, in part by tricking
decision-makers into making basic statistical errors. For example, even
though a detailed narrative may seem more plausible than a sparse one,
every contingent event decreases the likelihood that a given scenario
will actually transpire. Nevertheless, people frequently confuse
plausibility for probability, assigning greater likelihood to specific
stories that have the ring of truth. They might, illogically, consider a
war with China triggered by a clash in the Taiwan Strait more likely
than a war with China triggered by any possible cause.

In contrast to scenario planning's emphasis on imagination, forecasting
tends to rely on calculation. Deductive approaches use models or laws
that describe the behavior of a system to predict its future state, much
like Newtonian mechanics allows astronomers to anticipate the position
of the planets. Inductive approaches do not require such understanding,
merely enough data and the assumption that the future will in some way
reflect the past. This is how Netflix anticipates what you might like to
watch or Amazon what you might want to buy, based purely on your
previous actions. Increasingly, thanks to advances in artificial
intelligence and machine learning, analysts use hybrid approaches.
Meteorology is a good example, in which researchers combine
sophisticated models and big data collection, which feed into each other
and enable ever-better weather forecasts.

International politics poses a challenge for these methods because the
laws governing the system are elusive or highly debatable, relevant data
points are often unavailable or unprecedented, and thousands of
variables interact in countless ways. History functions as a series of
unfolding events, with highly contingent branching paths sometimes
separated by mere happenstance. Tectonic shifts can hinge on seemingly
mundane occurrences. That makes it hard to deduce future events from
theoretical principles or to induce them from past experience.

As a result, historians and foreign policy experts are often bad
forecasters. In 2005, one of us, Philip Tetlock, published a study
demonstrating that seasoned political experts had trouble outperforming
"dart-tossing chimpanzees" --- random guesses --- when it came to
predicting global events. The experts fared even worse against amateur
news junkies. Overconfidence was the norm, not the exception. When
experts expressed 100 percent certainty that events would occur, those
events materialized only 80 percent of the time. Yet there were pockets
of excellence amid this unimpressive performance. Those who were surest
that they understood the forces driving the political system
("hedgehogs," in the philosopher Isaiah Berlin's terminology) fared
significantly worse than their humbler colleagues, who did not shy from
complexity, approaching problems with greater curiosity and
open-mindedness ("foxes").

This distinction caught the eye of the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity, which set up a geopolitical "forecasting tournament,"
in which Tetlock participated. He recruited a team of volunteers to
provide probabilistic answers to sharply defined questions, such as
"Will the euro fall below \$1.20 in the next year?" or "Will the
president of Tunisia flee to exile in the next six months?" By measuring
the difference between estimates and the actual occurrence of events,
Tetlock and his colleagues could calculate a score showing how
"well-calibrated" the expectations of any given forecaster were with
reality. By analyzing these data, Tetlock discovered that the [[key to
more accurate **geopolitical forecasting** was]{.mark} to take
people]{.underline} who were [naturally **numerate** and
**open-minded**]{.underline}, [train them [to think
**probabilistically**]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoid common biases, and
then group them so they could leverage the "wisdom of the crowd." The
**[[best forecasters]{.underline}]{.mark}** would
[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark} seemingly intractable [[questions by
decomposing them]{.underline}]{.mark} into parts, researching the past
frequency of similar (if not precisely analogous) events, adjusting the
odds based the uniqueness of the situation, and continually updating
their estimates as new information emerged. By the end of the
tournament, Tetlock's top performers had achieved scores that were 30
percent better than those of career CIA analysts with access to
classified information. Somehow, they had [[transmuted **uncertainty**
into **measurable risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The advantages of being able to put realistic odds on possible futures
are obvious. It gives you a peek into the future. But even the best
forecasters have their limits. If asked to predict events three to five
years out, their performance becomes increasingly indistinguishable from
random guessing. Still, many [[**critical policy questions** are **short
term**]{.underline}]{.mark}: perhaps the most famous recent example
concerned whether Osama bin Laden was in the Abbottabad compound in May
2011. Highly consequential short-term questions now include when a
COVID-19 vaccine will be widely available. As of this writing, the smart
money (68 percent probability) is on or before March 31, 2021.

But to the extent that leaders need to make consequential,
difficult-to-reverse decisions that will play out over the long run ---
the strategic choices that will give the United States an advantage over
time --- it becomes more difficult to link forecasts to policymaking.
Well-calibrated forecasters, for instance, can estimate the likelihood
that a skirmish with the Chinese navy in the South China Sea will result
in at least two American deaths by December 31. But what policymakers
really want to know is the extent to which China will threaten U.S.
interests in the coming years and decades.

Answers to that type of inquiry are beyond the reach of forecasters
because it is impossible to define precisely what constitutes an
interest or a threat. To provide forecasts, questions must pass the
"clairvoyance test," which is to say that were it possible to pose the
question to a genuine clairvoyant, that omniscient seer must be able to
answer it without having to ask for clarification. "Will I fall in
love?" is not a forecasting question. "Will I marry Jane Smith by this
time next year?" is.

From a policy perspective, then, the greatest challenge to forecasts is
that although they can clarify slices of the future, they do not
necessarily provide enough information to inform decision-making.
Indeed, making a decision based on one specific forecast would be a
mistake: the estimated probability of an event is a poor proxy for the
significance of that event. "Will Vladimir Putin relinquish power within
the next two years?" is a far different question from "What would
Vladimir Putin's abdication of power mean for U.S.-Russian relations?"
The problem with forecasting is thus the exact opposite of the problem
with scenarios: if the latter often provide too panoramic a view of the
future to be useful, the former provides too narrow a glimpse.

AN ANSWER FOR THE FUTURE

How should these different approaches to anticipating the future be
linked? The answer lies in developing clusters of questions that give
early, forecastable indications of which envisioned future is likely to
emerge, thus allowing policymakers to place smarter bets sooner. Instead
of evaluating the likelihood of a long-term scenario as a whole,
question clusters allow analysts to break down potential futures into a
series of clear and forecastable signposts that are observable in the
short run. Questions should be chosen not only for their individual
diagnostic value but also for their diversity as a set, so that each
cluster provides the greatest amount of information about which imagined
future is emerging --- or which elements of which envisioned futures are
emerging. As a result, the seductiveness of a particular narrative will
not tempt decision-makers into mistaking plausibility for probability.
Instead, preliminary answers to specific questions can provide a simple
metric for judging in advance how the future is most likely to unfold
--- a metric that analysts can then refine once the event in question
takes place or not.

Consider the scenarios RAND produced as part of its analysis of China's
grand strategy. The four scenarios envisioned for 2050 --- "Triumphant
China," "Ascendant China," "Stagnant China," and "Imploding China" ---
can be roughly placed on a classic two-by-two matrix, with the strength
of China's political leadership on one axis and the strength of China's
economy on the other. A cluster of questions that would give a heads-up
that history is on a "Triumphant China" trajectory might include "On
December 31, 2020, will China exercise de facto control over Itu Aba (or
Taiping Island) in the South China Sea (which is currently under the de
facto control of Taiwan)?" "Will China's GDP growth in 2023 exceed ten
percent?" and "Among African audiences, when will the China Global
Television Network have a higher weekly viewership than Voice of
America?"

These questions are useful both individually and collectively. Knowing
that top forecasters see an increased chance of China controlling the
island (from, say, a ten percent probability to a 20 percent
probability), for instance, would provide immediate tactical value to
the U.S. Navy. It should not necessarily tip the balance in the debate
over whether China will be "triumphant," but if all the forecasts
resulting from the question cluster are trending in the same direction,
the United States may want to recalibrate its strategy. As forecasts
change and individual questions are answered by the course of events,
the view of the far-off future becomes a little bit clearer. Analysts
can then update their scenarios and generate new clusters of questions.
They can thus develop a continually evolving sense of plausible futures,
as well as a probabilistic estimate of which policies will yield the
most bang for the buck today.

This method resembles the U.S. defense and intelligence community's use
of indications and warnings. In the early 1960s, for example, the
National Intelligence Council developed a list of actions --- large
troop maneuvers, for instance --- that might precede an attack by the
Sino-Soviet bloc. The idea was that tactical changes might provide an
early warning of future strategic shifts. Indications and warnings have
come to play an important role in many national security scenarios.
Unfortunately, there are potential problems with scouring today's
environment for hints of tomorrow. For one thing, as psychological
research shows, having envisioned a particular scenario, humans are not
only inclined to consider it more likely; they are also more prone to
see evidence of its emergence---a form of confirmation bias that U.S.
intelligence has battled for decades. For another, analysts are not
particularly good at discerning in real time which events matter---which
signposts are actually indicative of a particular future. Developments
initially considered to be earthshattering may turn out to be
significantly less important, whereas a story buried well beneath the
day's headlines can end up changing the course of history. In a
statistical analysis of nearly two million State Department cables sent
in the 1970s, for instance, one recent study demonstrated that U.S.
diplomats were often bad at estimating the historical importance of
contemporaneous events.

[[Linking scenarios to]{.underline}]{.mark} clusters of [forecasting
[questions mitigates]{.mark} these [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
First, because the questions must be precise enough to pass the
clairvoyance test, there is no wiggle room about what constitutes, say,
large troop maneuvers. Second, because questions that disprove
hypotheses often yield the greatest information, selecting questions for
their diagnostic value [[decreases]{.mark} forecasters' susceptibility
to **[confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, much as
diversified stock portfolios spread risk through multiple, uncorrelated
investments, the diversity of question clusters
[[prevents]{.underline}]{.mark} forecasters from [[overweighting]{.mark}
a [potentially **unimportant signpost** and **mistakenly
concluding**]{.mark}]{.underline} that a [particular scenario is coming
to pass]{.underline}. Finally, and most important, because [[question
clusters yield]{.mark} forecasts]{.underline}, [one can attach
[**meaningful probabilities** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[likelihood]{.mark} that [**particular events** will occur]{.mark} in
the future]{.underline}. This [provides]{.underline} a sort of advance
[**e**arly **w**arning **s**ystem]{.underline}. An event does not need
to actually transpire for the United States to have actionable
information. That, more than anything else, gives question clusters an
advantage over traditional indications and warnings.

PLANNING IN PRACTICE

To be useful, any vision of the future must be connected to decisions in
the present. Scholars and practitioners often claim that [[scenario
planning and probabilistic forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark} are
incompatible given their different assumptions and goals. In fact, they
[[mesh]{.mark} well]{.underline}. A scenario planner's conviction that
the future is uncertain need not clash with a forecaster's quest to
translate uncertainty into risk. Rather, the challenge lies in
understanding the limits of each method. Question clusters [make it
possible [to leverage]{.mark} the [strength of **each
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[transforming]{.mark} the [**abstract
long term** into]{.mark} the [**concrete short term**
so]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[understand the future **quickly** and act to **stave off
danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}, seize opportunity, and strengthen
national security.

The [[greatest barrier]{.mark} to]{.underline} a [**clearer vision** of
the future [is not **philosophical** but
**organizational**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [[potential]{.mark} of
combining scenario planning with probabilistic forecasting [means
**nothing** if it is not **implemented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
occasion, the intelligence community has used forecasting tournaments to
inform its estimates, but that is only a first step.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and consumers of intelligence are
the ones who [[must]{.mark} understand]{.underline} the [importance of
forecasts and [**incorporate them** into]{.mark} their
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Too often, operational demands --- the
daily business of organizations, from weighty decisions to the mundane
--- fix attention on the current moment.

[[Overcoming]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tyranny of the present
requires]{.mark} **high-level action** and broad]{.underline},
[[sustained effort]{.underline}]{.mark}. Leaders across the U.S.
government must cultivate the cognitive habits of top forecasters
throughout their organizations, while also institutionalizing the
imaginative processes of scenario planners. The country's prosperity,
its [[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, [ultimately]{.underline}, its
power all [[depend on policymakers' ability to envision **long-term
futures**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[anticipate **short-term
developments**]{.underline}, [and use]{.underline}]{.mark} [both
[**projections** to inform everything]{.mark}]{.underline} from the
budget to grand strategy. Giving the future short shrift only
shortchanges the United States.

that **public support**]{.underline} for most key aspects of American

**[[grand strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[from]{.underline} [**free

**discontent** with the **failures**]{.mark} and **frustrations**
[of]{.mark} U.S. **grand [strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
post--Cold War era, no doubt, yet it also [reflects the fact that
**American [strategy]{.mark}** seems **[at risk of]{.mark} becoming [a

**[success]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[^[33]{.underline}^](javascript:void(0)) By

American [policies have made it more difficult for Americans to
**remember why** significant **[investments]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the global order [**[are needed]{.mark}** in the first

Today, [[this]{.mark} ambivalence is becoming]{.underline} increasingly
[problematic]{.underline}, for the simple reason that properly
[resourcing American **strategy** [**requires** **making**]{.mark}
politically **[difficult trade-offs]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[with]{.mark} respect to [**entitlements** **and** other
**ballooning**]{.mark} domestic **[costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is
also becoming problematic, of course, because [even if the American

[the **public has shown** itself **willing to elect a president**
who]{.mark} appears to **[care little]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the
successful postwar and post--Cold War tradition, [even if he
has]{.underline}, so far, [maintained more aspects]{.underline} of that
tradition [as president than his campaign rhetoric might have led one to

[**[require]{.mark}** [more]{.mark} **intensive [political

**[commitments]{.mark}** whose costs]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
often [more visible]{.underline}---not to say greater---[than their

[[their]{.mark} country's **[leadership]{.mark}** has not been a matter

**international [order]{.mark}** that is [**exceptional** in]{.mark} its
**stability, [liberalism]{.mark}, and benefits**]{.underline} for the
United States. Not least, they will need to make the case that [the
costs that the country has borne in support of that order are designed
to avoid the necessity of bearing]{.underline} vastly [higher costs if
the international scene returned to a more tumultuous
state]{.underline}. After all, [[the **success of** American

**Researching and debating IR is good.**

[The first benefit is]{.underline} generating [a **well-trained
[pipeline]{.mark}** [of future IR scholars]{.mark} and practitioners.
Today's students are the **scholars** and **practitioners of tomorrow**,
and sparking **curiosity** in students, [especially
**undergraduates**]{.mark}, has the potential to [**rejuvenate the
field** from within]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Hagmann and Biersteker
(2014, 292--293) argue, [IR scholars should "take a **more direct
interest** in]{.underline} how world politics is explained to [students
in everyday schooling practices]{.underline}." This is eminently
sensible. International relations' [preoccupation with]{.underline} "the
cult of research intensivity" (Nossal 2006, 737), and to a lesser extent
[political practice]{.underline}, [**[misleads]{.mark}** the
[professoriate into believing]{.mark} that the very people who sustain
universities as institutions and who are the future of the
discipline---[student]{.mark} subscribers---[can be
**ignored**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has]{.underline} also [led the IR
professoriate [to **undervalue**]{.mark}]{.underline} the contribution
that the taught discipline makes to disciplinary renewal through [the
[**training** of]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [next generation]{.underline}.

[For future practitioners, whether in **government** or **elsewhere**,
an [IR education provides]{.mark} the [**conceptual architecture**
needed to **make decisions**]{.mark} about policy and its place in the
world]{.underline}. In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger emphasizes this
point: "The convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high
office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they
continue in office. There is little time for leaders to reflect" (as
quoted in Desch 2019, 153). While Kissinger is talking about the highest
level of elected office, it is equally true that [policymakers
throughout government come in equipped with the **intellectual capital**
and **technical skills** learned in the classroom]{.underline} (Biswas
and Paczynska 2015). [For future scholars, early lessons have
**downstream effects** on the very content of IR knowledge]{.underline}.
After all, [the [**classroom** is where IR theory gets reproduced "**for
the first time**" to]{.mark} future generations of IR
[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Newsom (1995, 64--65) put
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark}, "\[t\]eachers [**[plant the seeds]{.mark}**
that shape the thinking of each new generation; this is]{.underline}
probably [the academic world's **most lasting
contribution**]{.underline}." [It is also a place where the durability
and centrality of the field's major theories are reinforced as a matter
of course and **not necessarily for the better**]{.underline} (Vitalis
2015, 6). [Early undergraduates **carry** the assumptions they are
taught **throughout** their undergraduate and graduate careers, and
**beyond**. A discipline that **cannot connect** with students or is
inward-looking and esoteric risks **putting off** its next
generation]{.underline}. Thus, [the classroom needs to be treated with
**greater regard** as a site of **knowledge production** and
**dissemination** in the intellectual life of the field]{.underline}. In
this sense, [curiosity can be provoked among students that may continue
**beyond** an undergraduate career]{.underline}. Take, for example, the
observation of one student on her intellectual awakening in the
classroom:

Despite a Eurocentric and male-dominated ethos, what ultimately
convinced me to stay in IR was my exposure and inability to detach from
what was first described to me as the politics of the "postcolonial." A
lecturer holding up a roughened paperback copy of Edward Said's 1979
acclaimed work Orientalism originally introduced me to
postcolonialism...Hearing Said's words being reiterated back to me in my
predominately white and conservative-leaning lecture theater was a
defining moment in my education. Orientalism provided an experience that
I could finally connect with: one where political power was not about
who had the most weaponry or democracy, but instead about who held
political control over the reality of the racialized person (Abu-Bakare
2017).

The moment captured in this tableau is the [[intellectual
awakening]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is possible]{.mark}
when]{.underline} pedagogy is carefully considered. From [the
student]{.underline} perspective, well-taught courses
**[prepare]{.underline}** them better [for the next stage in their
education, [starting with **superior**]{.mark} **foundational
[training]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the early undergraduate levels [and
[progressing to **improved research**]{.mark} **capabilities**
[and]{.mark} **substantive [knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the
higher undergraduate levels, and then to advanced skills training in
graduate school. [Well-trained cohorts]{.underline} coming up the ranks
[will be **highly proficient** in a **wider range** of IR topics,
theories, ideas, and methods and will be **well prepared** to make the
jump to fluency]{.underline}. Similarly, [future practitioners will be
equipped with **superior substantive** and **technical
training**]{.underline}. This is especially true with "experiential
learning." Done in purposeful ways, learning through experiences outside
the classroom generates employable skills for students.

Social and Institutional Context of Teaching and Disciplinary
Reproduction

Directly related to the question of the future of international
relations is the social context of teaching and the discipline's
reproduction in the classroom. IR [scholars must recognize that the [IR
classroom is the site of]{.mark} **ideational [preferences]{.mark}**,
clashes of **favored** or **disfavored paradigms**, of **personal
authority**]{.underline}, generational difference, [**social
privileges**, and **prejudices**. At **every point** in]{.underline}
professional [i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [there
are implications for how knowledge is **produced**, **taught**, and
**passed on**]{.underline} (Ettinger 2016; Colgan 2017; Fattore 2018;
Knight 2019). Indeed, [the intellectual output of IR scholars does not
exist independent of the **lived context** in which it is
produced]{.underline}. Gaining insight into the social context of
international relations' taught discipline can help begin to correct the
pathologies that are affecting the way the next generation of IR
scholars are being taught right now and how future scholars and
practitioners will be taught next year and beyond.

It begins by addressing the social identity of the instructor and how it
contributes to the reproduction of IR knowledge. After all, the
instructor does not speak from a position of nowhere and an account of
IR pedagogy should address the personal features of the instructor, her
place within the discipline's division of labor, and its effect on the
delivery of course content (Biswas and Deylami 2017). For international
relations especially, it is the site of entrenched male and
Euro-Atlantic dominance with cascading implications within the classroom
and beyond. The 2014 TRIP survey shows that the global IR professorate
is two-thirds male (Maliniak et al. 2014). In the United States and
British IR "core" and in the Anglo "noncore" (Cox and Nossal 2009), the
professoriate is overwhelmingly white and male. Australia is 72.11
percent male and 76.87 percent white. Canada is 70.83 percent male and
83.4 percent white. The United Kingdom is 64.83 percent male and 85.23
percent white, while the United States is 68.33 percent male and 85.21
percent white non-Hispanic. New Zealand, a slight outlier, is 81.82
percent male but only 34.78 percent identifying as NZ European (Maliniak
et al. 2014). Given what has been shown about the American dominance of
the discipline, the insularity of national IR communities, and the
gender gap in citations, it is reasonable to conclude that the bulk of
the most influential IR scholarship is produced and disseminated by
white men in the West (Maliniak et al. 2018; Maliniak et al 2013).

Understanding this relationship can improve IR pedagogy by recognizing
how diverse student populations interact with an overwhelmingly white
Euro-Atlantic intellectual tradition and by remedying some of the
attending limitations such as geohistorical narrowness, state-centrism,
epistemological positivism, and phallocentric authorship (Fonseca 2019).
In this regard, the taught discipline of international relations should
be intellectually responsive to a diversifying discipline and to a
diversifying student population. Such circumstances call for a broader
approach to teaching courses in a field whose heavy Euro-American
centrality can alienate students when their backgrounds are not
reflected in the course material. This is not simply a matter of
curriculum design that tries to mirror or "look like" the students
(Appiah 2019, SR7). Rather, it is one that balances disciplinary
foundations with broadened ontological scope of what "matters" in IR in
order to generate betterinformed teaching. It is widely recognized that
international relations is a very traditional field of scholarship, but
this should not preclude perspectives beyond the canon or case studies
from outside the empirical mainstream. More ambitious and, especially,
diverse content helps adapt teaching to changing student audiences. This
is especially true at the undergraduate level. What is important to
avoid is the "pipeline problem" that has discouraged women and
minorities from progressing through the scholarly ranks in STEM fields
(Brown et al. 2016; Branch 2016). By the same token, bringing more and
more diverse young students into the discipline of international
relations and encouraging their growth can bear intellectual fruit down
the line. At very least, we avoid artificially restricting the
development of the next generation of scholars.

[By **no means** is this a call to **jettison** the
classics]{.underline}. To the contrary, [[the field's canon is
**irreplaceable**]{.mark} as a foundation, as the **intellectual
inheritance** of the present, [as the **prevailing ideas** of]{.mark}
foreign [policymakers, and]{.mark} as **[points of
disagreement]{.mark}** for critical traditions]{.underline}. However,
[the scope of [IR]{.mark} pedagogy can [be
**expanded**]{.mark}]{.underline} to make it relevant for a twenty-first
century classroom. Primarily, this means expanding the theoretical and
empirical scope of international relations [[**beyond** its]{.mark}
traditional **Eurocentric** and **male-dominated**
[parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Acharya 2016). This is
discussed below. Granted, there will be no singular population to which
an IR curriculum will be pitched. Variation in student population
profiles based on race, gender, class, geography, and other identity
markers complicate the decisions that an instructor has to make. The
point is that there are intellectual gains to be had when the taught
discipline takes seriously the social context of international
relations' disciplinary reproduction. With a more diverse pedagogy in
place, it is possible that, with more eyes on the subject matter and
more minds from different backgrounds at work, [the IR classroom can
generate greater interest in **fundamental theoretical questions** for
the next generation of scholars to solve]{.underline}.

Institutional context of teaching matters too. The vast majority of IR
practice takes place in university institutions. Therefore, the material
institutional setting must enter in as a condition of international
relations' intellectual life. Consider first, the matter of basic
institutional survival. In an era where public universities around the
world face funding problems, there are immediate economic imperatives
for taking the taught discipline of international relations seriously.
In the short term, survival in unforgiving economic times requires
student enrollment and retention (Conley 2019). Systematic accounts of
US undergraduate enrollment since the Great Recession of 2008 show
majors in the "traditional disciplines" declining by 21 percent
(philosophy) to 30 percent (history). Political science and
international relations fare less badly, declining "only" by 11 percent
and 15 percent over ten years (Schmidt 2018). Put differently, the
classroom is on the front line in the battle for resources. Student
recruitment and retention are essential to the economic viability of
academic departments including political science and international
relations. Turning students off the subject matter through an
unreflexive pedagogy, boring classes, or mediocre lecturers has real
economic implications for the future. Without students prepared to part
with tuition dollars, or governments prepared to unlock activity-based
funding, no department can thrive, even with a roster of productive
researchers. Concretely, this means no new hiring and reduced budgets---
a recipe for contraction. In this context, the systematic neglect of the
classroom by IR stocktakers is entirely inexplicable given the parlous
financial state of most public universities. Trends in expanded
enrollment compound or create new problems. Universities that pack
classrooms with hundreds, if not thousands, of more students---many of
whom are international and pay exorbitant tuition fees---put revenue
generation above pedagogy (Schulmann 2019).

The disciplinary division of university labor must be factored into an
understanding of the context of IR teaching and its implications for the
intellectual life of international relations. In this sense, debate
about the taught discipline must grapple with question of resources,
division of university labor, teaching assignments, pressures of the
tenure track, the precarity of contract faculty, and other aspects of
university governance as conditions that influence the classroom. One of
the most striking trends in university governance is the increasing role
of contingent instructors. In the United States, some 73 percent of
instructional positions were nontenure track in 2016 (AAUP 2018). This
is consistent with longer-term trends. The percentage of postsecondary
instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6
percent in 1995 to 71.6 percent in 2011. In that time, the number of
full-time tenure-track positions increased by 10 percent while the
number of full- or part-time contingent positions doubled (GAO 2017,
8--9). This is not to say that contingent faculty are worse teachers,
but the contingent nature of the work creates impediments to teaching.
Fewer institutional resources, the constant need to reapply for jobs,
and the need for part-time work outside the university are all matters
that detract from time dedicated to students, improving pedagogy, or
learning new content. Downstream, the design of an IR class or the
delivery of an IR curriculum may not be nearly as effective as it could
be.

Intellectual Reflection and Renewal from the Inside Out

Taking teaching seriously as part of [the intellectual life of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [can]{.underline}
lead to intellectual renewal and self-reflection for individual
professors and for the discipline as a whole. At the individual level,
teaching has the ability to [catalyze an **intellectual
renewal**]{.underline} in the mind of the individual professor. [The
intellectual challenges of the classroom can provoke **[new]{.mark}
avenues of [research]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the instructor. [The
classroom is a **much more permissive intellectual environment** than
academic publishing. It affords]{.underline} the professor [a degree of
freedom to **explore topics**, **ideas**, and **arguments**, outside of
their research expertise. Making use of the opportunity to teach beyond
one's comfort zone [permits **thinking**]{.mark} **out loud**,
[**working through ideas**, and **entanglement in**]{.mark} **analytical
[puzzles]{.mark}**. Doing so is demanding, and it is much easier to fall
back on existing]{.underline} teaching [content. But an
ambitious]{.underline} teaching [agenda can lead to **new research
questions**, **new** and **unexpected intellectual horizons**, and
**better background context** for existing expertise]{.underline}.
Indeed, there is truth to the aphorism that there is no better way to
learn than to teach.

[This kind of renewal turns on the "**eureka**" moment when research
ideas **flows directly** from classroom activities]{.underline}. A more
systematic approach to renewal that is less reliant on serendipity
begins by asking discipline-wide questions. The first is this: what is
the purpose of teaching international relations? It is a variation on a
core concern to the discipline and one that remains unresolved (Dyvik,
Wilkinson, and Selby 2017)? Is it for disciplinary self-reproduction, to
train future practitioners, or more broadly, citizens and knowledge
workers in the twenty-first century economy (Darling and Foster 2012;
Szarejko and Carnes 2018; Zartner et al. 2018)? [Arriving at an official
"purpose" for i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is
probably **pointless**]{.underline}, and it is best left to the
decentralized community of scholars to decide. IR scholars have debated
this question widely within the published discipline but far less so in
the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of
options betrays a lack of focus that is symptomatic of the wider field
(Albert 2010). However, [this permissive intellectual environment is
beneficial for **wide-ranging intellectual pursuits**, **teaching
styles**, and **pedagogical agendas**]{.underline}. [It
**may**]{.underline}, though, [come at the cost]{.underline}. The
institutional underpinnings [of]{.underline} the discipline---faculty
administrators, editorial boards, funding agencies, hiring committees,
and so on--- may end up doing as much to shape the boundaries of the
discipline as the substantive output (Albert and Buzan 2017, 908). The
alternative, though, is subjecting intellectual and academic freedom to
[an **institutionalized orthodoxy**]{.underline}. In teaching,
decentralization may be intellectually permissive but may come at the
expense of disciplinary coherence.

[This concern]{.underline}, though, [may be **overstated**]{.underline}.
TRIP **[data]{.underline}** on curriculum design [gives an indication of
the **competing** and sometimes **overlapping pedagogical
priorities**]{.underline} among the IR professoriate. In a question on
introduction to IR classes, respondents were asked whether their
introductory courses are designed more to introduce IR scholarship
within the discipline or to prepare students to be informed about
foreign policy and international issues. The result favors a mix of both
with 80.83 percent incorporating scholarship and issues in some balance.
The remaining 19.17 percent come down in favor of one to the exclusion
of the other. At the master's level, the ratio is a bit narrower (73 to
27 percent) but still overwhelmingly embraces a mixture of academic
scholarship and international issues (Maliniak et al. 2014). Respondents
are a bit more divided on what undergraduate courses should be mandatory
in an IR program. They overwhelmingly agree (73.25 percent) that IR
theory should be a required subject. However, they differ on other
options. The next most popular candidates for a required course are
international/global political economy (45.37 percent), international
security (38.87 percent), and research methods (35.22 percent), followed
by international organizations (27.59 percent), comparative foreign
policy (22.86 percent), home country foreign policy (19.95 percent),
international law (19.85 percent), diplomatic history (19.11 percent),
and international economics (15.17 percent) (Maliniak et al. 2014). The
point is that [resolving what IR teaching is supposed to accomplish is
**hardly settled**]{.underline}, but there is some convergence on
certain issues.

So, [what]{.underline} then, [is the purpose of teaching
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations? Ultimately, it is up
to the individual instructor to answer and to enact a program
accordingly. But [[it is up to]{.mark} the community of [scholars to
**debate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may well be that the enormous
variation in the purpose of teaching international relations and the
radical decentralization is an inescapable feature of the taught
discipline. [Though [IR teaching]{.mark} may be **wildly
divergent**]{.underline} around the world, [there [is]{.mark} **always
some purpose** to it, and]{.underline}, however defined, [this is an
**intrinsic feature** of an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [education]{.underline}. Here, Cox's (1981, 128)
famous admonition that "[theory is **always for someone** and **for some
purpose**]{.underline}" serves as the anchor concept for
[such]{.underline} pedagogical [framing]{.underline}. It [frames IR
theories as **political things** and **not just abstractions** to be
memorized or [a]{.mark}n **analytical [template]{.mark}** to be applied
uncritically]{.underline}. Similarly, [it helps [to **frame thematic**
and **empirical**]{.mark} **cases** in the classroom]{.underline} so
that course material is not merely a reflection the professor's
unexamined preference. In the classroom, it is up to the professor to
articulate. Beyond the classroom in administrative meetings, academic
conferences, and in print, it is up to the field to debate.

The next question asks what is the proper scope of IR teaching? This
question has also been asked before of the field but not directly about
the IR classroom (Albert and Buzan 2017, 898). The answer to this
question connects different themes of this article: intellectual
rejuvenation and disciplinary renewal, diversity, and the future of
international relations as an intellectual project. In substance and in
design, [the scope of IR teaching should [**embrace pluralism** in
paradigm, empirical remit]{.mark}, and criticism]{.underline}. A great
deal has been made of pluralism in international relations (Levine and
McCourt 2018; Eun 2016), but pluralism in the taught discipline is far
different from pluralism in the published discipline, where differences
accrue over the merits of accumulation and diversity. Here, [the scope
of possibility in the classroom is **far more intellectually
permissive**. Teaching international relations can be **theoretically**
and **empirically promiscuous**]{.underline}. It can respect the canon,
its inner logic, and its external life, as well as contemporary
alternatives (Ferguson 2015). [This]{.underline} is an "integrative
pluralism" (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416) that [embraces diversity
as a means of "providing **more comprehensive** and **multidimensional
accounts** of complex phenomena" and a pedagogical engagement with the
world that includes, but **hardly limited** to the Euro-Atlantic
theater, that has dominated]{.underline} generations of [IR
thinking]{.underline} (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416).

Pedagogical pluralism in international relations flows from intuitions
about balancing theory and empirics, the canon and its alternatives,
being current while eschewing presentism, being "useful" without being
instrumentalist, and drawing on instructor expertise without being
constrained by the hyperspecialized knowledge attendant to the published
discipline. Of course, this is easy to say. But operationalizing these
intuitions into a pluralistic teaching program is much more difficult.
Complicating the matter is the relative absence of explicit theoretical
guidance for making IR pluralism work in the classroom. The insights of
proponents of a "Global IR" can help, including some critiqued above for
their neglect of the classroom. In particular, Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 300--308) program for developing a Global IR provides concrete
steps toward curriculum design as much as is does for research.

Regarding the IR theoretical parts of their program, Acharya and Buzan
(2019, 301) say that Global IR respects existing theories while "giving
due recognition to the places, roles, and contributions of non-Western
peoples and societies," which entails "pluralization within theories,
rather than just between them." There are issues here. First,
[[pluralization between theories requires **expanding**]{.mark} **the
remit** of [IR]{.mark} theory beyond the grand IR paradigms [to include
**non-Western contributions**]{.mark}]{.underline} to international
thought (Acharya and Buzan 2010; Acharya 2011). [But this is not
easy]{.underline}. Tickner and Wæver (2009) make it clear that
[Anglo-American IR looms impossibly large around the world. Without
jettisoning this intellectual inheritance]{.underline}, Thinking
International Relations Differently (Tickner and Blaney 2012) provides a
route to [pluralism]{.underline}. That volume [**interrogates
alternative meanings** to some of i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [central
concepts]{.underline}---security, state, sovereignty and authority,
globalization, secularism, religion, and the international. A professor
committed to [this kind of [pluralism]{.mark} can **[expand]{.mark} the
conceptual [vocabulary]{.mark}** of international relations in a way
that **encourages**]{.underline} undergraduate [**conversancy** in
multiple IR vernaculars **within** and **beyond** the Anglo-American
core]{.underline}.

[There is also the matter of what do with the **existing**,
**Western-centric canon**]{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan (2019, 301)
also say that [a global international relations would **subsume** rather
than **supplant** existing IR theories and methods. The purpose here is
**not to displace** Western-dominated IR knowledge but to **situate** it
within the global context]{.underline}. This is an entirely attainable
objective for an IR theory instructor. IR teachers should have full
command of some IR theories while being conversant in nearly all anyway.
[Integrating a fuller slate of intellectual content into teaching IR
theory permits]{.underline} a **[cognitive pluralism]{.underline}** that
is rarely available in the published discipline. The point here is that
teaching narrowly and to the expertise of professors may suit their
interests, but it puts blinders on the students. Upper-year and graduate
studies can explore specific pathways, but only after international
relations' map has been presented. This likely means instructors must
venture out of their preferred intellectual comfort zones and teach to
their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Doing so, however, requires
breaking through disciplinary walls and should not be underestimated. It
requires breadth of knowledge, disciplinary literacy beyond the
scholar's training, and language skills (usually beyond English) that
can take many years to develop, while the imperatives of the published
discipline stress specialization.

Regarding the empirical subject matter, a pluralistic IR agenda would
ground its empirics in world history rather than just Western history
(Acharya and Buzan 2019, 301) This is demanding on an instructor whose
subject-matter expertise will be narrow (by dint of academic training)
and whose time will be short given other professional and personal
commitments. Without considerable effort, this is more of an ideal than
a reality. But a good start would be to follow Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 303) admonition to integrate the study of regions, regionalism,
and area studies into the curriculum. In particular, this means offering
case studies, examples, and illustrations drawn from parts of the world
outside the Euro-Atlantic zone. To this we can add Buzan and Lawson's
(2015) case for expanding the temporal remit of international relations
to the nineteenth century. This would break free of the apocryphal
founding myths (Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson 2011) and temporal myopia of
the orthodox discipline (Buzan and Lawson 2014) in order to draw upon a
richer and more global context for the emergence of the modern world. A
worldly curriculum will likely begin rather thin, but over time become
much deeper and more inclusive. Perhaps [more attainable in the
short-term is a pluralistic [pedagogy]{.mark} that [recognizes]{.mark}
**multiple forms of [agency]{.mark}** beyond the state and material
power. Such]{.underline} an approach would entail [a
pedagogy]{.underline} addressing a diverse constellation of actors in
world politics that [offers a faithful representation of an
overwhelmingly complex environment **without reducing it** exclusively
to a handful of Western powers]{.underline}.

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to [**fill the gap**
between]{.mark} **IR [theory]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **real-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of **intellectual [openness]{.mark}**, recognizing both the need for
**greater [flexibility]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **theoretical
formulations** [and]{.mark} the **possibility of complementarity** by
**[other theories]{.mark}** and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in]{.mark} its [ability to **tackle future**]{.mark}
**event[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think**]{.mark}
caused by the **subconscious** and **simplified information processing
of humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants t]{.mark}o **reveal**
and [**question convictions**]{.mark} which have **so far remained
unchallenged**, [and]{.mark} to **question the [linearity]{.mark} of
world developments**.]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both **innovative** in terms of
**scholarship**, and **[policy-relevant]{.mark}** by offering a
**reflection** on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline} Thus, [it
can facilitate the **intellectual capability** to **think the
unthinkable**]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[innovative research topics **confront the uncertainties** that are
**crucial for policymakers** to be monitored closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[[possibility to **accommodate multiple**]{.mark} **driving
[forces]{.mark}**, to **take into account different values** they might
take and finally to **[combine them]{.mark} with each other** [and **see
how they affect the**]{.mark} **dependent [variable]{.mark}**, makes the
scenario approach quite unique. Traditional IR methods work with a
limited number of independent variables]{.underline}, formulate and test
hypotheses usually based on the relation between a single causal
variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex causal
trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background, we
agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and [provid]{.mark}ing academia with a tool for
"[**actionable clarity** in **understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary
global [issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool
towards]{.mark} **more exchange between academia and
[policy-making]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} can [contribute to]{.mark} a
**better [understanding]{.mark} between the two** worlds. For
policymakers, it provides the opportunity to consider **[long-term
trends]{.mark}**]{.underline} (an occasion not often found in the
day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides insight into
which trends are most concerning for policy-makers, allowing them to
check and ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the **[relevance of]{.mark} their
research agendas**.]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic

time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and

**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario

boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct

[Admitting NATO'S crimes and anti-democratic effects is]{.underline},
however, **[only the first step]{.underline}** to understand the actual
bind in which we progressives are stuck. Too many among progressives and
radical socialists are trapped in this stunted way of thinking because
of how we understand neoliberal capitalism as a uniquely American
project.

[[Movements]{.mark} for social progress around the world **[grow

games** of our **[great state powers]{.mark}** [jockeying for
**military** and **economic** influence]{.mark} and
domination]{.underline}. The socialist left has long been well aware of
the brutality and rapaciousness of capitalism.

Decades of research and journalism have demonstrated the central role of
American military and economic policy in pressing capitalist development
around the world. The intellectual tradition of studying how capitalism
began with Karl Marx himself and continues through generations across a
variety of disciplines. Many well-educated progressives have studied
these traditions, whether in the formal settings of universities to our
own learning. But much of this tradition focuses on the American role in
promoting global capitalism.

We progressives today must face a terrifying truth: [the
[America]{.mark}n state [is **not alone**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
enforcing the brutal innovations in capitalism that have developed over
the last generation.

Monstrosities of Mafia Fascism and Absolutism

Russia was once an ally of socialist liberation movements around the
world, though their own revolution under Josef Stalin had collapsed into
state-controlled capitalism and government by secret police.

Now, Vladimir [[Putin has restored **totalitarian principles**]{.mark}
of government to Russia, as [their]{.mark} domestic [policy is
the]{.mark} **economic** and **political [devastation]{.mark}** [of
the]{.mark} **[Russian people]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words,
[[Putin facilitated the]{.mark} **wholesale [theft]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**[hundreds of billions]{.mark}** [of dollars]{.mark} in wealth from the
Russian state and its industries [to a]{.mark} **[clique]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} former **bureaucratic**]{.underline} [and **secret police
[apparatchiks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of which is he leader. [Those
oligarchs are also leaders and financiers in Russia's **international
mafia**]{.underline}. Putin has explicitly built his new Russian
totalitarianism with significant influence from the fascist political
philosophy of Ivan Ilyin.

Russia is emerging again as a major power in our century's geopolitics,
but the collapse and corruption of much of the American government under
Trump, as well as their homicidal approach to COVID, has made China the
most powerful military and economic state in the world.

For decades, [[the Chinese state]{.mark} has [governed]{.mark} its
people [with]{.mark} **[brutal police enforcement]{.mark}** of **regime
loyalty**, even [deploying]{.mark} **[concentration camps]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[ethnic cleansing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to its
conquered territories of **East Turkestan** and **Tibet**]{.underline}.
More recently, [Xi Jinping's regime has been **especially devoted** to
institutionalizing his **absolute rule** over China, and the country's
highest political leaders are themselves embedded in **corrupt
relationships**]{.underline} [with their most powerful **billionaire
businessmen**]{.underline}.

[[One need **only count** the]{.mark} **many [murdered
journalists]{.mark}** in Russia who have investigated the details of
Putin's **gangster regime**]{.underline} [[to know]{.mark} that [this
geopolitical enemy]{.mark} of America is **[no friend]{.mark}** of the
progressive]{.underline}. [The same goes for dissidents and
whistleblowers who have **defied Xi's official truth**: they **rot in
prison**]{.underline} like Liu Xiaobo [or **disappear from
humanity**]{.underline} like Li Wenliang.

Three Militaries Against Democracy, Not Just One

Despite the destruction that the NATO military alliance has caused in
Europe and Asia, [we progressives face an **uncomfortable truth**: [we
need a]{.mark} **[military powerful enough]{.mark}** [to stand
against]{.mark} the many threats that **[Russia]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[China]{.mark}** pose to democracy around the world]{.underline}. As
well, [[we **must never** let our opposition to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
threat that [[America]{.underline}]{.mark} poses to global democracy
[[make us **patsies**]{.mark} [for Russian or Chinese
control]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **most potent** threat]{.underline} to our own democracies [is the
**destabilization**]{.underline} [of our **democratic
societies**]{.underline}. [A foundation of modern Russia's foreign
policy is to **aflame social conflicts**]{.underline} [inside of
**democratic polities**, and use weapons of **cyber-warfare**, such as
viruses and disinformation]{.underline}.

China has taken a more traditional route to global dominance. [Chinese
[investments in]{.mark} **massive resource [extraction]{.mark}**
projects [across **Africa**]{.mark}]{.underline} follow the model of the
old British East India Company. [Take almost **all profit** from mines
and oil wells, while [trap]{.mark}ping their African [partner states
in]{.mark} **[unsustainable debt]{.mark}**]{.underline} from project
financing.

How do we progressive and other ordinary people escape this triple
squeeze between three militarized, aggressive superpower states run by
mafiosi and billionaire power brokers? Anti-capitalist, socialist, and
democratic organization and agitation across the world is really our
only answer.

**[[We need NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but only because socialist and
democratic movements are closer to taking some measure of control away
from the corrupt in Europe and the Americas, pessimistic though even
these prospects often feel. A socialist Europe and North America would
stand against Russia and China as the weapons of war move to the
internet and public political movements themselves.

[If the NATO states]{.underline} of Europe and North America [could
unite]{.underline} in an aggressive cyberwar [to encourage **popular
resistance** to the **brutal mafia totalitarianism** of Russia and
China, then we will have a chance]{.underline} for global democracy,
socialism, a green economy, and a sustainable civilization on Earth.

Until those revolutions happen, we remain in our triple bind. But
[[**collapsing** our military]{.mark} entirely, [while geopolitical
enemies]{.mark} **[expand]{.mark}** and **consolidate** [theirs]{.mark},
[is a recipe for our **enslavement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We remain
slaves under]{.mark} neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}, [our opportunities
**ground to dust**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conclusion: the paucity of 'better' It seems appropriate to conclude by
commenting on why [it would be futile to attempt to provide a
justification for why postcolonial approaches offer a "better"
explanation of world politics in comparison to other IR
theories.]{.underline} The analysis has shown that traditional IR
theories, and even critical theories such as poststructuralism and
Marxism, operate within the limitations of an epistemology that is
inherently Eurocentric and attached to a vision of world politics that
is excessively temporal, with ontological categories that reflect this
point of view. Even when the European vision of modernity is criticised
from within, this criticism is prone to falling back on these same
categories in order to do so. Instead, a [decolonial epistemology can
create space for a universal that incorporates rather than excludes
difference,]{.underline} while ontological concepts derived from this
epistemology and the non-Western experience can elaborate a vision of
world politics that is more holistic and nuanced. Yet [to say that such
an explanation is "better" seems to negate the very purpose of
postcolonial approaches to IR; to draw attention to the hierarchies
embedded in the international sphere]{.underline} through the past and
ongoing practices and discourses of colonialism and imperialism[.
Describing these approaches as "better" merely engages in the same
tendency towards hierarchy, binaries, and reductionism critiqued in
other approaches.]{.underline} It is for this reason that this essay has
[argued strongly for the importance of postcolonial approaches to
explaining world politics but refuses to reduce these attributes to a
better or worse distinction]{.underline}. Suffice it to say that
postcolonial approaches encourage an understanding of world politics
that truly merits the name.

normative ones produces a comprehensive analytic of power \-- that

Bull notwithstanding, [there have been attempts in international re-
lations to address the cultural realm]{.underline}.32 Ali Mazrui
confronts interna- tional relations head-on by claiming that [\"culture
is at the heart of the nature of power in International
Relations]{.underline}. \"33 Mazrui sees [ideol- ogy, political economy,
and technology as deeply rooted in the cul- tural realm]{.underline},
and views the North-South divide as an increasingly cultural one.
Cultural identity is held to be an issue of increased sig- nificance in
the contemporary world - so much so that, according to Mazrui, we may be
witnessing the \"gradual unravelling of identities based on the state, a
declining of identities based on political ideol- ogy - and the revival
of identities based on culture.\"34 Peter Worsley\'s earlier account of
world development makes similar claims.35 [The in- ternationalization of
culture - youth cults, religious revivalism, con- sumerism, feminism -
are seen as \"powerful evidence that a sense of common identity and a
shared culture can give rise to social move- ments that quickly
transcend the boundaries of any particular soci- ety.\"]{.underline}36
Both Mazrui and Worsley thus see culture as a key determinant of
political and economic processes. [Even the generally econocentric
Immanuel Wallerstein has shifted ground to view culture as \"the key
ideological battleground\" of the opposing interests within the mod- ern
world capitalist system.37]{.underline} These attempts to engage culture
seemingly amount to [a re- spectable interest on the part of
international relations]{.underline}, and it is in- structive to
consider the intellectual background of the three writers discussed.
Wallerstein is a sociologist, and the essay cited above was published in
a collection of sociological articles on nationalism, glob- alization,
and modernity. Mazrui has always cut a distinctive path in international
relations, and his concerns have had more to do with the problems of
Third World justice and identity than with main- stream issues. Worsley,
similarly, has been steeped in the problems of development and
dependency in the Third World. We thus see that many of the perspectives
that have enlivened the discipline have come from outside it and draw on
different source material. Something similar may be said of R. B. J
Walker. Certainly he ha ried a consideration of culture with the issues
of order, power states, but his bearings have been taken from broad
modernity.38 Without belaboring the point, such an analysis is very much
the exception. Walker himself recognizes as much: \'This kind of
literature . . . has emerged largely on the margins of International
Relations as an institutionalized discipline. It remains obscure, even
alien to those whose training has been primarily within the positivis-
tic, realist, or policy-oriented mainstreams.\'139 The contrast with
postcolonialism could not be starker. Where in- ternational relations
has ignored culture, or at most grudgingly con- ceded it a minor role,
postcolonialism has elevated culture to an extraordinary degree.
Although the understanding of culture has changed as the discourse has
evolved, culture has been at the heart of postcolonialism from the
outset. In the first phase of postcolonial- ism, culture was grounded in
the literary context and understood very much in terms of the clash of
values engendered by the colonial encounter. Following
postcolonialism\'s move away from specific texts to a more generalized
account of domination and resistance between North and South, culture
has attained larger explanatory significa- tions. It has come to
encapsulate the very site of struggle and differ- ence between the
so-called margin and the center; the pivot upon which an emergent
postcolonial identity develops. On one view, how- ever, [culture has
been overdone. In its attempt to be at the cutting edge of academic
discourse, postcolonialism can be accused of hav- ing overstretched the
analytical utility of culture]{.underline}. Yet such a perspec- tive
underplays the significance of the cultural reorientation; it is
precisely through culture that postcolonialism mounts a fundamental
challenge to the epistemological bases of established regimes of
thinking such as international relations. In this respect its effect has
been overwhelmingly positive. To this point, the burden of our analysis
has been to suggest that [international relations and postcolonialism
pass like ships in the night. We have highlighted possible intersections
and potential sites of engagement, the idea being that both discourses
might be en- riched through a process of cross-fertilization. Such
enrichment would follow partly from the very fact of
difference]{.underline}. We now want to direct attention to three key
areas of difference in which [engagement might have real significance,
not only for each discourse but more generally for our broader concern
with approaches to the North- South divide. The first relates to power
and representation, the sec- ond to modernity, and the third to
emotional commitment and radicalism.]{.underline} In the process of
contestation and comparison, the hope is that [we can get a better
handle on understanding issues such as power and modernity as they bear
upon the relationship between the North and South. Both discourses have
distinct strengths and weak- nesses and bring different perspectives to
bear on the issues at hand. In seeking a dialogue and making assessments
about what we might learn from their diferences, we can begin to bridge
the discourses to their mutual benefit.]{.underline}

CHINA KNOWLEDGE AND SELF-REFLECTION

Until now, my focus seems to have been mainly on how not to understand
China's rise. While deconstruction is all well and good, one cannot help
but wonder: How to study China? If those paradigms are problematic or
less than adequate, what are the alternative ways of knowing this
important country? These questions sound reasonable enough. Be it
scholars or practitioners, when faced with an apparently unprecedented
transition from a transatlantic century to a transpacific century led by
the 'rise' of China (and India), one is naturally anxious to know what
China is up to and how to best respond to it. Yet, however
understandable this desire may be, this book has hesitated to directly
volunteer answers to those questions, or at least its implicit answers
would be unlikely to satisfy those demands on their own terms. There are
several reasons for this. To begin with, I am sceptical of some of their
underlying ontological and epistemological premises about what China is
and what China knowledge should mean. For example, those questions seem
to assume that this book is merely a study of China studies (or a
particular section of China studies), rather than a study of China per
se. Hence their insistence on knowing how we might go about studying
China proper. Yet, [from the beginning, this knowledge/reality dichotomy
has been problematised. Since there is no China-in-itself outside
knowledge, representation or discourse, what we refer to as 'China' must
already be coloured by such representations]{.underline}.
[Without]{.underline} **[reference to representations]{.underline}** [we
cannot]{.underline} for a moment [speak of China or do China
studies]{.underline}. Given that China does not exist independently of
discourse and that any study becomes part of its object of study, I
should say that this analysis of Western discourses of China is already
a study of China in the proper sense of the word. Also, underlying those
question is the belief that deconstruction is essentially destructive
and thus has little constructive to contribute to China studies.
However, [as Derrida notes, deconstruction is 'a way of taking a
position' rather than merely 'a flourish of irresponsible and
irresponsiblemaking destruction']{.underline}. 8 By way of
deconstruction, this book has hoped [to generate both critical and
constructive reflections on the way we think about the nature of China
knowledge as well as the way such knowledge can be better
produced]{.underline}. To the extent that methodology is always implied
in ontology and epistemology, my ontological and epistemological
critique is not an exercise of esoteric verbal incantation, but carries
important methodological messages for China watching, even though such
messages could well be dismissed as hollow, mystifying or even alien by
conventional standards. One message from this study [is that it is no
longer adequate for us to be merely 'China' specialists who are
otherwise blissfully 'ignorant of the world beyond China']{.underline}.9
**[Self-watching]{.underline}**, I suggest, [requires]{.underline} at
once **[discarding]{.underline}** [this positivist]{.underline}
**[self-(un)consciousness]{.underline}** [and cultivating a]{.underline}
**[critically reflective, philosophising mind]{.underline}**. '[The
philosophizing mind']{.underline}, wrote Collingwood, 'never simply
thinks about an object, it always, while thinking about any object,
[thinks also about its own thought about that object']{.underline}.
[China watching needs autoethnography or 'self-watching' to consciously
make itself part of its own object of critical analysis]{.underline}
whereby the necessary but often missing comparative context can help us
put China in perspective. All research, to be sure, must already contain
some level of reflectivity, be it about methods of inquiry, hypothesis
testing, empirical evidence, data collection, or clarity of expression.
And the Western representations of China's rise, predicated on some
particular ways of Western selfimagination, are necessarily
self-reflective in that sense. And yet, such [narrow technical
reflectivity or narcissistic posturing is not]{.underline} what I mean
by ['self-watching']{.underline}. In fact, [the]{.underline}
**[unconscious Western self-imagination]{.underline}** [as the modern
knowing subject]{.underline} ([who sets itself apart from the
world]{.underline} and refuses to critically look at itself) [is the
very]{.underline} **[antithesis of self-watching]{.underline}**. 10 This
position is similar to that of 'ironists'. According to Richard Rorty,
ironists are 'never quite able to take themselves seriously because
always aware that the terms in which they describe themselves are
subject to change, always aware of the contingency and fragility of
their final vocabularies, and thus of their selves'.11 In the concluding
chapter of his Scratches on Our Minds, Harold Isaacs seemed to have
endorsed such 'ironist' approaches to China studies: 'we have to
examine, each of us, how we register and house our observations, how we
come to our judgments, how we enlarge our observations, how we describe
them, and what purposes they serve for us'.12 Back in 1972, John
Fairbank put [such reflection in practice]{.underline} by
[suggest]{.underline}ing [that America's Cold-War attitude towards China
was based less on reason than on fear]{.underline}, a fear inspired not
by China but by America's experience with Nazi and Stalinist
totalitarian regimes. 13 These [examples clearly show the possibility of
reflective China watching]{.underline}, but alas, as noted from the
beginning, such reflectivity is [hardly visible in today's 'China's
rise' literature]{.underline}. Indeed, without the trace of a single
author, [the two dominant China paradigms hinge onto a ubiquitous
collective psyche and emotion that is often **difficult to
see**]{.underline}, let alone to criticise from within. Yet [it is
imperative that such self-criticism should occur, which entails
**problematising** China watchers' own thought, vocabularies and
taken-forgranted self-identity as disinterested rational
observers]{.underline}. [It requires us to]{.underline} **[pause and
look into ourselves]{.underline}** [to examine]{.underline}, for
example, [why we constantly fear China, rather than taking that fear as
given]{.underline}: 'We are wary of China because we are wary of China'.
Self-watching [demands]{.underline} an ironist [awareness
of]{.underline} the contingency, instability, and provinciality of
mainstream China knowledge, [its intertextual and emotional link to the
fears and fantasies in the Western self-imagination, the political
economy of its production, and the attendant normative, ethical and
practical consequences both for dealing with China and for serving the
power and special interests at home]{.underline}. Put it differently,
[it requires a]{.underline} **[deconstructive move of intellectual
decolonisation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the latent
**[(neo)colonial desire]{.underline}** and mindset that, despite the
formal end of colonialism decades ago, continues to actively operate in
Orientalism knowledge and China watching, [facilitated by its various
scientific, theoretical, and pedagogical guises]{.underline}. In this
context, self-reflection cannot be confined to individual China watchers
or even the China watching community. Never a purely personal pursuit or
even a disciplinary matter, China knowledge is always inextricably
linked with the general dynamism of Western knowledge, desire and power
in global politics. Its self-reflection should thus extend to the shared
collective self of the West, its assumed identity and associated foreign
policy (China policy in particular). If China can be seen as a
being-in-the-world, these issues are part and parcel of the world in
which China finds itself and relates to others. But until now they have
largely escaped the attention of China watchers. Maybe it is because
these are primarily the business of scholars of Western/American
culture, history and foreign relations, rather than that of China
scholars. After all, there is a need for division of labour in social
sciences. True, for various reasons it is unrealistic to expect China
scholars to be at the same time experts on those 'non-China' issues.
Nevertheless, [since China watchers both rely on and contribute to their
collective Western self-imagination in their understanding of China, it
is crucial that they look at their collective Western self in the
mirror]{.underline}. Take the negative image of China's brutal
Soviet-style sports system for example. Every now and then, such an
image will be reliably brought up to reinforce China's Otherness more
generally. But if the ways American young talents are trained are put
under the same spotlight, the difference between the US and China is no
longer as vast as it appears. 14 In doing so, the previous China image
is no longer as defensible as it seems. In brief, the broader point here
is that the same China may take on quite different meanings when we are
willing to subject ourselves to similar scrutiny. [We may **better
appreciate** why China looks the way it does when we are more
self-conscious of the various lenses, paradigms, and
fore-meanings]{.underline} through which we do China watching.
Conversely, we cannot fully comprehend why the Chinese behave in a
certain way until we pay attention to what we have done (to them), past
and present. Such [self-knowledge on the part of the West is essential
to a better grasp of China. Without the former, China knowledge is
incomplete and suspect]{.underline}. Yet, to many, self-reflection is at
best a luxurious distraction. At worst it amounts to navel-gazing and
could turn into 'a prolix and self-indulgent discourse that is divorced
from the real world'. 15 Such concern is hardly justified, however. [The
imagined Western self is integral to the real world, and critical
self-reflection also helps reconnect China watching to the 'real' world
of power relations]{.underline} to which it always belongs. [By making
one better aware of this connection, it helps open up space for
emancipatory knowledge]{.underline}. As Mannheim notes: The criterion of
such self-illumination is that not only the object but [we ourselves
fall squarely within our field of vision]{.underline}. We become
[visible to ourselves]{.underline}, not just vaguely as a knowing
subject as such but [in a certain role hitherto hidden from us, in a
situation hitherto impenetrable to us, and with motivations of which we
have not hitherto been aware]{.underline}. In such a moment
[the]{.underline} **[inner connection]{.underline}** [between our
role]{.underline}, our [motivations]{.underline}, and our [type and
manner of experiencing the world suddenly draws upon us.]{.underline}
Hence the paradox underlying these experiences, namely the opportunity
for relative emancipation from social determination, increases
proportionately with insight into this determination. 16 Still, there
may be a lingering fear that excessive reflectivity could undo much of
the hard-won China knowledge. But again to quote Mannheim, 'the
extension of our knowledge of the world is closely related to increasing
personal self-knowledge and self-control of the knowing personality'.17
Even when that does expose our lack of knowledge about China, **[all is
not lost]{.underline}**. Such [revelation is not a sign of ignorance,
but an essential building block in the edifice of China
knowledge]{.underline}. Confucius told us that 'To say that you know
when you do know and say that you do not know when you do not know---
that is \[the way to acquire\] knowledge'. 18 Thus, [the knowing subject
can emancipate itself from its delusion about its own
being;]{.underline} 19 [the real meaning of ignorance is that one claims
to know when one does not or cannot know.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} cynical [brilliance]{.underline} [of Vladimir
**Putin's** **propaganda**]{.underline} campaign [is that it
**exploited** **America's foundational commitment** to white
supremacy]{.underline}. [The term itself is so raw]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [so hideous]{.underline} that [it inspires an
allergy]{.underline} [to its usage within]{.underline} [mainstream
political]{.underline} [discourse]{.underline}. But no other
term---racism, white privilege, etc.---better captures the dynamic at
issue. White supremacy is exactly what it says on the label: a social
structure by which whites, a pseudoscientific grouping with [a
definition that changes over time as is
convenient](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003HQ3XHQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1),
dominate America's complex and often informal hierarchies of power.

American history is many things, but among them is a catalog recording
the mutating shape of a white power structure and how that structure
responds to various challenges to its existence. Amongst white
supremacy's greatest contemporary triumphs is its portrayal of racism as
individual prejudice rather than maintenance of the social order. Our
schools teach children that racism is about hatred, and hatred is
disreputable---not that racism is about power, with hatred merely one
downstream effect amongst many. And so, nearly every day, the public
discourse shows another white person objecting that the definitions have
changed on them in a dizzying way. [Those]{.underline}
[objections]{.underline} [predictably]{.underline} [run a gamut
from [left](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/donald-trump-white-supremacy-and-the-discourse-of-panic.html) to [right](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/09/media/fox-news-laura-ingraham-tucker-carlson-white-nationalism/index.html)]{.underline},
[since]{.underline} [white supremacy's roots sink deeper]{.underline}
[in America than any mere political persuasion]{.underline}. [Putin\'s
trolls]{.underline} **[wisely selected a fuel source]{.underline}**
[that white Americans of all political stripes, **consciously** **or
not, ensure is inexhaustible**.]{.underline}

[With every tweet, Facebook post, YouTube]{.underline}
[video]{.underline} [and Tumblr page, Russia]{.underline}
[showed]{.underline} that [it understands America]{.underline} [with a
depth]{.underline} **[that prompts much of white America to avert its
eyes.]{.underline}** [Russian propaganda]{.underline} expertly
[grasped]{.underline} that [even the most meager challenges]{.underline}
[to white supremacy]{.underline} [prompt]{.underline} **[a politically
powerful]{.underline}** **[and useful white resistance]{.underline}**,
[and that]{.underline} this **[dynamic is a persistent
feature]{.underline}** [of American]{.underline} [life]{.underline}. All
[Russia]{.underline}---or any foreign power, or no foreign power at
all---needs to do is [**breathe** on the **embers** **until they
ignite**]{.underline}. [White supremacy **murders millions of people**,
**steals their wealth** to distribute]{.underline} [it up the social
ladder]{.underline}, **[and denies untold millions their true human
potential]{.underline}**. America does this to itself, and left
undisturbed, will continue doing it. Russia's only unique contribution
in 2016, and beyond, was to underscore the threat white supremacy poses
to U.S. national security.

The reactionary Russian political theorist [Alexander
Dugin](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-far-right-book-every-russian-general-reads) has
written explicitly on the benefits of operationalizing American white
supremacy for Russian benefit. While Dugin's true influence on Putin
remains a subject of debate, his 1997 tome The Foundations of
Geopolitics presaged the Russian active-measures campaign of the past
three years.   

"[It is]{.underline} especially [important]{.underline} [to introduce
geopolitical]{.underline} [disorder]{.underline} into internal American
activity, **[encouraging]{.underline}** all kinds of [**separatism**
**and ethnic, social and racial conflicts**]{.underline}, [actively
supporting all dissident movements]{.underline}---[extremist, racist,
and sectarian groups]{.underline}, thus **[destabilizing internal
political processes]{.underline}** in the U.S.,"
Dugin [wrote](https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/the-dangerous-philosopher-behind-putins-strategy-to-grow-russian-power-at-americas-expense).
His clarity might have benefitted the 2017 CIA-FBI-NSA intelligence
assessment.

To credibly put that into practice 20 years later, Russians merely
needed to be ready online. They observed the idioms adopted by left and
right online political subcultures and repurposed them, using "cultural,
linguistic and identity markers in their Twitter profiles to align
themselves with the shared values and norms of either the left- or
right-leaning clusters," write University of Washington researchers
Ahmer Arif, Leo G. Stewart and Kate Starbird in
a [paper](http://ahmerarif.com/papers/BLM-IRA.pdf) to be presented at an
academic conference in November.

IRA stereotypes were crude, speaking to how Russians understood the
social currency of their marks. One fake profile, hilariously titled
\@USA_Gunslinger, read: "They won't deny us our defense! Whether you're
agree \[sic\] with me or not, you're welcome here! If you don't want to
be welcomed, go f\*ck yourself." Another, anticipating Atlantic writer
Adam Serwer's thesis that contemporary white supremacy portrays itself
as[ disgusted by
racism](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-nationalists-delusion/546356/),
included "Anti Racism" in its profile alongside "Southern. Conservative.
Pro God." IRA Tumblrs attempting to portray themselves as black were
titled such things as [Hustle In A Trap and Ghetta
Blasta](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-believes-there-is-a-conspiracy-to-submarine-the-kavanaugh-nomination?ref=scroll).
But the accounts, whether left or right, showed more sophistication---at
least on a level analogous to what a machine could spit out, given
enough data---in their appropriation of how authentic accounts within
the targeted groups spoke to one another.

"[What]{.underline} [really]{.underline} [struck me i]{.underline}n
studying the activities of these accounts up close, [was the level of
knowledge]{.underline} [they demonstrated of American
culture]{.underline}," Arif told The Daily Beast. "They talked about the
movies, they talked about specific holidays and things like that, so it
speaks to an organized, kind of a digital marketing operation, almost,
knowing your audience really thoroughly ... \[For\] a country that is
already divided in some ways by things like race and politics, this is a
case of someone coming along and giving us just a little nudge."

Arif and his colleagues didn't set out to study the IRA. As academics
examining human-computer interaction, they wanted to examine the online
discourse around Black Lives Matter. But last year, after Twitter and
Facebook began shuttering accounts associated with the IRA, they noticed
Russian accounts popping up with sufficient frequency in Black Lives
Matter discussions that they studied that phenomenon on its own. Their
preliminary work has already attracted coverage in [Mother
Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/russian-trolls-hyped-anger-over-black-lives-matter-more-than-previously-known/), [The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/trump-russia-twitter/551093/) and [Mashable](https://mashable.com/2018/01/22/drawing-lines-of-contention-study-twitter-university-of-washington/#zUuNBZbpbmq8),
but their final product has more information about, among other things,
"what content they were propagating," Arif said.

[What they found matched]{.underline} [a series]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} 2017 exclusives from The Daily Beast that showed [white
supremacy]{.underline} was never far from the surface of surreptitious
[Russian propaganda]{.underline}. [The fake]{.underline} [group
**SecuredBorders**]{.underline} [urged a real-life rally]{.underline} in
Idaho in August 2016 under the cry, "[We must stop taking in Muslim
refugees!](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russia-used-facebook-events-to-organize-anti-immigrant-rallies-on-us-soil)"
[The **IRA** Twitter account]{.underline} Being Patriotic [**called on**
**followers** **to** actually **kill Black Lives Matter
activists**:]{.underline} "[[Arrest and shoot every sh\*thead taking
part in burning our flag! #BLM vs
#USA](https://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-appear-to-use-facebook-to-push-pro-trump-flash-mobs-in-florida)."]{.underline}

It's true that the Russians also impersonated what they saw as left-wing
and nonwhite American audiences. Arif and his colleagues have documented
the IRA pretending to be both #BlackLivesMatter and its white-backlash
antagonist #AllLivesMatter. But a look at the substance of the messaging
the Russians geared to an ostensibly non-white audience looks distinctly
congruent with the prejudices reflected by its white right-wing one.
When the IRA pretended to be non-white, it portrayed its fabricated
in-group as threatening, provocative or anti-American.

A Facebook page [impersonating the United Muslims of
America](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-russians-impersonated-real-american-muslims-to-stir-chaos-on-facebook-and-instagram) pushed
memes falsely claiming the U.S., and particularly the Russian
adversaries Hillary Clinton and John McCain, created ISIS---before
claiming that Clinton was the guardian of Muslim interests. Arif's paper
notes that the IRA impostor group BlackMatters pushed a series of
inflammatory gifs purporting to show police officers sexually assaulting
a black teenage girl---which participants in the #BlackLivesMatter
hashtag subsequently debunked. "\[T\]he video incident functioned both
to further stoke anti-police sentiments on the left and, once it was
debunked, increase anti-BlackLivesMatter sentiments on the right," Arif,
Stewart and Starbird write.

The Russians posturing as Black Lives Matter "favored an uncompromising
and adversarial stance towards law enforcement," they found. "This
activity feeds directly into attempts to frame #BlackLivesMatter as an
anti-police hate group. From prior research we know that such framings
were actively resisted and addressed by #BlackLivesMatter activists...
\[T\]hese accounts did not just speak to the communities that they were
pretending to be a part of, but also aimed to communicate an
antagonistic representation of those communities to others."

That strategy is on display in Europe as well as America. According to a
knowledgeable European Union official who was not cleared to talk to a
journalist, social media accounts strongly suspected of being Russian
cutouts are waving digital red flags to ideologically contrary
audiences. In the run-up to the September 9 election in Sweden, the EU
official noticed pro-refugee messaging emanating from suspected
Russia-controlled accounts, aimed this time at audiences expected to
feel anxious about immigration. "You strengthen the grievances, and then
exploit" them, the official told The Daily Beast.

While each surreptitious Russian influence campaign is distinctly
tailored to its particular audience, [continuities amongst
them]{.underline} [point to the particular sort of chaos]{.underline}
[in the West]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Kremlin
considers beneficial. **It inflames**]{.underline} a sense of grievance
amongst a **[white overclass]{.underline}** [which fears the collapse of
its social, political and economic supremacy]{.underline}. It inflates
even the most modest challenge to that supremacy as an attack on its
fundamental way of life, essentializing entire national histories to
nothing more than white prerogatives. This is how immigration becomes
perceived as an invasion, [Black Lives Matter becomes a "[domestic
terror
outfit](https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/01/25/vermont-high-school-fly-black-lives-matter-flag/),"]{.underline}
[and the [poor white masses feel besieged into
silence](https://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/03/07/people-tiny-irish-town-taking-hundreds-migrants-no-say-scared-called-racist/)]{.underline} [before
crying out for a champion to make them feel great again.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON --- The **[Russian]{.underline}**
**[government]{.underline}** [has **stepped up efforts**]{.underline}
[to inflame racial tensions]{.underline} in the United States [as part
of its bid to [influence November's presidential
election,](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/us/politics/cia-russian-election-interference.html)]{.underline} [including
**trying to incite violence** by white supremacist groups]{.underline}
[and to stoke anger among African-Americans]{.underline}, according to
seven American officials briefed on recent intelligence.

[Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/world/europe/russia-school-shooting.html)'s
lead intelligence agency, the S.V.R., has apparently gone beyond 2016
methods
of [interference](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/us/politics/election-interference-russia-2020-assessment.html),
[when operatives tried]{.underline} [to stoke racial
animosity]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [**creating fake Black Lives
Matter groups** and spreading disinformation to **[depress black voter
turnout](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/us/politics/russia-2016-influence-campaign.html).**]{.underline}
Now, [Russia is]{.underline} also [trying to influence white
supremacist]{.underline} [groups]{.underline}, the officials said; they
gave few details, but one official said federal investigators are
examining how at least one neo-Nazi organization with ties to Russia is
funded.

[Other Russian efforts]{.underline}, [which American intelligence
agencies have tracked]{.underline}, [involve]{.underline} [simply
prodding white nationalists]{.underline} [to more aggressively
spread]{.underline} [hate messages and amplifying their]{.underline}
[invective]{.underline}. [**Russian** **operatives** are]{.underline}
also **[trying to push black extremist groups toward
violence]{.underline}**, according to multiple officials, though they
did not detail how.

[Russia's]{.underline} more [public influence operations]{.underline},
[like state-backed news organizations]{.underline}, have [continued to
**push divisive racial narratives**]{.underline}, including stories
emphasizing allegations of police abuse in the United States and
highlighting racism against African-Americans within the military.

And [as social media companies]{.underline} [more vigilantly
monitor]{.underline} [for foreign activity]{.underline} than they did in
2016, Russia has also adjusted its methods to evade detection. Rather
than disseminate messages as widely as possible, as in 2016, Russian
operatives are using private Facebook groups, posts on the online
message board 4chan and closed chat rooms that are more difficult to
monitor, according to intelligence officials.

[Russia's primary goal]{.underline}, according to several officials
briefed on the intelligence who spoke on condition of anonymity to
discuss sensitive information, **[is to foster a sense of
chaos]{.underline}** in the United States, though its motivations are
under debate and difficult to decipher in the absence of high-level
intelligence sources inside Moscow.

The direct effect of its interference on presidential politics is less
clear, though some American officials said that Russia believed that
acts of violence could bolster President Trump's re-election bid if he
could argue that a response to such an episode demanded continuity and
that he represented a law-and-order approach.

The F.B.I. and other intelligence agencies declined to comment on
specific Russian activities.

"[We see Russia is willing to conduct more brazen]{.underline} [and
disruptive influence operations]{.underline} [because of how it
perceives its conflict with the West]{.underline}," David Porter, a top
agent on the F.B.I.'s Foreign Influence Task Force, said last month at
an election security conference in Washington.

He added, "To put it simply, in this space, Russia wants to watch us
tear ourselves apart."

Because Russia is trying to amplify the messaging of existing groups,
its interference is difficult for American officials to combat given
First Amendment protections for speech. The government does have the
legal authority to stop hate speech that explicitly advocates violence,
and social media companies continue to take down accounts linked to
Russian intelligence or disinformation groups.

[Attempts]{.underline} [to exacerbate racial divisions]{.underline} [are
**only one strand**]{.underline} [of Russia's influence
operations]{.underline} in 2020; [Moscow's intelligence]{.underline}
[agencies]{.underline} [promote a variety of narratives]{.underline}
a[nd divisive issues.]{.underline} But [perhaps no more difficult issue
exists]{.underline} in the United States **[than racial justice and
privilege]{.underline}**, and [officials]{.underline} expressed
[worry]{.underline} that **[amplifying divisions]{.underline}** [among
races]{.underline} [could do the most damage to]{.underline} [the
country's social fabric.]{.underline}

The Russian intelligence services took note of the divisive nature of
the 2017 white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., which led to
the death of a counterprotester, and concluded that promoting hate
groups was the most effective method of sowing discord in the United
States, according to American intelligence reports described by the
officials.

Some American officials believe that Russia is trying to undermine
American democracy and the nation's standing in the world by driving
debate to the extremes.

"One of [Russia's]{.underline} [goals]{.underline} [is weakening
institutions]{.underline} [and the **weaponization of
race**]{.underline} is a way they can do that," said Laura Rosenberger,
the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. "A divided America
is a weaker America. When we are unable to solve our challenges
together, [Russia is more able to flex its power around the
world."]{.underline}

Historically, [oppressed]{.underline} [minorities]{.underline} [may be
more likely]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [gravitate]{.underline}
[towards]{.underline} **[a certain group identity]{.underline}**. [It
is]{.underline} [unsurprising]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
[Russia]{.underline} [identifies]{.underline} [these
individuals]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [targets of
disinformation]{.underline}. What is also concerning, however, is that
[Russia has been using social media]{.underline} [platforms to track
the]{.underline} [progress]{.underline} [of emerging cultural movements
and has worked to]{.underline} [infiltrate and fortify]{.underline}
[an]{.underline} [identity-consciousness]{.underline}
[among]{.underline} [members]{.underline} of these groups.

The [Kremlin]{.underline} [exploits]{.underline} social media
[platforms]{.underline} [like]{.underline} [Facebook, Twitter,
Alphabet]{.underline}, and Instagram by turning them into dual-use
tools. First, they use these [platforms]{.underline} to [capture the
"pulse" of]{.underline} [political discourse]{.underline} [and
gauge]{.underline} [the]{.underline} content [spectrum]{.underline} [of
conversations]{.underline} surrounding certain topics or groups. The
Russians then use social media as a joiner tool, bringing together
like-minded individuals under the banner of a shared interest or idea.

[This is]{.underline} precisely [how]{.underline} [Russian operatives
imbedded]{.underline} [within the "Red Pill" movement]{.underline}---[an
internet culture]{.underline} **[rooted in male supremacy and white
nationalism]{.underline}**. Southern Poverty Law Center [recently
classified ](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy)the
Red Pill movement as an extremist ideology. A number of online
communities affiliated with the [Red Pill]{.underline} movement [have a
history]{.underline} [of [encouraging **hatred** and **violence**

While Russia did not start the movement, it helped amplify the extreme
messaging of this group, which helped it develop a sizeable audience.
According to the New Knowledge report, the IRA-run Instagram account,
"the.red.pill," had approximately 3.5 million total interactions.
Additionally, our analysis shows that thousands of [IRA]{.underline}
tweets [attempted to attract people]{.underline} to the Red Pill
movement [by co-opting hashtags like #RedPill, #FollowTheWhiteRabbit,
and #BlackPill.]{.underline}

[It should not go unrecognized]{.underline} [that a few young
men]{.underline} [exposed to Red Pill ideology]{.underline} **[have
committed atrocious domestic acts of terror]{.underline}**. For
instance, in [Santa
Barbara](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/05/27/inside-the-manosphere-that-inspired-santa-barbara-shooter-elliot-rodger/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d9a251bd6ed0),
**[a young man]{.underline}** associated with the movement **[murdered
six individuals]{.underline}**. Just two months ago, **[another
follower]{.underline}** of the Red Pill movement **[shot and killed 11
people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.]{.underline}** The shooter was also
an [active participant on
Gab](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html),
a nascent social networking platform and, according to New Knowledge,
a [known
hotbed ](https://disinformationreport.blob.core.windows.net/disinformation-report/NewKnowledge-Disinformation-Report-Whitepaper.pdf#page=5)of
Russian disinformation.

The Russian accounts promoting the Red Pill movement did not directly
instruct the men to commit violent crimes, but the [account moderators
are guilty of]{.underline} [investing time and resources into fostering
communities]{.underline} [of people bound together by shared
hate]{.underline}. By actively promoting movements like Red Pill, the
Russians are making clear their intent to fan the flames of fear and
hate in society.

[Unprecedented]{.underline} [growth]{.underline} [in the
number]{.underline} [and influence]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
right-wing [nationalist populist]{.underline} [movements]{.underline}
and political parties [have]{.underline} [characterised]{.underline}
[the first two decades]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [21st
century.]{.underline} 

[Brexit]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [election of
Trump]{.underline} [represent **only the tip**]{.underline} [of this
global iceberg]{.underline}. Brazil has seen the election of Bolsonaro,
a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage and race equality initiatives; in
**[France islamophobic]{.underline}** National Front
**[leader]{.underline}** [Marine Le Pen]{.underline} [was the
**runner**]{.underline} [**up** in the 2017 presidential
election]{.underline}; **[Austria's Freedom]{.underline}**
**[Party]{.underline}**, which [has vowed to ban]{.underline}
[free]{.underline} [distribution of the Koran]{.underline}, **[has won
over 25 per cent]{.underline}** of the national vote and has been part
of a coalition government. 

[Meanwhile]{.underline}, in Germany, the **[Alternative for
Germany]{.underline}**, a party with distinct neo-Nazi overtones, now
**[has 94 seats in the Bundestag]{.underline}** (parliament) and is the
largest opposition party. [Likewise, in]{.underline} [Switzerland, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden,]{.underline} [Finland and Norway,
right-wing national populists]{.underline} [have]{.underline} **[gained
a significant share of votes]{.underline}** and parliamentary
representation. In Italy the xenophobic Legal Nord has been in
government, while in Hungary and Poland authoritarian populist parties
have been in government and have begun to dismantle independent
judiciaries, repress dissent and even explicitly call for illiberal
democracy. And so on.

But how and in what ways is racism involved in the phenomenal growth of
this nationalist right-wing populism? First, it helps to define
populism. At a minimum, populist ideology posits an opposition between a
'pure' people and a 'corrupt' political elite which is out of touch and
is responsible for the damage caused to the nation or people. Populist
electoral strategy is then based on a promise to rein in the power of
this elite, rid it of corruption, and restore the fortunes of the
people. There is usually a crucial element in which populists argue that
there are internal or external 'others' who are involved in the downward
fortunes of the genuine 'people' of the nation. It is in this way that
racism can be inserted as an important part of the message. These others
may be the EU, minorities, recent or even third generation immigrants,
refugees or economic migrants, such as the Mexicans so strongly evoked
by Trump as posing a strong economic and cultural threat to white
Americans. Even the EU has created an external, xenophobic and
racialised threat by a short-lived attempt to rebrand the head of the
EU's migration policy as 'the commissioner for protecting the European
way of life'. 

Sociologists and political scientists have argued that there are four
main causes that explain the rise of nationalist right-wing populism,
some aligned with the definition above. The four components are: a
distrust of corrupt or out of touch power elites; a fear of the
destruction of national cultures and identities; relative deprivation;
and a dealignment between mainstream parties and electorates. This last
issue is a phenomenon particularly reflected in the poor showing of
social democratic, labour parties which have seen their working- class
voter base eroded by the nationalist populists.

Each of these four main causes are intertwined with racism or
racialisation in one form or another. The distrust of political elites
is partly related to the unwillingness or inability of national elites
to curb immigration, especially Muslim immigration. Muslims are
racialised as practising a distinctly non-white way of life that is
supposedly completely at variance with the 'Western' or 'European'
culture. Relative deprivation in the form of a fall in living standards
is easily blamed on the arrival of immigrants and refugees, and this is
indeed what right-wing populists tend to do. The restructuring of the
usual pact between working-class electorates and social democratic
parties has occurred in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis in
which social democratic parties, rather than the financial sector and
its elites, are blamed for profligacy and being supposedly 'soft' on
welfare 'scroungers', especially non-white immigrants (although white
Eastern Europeans have also been caught up in a form of racialised,
xenophobic framing).

[What brings all these]{.underline} [elements]{.underline}
[together]{.underline} [is]{.underline} what has been called the
**[ideology of 'nativism']{.underline}**. "[Britain]{.underline}
[first]{.underline}", as the murderer of the British MP Jo Cox shouted
as he killed her**[,  echoes Trump's 'America first']{.underline}**, and
'[Germany for Germans']{.underline} [or 'Sweden for the
Swedes',]{.underline} always with the strong sense that the 'true' or
'genuine' natives who are being defended are white. Trump's rallying cry
'[**Make America Great Again'** has been]{.underline} [**perceived**
**as** a thinly veiled call for making America]{.underline} '**[white
again']{.underline}**, notwithstanding the fact that the earliest
Americans we know were non-white indigenous peoples (formerly labelled
'Red Indians'). In the case of Britain (and this might be extended to
the whole of Western Europe), [**the fantasy of an original**, **pure**
**white population is belied**]{.underline} [by the fact that the
earliest Briton discovered so far]{.underline} (the so-called 'Cheddar
Man' whose remains were found in the Cheddar gorge) [would today be
identified as black]{.underline}.

[Right-wing national populism,]{.underline} **[then, is a
thoroughly]{.underline}** **[racialised phenomenon]{.underline}**. Not
all those who support nativism would see themselves as racist, but
[the]{.underline} [consequences of adopting]{.underline} [a nativist
stance]{.underline} **[draws one into territory that is certainly
stained with racism.]{.underline}**

[**Pessimism [Trap]{.mark}** 2]{.underline}: The [[State is **Unified**,
**Deliberate** and **Unchanging** in]{.underline}]{.mark} Its [[Desire
to Dispossess Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} and Gain]{.underline}
Unfettered [Access to Indigenous Lands and Resources]{.underline}

In other words, [[colonialism]{.mark} by settler states
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[constant]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[variable]{.underline}]{.mark}, in both
outcome and intent. Further, the state is not only intentionally
colonial, but it is also unified in its desire to co-opt Indigenous
peoples as a method and means of control.

In 2005\'s Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, \'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart\'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
\'self-termination movement\', Alfred states, \'It is senseless to
advocate for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and
intense ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful
to us: our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to
land\'.23

Alfred\'s Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that \'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories\'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but \'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream\'.25 According to Alfred, the
state \'relegates indigenous peoples\' rights to the past, and
constrains the development of their societies by allowing only those
activities that support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous
peoples today do not present a serious challenge to its legitimacy\'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state\'s desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
\'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny
it a voice\', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years,
\'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to
it\'.27 According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders
and \'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands
to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a \"solution\" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie\'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard\'s central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
\'colonized subjects\', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
\'misrecog-nition\' granted through the state but can even come to
identify with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now
works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping
their perspectives in line with state discourses, rather than merely
excluding them, as in years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek \'the
reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still
colonial insofar as it remains structurally committed to the
dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and self-determining
authority\'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples\' self-determination claims in ways that \'jeopardize the
futures of indigenous communities\'.31 He claims that states first
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deem-phasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} move, Corntassel [[limits and]{.mark}
**actually [demeans]{.mark}** [Indigenous agency]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[overlooking]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[reality]{.mark} that
**[Indigenous organisations]{.mark} themselves**
[chose]{.mark}]{.underline} the human rights [framework and rights
discourse [as]{.mark}]{.underline} a [target [sphere of
action]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely [[because]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
was evident in [earlier [struggles like slavery]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[civil rights or women\'s rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, these were
[[tools]{.underline}]{.mark} available to them that [[had a
proven]{.mark} track [record of opening up]{.mark} **new
[possibilities]{.mark}** [and shifting previous **state**]{.mark}
**positions** and [behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous advocates
also cleverly realised, by the 1970s, that the anti-discrimination and
decolonisation frames could be used together against states. States did,
in no way, nefariously impose a rights framework on Indigenous peoples.
Rather, [Indigenous organisations and]{.underline} savvy [[Indigenous
political actors]{.mark} **[deliberately chose]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
frame their self-determination struggles within the human rights
framework in order to bring states into a double bind where they could
not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim that they uphold
equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous peoples\' human rights
and leaving them with a diminished and unequal right of
self-determination. But, because he is caught [in the **pessimism
[trap]{.mark}** [of seeing the state]{.mark} only [as]{.mark} unified,
deliberate and [unchanging]{.mark}]{.underline}, Corntassel [[overlooks
and diminishes]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**clear story** of Indigenous
agency and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for **positive
change**]{.mark} in advancing self-determination in]{.underline} a
[multitude of ways]{.underline}.

[**Pessimism Trap** 3]{.underline}: [Engagement with]{.underline} the
[Settler State is Futile]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive

Since the state always intends to maintain, if not expand, colonial
control, and is seeking to co-opt as many Indigenous peoples as possible
in order to maintain or expand its dispossession and control, it is
therefore futile, at best, and actually dangerous to Indigenous
existence to engage with the state. Furthermore, all patterns of
engagement will lead to co-optation as the state is cunning and
unrelenting in its desire to co-opt Indigenous leaders, academics and
professionals in order to gain or maintain control of Indigenous
peoples.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and \'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating\'.32 Alfred states that a \'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions\'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is \'precluded by the
state\'s insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of
sovereignty\'.34 Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous
communities frame their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal
rights and title, but do so within a state framework, rather than
resisting the state itself, it \'represents the culmination of white
society\'s efforts to assimilate indigenous peoples\'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, \'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position
that calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to \"turn away\" from
the assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
\"traditional\" political values and practices\'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1\. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples\' existence;

2\. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\. Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
need for Indigenous resurgence movements \'to address the interrelated
systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples\' experiences in
both urban and land-based settings\'38;

4\. Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and reflective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state\'s political and legal
system, he does assert that \'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political configurations of power that we
initially sought.to challenge\'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for
\'critical self-reflection, skepticism, and caution\' in a \'resurgent
politics of recognition that seeks to practice decolonial,
gender-emancipatory, and economically non-exploitative alternative
structures of law and sovereign authority grounded on a critical
refashioning of the best of Indigenous legal and political
traditions\'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel\'s observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink \'boomerang model\' and \'channels the energies
of transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries\', by which an \'illusion of inclusion\' is created.41
He argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel finds that \'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities\'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly \'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice\'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide \'illusions of
inclusion\' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
\'channeled\' and \'blunted\' by colonial state actors, \'it is a
critical time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to
bringing Indigenous rights concerns to global forums\'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic \'Resurgence\' Versus the
Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

All of these writers advocate Indigenous resurgence, through a
combination of rejecting the current reconciliation politics of settler
colonial states, coupled with a return to land-based Indigenous
expressions of governance as the only viable, \'authentic\' and
legitimate path to a better future for Indigenous peoples, which they
refer to as decolonisation. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, all three theorists are also caught
in the same three pessimism traps: authenticity versus co-option; a
vision of the state as unified, deliberate and never changing in its
desire to colonise and control; and a view of engagement with the state
as futile, if not dangerous, to Indigenous sovereignty and existence.
When combined, [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} three pessimism traps [aim
to [inhibit Indigenous peoples\' engagement with]{.mark} the [state
in]{.mark} **any [process]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}]{.underline} could
potentially [re-imagine and [re-formulate]{.mark} their **current
[relationship]{.mark}** [into one]{.mark}]{.underline} that could be
[[transformative and post-colonial]{.underline}]{.mark}, as envisioned
by the [**[UN]{.mark}** **[D]{.mark}**eclaration on the
**[R]{.mark}**ights of **[I]{.mark}**ndigenous
**[P]{.mark}**eoples]{.underline}. The [pessimism traps together
work]{.underline} to [[foreclose]{.mark} any
[possibility]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[there could be]{.mark}
**credible [openings]{.mark}** [of opportunity to negotiate]{.mark} a
[fairer]{.mark}]{.underline} and just [[relationship]{.mark} of
co-existence [with]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
most progressive [[state]{.mark} government]{.underline}.

This pessimistic approach is not innocuous. By [**over[emphasising
structure]{.mark}** and granting the state]{.underline} an [enormous
degree of agency]{.underline} as a unitary actor, this [pessimistic
approach [does]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**remarkable
[disservice]{.mark}** [to Indigenous resistance]{.mark} movements [by
proscribing]{.mark}]{.underline}, from academia, [an **extremely
[narrow]{.mark}** [view of what]{.mark} Indigenous
[self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline} can and [[should
mean]{.underline}]{.mark} in practice. By [[overlooking
and]{.underline}]{.mark}/or [[discounting Indigenous]{.mark}
agency]{.underline} and [not]{.underline} even [considering]{.underline}
the [possibility]{.underline} that [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}
could [themselves]{.underline} be [calculating]{.underline},
**[strategic [political actors]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their own
right, and vis-a-vis states, the [pessimistic lens]{.underline} of the
resurgence school [unnecessarily]{.underline}, [unproductively and
[unjustly limits]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[field of possibility]{.mark}
for Indigenous peoples]{.underline}\' decision-making, thus actually
countering and inhibiting expressions of Indigenous self-determination.
By [condemning]{.underline}---writ large---all [Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} and organisations [that wish]{.underline} to seek
[peaceful co-existence with the state]{.underline}, negotiate mutually
beneficial agreements with the state, and/or who have advocated on the
international level for a set of standards that can provide a positive
guiding framework for Indigenous-state relations, the [pessimistic
lens]{.underline} of resurgence forecloses much potential for new and
improved relations, in any form, and is [very likely to lead to **deeper
conflicts**]{.underline} between states and Indigenous peoples,
[and]{.underline} potentially, even [violent action]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. The [pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are]{.underline} therefore,
likely [[self-defeating]{.underline}]{.mark} for all but the most remote
and isolated Indigenous communities. Further, this [approach
is]{.underline} quite [[out of step with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
actions and [[vision of]{.mark} **many [Indigenous]{.mark} resistance**
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} on the ground who have been [working for
decades to advance Indigenous self-determination]{.underline}, both
domestically and globally, [in ways that transform the colonial
state]{.underline} into something more just [and]{.underline} may
[eventually present **creative alternatives** to]{.underline} the
[Westphalian state form in ways that]{.underline} could respect and
[accommodate Indigenous nations]{.underline}. Rather, it [aims to
**shame** and **blame**]{.underline} those who wish to explore creative
and innovative post-colonial resolutions to the colonial condition.

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration
or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 after 25
years of development. The Declaration is ground-breaking, given the key
leadership roles Indigenous peoples played in negotiating and achieving
this agreement.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN history, the
rights holders, Indigenous peoples, worked with states to develop an
instrument that would serve to promote, protect and affirm Indigenous
rights, both globally and in individual domestic contexts.46

Many Indigenous organisations and movements, from dozens of countries
around the world, were involved in drafting and negotiating the UN
Declaration and are now advocating for its full implementation, both
internationally and in domestic and regional contexts. In Canada, some
of the key organisational players --- the Grand Council of the Crees
(Eeyou Istchee), the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British
Columbia Indian Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations --- were
involved in the drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration
during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations
like the American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights
Fund have been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous
peoples\' governing institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council
and the Sami Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous
rights. In Latin America, organisations like the Confederation de
Nationalidades Indfgenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de
Sud America (CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration.
The three, major transnational Indigenous organisations --- the World
Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty Council
and the Inuit Circumpolar Council --- were all key members of the
drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration, and the latter
two, which are still in existence, continue their strong advocacy for
its full implementation.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires [[fundamental]{.mark} and **significant
[change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, on both the international and domestic
levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights essentially calls
for a complete and fundamental restructuring of Indigenous-state
relationships, it expects states to enact and implement a significant
body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy changes that can
accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights, free, prior and
informed consent, redress and a variety of self-government, autonomy and
other such arrangements. States are not going to implement this
multifaceted and complex set of changes on their own, however. They will
require significant political and moral pressure to hold them
accountable to the rhetorical commitments they have made to support this
level of change. They will also [[require]{.mark} ongoing
conversation]{.underline} and negotiation [with Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} along the way, [lest]{.underline} the [process
becomes **problematically one-sided**]{.underline}. Such processes
ultimately [require [sustained **political**]{.mark}
**will**]{.underline}, [commitment]{.underline} and [[engagement]{.mark}
over the long term]{.underline}, to [[reach]{.mark} the [end result of
**radical**]{.mark} **systemic [change]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
Indigenous state relationships grounded in mutual respect, co-existence
and reciprocity. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} type of fundamental change
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} creative thinking, careful diplomacy,
tenacity, and above all, [optimistic [vision]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[on
the part of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}. The pessimistic
approaches of the resurgence school are ultimately of little use in
these efforts, other than as a cautionary tale against state power, of
which the organisational players are already keenly aware. Further, [by
[dismissing and discouraging]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[efforts at
engagement with states]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
especially with the [blanket [accusations]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[all]{.mark} who engage]{.underline} in such [[efforts
are]{.underline}]{.mark} \'[[co-opted]{.underline}]{.mark}\' [[and
not]{.underline}]{.mark} \'**[[authentically]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'
[[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}, the resurgence school actually
[[creates **unnecessary**]{.mark} **negative** feelings and
[divisions]{.mark} amongst Indigenous movements]{.underline} who should
be pooling limited resources and working together towards better
futures.

European governments have been alarmed by [a Russian]{.underline}
[disinformation]{.underline} campaign that **[seeks to deflect
criticism]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin's
wa]{.underline}r [with]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline} [risks leaving
**millions of people in Africa**]{.underline} [facing
famine.]{.underline}

[**Russian diplomats** have gone on a **media offensive**]{.underline}
**[in recent months]{.underline}** [**to push the narrative** **that
sanctions**,]{.underline} [**rather than Russian** **blockades, are
causing shortages of grains and fertilizer in Africa**]{.underline}. The
public-relations onslaught shows how the monthslong war in Ukraine is
becoming a global propaganda battle as food, fuel and crop-nutrient
prices surge.

EU and U.K. officials who've recently met their African counterparts at
meetings in New York and Rwanda expressed concern that the Russian
message is gaining traction, said senior European diplomats who asked
not to be identified. In response, [European governments
are]{.underline} [increasing]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
[engagement]{.underline} [with leaders]{.underline} [on the]{.underline}
[continent]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [boosting]{.underline} [their
own information]{.underline} [campaigns to counter the
Russian]{.underline} [narrative]{.underline}, the diplomats said.

A senior European intelligence officer said the Kremlin had manufactured
the debate as a means to get sanctions lifted and was intent on using
the threat of global hunger as a bargaining tool in any future peace
talks. [Moscow has focused much of its influence]{.underline}
[operations on Africa and the Middle]{.underline} East, the official
said.

The Ideals of the American Republic

[The stakes in the Russo-American conflict are **high**]{.underline}.
Russian leader Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} seeks to **undermine
confidence** in **democratically elected institutions**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [the **institution of democracy itself** in the United
States and the West.]{.underline}1 [He [is trying to interfere
with]{.mark} the [ability of]{.mark} American and European [peoples to
**choose their leaders freely**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and is
undermining]{.mark} the **[rules-based international
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on which **American**]{.mark}
**prosperity** and [**security** rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. [His actions
in Ukraine and Syria have driven the **world** toward **greater
violence** and **disorder**.]{.underline} [The **[normalization of

[system.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Moscow's war on]{.mark} the **very idea of [truth]{.mark}** has been
perhaps the most **damaging** Russian undertaking in recent
years]{.underline}. [The most basic element of the Russian information
strategy]{.underline}, which we will consider in more detail presently,
[is the creation of a sense of **uncertainty** around **any important
issue**]{.underline}. [Russia's strategy does not require persuading
Western audiences that its actions in]{.underline} Ukraine's
[Crimea]{.underline}n Peninsula [or the Kerch Strait]{.underline}, which
connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, for example, [were legal or
justified]{.underline}.3 [It is enough to create an environment in which

falsehoods and accusations of falsehoods which]{.underline}, **[[if left

does not necessarily need its target audiences to believe in lies; its

She is far from alone. [Female politicians]{.underline} [and other
high]{.underline} [profile]{.underline} [women]{.underline} **[worldwide
are facing a deluge]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} what you could call
**[sexualized disinformation]{.underline}**. It mixes old ingrained
sexist attitudes with the anonymity and reach of social media in an
effort to destroy women's reputations and push them out of public life.

Several female politicians in the small Caucasian nation of Georgia were
the victims of a sexualized disinformation campaign last year, in the
run-up to parliamentary elections. [A series of videos]{.underline}
[purportedly]{.underline} [showing them having sex]{.underline} [were
released online]{.underline}, with intimidating messages. [The goal was
to **spread "fear"**]{.underline} **[among women]{.underline}**
**[involved in politics]{.underline}**, says Tamara Chergoleishvili, a
prominent journalist and activist, whose husband is a well-known
opposition politician. Georgia is a very conservative country where
patriarchal attitudes remain strong, so that made the attack more
potent. To underline the point, [the message was]{.underline}
[accompanied]{.underline} [by doctored images]{.underline} [purporting
to show]{.underline} [her totally naked.]{.underline}

Chergoleishvili was targeted too, in a video supposedly showing her
engaged in sex with two other people. But Chergoleishvili says it was a
fake. "They didn't know I've had a huge tattoo on my back since, like,
2000," she laughs.

Though it backfired in her case, another female politician implicated in
an extramarital affair as a result of the videos has all but retreated
from Georgian political life.

By contrast, [the men who featured have not suffered]{.underline},
["because male adultery is a common thing]{.underline}," says
Chergoleishvili. "Maybe the family suffered, but society would be less
judgemental, whereas women are supposed to be the Virgin Mary. They're
not supposed to have sex."

There was one exception. A man who appeared in the video aimed at
Chergoleishvili was labelled as "gay," which put him at extreme risk
because of deep-seated homophobic attitudes in Georgia. "It took a long
time for him to get over that," she recalls.

Like Chergoleishvili, Zalishchuk has withstood the attacks against her,
and continues to maintain a high profile. But she can't escape her naked
doppelganger. "Whenever I speak publicly somewhere abroad, someone will
comment on it \[on social media\]," the Ukrainian MP says, often adding
a link to the photo. "I have no resources to fight that." "It was all
intended to discredit me as a personality, to devalue me, and what I'm
saying." Ukrainian MP Svitlana Zalishchuk

[Zalishchuk]{.underline} **[suspects a pro-Kremlin hand]{.underline}**
[in the]{.underline} abuse she has experienced, **[as it started at the
height of the conflict with Russia.]{.underline}** [And the **fake
claims** and **doctored images** **first** **appeared** **on pro-Kremlin
platforms.**]{.underline} But whatever the case, it has become a
worldwide problem for any women who takes a position online.

[The use of realistic pictures]{.underline} --- which [is easy to
achieve]{.underline} [with modern software]{.underline} --- [adds to the
potency]{.underline} **[of these misogynistic disinformation
campaigns]{.underline}**, says Sandra Pepera, director of Gender, Women,
and Democracy programs at the National Democratic Institute, in
Washington, D.C. "[Obscene harassment is]{.underline} [bad
enough,]{.underline} [but the visualization of it is what tips
the]{.underline} [balance]{.underline}."

Such abuse is becoming almost part of the job for female politicians.
But logging off to try to escape is not really an option, as being on
social media is such a crucial part of being a modern-day politician.

In Georgia, the government eventually condemned the release of the sex
tapes, and they were removed from YouTube. But that could not mitigate
the damage entirely, as the names of those shown in the videos spread
widely. And intimidation like this can have a smothering effect on
female engagement in politics, says the NDI's Pepera, "limiting both the

President Joe Biden announcing major economic sanctions against Russia
on Tuesday, following Russian president Vladimir Putin\'s move of troops
into the eastern region of Ukraine. While Putin called it a peacekeeping
mission, the U.S. calls it a flagrant violation of international law. In
Hawaii, Ukraine may seem like a world away, but the impacts of the
situation in eastern Europe will be felt on its shores. \"When you are
in a place like Hawaii and you are thinking thank goodness we aren\'t
right next door to the war, you need to start questioning what does it
mean, what kind of precedent does it mean that international boundaries
don\'t matter,\" said Jairus Grove, associate professor of international
studies at the University of Hawaii Grove says how the situation in
Ukraine plays out, could have lasting consequences. [\"This is calling
into question what NATO is for, this is calling into question what the
U.S. can do without firing shots,\" Grove said.]{.underline}

Using an example from Thomas C. Schelling\'s, \'Arms and Influence,\'
[Grove says there are two different things that military power does.
\"**First it deters**, it prevents another state from attacking you,\"
said Grove. \"**Then, there is** having so much power because of
military might you can have **compellence** which means without firing a
shot you can compel a state to do what you would like it to
do.\"]{.underline} Grove says for most of our lifetimes, we have lived
with the belief that the United States has compellence. Now, [he thinks
Putin has kind of called the bluff on that belief, and how the U.S.
continues to react will be watched closely by other adversaries. \"Once
one state calls your bluff, you kind of wait for the next one to do it
and the United States will be put to a choice, when do we decide that
it's not a bluff, when are we actually willing to fight and that is the
conversation we need to have,\" said Grove]{.underline}. Among the
sanctions issued Tuesday, Feb. 22: cutting off Russia\'s government from
western finances, which means the country can no longer trade in its new
debt on U.S. or European markets. But [Grove was quick to point out,
sanctions only work if they are painful and if they are a painful they
are probably working in a way we aren\'t going to like]{.underline}. One
example is at the gas pump where Hawai\'i will continue to see prices
rise. \"We are market takers and so we tend to purchase the oil on the
market where we can get it cheapest and over the last few years, 34% or
about 1/3 of all oil comes from Russia so from that stand point it has a
major impact on us,\" said Chris Yunker, Managing Director, Resiliency,
Clean Transportation, and Analytics, with the Hawai\'i State Energy
Office. [According to Grove, the problem lies in if the sanctions don\'t
work though. \"That means **we don\'t have a way to constrain Russia
without using military force**,\" said Grove]{.underline}. [Grove says
he thinks Putin over the last several years has built a large enough
counter financial network outside of the sanctions that he can keep
investment and capital coming in]{.underline}. \"He has a lot to lose
politically by kowtowing to the sanctions,\" said Grove. \"I would be
surprised. The domestic costs would be high for him and I don't know if
he will even feel the pinch.\" [Only time will tell whether or not
sanctions work to deter Russia, but Grove says this will be a period of
tremendous uncertainty and rapid change.]{.underline}

He does believe the probability of a direct war between the U.S. and
Russia is less than zero, saying he doesn\'t see Biden committing U.S.
troops to this particular conflict. [\"]{.underline}But what this can
do, is this conflict can spread and that poses the question of [**if
Russia takes Ukraine too easily, will Putin set his eyes elsewhere**,\"
said Grove.]{.underline}

**He thinks Russia's revisionist!**

//CHC-DS

"We ... have a lot of anti-war activists in the state who watch these
kinds of humanitarian catastrophes very closely," said Grove. "We have a
lot of people who are uniformed members of the U.S. military, who I\'m
sure are already thinking, 'Is this a conflict that the United States is
going to become involved in? Are we going to be sent to Europe to
reinforce NATO allies?'" He also encouraged anyone who might feel
Ukraine is far away to take the time to engage, as everyone\'s
participation is important for a flourishing democracy. ["That's what
makes us different than Russia ... our foreign policy is shaped
by]{.underline} our discourse and [our elections and who represents us,"
Grove said.]{.underline}

Russia's Fake News

Olga Sousa moved to San Francisco when she was 19 years old, after
growing up in the city Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, where
Russian forces have been fighting and seized a large nuclear power plant
on March 4. Sousa has now lived in Hawaii for the last eight years.
After learning that Russia had invaded Ukraine, Sousa told Spectrum News
Hawaii that she called her mom, who currently lives in San Francisco,
and they talked about their worry for Sousa's 33-year-old brother. He
lives in Hawaii, but had returned to Zaporizhzhia the week before the
war started, trying to help his wife get out of Ukraine. "She was just
crying," said Sousa about her mother. "I have such a heavy guilt that
I\'m here safe. I\'m thankful that I\'m here, but at the same time I
feel guilty that I\'m here." Sousa is half Ukrainian and half Russian,
as her Russian mother moved to Ukraine in the 1980s, where she met her
Ukrainian father. Her mom's sister and her cousins still live in Russia,
but she said her mom and aunt stopped speaking five years ago, because
her aunt claimed Russia is helping Ukraine and the country should
surrender. Sousa said Russian President Vladimir Putin's rhetoric has
brainwashed people. "It\'s very heartbreaking," said Sousa about her
family's division. [Grove said that]{.underline} **[Russia is good at
defining the narrative]{.underline}** [of what's taking place
**through** strategic communications and]{.underline} **[fake
news]{.underline}**, [including perpetuating the **false claim that**
"**this is a defensive invasion** (and) that (attacking) Ukraine is
about protecting Russia."]{.underline} ["Russia is very good at building
stories, which draw people in and they can be conspiratorial (or) they
can merely go with people\'s already existing political preferences, but
they\'re very good at inflaming differences," said Grove]{.underline}.
Still, Grove said Putin can't control all the information that comes
into the country, especially with the internet. This is part of the
reason some Russians are protesting the war in Ukraine.

War crimes

When Sousa first found out that Russia was attacking Ukraine, she said
she was in disbelief; despite Russia's escalation of troops, she never
thought they would attack. She checked news reports, but information was
just starting to come in, so she called a friend in Ukraine, who told
her the apartment building next to her had just been bombed. "It was so
surreal. I felt like I was watching a movie," said Sousa. Sousa\'s
grandparents and some of her other friends still live in Ukraine. "I
have a lot of family and friends pretty much all over Ukraine and have
my grandparents in Kharkiv, which has been heavily attacked for the last
two days," said Sousa in an interview with Spectrum News Hawaii on Feb.
28. Kharkiv is the second-largest city in Ukraine, with a population of
1.5 million, and Russia has been attacking the city with airstrikes and
rockets. Residential buildings have been damaged and a missile hit the
city's central square on March 1. The city has put up a resistance to
Russia's fighting, with Russian planes shot down and advancing troops
slowed. "Ukraine is so little compared to Russia on the map. Yet, we\'re
sticking up to Russia," Sousa said. "The strongest feeling I have right
now is definitely pride. I\'m proud for my people." "I\'m sad to see
people dying, to be honest, on either of the sides," Sousa added.
[Grove]{.underline}, the university professor, [told]{.underline}
Spectrum News Hawaii that [it is clear Russia is committing war crimes
in Ukraine right now. "I think whenever you move heavy artillery, and
you\'re bombing in civilian areas, that is by definition, a war crime,"
said Grove]{.underline}. ["We may be seeing **unprecedented dangerous
events** unfolding before us."]{.underline} The 1949 Geneva Convention
Article 8, 2.b defines war crimes, in part, as "intentionally directing
attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual
civilians not taking direct part in hostilities; intentionally directing
attacks against civilian objects, that is, objects which are not
military objectives..." and "intentionally launching an attack in the
knowledge that such an attack will cause incidental loss of life or
injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects ..." The International
Criminal Court launched an investigation on March 2 into whether Putin
is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide as the
civilian death toll rises and widespread destruction is inflicted on
Ukraine.

University of Hawaii associate professor Jairus [Grove]{.underline} says
many in the islands view the war in Ukraine as a far away crisis, and
that makes him sad. He [thinks more people should be
shocked]{.underline}. "It is a watershed moment for global order. [It is
no coincidence that China sent nine warplanes into Taiwan's secure
airspace the same day that Russian tanks rolled into
Ukraine]{.underline}. [He says Russia's naked aggression could
**embolden China** to go after disputed land it claims it owns and wants
to take back. And it could make China more **eager** in the future to
**test agreed-upon international boundaries**.]{.underline} Grove is
chairman of the political science department at UH Manoa and the
director of the Hawaii Research Center for Future Studies. [He thinks
that even the increased support from Germany and other Western allies
for swift sanctions still may not be enough to change what Russia has in
mind. He says even stronger sanctions may push Russia closer to China,
which already signaled it might bail out Russia with economic support
behind the scenes as it has done in the past. **"It is a different kind
of world when China and Russia no longer see each other as
competitors,"** says Grove.]{.underline}

**Their theory is wrong, and the case outweighs.**

Where [I **disagree** with the]{.underline} author, however, is his
[**very concept** of the '**Eurocene**.' [If the]{.mark} present
[international]{.mark} state [system **wasn't working**]{.mark} for
states across the globe [it would be **dying**]{.mark} **out**, [but it
seems]{.mark} to **strengthening**. [There is **no way** we]{.mark} are
[get]{.mark}ting [through]{.mark}]{.underline} what I will remain
calling [[the anthropocene without **some**]{.mark} **level** of a
command [economy for]{.mark} resources and research direction for
[technologies]{.mark}. Many of these [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}
will be scare and [[will be **competed over**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
competitive nature of the state system means something Darwinistic is
occurring, which is good as [we **do not yet have the answer** for
surviving our current era and so **multiple approaches** must be tried
and the **best will serve as models** for others and the **worst will
die out**]{.underline}.

[[I]{.underline}]{.mark} also [**[do not see anything]{.mark}
particularly [European]{.mark}** [about modernity]{.mark} anymore. While
a new era **did begin** with the]{.underline} biological and demographic
[takeover of the western hemisphere and its forceable wedding to
Europe]{.underline}-previously a minor and not particularly important
subcontinental peninsula of Asia-[**[any Eurasian]{.mark} actor** [could
have]{.mark} potentially [done the same thing. The]{.mark} bureaucratic
[state was]{.mark} **first [born in China]{.mark}** and the
[agricultur]{.mark}al state [came from the **Middle East**]{.mark}, and
those strike me as **just as relevant** to where we are now than the
maritime-industrial states of post medieval Europe]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [as [**India** and **China** move]{.mark} their way
[into]{.mark} **full [industrialization]{.mark}** on their own terms and
countries like **Japan** have long held that position dating back to the
colonial era, I find **little** to argue for something called
specifically 'The Eurocene.']{.underline} That being said, the author is
entirely correct that our currently unsustainable methods of development
are a type of self-replicating virus imposed by force. But so too will
any solutions have to follow that path.

It may come as no surprise that I, a person very into geopolitics (and
making speculative realist geopolitics in particular) also take a more
neutral tone on the field than this author. I think [[geopolitics
are]{.mark} **as likely [to get us out of this mess]{.mark}** as they
are to dig us deeper]{.underline}. Aside from general environmental
goals, [[I see **little universal** in how we]{.mark} will [escape
from]{.mark} **pollution** and **mass [extinction]{.mark}** and [more a
**variety of paths** which depend on]{.mark} the **varying ecologies of
different [countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As it is, some countries
will benefit from climate change and their interests cannot be said to
be comparable with those who will suffer. [[A **stateless** world
is]{.mark} a **de facto [neoliberal]{.mark}** world in practice and the
author's fear of political [homogenization is **not caused by
realism**]{.mark} or **geopolitics** [but]{.mark} rather
**[prevented]{.mark} by those same actors**. Diversity can only thrive
in the **absence of grand universal projects**]{.underline}.

So our approaches are very clearly different as [I see realist
geopolitics as the]{.underline} garuntor [\[**guarantor**\] of
ideological, economic, and ecological diversity, **not its
foe**]{.underline}. But Grove is an excellent writer so I enjoyed his
take on it anyway.

**Grove is [too pessimistic]{.underline} about modernity's potential ---
means at [best]{.underline} they solve nothing and at
[worst]{.underline} "martial empiricism" [actively empowers]{.underline}
fascists.**

**Tallis, 20**---senior researcher, Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy, University of Hamburg (Benjamin, "Un-cancelling the
future," New Perspectives, OnlineFirst, July 8, 2020, dml)

Examples of this way of thinking are plentiful but, for convenience, one
need to look no further than Jairus [Grove's]{.underline}
scintillatingly pessimistic keynote at the Hamburg Sessions (forthcoming
as an essay in NP and based on his 2019 book, Savage Ecology).3 It is
not that Grove doesn't make compelling critical [arguments]{.underline}
-- he does and in brilliant, imaginative ways -- but that they [**lack
balance**. And balance **matters**, whether we are reckoning with
horrendous pasts or trying to boldly imaging new futures.]{.underline}

[To see, or]{.underline} certainly to [dwell on, **only the bad** in
what we in the West have collectively done]{.underline} (however, Grove
or anyone else defines who we are), [over the entire course of our past
and present is **grossly unfair**. It also amounts]{.underline}, in
effect, [to a counsel of **despair**, however much Grove protests to the
contrary or claims to eschew nihilism]{.underline}. In his keynote,
having written off our past and present, [Grove]{.underline} also
explicitly [urged us]{.underline} in Europe and the West [to **stop
imagining better**, **progressive futures**]{.underline}, arguing that
this has led to precisely the problems he identified. [Grove's
critique]{.underline} thus not only leaves us out of time (without an
avowable past, present or future) but also [leaves us **without space**
for contesting negative, regressive and repressive political
trends]{.underline}. In his book, he laments the 'debilitating stupor'
in which the work of thinkers like Theodor Adorno and Giorgio Agamben
leaves us (Grove, 2019: 238). But [Grove's]{.underline} own [pessimism,
if we took it seriously]{.underline}, would leave Europeans without a
political leg to stand on. It [would leave us in]{.underline} just such
[a **stupor** -- or **worse** -- with no **solid ground** and no
**lever**: no way to **move the world** and no platform for
**positive**, **progressive change**]{.underline}.

**[Why bother, if everything we do only makes things
worse?]{.underline}**

[[However much harm we]{.underline}]{.mark} Europeans and [Westerners
[have done, we **haven't**]{.mark} **done**, [**don't** and **won't only
do harm**]{.mark}. The real danger of [Grove's]{.mark} type of
**timelessly [pessimistic]{.mark}** [and **literally hopeless**
critique]{.mark} is that]{.underline} (again, if taken seriously) [it
[breeds **only damaging inertia**, **inaction** and
**resentment**]{.mark} -- its hopelessness makes it a **debilitating**
critique; its timelessness offers **no possibility of salvage**, let
alone **progress**. [It **cedes**]{.mark} **the ground** of action [to
those who many of us (including Grove) would]{.mark} **explicitly
[disagree with]{.mark}** -- [whether]{.mark} to [exponents of
'**traditional**']{.mark} approaches to [IR]{.mark} who are **more than
happy** to offer policy advice [or]{.mark}, worse, to
[**authoritarians** and **populists**]{.mark} in practical
politics]{.underline} (as ably described in Johanna Sumuvuori's essay in
this issue). [Critical scholars **too rarely** see it as their task to
construct **positive visions** of better worlds. Instead, too often they
content themselves]{.underline} (if no one else) [with evermore
thoroughgoing deconstructive critique]{.underline} -- including of other
critical academics. Whether totalising or parasitic, even some of its
leading proponents admit that IR's critical project has, thus far, had
insufficient impact on the world at large (Austin, 2017, 2019).

Few critical scholars will thank me for this comparison, but, in their
pessimistic, misanthropic zeal, they echo what French President Emmanuel
Macron called the 'sad passions' of the author Michel Houellebecq4
(Carre\`re, 2017). They may not share Houellebecq's politics, but many
critical scholars certainly share his exhaustive (and exhausting)
disenchantment with contemporary (neo)liberal societies, the state of
Europe and of the West. Too often they also share his miserabilist
outlook on the impossibility of change for the better and the futility
or harm of even trying to improve things.

[[Grove does propose]{.mark} several forms of political action:
[**micro-kindnesses**, however **vague**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. 'the
impossible generosity and affirmation of deconstruction', 2019: 231);
[**[resistant acts]{.mark}** by brave individuals]{.underline} (e.g.
'William ''Fox'' Fallon, who sacrificed his prestigious position as head
of \[US Military\] Central Command because he would not go along with
the plan to attack Iran', 2019: 232); [embracing]{.underline} entirely
new '**[forms of life]{.underline}** 5 '; [[or **welcoming
apocalypse**]{.mark} as driver of change]{.underline} (2019: 229--248).
[Grove **will not be confused with Goldilocks anytime soon** -- these
forms of action each seem either **too little** or (**much**) **too
much**]{.underline}.

[Few of us would question the value of and need for
kindness]{.underline} and, indeed, the most hopeful part of Grove's book
is the touching introduction where he details many of the kindnesses he
has himself benefitted from, mainly from people in the West where he has
spent most of his life. [There is also, clearly, a role for
resistance]{.underline} and for the kinds of acts that Grove notes have
prevented executions and even nuclear war. [Yet [without a **wider
programme**]{.mark}, without a **bigger positive vision**, [kindness and
resistance **cannot**]{.mark} **sufficiently [change our world]{.mark}**
for the better. [Apocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}, on the contrary,
[changes **too much**, [**junks too much** that is good and is
**rarely**]{.mark} **likely** to be an **[appealing]{.mark}** option, or
something we **can all get behind**. The apocalyptic aspect of Grove's
position]{.underline}, like that of many critical scholars, [seeks to
inflict **destructive harm** on Western institutions rather than
**constructively reform** them]{.underline} -- something Houellebecq
would also relish. [[Apocalyptic change]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[smacks of]{.mark} the **[recklessly callous]{.mark}**, **negative
sides** of]{.underline} early 20th-century [futurism]{.underline}
(Marinetti, 1909), [as Grove acknowledges when asking 'How do we go wild
without the cruelty of [indifference]{.mark}?']{.underline} (2019: 280).
Again, a more balanced approach to boldness would help.

[To be clear, major change is needed]{.underline} -- that was the whole
point of the Hamburg Sessions and the motivation behind giving it the
theme of 'Un-Cancelling the Future'. I've argued elsewhere that the kind
of socio-economically regressive, technocratic, defensive liberalisms
that have dominated large parts of the last 40 years in the West have a
lot to answer for (Tallis, 2018). So too, of course, does the type of
narrowly, teleological individually atomising (neo)liberalism that
neither saw (Fukuyama, 1992) nor allowed (Fisher, 2009) alternative
visions of politics, societies and economies. Mark Fisher (2009),
echoing the artist Gerhard Richter (Elger, 2009), called this myopic
liberalism 'Capitalist Realism'. [You don't have to be a Marxist or even
a leftist to see that a **mandated lack of alternatives** and a
**commensurate narrowing of possibilities** and **horizons** is a bad
thing]{.underline}. As noted above, [both climate change and
sociotechnical upheavals in the ways we work and live **need bold
visions** to address the challenges they pose while also seizing the
opportunities they present.]{.underline}

[[It is,]{.mark} however, eminently [possible to **recognise**]{.mark}
**the full horrors** of Europe's ([colonial]{.mark}) [pasts and presents
**without**]{.mark} **immediately [discounting the possibility of
improvement]{.mark}** coming [from the West]{.mark}]{.underline}, from
Europe. Similarly, [one can recognise the myriad problems]{.underline}
that Europeans have caused [while also **celebrating the many positive
things** they have]{.underline} also [achieved]{.underline}. Moreover,
[[it is possible to use]{.mark} those [achievements as
**inspirations**]{.mark} for better ways of doing things -- as
**catalysts** to new, progressive creativity and to positive visions of
the future]{.underline}. Just as Kraftwerk did in the fragile yet
fertile Germany of the second half of the 20th century when they
acknowledged the abyss yet still sought a better future, including as
atonement for that past.

The cancellation of the future

William Gibson recently tweeted ''In the 1920s, the phrase 'the 21st
Century' was already popubiquitous. How often do we see the phrase ''the
22nd Century'', now?''. And it's true -- we don't have these dates
anymore. As a boy, as a young man, I had mental pictures of the 21st
Century. But I don't have any sense of 2050 or 2100 -- except as a
deterioration or a collapse. (Simon Reynolds, Hamburg Sessions 2019, see
essay in this issue)

I return to Kraftwerk below but first, a little more is needed on the
ramifications of contemporary hopelessness. Rather than striving to
create new and compelling positive, progressive visions, many thinkers
content themselves with critique (Austin, 2017) while others, like
Grove, see positive, progressive visions and futures -- especially those
coming from Europe or the wider West -- as being necessarily harmful in
themselves.

This is postmodernism as hangover. The depressed -- and depressing --
aftermath of the shortcomings, broken promises and unintended
consequences of modernisms of different kinds, in which strange
connections are made and selective, guilty memory runs amok (Fisher,
2014). Forgetting the good, it fuses the bewitchingly pertinent aspects
of the post-positivist critical project (which influenced many of us,
myself very much included), with more zealously (self-)destructive and
paralysing tendencies. As Fisher puts it: 'Deconstruction \[is\] a kind
of pathology of scepticism, which induced hedging, infirmity of purpose
and compulsory doubt' (2014: 16). In this mode, scholarship no longer
seeks to invent the train but fixates on the train crash or even
pre-empts and precludes the train's invention for fear of the seemingly
inescapable imagined train crash to come.

Like [[Grove's denunciation]{.mark} of the future]{.underline}, many of
the critiques of (popular) modernisms [are not so much **wrong** as
**imbalanced**]{.underline} (although some are wrong of course, others
not even). [They [take **insufficient account** of modernisms'
**multiple** and **meaningful successes**]{.mark}]{.underline} (there's
no time here, but see, e.g. Fisher, 2014: 22; or Meades, 2014, for a
flavour). This leaves us in an odd situation where many of [the
[scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}, commentators and others [[who criticise
neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, capitalist realism and so on, [[find
themselves in **de facto agreement** with its notion that there should
be no alternative.]{.mark} In this view, we **simply shouldn't do big
vision politics** because our 'schemes to improve the human condition'
have not only 'failed' but will **always**, **inevitably**, do **more
harm than good**]{.underline} (Scott, 2008). [This approach, all post
and no modern, will take us **nowhere**, even as it **fast-forwards the
academic careers** of its exponents]{.underline}.

The future visions that are left, on the left, tend to be Marxist ones
(see, e.g. Grove, 2019: 198-- 202). Tarred not only by the brush of the
communisms that actually existed (and their distinctly less balanced
ledger than that of modernism more widely) they understandably fail to
inspire mass enthusiasm. Many of their proponents are still really more
interested in explaining the failure to bring about the inevitable (full
communism) in the past and present than in imagining new futures that go
beyond the narrow world view and limiting subjectivity of too many
Marxist approaches (see, e.g. Scribner, 2003; Sˇitera, 2015). This has
done little to address the crisis of hope or to countervail prevalent
contemporary pessimism.

[The loss of the belief in the progressive future]{.underline} -- that
tomorrow can be better than yesterday and today -- [and the related
erosion of faith in our ability to **positively shape our own
destiny**]{.underline} are what Berardi (2011: 13) called 'the slow
cancellation of the future'. As Simon Reynolds noted in his Hamburg
Sessions keynote (included in this issue of NP), the cancellation may
have started slowly in the 1970s, but, by the 2000s, it had picked up
speed and its effects could start to be seen. The first of these -- its
more (neo)liberal variant -- was the feeling of living in an endless
present. For a lot of people in the West, this has been comfortable in
many ways (although often unevenly and unfairly) and has had distinct
advantages over the past (the extension of rights and opportunities to
broader swathes of the population) but without much hope, optimism or
greater purpose. Unless it provokes the nostalgic responses outlined
below, this endless present [can lead to a sense of **ennui**, a **lack
of direction** and **loss of momentum**]{.underline}.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} second, **[more overtly
[sinister]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[variant that fills the vacuum left

**Grove says we should replace calculative rationality with a focus on
affect. Don't do that.**

of the "post-truth" era: Feeling rules and networked subjectivity,"
Emotion, Space and Society Volume 27, May 2018, Pages 75-85, dml)

[While the [attention to affective attunement is]{.mark} **potentially
[useful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in deploying a definition of affect as
quantitative, pre-personal, non-conscious, and non-signifying, [[one is
left with **myriad questions** about how particular emotions are
**targeted**, **produced** and **manipulated**]{.mark}
within]{.underline} the [affective politics]{.underline} of digital
media. Papacharissi characterizes affective transmission as follows: "So
digital, among other media, invite and transmit affect but also sustain
affective feedback loops that generate and reproduce affective patterns
of relating to others that are further reproduced as affect --- that is,
intensity that has not yet been cognitively processed as feeling,
emotion, or thought" (23). Following the popular reification of affect,
Papacharissi sharply distinguishes affect from emotion (2015, 13).
"Affect explains the intensity with which something is experienced; it
refers to just that: intensity" (2015, 135). For her, affect is a
central component of how stories are formed and circulated within media
flows, and affect helps provide an index of how some stories end up
being salient in social media, and thus potentially have more or less
political impact. While this account of affect resonates prima facie
with Hochschild\'s concept of "deep stories" and felt truths which shape
the feeling rules we see defining partisan polarization, [[readers are
**left wanting a full articulation**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
**[significance]{.mark}** (rather than simply the **alleged presence**)
of affect as it circulates]{.underline} in and through digital media.
[This reflects a **more widespread [tendency]{.mark}** in much
scholarship [to invoke "affect]{.mark}"]{.underline} in Massumi\'s
"autonomous" sense [[with **little exploration** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[complex [relational manifestations]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
emotions.

[Affect **all too often** [becomes a **mystified idea** akin to]{.mark}
force or energy and intimates an **[abstract celebration]{.mark}** of
the uncontainable]{.underline}:

Disorder, marginality, and anarchy present the habitat for affect,
mainly because order, mainstreaming, and hierarchy afford form that
compromises the futurity of affect. Because marginal spaces support the
emergence of change, [[affect]{.mark} is **inherently political**,
although it [**does not conform** to the structures we symbolically
internalize as political]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, per affect theory,
[[empowerment lies]{.underline}]{.mark} in liminality, in pre-emergence
and emergence, or [[at]{.mark} the point at which [new
formations]{.mark} of the political are in the process of being imagined
but **[not yet articulated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The form of affective
power is pre-actualized, networked, and of a liquid nature.(2015, 19)

The qualitative descriptions of "affect" in social media are
conceptually overshadowed by the language of emotion --- and yet
emotions are presented as simply what people "express", not a web of
intersubjectively produced sociality (see, e.g., Papacharissi, 2015, 15,
22, 53--54). As a result, [the account is able **only to suggest broad

"Securitization Forum: The Transatlantic Divide: Why Securitization Has
Not Secured a Place in American IR, Why It Should, and How It Can," Duck

http://duckofminerva.com/2015/09/securitization-forum-the-transatlantic-divide-why-securitization-has-not-secured-a-place-in-american-ir-why-it-should-and-how-it-can.html

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **[securitization]{.mark} has
[failed to gain traction]{.mark} in North America**]{.underline}. First,
and [most important, securitization describes a process but leaves us
well short of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper
account of the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}.
According to the foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School,
actors, usually elites, transform the social order from one of normal,
everyday politics into a Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a
dire threat to the political community. [They conceive of this
"securitizing move" in linguistic terms, as a speech act]{.underline}.
As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues, "By saying it \[security\], something
is done (as in betting, a promise, naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word
'security' is the act . . ." \[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a
powerful discursive process that constitutes social reality. Countless
articles and books have traced this process, and its consequences, in
particular policy domains. [Securitization presents itself as a
**[causal]{.mark}** account. But its [**mechanisms remain
obscure**,]{.mark} as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **[speech acts]{.mark}** often [seem]{.mark} to
be **[magical]{.mark} incantations** that upend normal politics through
pathways shrouded in mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why
**[some]{.mark}** securitizing moves [resonate]{.mark}, while [others
\[are **ignored**]{.mark}\]]{.underline} ~~fall on deaf ears~~.
[Certainly not all attempts to construct threats succeed]{.underline},
and this is true of both traditional military concerns as well as "new"
security issues. [Both [neocons]{.mark}ervatives [and]{.mark} structural
[realists]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have
long [insist]{.mark}ed that **[conflict]{.mark} with China [is
inevitable]{.mark}**[, yet]{.mark} China has [over the]{.mark} last **25
[years]{.mark}** been [more opportunity than threat]{.mark} in US
political [discourse]{.mark}---**[despite]{.mark}** these **[vigorous
and persistent securitizing moves]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In very
recent years, the balance has shifted, and the China threat has started
to catch on: **[linguistic processes]{.mark} alone [cannot
account]{.mark} for this change**]{.underline}. The US military has
repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound implications
for national security---but that has hardly cast aside climate change
deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks supposedly
deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers have
varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W. Bush
powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against American
values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator, struggled to
convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an imminent threat to
the United States. [After thirty years as an active research program,
securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer acceptable answers**
to these questions. **Brief [references to "facilitating conditions"
won't cut it]{.mark}**. You don't have to subscribe to a covering-law
conception of theory to find these questions important or to find
securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part of the
problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the politics of
security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded an oddly
apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation, the
Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must be
followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as Thierry
Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely rule-driven
process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the politics of
securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a conventional
procedure such as marriage or betting in which the 'felicity
circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for the act to
go through" (2005:172). [[Absent]{.mark} from this picture [are]{.mark}
fierce rhetorical battles, where [coalitions counter
securitizing]{.mark} moves with their own appeals that strike more or
less deeply at underlying narratives. Absent as well are the public
[intellectuals and media]{.mark}, who question and [critique]{.mark}
securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not others), [sometimes
to good effect (and sometimes [with little impact]{.mark})]{.underline}.
[[The **audience**]{.mark} itself---whether the mass public or a
narrower elite stratum---[is **stripped of**]{.mark} **all
[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Speaking security]{.mark}, even when
the performance is competent, **[does not sweep]{.mark} this [politics
away]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only by delving into this politics can we
shed light on the mysteries of securitization. We see rhetorical
politics as constituted less by singular "securitizing moves" than by
"contentious conversation"---to use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end,
we would urge securitization theorists, as we recently have elsewhere,
to move towards a "pragmatic" model that rests on four analytical
wagers: that actors are both strategic and social; that legitimation
works by imparting meaning to political action; that legitimation is
laced through with contestation; and that the power of language emerges
through contentious dialogue. We are heartened that our ambivalence
about securitization---the ways in which we find it by turns appealing
and dissatisfying---and our vision for how to move forward have in the
last decade been echoed by (mostly) European colleagues. These critics
have laid out a research agenda that would, if taken up, produce more
satisfying, and more deeply political, theoretical accounts. In our own
work, both individual and collective, we have tried to advance that
research agenda. So long as securitization theorists resist defining the
theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long as it remains wedded to
apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely to gain a broad following
on this side of the pond. [Second, securitization has been held back by
another way in which it is apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to
its Schmittian commitments and political vision. [Successful
securitization, in seminal accounts, replaces normal patterns of
politics with the world of the exception]{.underline}, in which contest
has no place. [They imagine security as the ultimate trump card. But, in
reality, the divide is not nearly so stark. Security **[does not crowd
out]{.mark} all [other spending priorities]{.mark}**---or states would
spend on nothing but defense and "securitized" issues. **[Nor]{.mark}**
does simply declaring something a matter of national security
**[guarantee]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

In chapter 7 I engaged with the human security framework and some of the
problematic implications of 'emancipatory' security policy frameworks.
In this chapter I argued that [the **[shift]{.mark} away**
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [pluralist [security]{.mark}
framework]{.underline} and the elevation of cosmopolitan and
emancipatory goals [has [served to **enforce**]{.mark} international
**[power inequalities]{.mark}** rather than lessen them]{.underline}.
Weak or unstable states are subjected to greater international scrutiny
and international institutions and other [[states have greater freedom
to intervene]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} the [citizens]{.mark}
of these states [have no way of]{.mark} controlling or
[influencing]{.mark} these **international
[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} or powerful states. [This [shift
away from]{.mark}]{.underline} the pluralist [[security]{.mark}
[framework]{.mark} has **[not]{.mark} [challenged]{.mark}** the
**[s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which may help to explain
why major [international institutions and [states can]{.mark} **easily
[adopt]{.mark}** a more **[cosmopolitan]{.mark} [rhetoric]{.mark}** in
their **security policies**]{.underline}. As we have seen, the shift
away from the pluralist security framework has entailed a shift towards
a more openly hierarchical international system, in which states are
differentiated according to, for example, their ability to provide human
security for their citizens or their supposed democratic commitments. In
this shift, the old pluralist international norms of (formal)
international sovereign equality, non-intervention and 'blindness' to
the content of a state are overturned. Instead, international
institutions and states have more freedom to intervene in weak or
unstable states in order to 'protect' and emancipate individuals
globally. Critical and emancipatory security theorists argue that the
goal of the emancipation of the individual means that security must be
reconceptualised away from the state. As the domestic sphere is
understood to be the sphere of insecurity and disorder, the
international sphere represents greater emancipatory possibilities, as
Tickner argues, 'if security is to start with the individual, its ties
to state sovereignty must be severed' (1995: 189). For critical and
emancipatory theorists there must be a shift towards a 'cosmopolitan'
legal framework, for example Mary Kaldor (2001: 10), Martin Shaw (2003:
104) and Andrew Linklater (2005). For critical theorists, one of the
fundamental problems with Realism is that it is unrealistic. Because it
prioritises order and the existing status quo, [Realism attempts to
impose a particular security framework onto a complex world, ignoring
the myriad threats to people emerging from their own
governments]{.underline} and societies. Moreover, traditional
international theory serves to obscure power relations and omits a study
of why the system is as it is: \[O\]mitting myriad strands of power
amounts to exaggerating the simplicity of the entire political system.
Today's conventional portrait of international politics thus too often
ends up looking like a Superman comic strip, whereas it probably should
resemble a Jackson Pollock. (Enloe, 2002 \[1996\]: 189) Yet as I have
argued, contemporary [critical security theorists seem to show a marked
lack of engagement with their problematic]{.underline} (whether the
international security context, or the Yugoslav break-up and
[wars]{.underline}). [[Without]{.mark} concrete [engagement]{.mark} and
analysis, however]{.underline}, [[the **critical project**]{.mark} is
**[undermined]{.mark}** and [critical theory becomes **nothing more**
than]{.mark} a **[request]{.mark}** that [people behave]{.mark} in a
**[nicer]{.mark}** way to each other]{.underline}. Furthermore, whilst
contemporary crit[ical security theorists argue that they present a more
realistic image of the world, through exposing power
relations]{.underline}, for example, [their **[lack of concrete]{.mark}
[analysis]{.mark}** of the problematic considered [renders]{.mark} them
actually [unable to engage with existing power structures]{.mark} and
the way in which power is being exercised in the contemporary
international system]{.underline}. For critical and emancipatory
theorists the central place of the values of the theorist mean that it
cannot fulfil its promise to critically engage with contemporary power
relations and emancipatory possibilities. Values must be joined with
engagement with the material circumstances of the time.

As provided by the Copenhagen School [**securitization theory** is
**comprised** by **speech act**]{.underline}, acceptance of the audience
and facilitating conditions or other non-securitizing actors contribute
to a successful securitization. [The [causality]{.mark} or a one-way
relationship [between]{.mark} the [speech act]{.mark}, the audience [and
securitizing actor]{.mark}, where politicians use the speech act first
to justify exceptional measures, has [been
criticized]{.mark}]{.underline} by scholars, such as Balzacq. According
to him, the one-directional relationship between the three factors, or
some of them, is not the best approach. To fully grasp the dynamics, it
will be more beneficial to "rather than looking for a one-directional
relationship between some or all of the three factors highlighted, it
could be profitable to focus on the degree of congruence between them.
26 Among other aspects of the Copenhagen School's theoretical framework,
which he criticizes, the thesis will rely on the criticism of the lack
of context and the rejection of a 'one-way causal' relationship between
the audience and the actor. [The [process of threat
con]{.mark}struction, according to him, [can be clearer]{.mark} if
external context, which stands independently from use of language, can
be considered]{.underline}. 27 Balzacq opts for more context-oriented
approach when it comes down to securitization through the speech act,
where [[a single **speech does not create**]{.mark} **the
[discourse]{.mark}**, [but it is **created** through a **long
process**]{.mark}, where **context is vital**]{.underline}. 28 He
indicates: [In reality, the **speech act itself**, i.e. literally a
**single security articulation** at a particular point in time, will
**at best** only **very rarely explain** the entire social process that
follows from it]{.underline}. In most cases a security scholar will
rather be confronted with a process of articulations creating
sequentially a threat text which turns sequentially into a
securitization. 29 This type of approach seems more plausible in an
empirical study, as [it is more likely that [a single speech will
not]{.mark} be able to [securitize an issue]{.mark}, but it is a lengthy
process]{.underline}, where a the audience speaks the same language as
the securitizing actors and can relate to their speeches.

The reality is that [[foreign policy]{.mark} has **always been
contested**]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline}, more often than not,
[linked to]{.underline} questions of [**identity** and
**ideology**]{.underline}. But [debates about war]{.underline} are [so
[interwoven with]{.mark}]{.underline} our [larger [culture-war
politics]{.mark}]{.underline} now [that]{.underline} most [[questions
of]{.mark} how to handle [military conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} have
been [**largely [reduced]{.mark}** [to partisan
scoring]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [that's a problem]{.underline} --- not
because we need to get back to some bygone bipartisan era, but because
[**real dissension** is vital in a democracy]{.underline}, [especially
in]{.underline} matters of [foreign policy]{.underline}.

The seeds of war politics' merging with culture-war politics arguably
date back to the late 1960s, when anti-Vietnam War protests overlapped
with civil rights protests and other social movements that challenged
the existing social order. Over time, conservatives and liberals
diverged in their attitudes toward the war, especially as liberal elites
began to criticize it. Starting with the 1968 presidential election,
being anti-war became more closely associated with being a liberal
Democrat. And the accusation that George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee, was all for "acid, amnesty1 and abortion" helped
solidify this cultural connection.

And this larger cultural split between the two parties came to a head
during the Iraq War. In many ways, it's connected to the political
discourse we're seeing with Russia and Ukraine now. Unlike now, though,
the discourse during the Iraq War --- in the beginning at least ---
exemplified the idea that politics stops at the water's edge. Critics of
then-President George W. Bush rallied behind him after the 9/11
terrorist attacks, and public opinion on the war was initially quite
favorable, even though Democrats were far more split than Republicans.

That national unity turned out to be short-lived, though. As political
communications scholar Mary Stuckey has observed, it was during the Iraq
War that the two parties began to make very distinct arguments about
what it meant to be an American in relation to the war.
[[Bush]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, often
[[framed]{.underline}]{.mark} the [war on terror]{.underline}, including
the U.S. invasion of [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in terms of **good**
and **evil**]{.underline}]{.mark} as he tried to establish the GOP as
the party of faith and strength. Democrats, meanwhile, in their 2004
party platform accused Bush and the [Republicans]{.underline} of
[[having]{.mark} an]{.underline} "[[**insufficient understanding**
of]{.mark} our enemy]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} a [failure to
comprehend]{.underline} the [[complexity of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[situation in [the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While the Iraq War was not directly related to Bush's religious faith,
both supporters and opponents alike depicted his [approach to
war]{.underline} as [[reflective of]{.mark} his **overall [philosophical
approach]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The president [[relied on **gut** and
**instinct**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[not expertise]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[to make decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Likewise, Bush's 2004
presidential campaign portrayed his Democratic opponent, then-Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts, as a waffling intellectual who lacked conviction
and patriotic dedication.

In other words, the debate over the Iraq War quickly became an extension
of the debates Democrats and Republicans were already having in the 2000
presidential election --- and even earlier --- about religion, culture
and Bush's intellect and qualifications.

Ultimately, the Bush administration's justification for the Iraq War
became the subject of widespread criticism across the ideological
spectrum since the rationale for invasion was shaky at best. But the
[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} Democrats and Republicans [employed
during]{.underline} the [invasion of Iraq]{.underline} and the war on
terror [were **still [powerful]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
[ways]{.mark}]{.underline} in which [[they preyed on]{.mark} domestic
and **[cultural]{.mark} disagreements** and
[anxieties]{.mark}]{.underline}.

These arguments also had important implications for debates over
presidential war powers. While many Republicans embraced an expansive
role for the president --- a strong leader asserting U.S. dominance on
the world stage --- Democrats said in their 2008 presidential platform
that they "reject\[ed\] the sweeping claims of 'inherent' presidential
power," and that their candidate, then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois,
would better grasp intercultural nuance and policy detail.

But as president, Obama struggled with questions of war and war powers
as well. Although his administration was committed to a less
interventionist approach, world events still demanded attention. There
were new questions to answer about American intervention in the Middle
East and North Africa, as civil wars broke out in Libya and Syria. And
like Bush, Obama often found himself the subject of criticism --- first
for going too far in Libya and then for not going far enough in Syria.

In other words, the [[debate]{.underline}]{.mark} around the Iraq War
[[didn't]{.mark} help]{.underline} either Democrats or Republicans
[[create]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[coherent]{.mark} set of
[ideas]{.mark}** [about how to engage with]{.mark} foreign
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, how to [[prepare for]{.mark} the
[aftermath]{.mark}]{.underline} of one, [[or when]{.mark} it
makes]{.underline} the most [sense [to]{.mark} avoid [get]{.mark}ting
[involved]{.mark}]{.underline} at all. Obama was different from Bush,
but the [foreign-policy [questions]{.mark}]{.underline} he faced were
still [[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
domestic [[culture-war disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[not]{.mark}
**especially [useful]{.mark}** in resolving them]{.underline}. Yet,
because of the Iraq War, the [[country]{.underline}]{.mark} was now
[[set on]{.mark} a [political course that
undermined]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[goal of
**meaningful**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**reasoned dissent** on foreign
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Figuring out]{.underline} the role [the U.S. should play
following]{.underline} the [Russian invasion of [Ukraine
requires]{.mark}]{.underline} answering a [**completely
[different]{.mark}** set of [questions than]{.mark}]{.underline} the
global [[war on terror or]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. response to the
war in [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark} required, but as we saw in Vietnam,
Iraq and elsewhere, [[culture-war politics are]{.underline}]{.mark} once
again **[[overshadowing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[discussion of what
to do]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Instead of debating]{.underline} the
[extent to which Americans should intervene]{.underline} in Ukraine,
[Republicans]{.underline} have [attacked Biden as]{.underline} a [weak
leader]{.underline} --- and that's the PG-rated stuff: Many attacks from
the far right have veered into even uglier culture-war territory and
praise for the Russian president.

So far, most rank-and-file Republicans have unfavorable views of the
Russian invasion, not sympathy toward Putin. (Instead, a partisan divide
is emerging over whether the U.S. should be "doing more.") Still, it's
not hard to figure out why the [[discussion of whether and how America
gets involved]{.mark} in armed conflict]{.underline} has [[devolved into
**partisan point-scoring**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nearly everything has.
[But this has a **real cost**]{.underline}, and the answer isn't for
politics to stop at the water's edge.

[Dissenting viewpoints and **serious debate**]{.underline} are [crucial
in]{.underline} a [democracy]{.underline}, and foreign policy is not an
exception. [Politics]{.underline} can and [should be a place for **real
[debate]{.mark}** [and **multiple viewpoints**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is [[**imperative** to hold public officials
accountable]{.underline}]{.mark} for their decisions. [[When we treat
foreign policy as]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[extension of]{.mark}
domestic [cultural politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, [we lose]{.underline}
almost [as much as we do when [we act as though it's **not up for debate
at all**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[There is **No Sinister**]{.underline}]{.mark} [National **[Security
Elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Many **[restraint]{.mark}** [proponents]{.mark} use a]{.underline}
second major [**[claim]{.mark}** to buttress their argument that [**US
strategy** is]{.mark}]{.underline} fundamentally [**invalid** and should
be radically scaled back]{.underline}: [US **overreach** reflects [the
**malign influence** of]{.mark} a]{.underline} devious [**national
[security elite]{.mark}** fired with dangerous visions of primacy and
liberal hegemony]{.underline}. Not all restraint advocates make this
argument, but it is a dominant theme in some of the literature's most
important works. [Stephen Walt]{.underline}'s 2018 book The Hell of Good
Intentions, for example, is an extended indictment of this
group---including current and former US officials, congressional staff,
think tank experts, and others---which [he describes as a]{.underline}
"[**dysfunctional elite** of privileged insiders]{.underline} who are
frequently disdainful of alternative perspectives." 35 [According to
Walt]{.underline}, [**promoting** an **interventionist** foreign
**policy** provides]{.underline} jobs, status, and access to [high-paid
consultancies]{.underline} and political power to this group, which
comprises an exclusive clique of insiders who attend the same schools
and clubs and believe, for the most part, the same things about US
power.

[The historian]{.underline} and writer Andrew [Bacevich]{.underline}
[denounces the same alleged cabal]{.underline}, [agreeing]{.underline}
that "[the **ideology of national security**]{.underline} ... [serves
the **interests** of those who **created** the national **security
state**]{.underline} and those who still benefit from its continued
existence"---interests that include "status, influence, and considerable
wealth." 36 [The result is an **addiction** to global
**hegemony**]{.underline} and military force, [a tendency to seek out
**unnecessary** enemies and **commitments**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} a ~~crippling~~ [conformism that quashes
dissent]{.underline}.37 [US]{.underline} national [security
elites]{.underline} at the end of the Cold War, he argues in his most
recent book, [**coalesced** around **primacy**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} "something close to [unanimity]{.underline}." 38

[It is not clear how to treat [such]{.mark}]{.underline} sprawling
[**[assertions]{.mark}** when the reality]{.underline}---[the
**[jumble]{.mark}** of **motivations**]{.underline}, views,
[[relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} [ambitions
of]{.mark} the]{.underline} tens of [thousands of
[people]{.mark}]{.underline} who comprise the national security
community---[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} obviously [[so]{.mark} **much more
[complex]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Do all US foreign policy officials or
experts support global engagement because it grants them jobs or
speaking opportunities? How many actually attended the same schools or
even know one another, and what effect does this have on their views? Do
all of them embrace primacy, and to the same degree? Apart from
collections of anecdotes, [[those]{.mark} [convinced of the]{.mark}
existence of such a **homogenous [elite]{.mark}** [offer
**no**]{.mark}]{.underline} objective
**[[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[such as surveys]{.underline},
[interviews]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} comprehensive [literature
reviews]{.underline}---to back up these sweeping claims. "By and large,"
[Bacevich insists]{.underline} in just one example, "[members of
the]{.underline} national security [elite hold the public
in]{.underline} remarkably [low regard]{.underline}," [**citing** as
proof a **single**]{.underline}, dated [**quote** from Dean
Acheson]{.underline}.39

[[The]{.mark} **[real]{.mark}**]{.underline} "[national security
**[elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}," of course, [[comprises **individuals**
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [starkly **[opposing
opinions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Some favor nuclear **[arms
control]{.mark}**]{.underline}, some oppose it; [some want
more]{.underline} US **[[forces in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, some
fewer; [some]{.underline} continue to [support humanitarian
**[interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [whereas]{.underline} [most
are]{.underline} now [skeptical]{.underline} of them. As a result,
[[profound **arguments**]{.mark} have **[erupted]{.mark}** within this
group over **every** major foreign policy **issue**]{.underline} of the
last half-century. The scholars and former government officials Hal
[Brands]{.underline}, Peter [Feaver]{.underline}, and William
[Inboden]{.underline} [explain]{.underline} that "[intense disputes
[over]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[Korea]{.mark}n War**, the
**[Vietnam]{.mark} War**]{.underline}, détente and **[arms
control]{.underline}**, [the opening to **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[and policies in **[Central America]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and the
**[Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark}**]{.underline} [were followed by battles
over [the **Gulf War**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[NATO]{.mark}**
expansion]{.underline}, [military **interventions** in
**[Haiti]{.mark}**, **[Somalia]{.mark}**, and [the
**Balkans**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the wars in
**[Afghanistan and Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[not to
mention]{.mark} heated arguments over]{.underline} positions toward
[**[China]{.mark}**, **[Iran]{.mark}**, **[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}, [**[Russia]{.mark}**, [and
**other**]{.mark} **issue[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} today." 40 **[[Few
officials]{.underline}]{.mark}** or experts [[may **rail
against**]{.mark} the broad principle of US global
**[engagement]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But on specific policy
questions---whether to go to war or conduct a humanitarian intervention,
or what policy to adopt toward China or Cuba or Russia or Iran---
[**[debates]{.mark}** in Washington [are]{.mark} deep,
**[intense]{.mark}**, and sometimes bitter.]{.underline}

To take just a single example from recent history, the
[Obama]{.underline} administration's [decision to **endorse** a
**surge** in **Afghanistan**]{.underline} [came only after extended
**deliberation** and **soul-searching**]{.underline}, and [it included a
major]{.underline}, and highly controversial, [element of
**restraint**]{.underline}---[a]{.underline} very [public **deadline**
to begin]{.underline} a graduated **[withdrawal]{.underline}**.41 [If
one were to choose the less **aggressive** or **interventionist**
side]{.underline} of this and a dozen other recent debates, in fact,
[one could **assemble** a reasonable **facsimile** of the more
**circumscribed** foreign policy]{.underline} that [proponents of
**restraint**]{.underline} themselves [suggest]{.underline}.

It is true that [[**groupthink** often **grips**]{.mark}
tighter]{.underline}, and dissent ebbs, [during **times of
[crisis]{.mark}** or]{.underline} war--- during the crucial escalation
years [[in]{.mark} **Vietnam**]{.underline}, [[for
example]{.underline}]{.mark}, [or]{.underline} in the weeks after
**[[9/11]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The national security community has
closed ranks to an unhealthy degree at such moments. [[But **these are
exceptions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and they deeply complicate the
argument for restraint]{.underline}: [if US foreign policy excesses tend
to emerge during emotionally charged crises]{.underline} or periods of
rabid threat perception, [[the **problem** is **not**]{.mark} a
[**relentless** hegemonic **impulse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is
overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark} at specific, desperate
moments---**[[something]{.underline}]{.mark}** a general commitment to
[[**restraint** is **unlikely to cure**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Blob]{.underline} [[**theorists view** the **establishment**]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} a club of **like-minded [elite]{.mark}**
[insiders]{.mark}]{.underline} who control everything, take care of one
another, [and brush off challenges to]{.underline} conventional
[wisdom]{.underline}. [**[In reality]{.mark}**, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} actually [[has a]{.mark} **healthy
[marketplace]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} foreign policy
**[ideas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Discussion** over]{.underline}
American [foreign policy **is** loud]{.underline}, contentious,
[diverse, and]{.underline} generally **[pragmatic]{.underline}**---and
as a result, [the nation gets the opportunity to learn from its
mistakes]{.underline}, build on its successes, [and **improve** its
**performance**]{.underline} over time.

In both absolute and relative terms, [[the]{.mark} **expert
[community]{.mark}**]{.underline} dealing with foreign policy and
national security in the United States [[is]{.mark}
remarkably]{.underline} large and
**[[heterogeneous]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Inside government, [cadres of
professionals make vast]{.underline} [amounts of **technocratic
knowledge** and **institutional memory** available]{.underline} to
policymakers. Every department and agency with an international role
has distinctive regional or functional expertise it can bring to bear.
[This in**-house [knowledge]{.mark}** is [complemented by]{.mark}
an]{.underline} even larger and more [**diverse** network of
**[experts]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the many hundreds of **[think
tanks]{.mark}** and contract research **institutions** that surround the
government]{.underline} and [[offer views]{.mark} ranging [from **right
to left**]{.mark}, **[hawk to dove]{.mark}**, **free trader to
protectionist**, **technocratic to ideological**]{.underline}. [Pick any
policy issue and **you can put together** a lively
**debate**]{.underline} with ease. Should the United States [[engage
with
China](https://www.brookings.edu/research/u-s-policy-toward-china/) or
contain it?]{.underline} [Negotiate with Iran or squeeze it? [Withdraw
from the Middle
East](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2020-02-10/price-primacy) or
redouble its efforts?]{.underline} Reasoned [arguments on all sides
are]{.underline} widely [available]{.underline}, in any form you
want---[all **supplied** from within the]{.underline} supposedly
monolithic **[establishment]{.underline}**.

Moreover, unlike such communities in other leading powers,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} American [foreign policy [**establishment**
is **connected to society**]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than cut off
from it, because [the top]{.underline} several [layers of]{.underline}
U.S. national [security]{.underline} bureaucracies [are staffed
by **political appointees** rather than civil servants]{.underline}.
[[The **Blob** comprises]{.underline}]{.mark} government
[[officials]{.mark}, **outside [experts]{.mark}**, [and many]{.mark}
**people** who [go **back and forth**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the
two. Insiders know how government works and what is practical.
[Outsiders think independently]{.underline}. [And in-and-outers
**[bridge the gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Other countries]{.underline}
simply [do not have]{.underline} comparably [large,
diverse]{.underline}, permeable, [expert communities that **encourage
vigorous debate**]{.underline} over national policy---which is why, say,
[the **caliber of** U.S. **debate** about nuclear policy is more
**nuanced** and better informed]{.underline} than in other nuclear
powers, and which is why [**other countries** would
**love**]{.underline} to have such [a **Blob** of their
own]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} American **foreign policy**
[establishment]{.mark}]{.underline}, finally, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
generally [**more** **[pragmatic]{.mark}** than
**ideological**]{.underline}. [It values]{.underline} prudence and
[security over novelty]{.underline} and creativity. [It knows that
thinking outside the box may be useful]{.underline} in testing policy
assumptions, [but **the box is**]{.underline} usually **[there for a
reason]{.underline}**, and [so reflexively embracing the far-out option
is dangerous]{.underline}. [Its members have made]{.underline} many
[mistakes]{.underline}, individually and collectively, [but]{.underline}
several [**features** of the system **enforce
accountability**]{.underline} over time. [Foreign [policy
**failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [**[are]{.mark}**
politically **[toxic and]{.mark}** often **[spur]{.mark}** **positive
[change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The monumental intelligence
failures that allowed the September 11 attacks to happen were followed
by policy and institutional reforms that have helped prevent other
mass-casualty terrorist attacks on U.S. targets for almost two decades.
Early [[[**misjudgments** in]{.mark} the **[Iraq]{.mark}**
war ](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2003-09-01/stumbling-war)**[led
to]{.mark}** the adoption of a **[new]{.mark}
[co]{.mark}unter[in]{.mark}surgency** strategy that restored
stability]{.underline}, at least for a while. [The]{.underline}
international economic **[imbalances]{.underline}** and financial
procedures [that **led to** the **2008** global financial crisis were
**addressed by policies**]{.underline} that contributed to a decade-long
recovery.

Taken together, [these **virtues reinforce** one another]{.underline}
and [**help** the United States **tackle** the countless]{.underline}
national and [**global challenges** that confront a
**superpower**]{.underline}. [Blob [critics claim]{.mark} there are
[no]{.mark} meaningful [arguments]{.mark} over]{.underline} U.S.
[foreign policy]{.underline}. But [[this is]{.mark} just [not
true]{.mark}]{.underline}. Intense [disputes over the **[Korea]{.mark}n
War**]{.underline}, [the **[Vietnam]{.mark} War**]{.underline},
[**détente** and **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [opening to
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and policies in [**Central America**
and]{.mark} the **[Middle East]{.mark}** were followed]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} battles over [the **Gulf War**]{.underline}, [**NATO**
expansion]{.underline}, [military **interventions** in
**Haiti**]{.underline}, **[Somalia]{.underline}**, [and the
**Balkans**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the wars in [**Afghanistan**
and **Iraq**]{.underline}---[[not to]{.mark} mention [heated arguments
over]{.mark}]{.underline} positions toward [**[China]{.mark}**,
**[Iran]{.mark}**, **[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea**,
**[Russia]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} [other]{.mark}
issue[s]{.mark}]{.underline} today. It is true that [[beneath]{.mark}
all [this]{.mark} controversy [lies]{.mark} a]{.underline} relatively
[**stable [consensus]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the value of
power]{.underline}, [alliances]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
constructive [global **[engagement]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Most [members
of the establishment believe]{.underline} that [global
**problems**]{.underline} usually [**improve** when the]{.underline}
[**U**nited **S**tates **engages** responsibly and **worsen when** the
United States **retreats**]{.underline}. Yet [that [**reflects not**
some]{.mark} nefarious **[groupthink but]{.mark}** the
**[wisdom]{.mark}** of professional crowds]{.underline}, [arrived at
**through** painful **trial and error**]{.underline} over more than a
century.

WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

If the Blob is not a cabal, neither is its record one of dismal failure.
[Critics argue]{.underline} that [the United States entered
the]{.underline} 19[90s]{.underline} [in a position of **great power**
and **prestige**]{.underline} [and squandered that legacy through
misguided wars and **interventions**, geopolitical **hubris**, and the
**aggressive pursuit** of a global liberal **order**]{.underline} [at
the **expense** of]{.underline} the nation's economic and
**[security]{.underline}** interests. But [the story they tell doesn't
match what]{.underline} actually [happened]{.underline}. American [grand
strategy did not change radically after the Cold War]{.underline},
because it was developed not just as a response to the Soviet challenge
but to the foreign policy disasters of the 1930s and 1940s. After World
War II, [**U.S. officials** decided to **maintain**]{.underline} the
nation's **[primacy]{.underline}**, [**thwart** dangerous
**aggressors**]{.underline}, and [build a **secure**]{.underline},
prosperous [international **order**]{.underline} in [which the United
States could thrive]{.underline}. After the Cold War, [they decided to
**keep this strategy** going]{.underline}, even in the absence of an
immediate peer competitor.

[From]{.underline} George H. W. [Bush to]{.underline} Barack
[Obama]{.underline}, post--Cold War [[presidents]{.mark} worked hard to
further]{.underline} the efforts their predecessors started, [**shaping
an environment** conducive to **American interests**]{.underline} and
ideas. [They]{.underline} promoted free trade and globalization,
[maintained]{.underline} and even [**[expanded]{.mark}** the
country's]{.underline} global network of [[**alliances** and]{.mark}
**military [bases]{.mark}**]{.underline}, policed the global commons,
[and tried [to **stabilize**]{.mark} regional **[conflicts]{.mark}** and
promote **h**uman **r**ights]{.underline}. [Unchecked by **great-power
rivals**]{.underline}, [[Washington]{.mark} did become more willing to
use military force]{.underline} in the periphery on behalf of national
ideals. But even then, [it **[hardly ran amok]{.mark}** [in search of
**monsters**]{.mark} to **destroy**, [**abstaining**]{.mark} from
**[interventions]{.mark}** in **[Rwanda]{.mark}**, the
**[A]{.mark}frican [G]{.mark}reat [L]{.mark}akes**, **[Sudan]{.mark}**,
the **Caucasus**, **[Ukraine]{.mark}**, **[Myanmar]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} **[other]{.mark}** potential
**case[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The basic outlines of recent American
strategy would be recognizable to officials stretching back generations,
because [its goal has remained constant]{.underline}: [**fostering** a
**world** guided by **American leadership**]{.underline}, rooted in
American values, and [protected by American power]{.underline}.

**[[Have there been]{.underline}]{.mark}** disappointments and even
[**[disasters]{.mark}** along the way?
**[Absolutely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Globalization]{.underline} and
democratization [were supposed to [mellow China and
Russia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-02-10/new-spheres-influence)]{.underline} and
help them fit easily into the U.S.-led order. [That hasn't worked out as
well]{.underline} as hoped. [**No**rth **Ko**rea **went nuclear**
despite a series of]{.underline} U.S. [presidents swearing they would
never let it happen]{.underline}. [Before **9/11**, Washington didn't
take **terrorism** seriously]{.underline} enough;
[afterward]{.underline}, [it became obsessed with stopping
it]{.underline} at all costs. [And]{.underline} far too many **[military
interventions]{.underline}**---from [**Somalia** to **Afghanistan**,
**[Iraq]{.mark}** to **Libya**]{.underline}---[have been]{.underline}
misconceived and **[[mishandled]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[As serious as these]{.underline} failures [were]{.underline}, however,
[they were no worse than those]{.underline} occurring [during other
periods]{.underline} in U.S. history. [The]{.underline} quarter [century
after **World War II** saw the loss of **China**]{.underline}, the [end
of a nuclear monopoly]{.underline}, the [erection of the **Iron
Curtain**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the **[Berlin
Wall]{.underline}**, a [bloody **stalemate** in **Korea**]{.underline},
a [**communist takeover** in Cuba]{.underline}, [and a **catastrophic
war** in Vietnam]{.underline}. The following two decades witnessed the
[collapse of]{.underline} the **[Bretton Woods]{.underline}** system,
[an energy crisis and **OPEC**]{.underline} oil [embargo]{.underline},
[anti-American revolutions in **Iran and Nicaragua**]{.underline}, a
bungled [intervention in **Lebanon**]{.underline}, [**dirty** **wars**
in **Central America**]{.underline}, the [Iran-contra]{.underline}
scandal, [and]{.underline} the **[Tiananmen Square]{.underline}**
massacre. [Some degree of **failure**]{.underline}, even tragedy, [is
**inescapable**]{.underline} in foreign policy. [**[What
matters]{.mark}** most [**is** not]{.mark}]{.underline} the presence of
[[individual]{.mark} triumphs or [disasters but **the collective
balance**]{.mark}]{.underline} between them. From this perspective, the
[post--Cold War era looks]{.underline} significantly
[better]{.underline}, for [[**set against** the **failures**]{.mark} [is
a]{.mark} **giant success**]{.underline}---[the emergence of a far [more
**peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline}, prosperous, and [**liberal**
international **[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with a prosperous and

[Critics count the problems]{.underline} that have occurred [but
**ignore** the **problems** that have been **avoided**]{.underline}.
[There were **plenty of ways** the world could have gone
**haywire**]{.underline} after 1989. Leading scholars, for example,
foresaw a descent into [vicious instability]{.underline}. [**Germany and
Japan** would **turn hungry** and **revisionist**]{.underline} again,
[**security vacuums** would **emerge**]{.underline} in [**Central
Europe** and **East Asia**]{.underline}, and [**nationalism**,
**aggression**, and nuclear **proliferation** would run
**rampant**]{.underline}. "We will soon miss the Cold War," John
[[Mearsheimer [predicted](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/politics/foreign/mearsh.htm)]{.underline}]{.mark} in
1990. "The prospect of **[major [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even
wars . . . [is likely to **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}
dramatically."

[[Not quite]{.mark}. [The **long**]{.mark} **[peace]{.mark}
[continued]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [**great-power** relations
remained]{.underline} relatively **[calm]{.underline}**. German and
Japanese [[**revisionism** **never
materialized**]{.underline}]{.mark}---because those [countries
remained]{.underline} tightly [embraced within a]{.underline} strong
U.S. [**alliance system** and a broader]{.underline} [**l**iberal
**i**nternational **o**rder]{.underline}. [An outbreak of
**nationalism**]{.underline} and ethnic aggression [was **contained** in
the Balkans]{.underline}. The countries of the former Warsaw Pact did
not descend into chaos but embarked on political and economic reform,
[relaxing into]{.underline} a newly [secure]{.underline} environment
inside **[NATO]{.underline}**. [Asia did not collapse into]{.underline}
vicious [rivalries]{.underline}; under U.S. guidance, it continued its
remarkable post-1979 stretch of peace as billions of people benefited
from decades of sustained economic growth. The number of
**[democracies]{.underline}** in the world [**rose**
dramatically]{.underline}. [Even **[nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration** has
[remained]{.mark}]{.underline}
relatively [[[limited]{.underline}]{.mark}](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/non-proliferation-limitation-and-reduction),
as [Washington continued to provide **security guarantees**]{.underline}
to allies [so they would **not pursue**]{.underline} independent
[nuclear **arsenals**]{.underline}, orchestrated a campaign to secure
loose nuclear materials, and [[punished **rogue states**]{.mark} that
tried to buck the **nonproliferation** regime]{.underline}. In short,
after 1989, [the deep global **[engagement]{.mark} favored by the Blob**
[kept the world]{.mark} moving [forward]{.mark}]{.underline} on a
generally positive track, [[rather than]{.mark} regressing to the
historical mean of **[tyranny]{.mark}, depression, [and
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Yes]{.mark}, **[instability is returning]{.mark}** in]{.underline}
both [**[Asia]{.mark}** and **[Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[globalization and **democracy** are]{.underline} currently [in
**retreat**]{.underline}, [[[intense
**competitions**](https://www.brookings.edu/research/china-and-the-return-of-great-power-strategic-competition/) with
**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} loom]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
the new **[[corona]{.mark}virus]{.underline}** pandemic [has
[reminded]{.mark} the world of the [**downsides** of
**connectivity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [the return of
**great**-**power** **rivalry**]{.underline} in recent years [has been
fueled **less by** U.S. **overreach** than by **questions about** its
**stamina**]{.underline}. [Had Washington followed the]{.underline}
recommendations of the **[Blob's critics and retrenched]{.underline}**
from its global commitments after 1989, rather than leaning into them,
[things would **look even worse**]{.underline} now. [[If]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} had [[pursued]{.mark} a
strategy of **[o]{.mark}ff[s]{.mark}hore
[b]{.mark}alancing**]{.underline}, say, by [winding down its **overseas
obligations**]{.underline}, would it be sitting pretty now? It is hard
to see how [withdrawing from Europe]{.underline} in the 1990s [or not
expanding NATO would have encouraged]{.underline} less bullying from
Moscow. More likely, it would simply have given [a **resurgent
Russia**]{.underline} greater freedom [to **reassert** its
**influence**]{.underline}. Pulling back from the
[Asia-Pacific]{.underline} region, similarly, [[would]{.mark} **likely**
[have **undermined**]{.mark} the United States' [**ability** to
**hedge** against]{.mark}]{.underline} the negative consequences of
[**China's** **[rise]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And **[[less
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** by Washington [on a global liberal
agenda in **trade**, politics, and **human rights** [would **not**
]{.mark}**have [improve]{.mark}d the [world]{.mark}** or prepared
it]{.underline} institutionally [[to handle]{.mark} global challenges,
such as [**pandemics** and **climate**]{.mark} **change**]{.underline}.

In retrospect, it is easy to identify specific policies and decisions
one would want to change. [[It is **hard**]{.mark}**er [to identify an
alternative]{.mark}** strategy that would]{.underline} have [delivered
clearly superior results]{.underline}---and [that is the true standard
by which real-world foreign policies deserve to be judged]{.underline}.

THE RETURN OF THE BLOB

[[How about]{.underline}]{.mark} the critics' third
[**[argument]{.mark}**, [that]{.mark} [**escaping** the]{.mark}
**influence of the [Blob]{.mark}** [would **make**]{.mark} American
**[policy]{.mark}** more **[effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
country more secure? As it happens, [[a **real-time test**]{.mark} of
that proposition **[has been running]{.mark}**]{.underline} for over
three years. [The **[Trump]{.mark}** administration has
**[sidelined]{.mark}** national security
**[professionals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and professionalism, [to a
degree unprecedented]{.underline} in the modern era. The
[president]{.underline} has routinely [**disregarded** the advice of
apolitical **career officials**]{.underline}, [accused them of
disloyalty]{.underline} and
even [treason](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/appalling-attack-alexander-vindman/601000/),
and **[[purged]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[top ranks]{.mark} of the
**administration**]{.underline} of anybody unwilling to toe the official
line of the day (whatever that may be). [The **results**]{.underline} of
this experiment **[are not encouraging]{.underline}**. So far [it has
produced **poor policy**, poor **execution**, and poor
**outcomes**]{.underline}.

Unforced [errors are]{.underline} one of [the **hallmarks** of the
Trump]{.underline} administration's [**foreign policy**.]{.underline}

The [administration launched an]{.underline} overdue [effort to confront
**China**]{.underline} on its trade practices, [only to **hobble the
approach** by [withdrawing]{.mark} from
the **[T]{.mark}**rans-**[P]{.mark}**acific
**[P]{.mark}**artnership]{.underline} and [starting]{.underline}
simultaneous [**[trade wars]{.mark}** with]{.underline} American
[allies]{.underline}. It [punished Russia]{.underline} for its
territorial aggression and electoral sabotage, [only to be **undercut**
**by** the president's embrace of]{.underline} Russian
President [Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} ](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2019-08-12/putin-great)and
by his personal vendettas relating to Ukraine. [The
president]{.underline} twice [announced]{.underline}, and twice
partially reversed, [a decision to **[withdraw]{.mark}** troops [from
**Syria**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [**[battering]{.mark}** U.S.
**[cred]{.mark}ibility**]{.underline} without actually leaving the
conflict. Thanks to diplomatic bungling and presidential credulity,
[**No**rth **Ko**rea is **no more contained**]{.underline} than it was
three years ago, [and **Japan**, **So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline}, and
the United States [are all **at odds**]{.underline}. [Because of
arbitrary]{.underline} White House [interference with **military
justice**]{.underline} and other issues, [**c**ivil-**m**ilitary
**r**elations]{.underline} [have **cratered**]{.underline}. What links
these cases is not ideology but competence---all involved basic mistakes
that were pointed out by experts inside and outside government, only to
be contemptuously ignored by the White House.  

Even when the administration's policy choices have been defensible in
conception, they have often been botched in execution, due to a
disregard for expert advice and a disdain for the details of
implementation. The administration could have tried to [remedy the
defects](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-11-15/better-iran-deal-within-reach) of
the Iran nuclear deal, for example, in a way that included European
powers rather than alienating them. It could have increased pressure on
Tehran with a plan for converting that pressure into lasting results. It
could have gotten something in return for diplomatic concessions given
to Israel and Saudi Arabia. And it could have reformed NAFTA without
gratuitously harming relations with Canada and Mexico.

As for results, [[the]{.mark} current [**pandemic**
shows]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[what happens when]{.mark} national
[policy is **driven by amateur**]{.mark} **improvisation** rather than
professional planning]{.underline}. Pandemics have been a known danger
for decades, and [[the **Blob** **has**]{.mark} **a** [suggested
**playbook** for]{.mark} handling them]{.underline}---constant
vigilance, [early [**detection** and
**monitoring**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a [unified national
response]{.underline} in coordination [with **global
partners**]{.underline}, and much more. Coming into office, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [was fully briefed]{.underline} on
the challenge---[and chose to look the other way]{.underline},
downgrading the relevant technocrats and pushing for deep cuts in global
health and disease programs. At the crucial early stages of the crisis,
[when a[ **robust** multilateral
**effort**](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-18/pandemic-and-toll-transatlantic-discord) might
have had maximum effect]{.underline}, [the administration]{.underline}'s
disorganization and denial [left Washington on the
sidelines]{.underline}. As the disease raced around the world and took
hold in the United States, officials desperate to sound the alarm and
begin [**preventive measures** were **silenced**]{.underline} by a
president unwilling to hear bad news. And once the direness of the
medical situation was finally recognized, the administration tried to
shift blame, going so far as to cut funding for the World Health
Organization in the midst of the pandemic, simply in order to create a
politically useful scapegoat.

[[The **establishment** makes **mistakes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, often
big ones. [**[But]{.mark}** in its collective capacity, [**it
learns**]{.mark} from them [and changes
course]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[which is why **the**]{.mark} liberal
international [**order** **has**]{.mark} **not only [lasted]{.mark} for
generations** [but]{.mark} **deepened** and [broadened]{.mark} **[over

//GrRv)

In his article "Why America's Grand Strategy Has Not Changed: Power,
Habit, and the U.S. Foreign Policy Establishment," Patrick [[Porter
argues]{.mark} that the continuity of [U.S.]{.mark} grand
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} since World War II [has [resulted from a
**group-think mentality**]{.mark}]{.underline} fostered by a powerful
foreign policy elite---"the Blob"---[[that **stifles debate**]{.mark}
and prevents]{.underline} needed **[course corrections]{.underline}**.1
[[Porter]{.mark}'s]{.underline} provocative [argument
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [**[unpersuasive]{.mark}**, because
[it **overstates** the degree of **conformity**]{.mark} **and
consensus** [in U.S. strategy]{.mark} while slighting the **most obvious
explanations** for the strategy's **endurance**]{.underline}. Below we
highlight several problems with his argument.

First, [[Porter **exaggerates**]{.mark} the degree of [consensus]{.mark}
in U.S. foreign policy]{.underline} since World War II. In fact, despite
a bipartisan consensus on the necessity of U.S. global leadership in
support of a congenial international order (what Porter calls
"primacy"), intense debates about how that strategy should be
operationalized have been common in U.S. foreign policy circles.
[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, elected officials, and policy
commentators [[**argued heatedly** over]{.mark} such fundamental issues
as whether to pursue a **Europe-first** or **Asia-first
strategy**]{.underline} in the 1950s, whether and how aggressively to
combat Soviet and communist influence in the developing world, whether
to make or avoid defense commitments on the Asian mainland, whether to
pursue détente or confrontation with the Soviet Union in the 1970s,
whether to use force to reverse Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in
1990--91, [whether to **expand** the **[N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic
[T]{.mark}reaty [O]{.mark}rganization**]{.underline} after the Cold War,
[[and whether to]{.underline} **[invade Iraq]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
2003. [[These]{.mark} debates [reflected **genuine intellectual
disagreements**]{.mark}]{.underline} that pitted members of the Blob
against one another. Porter would likely respond that such debates were
essentially about tactics, but [the fact that [the]{.mark} foreign
policy [community]{.mark} has engaged in knock-down, drag-out debates
over issues of such enormous strategic importance shows that it [is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} as **[[unified]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
the marketplace of ideas not as limited, as Porter claims.

Second, [[although Porter argues]{.underline}]{.mark} that
**[[dissenting]{.mark} foreign policy]{.underline}**
**[[views]{.underline}]{.mark}** advocating an approach he calls
"restraint" [[tend to be **marginalized**, departures]{.mark} from a
**strategy of U.S. leadership** [have **time and again** received a
hearing]{.mark}]{.underline} at the highest levels of government. In the
1950s and 1960s, Presidents Dwight [[**Eisenhower**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} John **[[Kennedy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
repeatedly [[considered **withdrawing**]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
[**troops** [from Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 Similar debates occurred
in Congress in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When Jimmy
**[[Carter]{.underline}]{.mark}** took office, he [**strongly
[favored]{.mark}** [withdrawing]{.mark} U.S. troops [from
**So**]{.mark}**uth [Ko]{.mark}rea**]{.underline}.3 In the early 1990s,
the George H.W. [[**Bush** and]{.underline}]{.mark} Bill
**[[Clinton]{.underline}]{.mark}** administrations initially
[[delegated]{.underline}]{.mark} management of the crisis in the former
[**[Yugoslavia]{.mark}** to]{.underline} the [Europe]{.underline}an NATO
allies. In 2011, Barack [[**Obama** **withdrew**]{.mark} **U.S. troops
[from Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline} as part of a broader move toward an
offshore balancing strategy in the Middle East.4 In other words,
presidents and other [**[political leaders]{.mark}** in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[have]{.mark} often been
willing to [consider **significant changes** in]{.mark} U.S. [strategy,
and]{.mark} they have sometimes even [implemented policies that]{.mark}
represented a **meaningful [shift toward
retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline} and restraint.

Third, [the reason that many of [these]{.mark} departures [were
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately
**[[undertaken]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or proved fleeting---[is **not**
because policymakers denied them a **fair, open hearing**]{.underline}.
[It is [because they were]{.mark}]{.underline} judged---or later
shown---to be [**substantively [inferior]{.mark}** [to more assertive
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Eisenhower **never
withdrew**]{.underline} U.S. troops [from **Europe**]{.underline},
[because he understood that doing so would have threatened to
**destabilize**]{.underline} the interlocking series of arrangements
that deterred the Soviet Union while pacifying Germany and **[Western
Europe]{.underline}**.5 [Carter never withdrew]{.underline} U.S. troops
[from South Korea, for fear that **doing so** would have risked
incentivizing **South Korean nuclear proliferation**]{.underline} and
destabilizing the fragile balance in a critical part of the world.6 The
United States ultimately took the lead in addressing the crackup of
Yugoslavia when the inability of the Europeans to deal with the crisis
had become clear. [Obama did draw down U.S. forces in Iraq, but large
swaths of that country]{.underline} (and Syria) [were subsequently
**overrun** by]{.underline} the \[**[ISIL]{.underline}**\] Islamic
State, compelling a reassertion of U.S. military and diplomatic
engagement.7 In these and other cases, an emphasis on [[**U.S.
leadership has persisted**, because that approach has been]{.mark}
deemed---after **significant debate**]{.underline} or hard
experience---[**[superior]{.mark}** to the alternatives.]{.underline}

Fourth, and related, [Porter slights [the **simplest explanation**
for]{.mark} why there has been substantial [consistency in]{.mark} U.S.
[strategy: **because it works.**]{.mark}]{.underline} As scholars have
demonstrated, [[the past **seventy years** have been **among the best**
in]{.mark} human history in terms of **rising**]{.underline} global and
U.S. [**[prosperity]{.mark}**, the spread of]{.underline} democracy and
human **[rights]{.underline}**, [the [**avoidance** of **great power
war**,]{.mark} and the **decline of war in general**.]{.underline}8 It
has also been a period when the world's leading power consistently
pursued a grand strategy geared explicitly toward achieving those
goals[. [To prove]{.mark} that [U.S.]{.mark} grand [strategy persists
for reasons **other than utility**, Porter would have to show]{.mark}
that [U.S. leadership has **not been necessary**]{.mark} **to those
outcomes**]{.underline} or that it is no longer necessary. **[But [he
does not do so]{.mark}]{.underline}** ([[or even really **try** to do
so]{.underline}]{.mark}), [and [his article **does not engage**
the]{.mark} relevant social science **[scholarship]{.mark}** and
historical literature [establishing a **causal connection** between
**U.S. engagements** and]{.mark} **key aspects** of [the]{.mark}
relatively benign [global order]{.mark}]{.underline}.9

Finally, **[[critics of primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** consistently
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Porter does, [that [their ideas
are]{.mark}]{.underline} censored or [[**excluded** from **policy
debates**. Yet, **critics**]{.mark} of U.S. grand strategy [are
**prominent**]{.mark} **within the academy**]{.underline}, including at
prestigious institutions such as the University of Chicago, Harvard, and
the Massachusetts Institute of [Technology. Their **op-eds** and
**essays** appear in the New York Times]{.underline}, Foreign Policy,
and Foreign Affairs, [among other]{.underline} prominent
"[mainstream]{.underline}" [outlets, and **their work** receives
**generous funding**]{.underline}. Leading [**critics of primacy** are
regular participants in]{.underline} U.S. **[government--sponsored
outreach initiatives]{.underline}** such as the National Intelligence
Council's Intelligence Associates program. Not least, although Porter
and many other realists in the academy deplore key aspects of the
current president's foreign policy, that president's own core critique
of the foreign policy elite echoes those made by academic realists.10 If
this is censorship, it is a remarkably ineffective form of censorship.
Perhaps [[the reason primacy endures is **not that the marketplace of
ideas is broken**, but that it is **working**]{.mark} **fairly
well.**]{.underline}

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the White House, [[university
halls]{.underline}]{.mark}, and op-eds pages, [[experts]{.mark} are
**[under siege]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President Trump calls them
"terrible," and so it is little surprise that most of the individuals
driving his China policy are not China specialists, do not speak
Mandarin, and have little in-country experience.

The most recent critique of area specialists came in the form of an
op-ed by my colleague Hal Brands. The piece argues that "[[great power
gurus]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- [those **primarily
[well-versed]{.mark}** [in **i**]{.mark}nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations theory]{.underline} --- [have]{.underline} a
[better track record at predicting Chinese behavior than China
hands]{.underline}. Brands is not alone; many generalists believe their
[positions]{.underline} are somehow less biased and [[reflect **better
analysis** and]{.mark} **strategic [thinking]{.mark}** [because they are
not]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the words of Aaron Friedberg, "[[a]{.mark}
card-carrying [member of the **China**]{.mark}**-watching
[frat]{.mark}ernity**]{.underline}."

Is Hal Brands correct? The evidence he offers does not make an
open-and-shut case. Robert Kagan predicted in 1997 that China would
challenge the United States in the region and perhaps globally, but it
didn't happen for at least a decade and a half. Beijing's strategy of
reassuring smaller countries and prioritizing positive relations with
great powers created a relatively stable and peaceful environment in
Asia until, arguably, 2012. Also, whether generalists admit it or not,
they have relied on the hard work of China hands in their own research.
In making his argument that China will "struggle for mastery in Asia,"
Friedberg relies on specialists' assessments of Chinese history and
strategic culture, as well as numerous Chinese sources translated for
him by Chinese speakers. Lastly, you have to evaluate predictions as a
whole. In 2014, John Mearsheimer predicted great power rivalry with
proxy wars between American allies and Chinese allies and attempts by
Beijing to forge ties with Canada and Mexico to weaken U.S. dominance in
the Western Hemisphere. Neither have happened.

To state the obvious, there are people on both sides who got it wrong.
All experts should be humble about their assessments and open to the
ways that Chinese interests, behavior, and strategy may change. Also,
the knowledge of history, strategy and theory continues to be useful
tools in research, analysis and advocacy. For this reason, many
foreign-policy China hands of this generation invest in building equally
strong theoretical backgrounds as they do in country knowledge. But for
whatever reason, we are seeing a trend of discounting area expertise.
Because of this, many of us couch our research agendas in language that
appeals to generalists and downplay our strong China backgrounds for the
sake of publishing in political science journals or scoring tenure.

[[Creating]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**political [culture]{.mark}** [that
values]{.mark} **China [experts]{.mark}** is about [more than]{.mark}
**just [ego]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Brands also argues, the
[**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates needs]{.underline} a [good
[strategy]{.mark} if is to prevail]{.underline}. Developing such a
strategy is [[only possible by including]{.mark} **China
ex[perts]{.mark}** [who]{.mark}se bread and butter is
[decipher]{.mark}ing]{.underline} what motivates [[Chinese behavior as
well as how to **shape** and **constrain** it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
some [[generalists **admit** they are less proficient
at]{.underline}]{.mark} the "[[how]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[why]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[than those
with]{.mark} **area [expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is one thing
to predict that Chinese military power will grow, it is quite another to
predict the anti-access area denial strategy that China initially
adopted; or to predict that China would rely primarily on coercive
diplomacy, information operations and lawfare to promote its claims in
the South China Sea. China specialists can tell us why China still only
has one overseas base, and why it is in Djibouti; why China has chosen
to expand its power globally initially through One Belt, One Road and
not a global military presence like the United States; or why China was
unlikely to liberalize as it became richer.

The second [[shortcut]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps more popular than
the first, [[is]{.mark} to stand up]{.underline} always against
"imperialism"---or, a shortcut inside the shortcut, [**[always]{.mark}
to oppose** American policies abroad]{.underline}.
[**[Anti-Americanism]{.mark}** is a common left politics]{.underline},
which, again, sometimes gets things right and sometimes doesn't. I
believe that it got things right in Vietnam in 1967; it mostly got
things right from the beginning to the end of the twentieth century in
Central and South America; it got Iran right in 1953, when leftists
criticized the anti-Mossadegh coup, and it got Iraq right in 2003. But
that's not enough to make the shortcut a reliable one. The [[defeat of
**Nazism** and **Stalinism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the two [**[most
brutal]{.mark} political [regimes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} world [history,
was]{.mark}]{.underline} in significant ways [[American
work]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many peopl[e on the left supported
that]{.underline} work, [as we should]{.underline} have.

In 1967, Dwight Macdonald wrote to Mary McCarthy that the American war
in Vietnam proved "that despite all the good things about our internal
political-social-cultural life, we have become an imperialist power, and
one that, partly because of these domestic virtues, is a most inept
one."37 We are still inept: in December 2005, with 100,000 American
soldiers in Iraq, we organized an election there --- and our man came in
third. This result may be without precedent in imperial history. (It
might suggest that we were less interested in imperial control than in
promoting democracy, though the Iraqi politician who came in first
wasn't much of a democrat.) Macdonald's understanding of US imperialism
reflects a political intelligence and a moral balance that are mostly
missing in contemporary anti-American writing.

Another often used shortcut is to oppose everything Israel does and to
blame it for much that it hasn't done, since it is the "lackey" of
American imperialism or, alternatively, the dominant force shaping
American foreign policy. The policies of recent Israeli governments
require strong criticism --- the occupation, the settlements, the
refusal to suppress Jewish thugs and terrorists on the West Bank. But
much of the left attack on Israel has little to do with its policies and
more to do with its existence, which is taken to be the root cause of
all evils in the Middle East. This view violates all the requirements of
realism --- by which I mean simply a readiness to see the world as it
really is.

The last [[shortcut]{.underline}]{.mark} is [to [support every
government that calls itself **leftist or**]{.mark}
**anti-imperialist**]{.underline} and [sets itself **[against
America]{.mark}**]{.underline}n interests. This is different from the
old Stalinist shortcut: support the Soviet Union, whatever it does,
because it is the first proletarian dictatorship and the first workers'
paradise. [[That]{.mark} kind of [politics is]{.mark}]{.underline}, I
think, definitively finished, though it had a brief afterlife focused on
China and then, with very few believers, on Albania and
[**[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}. The more recent
version celebrates Maximal Leaders like Gamal Nasser, Fidel Castro, or
Hugo Chávez; there are also short-lived infatuations, such as Michel
Foucault's affair with the future Ayatollah Khomeini. [[Leftist
enthusiasm for **populist dictatorships**]{.mark} is one of our **sad
stories**]{.underline}, which ends when resources run out, the failure
to build the economy suddenly becomes undeniable, and the military takes
over. [[But]{.mark} often the]{.underline} Maximal [[Leader is a
military]{.underline}]{.mark} ~~man himself~~ \[[[person
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}\], [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[repressive role]{.underline}]{.mark} of the army simply
[[becomes]{.mark} **more [obvious]{.mark}** [over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Latin America today, the better left is
represented by socialists and social-democrats in countries like Chile,
Brazil, and Costa Rica who reject demagogic populism and struggle to
produce economic growth, greater equality, and a stronger welfare state
--- and who attract less enthusiasm from American leftists than they
deserve.38

There is a lot to be said for [the **default position**. [We
should]{.mark} work]{.underline} in the place we know best [to [make
things better]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[improvement of
**humanity**]{.mark} begins]{.underline} at home. This argument has
special force for Americans, who live [[in a]{.mark}n]{.underline}
increasingly unequal society that is also a near-[[hegemonic world
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need to be wary of adventures abroad that
make our work at home more difficult.

Still, good leftists can't avoid internationalism. We will be engaged
again and again in arguments about what we should do or what we should
urge the United States to do to help people in trouble or comrades
abroad. Sometimes there is nothing that the United States can do, at
least nothing it is likely to do right. But even when we oppose American
action in other countries, we can be active ourselves --- providing
moral, political, and financial support to \[people\] ~~men and women~~
fighting in self-defense or in defense of others. There is no magic
answer to the question, What should we do? But the [[ideological
shortcuts]{.underline}]{.mark} I've just described, [**[lazily]{.mark}
adopted** and rigidly [held]{.mark}]{.underline}, have [served us badly
in the past and are]{.underline} almost [certain to [serve us
badly]{.mark} in the future. [Sticking with them
means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[get]{.mark} [things right **only by accident**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Political intelligence and moral sensitivity work much better than
ideology, and they are what should guide our choice of comrades and our
decisions about when and how to act abroad.
**[[Dictators]{.underline}]{.mark}** and terrorists [[are **never our
comrades**]{.mark}. We should embrace]{.underline} only those ~~men and
women~~ \[people\] who really believe in and practice [democracy and
equality. We should act abroad]{.underline} only [with those who **share
our commitments**]{.underline} and then, only in ways consistent with
those commitments. This is the politics that I want to call left
internationalism.

[[Beijing's criticism of the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, however, differs from that seen around
the globe. China's critique [[does not stem from]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**genuine [concern]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} universal
[**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights and]{.underline} the [well-being
of African Americans]{.underline}. The [[Chinese
people]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} been
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[opportunity to
protest]{.underline}]{.mark} in solidarity with Americans --- or
[[against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[abuses of black residents in
China]{.mark} itself. **Anti-black [racism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
remains [[rampant]{.mark} on the Chinese internet]{.underline},
untouched by [[censors]{.underline}]{.mark} who seek to [[**crush
opinions** the government dislikes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its
[[motivation is]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[to tell the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, and everybody else,
[[to stop criticizing China over its own]{.mark} **human rights
[abuses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Underneath Beijing's commentary on the
U.S. unrest is a deeply cynical voice that asks: If the U.S. authorities
can do it, why shouldn't we?

Last Friday afternoon, Trump held a press conference to denounce China's
plan to devise a national security law to crack down on Hong Kong's
dissents. He threatened to end U.S. recognition of Hong Kong's special
trading status and to sanction Chinese officials hurting Hong Kong's
freedom. It is going to bring real damage to [**[Chinese]{.mark}
companies** and **wealthy [elites]{.mark}**]{.underline} who have been
[[using Hong Kong as a back door]{.mark} to]{.underline} gain access to
foreign capital, sensitive technology, and channels to [relocate their
wealth oversea]{.underline}s.

That night, after Trump's speech, major cities across the United States
were engulfed in flames, National Guards were mobilized, and protesters
clashed with riot police near the White House. The president reportedly
hid briefly in a bunker. The [Chinese authorities]{.underline} have been
heavily criticized for their [[crackdown on]{.mark} **Hong Kong
[protests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for the Uighur [[concentration camps,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} for the [[arrests of]{.mark} rights [lawyers.
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} must be [[delighted to
see]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U.S.]{.mark} **global
[reputation]{.mark}** [tarnished]{.mark}]{.underline} as its problems of
racism and police brutality are brought into the spotlight. It would be
surprising if [Beijing]{.underline} did not [[seize]{.mark} the [moment
to **criticize** the]{.mark}]{.underline} double standards of the
[[White House]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [cynicism [underlines]{.mark}
Beijing's]{.underline} response to criticism of its [[bullying
behavior]{.mark} in the international arena]{.underline}. When an
international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines
against Chinese claims of sovereignty over the South China Sea in 2016,
Beijing made it clear it would not abide by the ruling. It pointed out
that the United States violated international law all the time and,
hypocritically, hadn't even acceded to the relevant U.N. convention
itself.

Such [rhetoric]{.underline} has [grown common over]{.underline} the
[last few decades]{.underline}, as the [**[C]{.mark}**hinese
**[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty]{.underline} gradually
abandoned its appeal for a more just social system and world order.
Instead, the party has become [**increasingly [explicit]{.mark}** [in
referring to]{.mark}]{.underline} the global [[domination by Western
powers as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**license** for its own imperial
ambition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Jiang Shigong, an influential official
scholar who advises the Chinese government on Hong Kong policy and
global governance, even wrote recently that China should "absorb the
skills and achievements" of the British and American empires to
construct its own "world empire" for the sake of the Chinese people and
the world.

For those in the United States and elsewhere who aspire for more
equality, justice, and liberty, [it is a [mistake to see Beijing
as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**exotic [progressive]{.mark}** force with
which to ally]{.underline}. [[Beijing points to the]{.mark}
violence]{.underline} and injustice [of the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [to exonerate]{.mark} itself from [its own]{.mark}
**egregious [violence]{.mark}** [and injustices]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Police brutality and racism in the United States are unimaginably
horrific. But [[U.S.]{.mark} authorities]{.underline} today are [[not
using]{.mark} these [protests as]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[excuse
to]{.underline}]{.mark} arrest dissenting legislators and professors, to
wholly outlaw peaceful assembly and rights organizations, to pressure
companies and universities to fire employees sympathetic with the
protesters, to arrest people for criticizing the government on social
media, or to [[lock up]{.underline}]{.mark} 1 million
[[minorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in reeducation camps. [[These]{.mark}

//CYang

But [[African leaders should have]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[more
fundamental [concern]{.mark}]{.underline}** than these --- at least,
those who are committed to advancing peace and democracy.
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} is [attempting to undermine the global
order that]{.underline} has [guided international relations for
the]{.underline} better part of the [last century]{.underline}.
[Building on]{.underline} Russia's previous annexation of [Crimea
and]{.underline} parts of northern [Georgia]{.underline} as well as its
prior occupation of [Ukraine's]{.underline} Donbas region, [Putin is
[taking a **sledgehammer** to the]{.mark} foundation of the]{.underline}
once stable [**post-[World]{.mark} War II** [order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This attempt to normalize expansionist ambitions [will [have **profound
consequences** for Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}. Would-be [[tsars]{.mark}
[across the continent]{.mark}]{.underline} --- who, like Putin, have
[[evade]{.mark}d [term limits]{.mark} to stay in power
indefinitely]{.underline} while [[eliminat]{.mark}ing]{.underline} their
[[political opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} --- are watching closely,
asking if Putin can [get away with]{.underline} this [**brazen
[overreach]{.mark}** and flout the rules-based order]{.underline}, then
why can't they. It is a reasonable question to ask. [At stake
are]{.underline} established notions of
[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}, territorial integrity,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[independence of member
states]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which **suddenly
[become]{.mark}**]{.underline} more temporal, arbitrary, and [[open to
**violent contestation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Perhaps the most eloquent defense of the existing order, premised on
these foundational principles, came from Kenya's permanent
representative to the United Nations: ambassador Martin Kimani, who
warned Putin and the Russian military to respect its border with
Ukraine, using [[Africa's]{.underline}]{.mark} own [colonial
[past]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[highlight]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[dangers of]{.mark} stoking the]{.underline} "**[embers of [dead
empires]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

So what does a Russian-shaped international order look like for Africa?

A [primary feature is]{.underline} the [challenge to the
**inviolability** of established boundaries]{.underline}. There are
currently some 100 contested borders on the continent, most of them
stemming from arbitrarily drawn colonial boundaries. These have, for the
most part, been managed peacefully by successive [African
governments]{.underline}, [rooted in]{.underline} a [respect
for]{.underline} the principles of [[sovereignty]{.mark} and territorial
[integrity]{.mark}]{.underline} that were enshrined in the Charter of
the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and later reaffirmed in the
Constitutive Act of the African Union in 2001. Established during the
postcolonial independence period, many African states were born out of a
commitment to [[self-determination]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ironically,
[this is [the **central issue**]{.mark} being [contested]{.mark} today
[by **Russia**]{.mark}**'s invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline}.

If the lesson from Putin's invasion of Ukraine is that might makes
right, then [Africa's political geography could be **perpetually in
dispute**]{.underline}. In other words, [if]{.underline} the
[overlapping security guarantees]{.underline} provided by both the U.N.
and AU charters [can be violated with impunity]{.underline}, [then what
is to stop African leaders who envy Putin's **[aggressive]{.mark}
brand** of [authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline} from
[[follow]{.mark}ing suit]{.underline}?

Already, we see this happening in some parts of Africa.

The volatile African Great Lakes region stands out for the fragility of
its borders. The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example,
has become a target for exploitation by authoritarian leaders in
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame, officially
in power since 2000, and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power
since 1986, have routinely marched their troops and proxies as well as
directed their allied rebel groups to seize Congolese territory, loot
natural resources, and kill citizens with alarming impunity. In October
2021, Congolese authorities reported clashing with Rwandan troops, who
allegedly occupied several villages before retreating. And as recently
as March, the Congolese army presented evidence that the Kagame regime
was actively backing a rebellion in eastern Congo. Disregarding borders
is particularly precarious in the Great Lakes region because it carries
with it the potential to reignite one of the most cataclysmic conflicts
in recent history.

Similarly, Moscow has played a destabilizing role in Africa. Recent
years have illuminated a "new scramble for Africa" as external actors
seek to aggressively plant their politics, governance, and economic
flags across the continent. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [at
the forefront of]{.underline} this [predatory behavior by **repeatedly
[propping]{.mark}** [up]{.mark}]{.underline} isolated and [authoritarian
leaders]{.underline} --- most notably in [[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[C]{.mark}entral [A]{.mark}frican [R]{.mark}epublic]{.underline},
[[Mali]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[Sudan]{.underline}]{.mark} --- to
advance Moscow's patently anti-democratic influence.

[[Through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[deployment of]{.mark} **shadowy and
[unaccountable]{.mark}** mercenary [groups]{.mark}]{.underline},
[polarizing [disinformation]{.mark} campaigns]{.underline}, [[election
interference]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and arms-for-resource]{.underline}
deals, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has gained influence while
[[fostering instability and]{.mark} the increased **h**uman **r**ights
[abuses]{.mark}]{.underline} that ultimately result from it.

[Russia]{.underline} has [also fomented]{.underline} --- both covertly
and overtly --- and been quick to support the many unconstitutional
[seizures of power]{.underline} recently witnessed in Africa. The
[**spate of [coups]{.mark}** and]{.underline} increasing instances of
[African leaders scrapping term limits]{.underline}, for example, better
[suit Moscow's]{.underline} vision of [remaking]{.underline} the
international order in its autocratic mold.

That a Russian-shaped order in Africa would be more oppressive is
crucial to note since most of the 16 ongoing internal conflicts on the
continent have deep roots in authoritarian forms of governance. None of
Africa's established democracies, in contrast, are in conflict. More
authoritarianism, then, can be expected to yield more conflict.

[[Tolerance for predatory]{.mark} interstate
[behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} globally, moreover, will
[[embolden]{.mark} elevated]{.underline} forms of
[[repression]{.underline}]{.mark} domestically in African states. After
all, if the enshrined principles of self-determination and popular
participation are not respected in a high-profile instance, such as
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, then what international actors can be
compelled to penalize the intimidation or jailing of opposition leaders,
the shuttering of independent media outlets, and the brazen rigging of
elections in Africa? Growing autocracy [would [do]{.mark} a **grave
[injustice]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [75 percent of
[Africans]{.mark} who **regularly state**]{.underline} that [democracy
is their preferred]{.underline} form of [government]{.underline}. The
[inevitable repression]{.underline} that will result from an unfettered
international order would [also]{.underline} lead to a
[[spike]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[refugee]{.mark} flow[s and]{.mark}
**internally [displaced]{.mark}** [populations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It took the trauma of World War II to compel the international community
to unite, recognize, and sign onto the principles outlined in the U.N.
Charter. Intrinsic to this global system --- forged from hard-learned
and costly experiences --- was the importance of collective security to
deter and push back against authoritarian bullies in Europe and
elsewhere.

The Organisation of African Unity and later the AU adopted many of these
core values. Indeed, drawing on its own hard-earned lessons from
colonialism, the challenges of securing peace following the brutal wars
of the 1990s, and the aftermath of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsis,
the AU rightly recognized the importance of action when faced with
violations of such universal principles.

While often underappreciated and unevenly applied, the U.N. and AU
frameworks provide a layer of international accountability against
extralegal actions as well as a critical starting point to build the
solidarity that is needed to address the challenges that the global
community faces.

As Africans grapple with the more present and disastrous aftershocks of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is important to recognize the threat
this form of authoritarian expansion will have on the continent if it is
normalized. [[History shows]{.underline}]{.mark} us that [[impunity is
**contagious**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [[apathy]{.mark} in the face of
**imminent threat** [is **foolhardy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [clear
threats emanating from [Putin]{.mark}'s worldview [defy the
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [[**central** to]{.mark} an
international order]{.underline} that both [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
U.N. and [**[AU]{.mark}** helped foster]{.underline}.

Today's [restrainers]{.underline} similarly seek to [**capitalize**
on]{.underline} the suffering and difficulties associated with [the wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}, as well as the broader fight
against terrorism, when they [argue for]{.underline} the [withdrawal
of]{.underline} the [remaining U.S. forces]{.underline} from these and
other conflicts.11 [[Restrainers]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, often
[[conflate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [initial [decision to
intervene]{.mark}]{.underline} at all [[with how]{.mark} a [conflict
is]{.mark} **subsequently [managed]{.mark}**]{.underline} or how
eventually to withdraw. [[These are **different**]{.mark} **policy
[decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [[one]{.mark} can be
[critical of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [2003 **invasion of
[Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline} and how the war was managed -- [while [also
believ]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [[Washington should
retain]{.underline}]{.mark} a modest [U.S. [military
presence]{.mark}]{.underline} to help prevent a return of the Islamic
State and to counter the influence of Iran.

Restrainers have also attempted to leverage the Great Recession and the
current economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic to incite
populist passions.12 They do this by falsely suggesting that defense
spending is the primary source of the federal deficit and debt.13
Defense spending is near post-World War II lows in terms of percentage
of U.S. gross domestic product and percentage of federal spending.

Restrainers consistently paint existing and potential conflicts and U.S.
military deployments with the same brush, warning of another "forever
war."14 However, not every conflict leads to an interminable quagmire.
Even the so-called War on Terror, despite its headaches, so far has
helped prevent another major foreign terrorist attack on the United
States, which many had predicted to be inevitable after 9/11.

The term "forever war" is itself curious. History, unfortunately, is a
forever war --- the chronicle of states' struggles with their enemies.
To be sure, one can write a truly wondrous history of human achievement.
But sadly, as the Spanish writer George Santayana observed, "only the
dead have seen the end of war."15

[Restrainers operate under]{.underline} the [**mistaken
[assertion]{.mark}** that]{.underline} the [[world would be]{.mark} a
[**safer** or **better**]{.mark} place [if U.S.]{.mark} influence would
**simply [recede]{.mark}**]{.underline}.16 The [20th [century tells
another story]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the historian Robert Kagan argued
in his 2012 book The World America Made, the [[U.S.-led]{.mark} world
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[heralded]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[global [rise in liberalism]{.mark} and **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights]{.underline}, better [**[education]{.mark}** and
**[health]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[greater
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} more [access
to [information]{.mark}]{.underline}.17

Equally puzzling is the notion that the world's problems and conflicts
are of little consequence to the United States.18 What happens abroad
inevitably affects Americans at home. Al-Qaeda launched the 9/11 attacks
despite America's best efforts to steer clear of Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan, where al-Qaeda was and is based. The Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor despite Washington's best efforts to stay out of the fray.
Isolationists initially blocked then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt
from providing greater support to an embattled Britain, and millions of
lives were lost from not confronting German leader Adolf Hitler
sooner.19

The best way to protect American interests is to engage internationally
and maintain a well-designed, forward-deployed military presence
alongside allies and partners. As Jakub J. Grygiel and A. Wess Mitchell
have noted, U.S. deployments of varying magnitude along what they call
the "unquiet frontier" that stretches from the Baltic Sea to the South
China Sea counter the rise of revisionist powers such as China, Russia,
and Iran.20 Support for U.S. allies, coupled with a U.S. military
presence in forward bases, helps deter gathering threats.21

[When Washington plays]{.underline} an [**outsized role** in shaping and
maintaining]{.underline} the [international **rules-based
order**]{.underline}, Americans and [people around the world are safer
and **more prosperous**]{.underline}. That is what the [United States
has done]{.underline}, for the most part, [since World War
II]{.underline}. And that [[leadership]{.mark} role]{.underline} has
helped [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [global
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Cold War [[did not erupt
into]{.mark} **devastating [military
confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Admittedly, the U.S.-led international order certainly has not prevented
all wars. There have been costly mistakes along the way. But
[[responding to]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[mistakes by
ignoring]{.mark} **persistent [threats]{.mark}** [and drawing down
U.S.]{.mark} military [posture]{.mark}]{.underline} for its own sake
would be [[**shortsighted** and **dangerous**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Those who welcome]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[retreat]{.mark} of U.S.
power]{.underline} have [[yet to]{.mark} **fully [answer]{.mark}** one
**important [question]{.mark}**[: What happens
after]{.mark}]{.underline} the [United States goes]{.underline} home?
When the British Empire unraveled after World War II, the United States
stepped into the void, promoting an international system based on the
rule of law. Who will follow the United States? The
[[alternatives]{.mark} are [frightening]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is far less equipped to become a
superpower but would be a [**particularly [predatory]{.mark}**[,
**corrupt**, and **avaricious**]{.mark}]{.underline} one
[[under]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its
part, actively seeks global leadership. The [Chinese Communist
Party]{.underline}'s [**[authoritarian]{.mark} hostility** to
democracy]{.underline}; [[weaponization]{.mark} of data]{.underline};22
[**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights [abuses]{.mark}]{.underline};23
[support for rogue states such as]{.underline} Iran, [North

and massive [[theft of **i**]{.mark}ntellectual
**[p]{.mark}**roperty]{.underline}27 should all serve as warnings about
a Chinese-led world order. And let us all dispense with the fiction that
the European Union could be an alternative to the United States in
defending democracies.

[an empire?]{.underline} [We may just as well debate whether an elephant
most closely resembles a]{.underline} **[T]{.underline}**yrannosaurus
**[Rex]{.underline}** [or **Triceratops**]{.underline}. [Some will point
to the imperial characteristics]{.underline} that are [reflected in
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[force posture]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}** [[characteristics
of]{.mark} dinosaurs or [empires]{.mark}]{.underline} (size, martial
strength, breadth) really [[have **no meaning**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in a world where that]{.mark} entire [order is
**extinct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **21st century** is filled with a
**new order**]{.underline} [of **nation-states**]{.underline},
[**markedly different** from eras prior to 1945]{.underline}.

**[American power]{.underline}** [is best understood not by its
type]{.underline}: hard, soft, or smart, [but]{.underline} its
**[motivation]{.underline}**. This is not to say the "imperial"
motivation has disappeared from human affairs; self-preservation and
domination are instinctive human qualities. But [[there is a **new
aspect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations that has been in place for more than a century, a
form of **[altruism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[illustrated by]{.mark} the
**[widespread support]{.mark}** that exists [in the U.S.]{.mark} and
other countries [for]{.mark} **universal [human
rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For many decades now,
[nations]{.underline} have routinely sought to [advance something beyond
their narrow national interests]{.underline}. I call this [a
**Promethean motivation**]{.underline}, and America a Promethean power.

The phrase is rooted in the myth of Prometheus, the rebellious god of
ancient Greek mythology who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the
human race, sparking the beginning of technology, growth, civilization,
and prosperity. Zeus was the ruler of the Gods of Olympus, archetype of
the emperor/king. The Gods were rulers, and humans were mere subjects.
Prometheus represents rebellion, the trickster God, undercutting the
authority of the imperial order. Legend has it that Prometheus tricked
Zeus --- repeatedly --- in order to help uplift the human race.

[[Critics]{.mark} of American intervention [**reflexively** use the
term]{.mark} **["imperial"]{.mark}** when discussing foreign
affairs]{.underline}. By far the dominant theme of imperialism in
American foreign policy has been voiced by Leftist thinkers such as
Howard Zinn, Gabriel and Joyce Kolko, and Gore Vidal. But since 1990,
the end of the Cold War, **[[neo-isolationists]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[on the right have [adopted the term as well]{.mark}]{.underline},
notably Pat **[Buchanan]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Congressman Ron
**[Paul]{.underline}**. Thus [the tendency is for thinkers on the
**political extremes**]{.underline} --- globalists on the left,
nationalists on the right --- [to find common cause, whereas centrists
tend to view American power more favorably]{.underline}, as do many
foreign scholars.

Following the 9/11 attacks and concerns about state failure abroad,
proponents of American intervention began suggesting American empire in
explicit and favorable ways. Such voices included Richard Haas,
Sebastian Mallaby, and Max Boot. The fullest expression of this new
theme is found in Colossus, a 2004 book by Niall Ferguson3 (now a
colleague at the Hoover Institution), who argued "not merely that the
United States is an empire, but that it always has been an empire" and
that the ultimate threat to the nation is its own "absence of a will to
power." The book is an unappreciated gem, but one wonders if Ferguson
and his intellectual opponents share the same framework, which refuses
to draw a line between imperial states of the 15th-19th centuries and
the modern states of the 21st.

Ferguson wonderfully skewers the slipperiness of the term hegemon, which
remains "the most popular term among writers on international
relations." [Hegemony]{.underline} refers to a coercive state, like an
empire, but one that aims to [create **mutually beneficial
relationships**]{.underline}. Trying to define the nature of state power
by the distribution of benefits (exploitative or shared) misses the
point. The point is: what are first principles that motivate foreign
action?

America on the world stage should be understood in the context of its
revolutionary founding. The republic's anti-imperial birth and its sense
of manifest destiny have colored foreign affairs from early on. Consider
again Thomas Jefferson's "Empire of Liberty," which was more than a
poetic phrase. In 1809 Jefferson wrote to his successor James Madison,
"I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as
ours for extensive empire & self-government." In one of his final
letters, written in 1824, Jefferson wrote, "where this progress will
stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been receding
before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I trust,
disappear from the earth."

To simplify matters, let's accept the framework of definitions on the
Left (and also popularly understood by Americans throughout history).
[Define an empire as a nation that exploits foreign peoples, aiming to
colonize them and/or extract their resources for the
advantage]{.underline} of the empire and at the cost of the foreigners.
And for the sake of clarity, recognize a bright line that distinguishes
imperial relationships as those where subjugated peoples do not want but
are forced to abide by foreign intervention. To be specific, [[the U.S.
role in]{.mark} South [Korea **fails the imperial
test**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as does the]{.mark} post-1955
[role]{.mark} of the U.S. [in **Germany** and
**Japan**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Those]{.mark} three [countries
accounted for]{.mark} nearly [**three-quarters** of U.S]{.mark}. troop
[deployments]{.mark} since 1950]{.underline}. [[Not to mention
**Spain**]{.mark}, **[Turkey]{.mark}**, [**Taiwan**, and
**Kuwait**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[All]{.mark} of these [are]{.mark}
**[voluntary alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and qualitatively
distinct from forces based in Iraq.

[[For the]{.mark} **Leftist [criticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of
American empire [to hold]{.mark}, **[ev]{.mark}**idence [of domination
should be **easy**]{.mark} **to see**]{.underline}. [One would expect to
see the countries of the world that are occupied by American troops
suffering economic decline as a result]{.underline}, or at a minimum a
relative decline. [Here **[the critique falls
apart]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the world [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[hosted]{.mark} the greatest
number of American [troops]{.mark} since 1950 [have **grown the
fastest**]{.mark} **economically**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [host
[countries]{.mark} have [experienced **faster declines in child
mortality**]{.mark}, **faster [increase in]{.mark} overall
[longevity]{.mark}**, **faster [growth in infrastructure]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} even [greater improvements in]{.mark} the broadly measured
human development index (**[HDI]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. Consider as
evidence the average economic growth rates presented in table 2,
reproduced from Jones and Kane (2012).4

The record shows that [**[America's engagement]{.mark}** with allied
nations [is **unequivocally beneficial**]{.mark} for those
countries]{.underline}. But the context is what matters for future
policy choices. **[Public [perceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** of world
affairs [[are dominated by]{.mark} negatives: [bombings in]{.mark} Iraqi
[cities]{.mark}, AIDS rampant in Africa, genocides,
earthquakes]{.underline}. Foreign policy experts focus on negatives of a
subtler nature: the dilemma over Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, the
poppy trade and corruption in Afghanistan, the strategic mystery that is
China. [**[Yet]{.mark}** despite real and looming crises, the
**underlying [theme]{.mark}** of the American century [is a]{.mark}
**patient [march of human prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [deepening
and [broadening as]{.mark} economic [growth unfolds]{.mark} in the free
world]{.underline}.

[The American strategy of patient, forward deployment of U.S.
troops]{.underline}, even and especially when it is not self-interested,
[has **benefitted our allies and the world**]{.underline}. [America's
engagement in Asia and Europe since 1945 created a security umbrella
fostering **peace** and **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline}. [If
this model were applied to the Middle East]{.underline} --- supporting
allies rather than hunting monsters --- [it would reshape the region's
future for the better]{.underline}. On this point, Fallows might agree.

[[The question]{.underline}]{.mark} that haunts contemporary foreign
policy [[is **not** whether the U.S.]{.mark} military [is a force for
good]{.mark} around the globe]{.underline}. **[[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The question is: Can]{.mark} Promethean
[power be sustained?]{.mark}]{.underline} Does the United States have
the willpower to maintain a forward force posture?

**Russia and China's "new world order" would be a nightmare for African
decolonial sovereignty.**

**Mhaka '22** \-- Johannesburg-based social and political commentator
(Tafi Mhaka, 4-7-2022, \"Russia's new world order is bad news for
Africa,\" Al Jazeera,
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/4/10/russias-new-world-order-is-bad-news-for-africa,
accessed 7-5-2022) \-- nikki

On March 30, just a day after a Russian missile hit an administrative
building in the port city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, killing at
least 12 people, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made the case
for the establishment of new world order. In a videotaped message to his
Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Lavrov claimed the world is "living through
a very serious stage in the history of international relations". He
added, "We, together with you, and with our sympathisers will move
towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order". Lavrov's sentiments
echoed [Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi
Jinping's February 4 joint statement announcing the beginning of a new
era in international relations. In that statement, the two leaders not
only called for a new, multipolar order but lamented the West's
"unilateral approaches to addressing international issues", claiming
such attitudes "incite contradictions, differences and confrontation"
and hamper "the development and progress of mankind".]{.underline}
Without a doubt, this is a credible observation, especially regarding
the United States' policies across the world. For example, Washington
has sanctioned Zimbabwe's government -- and rightfully so -- for
committing gross human rights abuses, but continues to support the
equally repressive Ugandan government with military hardware, cash and
training. Last month, the US Senate passed a resolution urging
"international criminal courts to investigate Putin, his security
council and military leaders for possible war crimes" in Ukraine.
Nevertheless, Washington still refuses to recognise the International
Criminal Court (ICC), or cooperate in any way with its investigation
into possible war crimes committed by US troops in Afghanistan. The
hypocrisy of the US is also apparent in its approach to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite Israel's countless,
well-documented human rights and international law violations,
decades-long illegal occupation of Palestinian territories, and
apartheid policies against the Palestinian population, the US has
blocked 53 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical
of Israel in the last five decades. And it is not only Russia and China
that are disturbed by the West's apparent hypocrisy in the international
arena. [Africa too has grave concerns about the current global order,
and has long been calling for the UN to undergo substantial reform to
address the deep-rooted injustices in its handling of international
affairs. In]{.underline} 2005, for instance, the African Union (AU)
adopted the Ezulwini Consensus, calling for a more representative and
democratic UNSC, in which Africa, like all other world regions, is
represented. And speaking at the 35th Ordinary Session of the AU
Assembly in February, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed renewed the
call for Africa to be granted a larger role in the UN. [In this context,
it may seem understandable for Africa to support the multipolar world
order Russia claims to be building with the help of China. However,
Beijing and Moscow are not calling for any reform that would diminish
the enormous sway they readily have over world affairs. They are also
not acting in a way that demonstrates under this new order they would
hold themselves to the same standards as everyone else or that less
powerful states and peoples would have better access to justice. Indeed,
as recently as in 2021, China blocked a UN Security Council statement
condemning the military coup in Myanmar. And between 2011 and 2019,
Russia vetoed no less than 14 UNSC resolutions on Syria. These great
powers are evidently selective and casual proponents of democracy and
human rights]{.underline} -- just like their nemesis, the US. [But
African nations now appear hell-bent on ignoring the hypocrisy
demonstrated by Russia and China, and eagerly awaiting the emergence of
their new world order.]{.underline} The dangers of idolising Putin's
Russia, Xi's China [Putin's popularity is at an outstandingly irrational
and possibly dangerous high in Africa. Despite the illegality and
brutality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, for example, Putin's name
adorns long-distance buses in Zimbabwe.]{.underline} And [African
leaders also seem reluctant to punish or even caution the Russian leader
for its destructive "special military operation" in Ukraine. At the
recent UN General Assembly vote on a resolution calling for Russia's
suspension from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), for example, the
majority of African states either abstained -- such as South Africa --
or outright voted no -- like Ethiopia.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [South
Africa's influential opposition leader Julius Malema has urged Putin to
"teach" Ukraine and NATO a lesson because "we need a new world
orde]{.underline}r". He has also claimed that Putin has given the
Russian army clear instructions to avoid "civilian casualties" in
Ukraine. [This is despite the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights recording 1,900 civilian casualties -- with 726 people
killed, including 52 children -- mostly caused by the use of explosive
weapons in populated areas.]{.underline} In light of the disdain for
territorial integrity, humanity and the right to life Putin's Russia is
currently showing in Ukraine, Africans should stop and think how the
Russian leader's proposed new world order would likely work out for
them. And [it is not only the carnage caused by Russia in Ukraine that
should make Africa think twice about supporting the new world order
promoted by Moscow and Beijing.]{.underline} Under Putin, [Russia has
been inundated by state-affiliated and state-sponsored political filth
and terror. Putin's political rivals and anyone daring to act against
the interests of the Kremlin, including journalists, have faced
assassination attempts both in Russia and abroad.]{.underline} Many,
including former Federal Security Service agent Alexander Litvinenko and
journalist Anna Politkovskaya, have been killed. [Human rights groups
and independent media organisations have been targeted and shut down.
Elections have been turned into a sham and private enterprise has been
all but killed. Under Putin's orders, the Russian military waged many
immoral wars across the world -- Russia's indiscriminate shelling of
residential areas in Syria and Georgia claimed thousands of
lives.]{.underline} Similarly, [China under Xi is a hotbed of
repression. His administration has arbitrarily detained, tortured and
mistreated millions of Turkic Muslims in the northwestern Xinjiang
region. It has also frequently targeted intellectuals, civil rights
activists and journalists and moved to restrict LGBTQ and women's
rights]{.underline}. Thus, [Malema and other African leaders who look
forward to Putin's new world order should stop and consider what they
are wishing for. An illiberal world order led by despots with
blood-soaked histories cannot help Africa fulfil its democratic
aspirations.]{.underline} Africa must chart its own path Africa does not
need to subscribe to Chinese, Russian or American interpretations or
manifestations of democracy and multilateralism. It simply needs to
secure equal rights and representations in a genuinely progressive
multipolar international system that safeguards its democratic and
economic interests as enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the AU. The
ill-advised and misplaced enthusiasm for Putin's strongman politics is a
sombre reflection of Africa's failures and imprecise trajectory under
the toothless AU. Almost 21 years after its establishment, the AU
carries very little weight on the continent and it has almost no voice
on the global stage. And while its pursuit of permanent representation
on the UNSC is an extremely praiseworthy and essential exercise, it has
gradually turned into an expedient and intermittently expressed
soundbite. Be that as it may, [Africa should focus on establishing a
world order that is defined by strong, independent and democratic
multilateral institutions. Undoubtedly, that is what China and Russia
are eager to avoid or destroy, because they want the licence to
intimidate, repress, silence and kill, both at home and
abroad]{.underline}.

**The [best]{.underline} studies go aff --- err on the side of a
[consensus]{.underline} of [empirical]{.underline} research --- our
evidence assumes [every skeptic]{.underline}.**

[Consistency with influential relevant theories lends
**credence**]{.underline} [to the expectation that **US security
commitments**]{.underline} [actually can shape the strategic environment
as deep engagement presupposes]{.underline}. But it is far from
conclusive. Not all analysts endorse the theories we discussed in
chapter 5. These theories make strong assumptions that states generally
act rationally and focus primarily on security. Allowing misperceptions,
emotions, domestic politics, desire for status, or concern for honor
into the picture might alter the verdict on the strategy's net expected
effects. And [[to model]{.mark} the strategy's expected [effects
we]{.mark} had to [simplify]{.mark} things by selecting two
mechanisms]{.underline}--- [**[assurance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[deterrence]{.underline}**]{.mark}--- [and examining
their effects independently, thus missing potentially **powerful
positive interactions** between them.]{.underline}

This chapter moves beyond theory to examine patterns of evidence. If the
theoretical arguments about the security effects of deep engagement are
right, what sort of evidence should we see? Two [major bodies of
evidence are most important]{.underline}: general **[empirical
findings]{.underline}** concerning the strategy's key mechanisms
[and]{.underline} **[regionally focused research]{.underline}**.

General Patterns of Evidence Three key questions about US security
provision have received the most extensive analysis. First, do alliances
such as those sustained by the United States actually deter war and
increase security? Second, does such security provision actually hinder
nuclear proliferation? And third, does limiting proliferation actually
increase security?

Deterrence Effectiveness [The determinants of [deterrence]{.mark}
success and failure have [attracted]{.mark}]{.underline} scores of
quantitative and [case study [tests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much of the
case study work yields a cautionary finding: that [deterrence is much
harder in practice than in theory]{.underline}, because standard models
assume away the complexities of human psychology and domestic politics
that tend to make some states hard to deter and might cause deterrence
policies to backfire. 1 [Many quantitative
[findings]{.mark}]{.underline}, mean- while, [[are]{.mark} mutually
[contradictory]{.mark} or are clearly not relevant to extended
deterrence. But **[some]{.mark} relevant [results receive broad
support]{.mark}:**]{.underline}

- **[[Alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** generally do **[[have a
  deterrent]{.mark} effect]{.underline}**. [[In a study
  spanning]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly **[[two
  centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[Johnson]{.underline}**
  [and]{.underline} [**[Leeds]{.underline}** [found "support
  for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the hypothesis that defensive alliances
  deter the **initiation of disputes**]{.underline}." They conclude that
  "[[defensive alliances lower]{.mark} the **probability of
  international [conflict]{.mark}** and are thus a good policy option
  for states seeking to maintain peace]{.underline} in the world."
  Sechser and [Fuhrmann similarly find that formal defense pacts with
  nuclear states]{.underline} have significant deterrence benefits. 2 3

- [The overall balance of military forces]{.underline} (including
  nuclear) between states [does not appear to influence deterrence; the
  **local balance of [military forces ]{.mark}**[in the]{.mark}
  **specific [theater]{.mark}** in [which **deterrence** is]{.mark}
  actually **[practiced]{.mark}**, however, **[is
  key]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4

- **[[Forward- deployed troops enhance the]{.mark} deterrent
  [effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** of alliances with overseas allies. 5

- [Strong mutual interests and ties enhance deterrence]{.underline}. 6

- [Case [studies]{.mark} **strongly [ratify]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}
  theoretical [expectation]{.mark} that [it is easier to
  **defend**]{.mark} a given status]{.underline} [quo [than]{.mark} to
  **[challenge]{.mark} it forcefully**]{.underline}:
  [compellence]{.underline} (sometimes termed "coercion" or "coercive
  diplomacy") [is extremely hard]{.underline}.

[The most important finding]{.underline} to emerge from this voluminous
research [is that [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}--- especially
[[with]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[- armed
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** [like the United States]{.underline}---
**[actually [work]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in deterring
conflict]{.underline}. This is all the more striking in view of the fact
that what scholars call "[[selection bias]{.underline}"]{.mark} probably
[**[works against it]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The **U**nited States is
more inclined to offer]{.underline}--- and protégés to seek--- [alliance
rela- tionships in settings where the **probability** of military
**conflicts** is **higher than average**]{.underline}. [The fact that
alliances work to deter conflict in precisely the situations where
**deterrence** is likely to be **especially hard** is
noteworthy.]{.underline}

More specifically, these findings buttress the key theoretical
implication that if [the United States is interested in deterring
military challenges]{.underline} to the status quo in key regions[,
[relying]{.mark} only [on]{.mark} **[latent]{.mark} military
[capabilities]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} US **[homeland]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} likely to be **far [less effective]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[than having an **overseas military posture**]{.underline}.
Similarly, they lend support to the general proposition that a [[forward
deterrence]{.mark} posture [is]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[strongly
[appealing]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a status quo power, [[because
defending]{.mark} a given status quo [is]{.mark} **far [cheaper than
overturn]{.mark}ing it**, and, once a favorable status quo is
successfully overturned, **restoring** the status quo ante can be
expected to be **fearsomely costly**]{.underline}. [[Recognizing]{.mark}
the significance of [these **findings**]{.mark} **clearly [casts
doubt]{.mark}** [on the]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[wait on the sidelines
and decide]{.mark} whether [to intervene later"
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is so strongly [favored by
**retrenchment proponents**]{.underline}.

The Causes of Nuclear Proliferation Matthew Kroenig highlights a number
of reasons why US policymakers seek to limit the spread of nuclear
weapons: "[Fear that nuclear proliferation might deter \[US leaders\]
from using military **intervention** to pursue their interests, reduce
the effectiveness of their **coercive diplomacy**, trigger **regional
instability**, undermine their **alliance structures**, dissipate their
strategic attention, and set off **further nuclear proliferation**
within their sphere of influence]{.underline}." These are not the only
reasons for concern about nuclear proliferation; [also notable are the
enhanced prospects of]{.underline} **[nuclear accidents]{.underline}**
[and the greater risk of **leakage** of]{.underline} **[nuclear material
to terrorists]{.underline}**. 9 8

[[Do]{.underline}]{.mark} deep engagement's [[security
ties]{.underline}]{.mark} [serve to [contain]{.mark} t]{.underline}he
spread of **[[nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**? The literature on
the causes of proliferation is massive and faces challenges as great as
any in international relations. With few cases to study, severe
challenges in gathering evidence about inevitably secretive nuclear
programs, and a large number of factors in play on both the demand and
the supply sides, [**[findings are]{.mark} decidedly [mixed]{.mark}**.
Alliance relationships are just one piece of this complex
puzzle]{.underline}, one that is hard to isolate from all the other
factors in play. And [empirical studies face the same selection bias
problem just discussed]{.underline}: Nuclear powers are more likely to
offer security guarantees to states confronting a serious threat and
thus facing above- average incentives to acquire nuclear weapons.
Indeed, [alliance guarantees might be offered to states actively
considering the nuclear option precisely in order to try to forestall
that decision]{.underline}. Like a strong drug given only to very sick
patients, alliances thus may have a powerful effect even if they
sometimes fail to work as hoped. 10

Bearing these challenges in mind, [[the **most relevant**]{.mark}
findings that emerge **from this literature [are]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

- [The]{.underline} **[most recent [statistical
  analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the precise question at issue
  [[concludes]{.mark} that "[security guarantees]{.mark} **significantly
  [reduce proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [proclivity]{.underline}
  among their recipients." In addition, [[states]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
  such [guarantees are less likely to **export**]{.mark}
  sensitive]{.underline} **[nuclear [material and
  tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** to other nonnuclear states. 12 11

- **[Case study research]{.underline}** [underscores that the complexity
  of motivations for acquiring nuclear weapons cannot be reduced to
  security]{.underline}: domestic politics, economic interests, and
  prestige all matter. 13

- [[Multiple **independent**]{.mark}**ly conceived** and]{.underline}
  **[executed]{.underline}** [recent case [studies]{.mark} nonetheless
  [reveal]{.mark} that **[security alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}
  [help [explain]{.mark} numerous allied [decisions not to
  proliferate]{.mark} even when security is not always the main driver
  of leaders' interest]{.underline} in a nuclear program. As Nuno
  Monteiro and Alexandre Debs stress, "[States whose security goals are
  subsumed by their sponsors' own aims have **never acquired the
  bomb**]{.underline}. ... [This finding highlights the role of U.S.
  security commitments in **stymieing nuclear
  proliferation**]{.underline}: U[.S. [protégés]{.mark} will [only
  **seek the bomb** if they **doubt U.S.
  protection**]{.mark}]{.underline} of their core security goals." 15 14

- **[Multiple independently]{.underline}** conceived and executed recent
  **[case [research]{.mark}]{.underline}** [projects further unpack the
  conditions that decrease the likelihood of allied proliferation,
  [center]{.mark}ing [on]{.mark} the [**credibility** of the **alliance
  commitment**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In addition, [in]{.underline}
  some [cases of prevention failure, the alliances allow the patron to
  influence the ally's nuclear program subsequently, decreasing further
  proliferation risks]{.underline}. 17

- [Security [alliances lower]{.mark} the likelihood of **[proliferation
  cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, [many predicted cascades
  did not occur.]{.underline} But [security **[provision]{.mark}**,
  mainly [by the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**[, is a **key**
  reason]{.mark} why]{.underline}. [[The **most comprehensive**]{.mark}
  **statistical [analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[finds]{.mark} that
  [states]{.mark} are more likely to [proliferate]{.mark} in response to
  neighbors [when]{.mark} **three conditions are met**]{.underline}: (1)
  [[there is an **intense**]{.mark} **security [rivalry]{.mark}**
  between the two countries]{.underline}; (2) [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
  prospective [proliferating [state **does not have a security
  guarantee**]{.mark} from a **nuclear**- armed **patron**]{.underline};
  [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (3) [the potential proliferator has the
  industrial and technical [capacity]{.mark} to launch an
  indigenous]{.underline} nuclear [program]{.underline}. 18 19 16

In sum, as Monteiro and Debs note, "Despite grave concerns that more
states would seek a nuclear deterrent to counter U.S. power
preponderance," in fact "[the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
[**decelerated** with the **end of the Cold War**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in 1989." [Their research, as well as that of **[scores of
scholars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[using]{.underline} **[multiple
methods]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and [representing]{.mark} many
**[contrasting]{.mark} theoretical
[perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [shows]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[US]{.mark} **security [guarantees]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the counter-
proliferation policy **[deep engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline} [allows
[are]{.mark} a **big part** of the **reason [why]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
20

The Costs of Nuclear Proliferation General empirical findings thus lend
support to the proposition that security alliances impede nuclear
proliferation. But is this a net contributor to global security? Most
practitioners and policy analysts would probably not even bring this up
as a question and would automatically answer yes if it were raised. Yet
a small but very prominent group of theorists within the academy reach a
different answer: [some of the same realist precepts that generate the
theoretical prediction that retrenchment would increase demand for
nuclear weapons also suggest that proliferation might **increase
security**]{.underline} such that the net effect of retrenchment could
be neutral. Most notably, "**[nuclear optimists]{.underline}**"
[like]{.underline} Kenneth **[Waltz]{.underline}** [contend that
**deterrence** essentially solves the security problem for all
**nuclear- armed states**]{.underline}, [largely eliminating the direct
use of force]{.underline} among them. It follows that [US retrenchment
might generate an initial decrease in security followed by an **increase
as insecure states acquire nuclear capabilities**]{.underline},
[ultimately leaving no net effect on international
security]{.underline}. 21

[This perspective is countered by]{.underline} "**[nuclear
[pessimists]{.mark}]{.underline}**" such as Scott Sagan. Reaching
outside realism to organization theory and other bodies of social
science research, [they [see major]{.mark} security [downsides]{.mark}
from **new nuclear states**. **Copious [research]{.mark}**]{.underline}
produced by Sagan and others [[casts doubt]{.mark} on the expectation
that [**governments** can be **relied upon**]{.mark} to create
**secure** and **controlled** **nuclear forces**. The more nuclear
states there are, the higher the probability that the organizational,
psychological, and civil- military pathologies Sagan identifies will
turn an episode like one of the numerous "**near misses" he
uncovers**]{.underline} into actual nuclear use. As Campbell Craig
warns, "[One day a **[warning system]{.mark} will
[fail]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or **[[an]{.mark} [official will
panic]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [or a terrorist **[attack will be
misconstrued]{.mark}**, and **the [missiles will
fly]{.mark}**.]{.underline}" 22 23

Looking beyond these kinds of factors, it is notable that [powerful
reasons to question the assessment of proliferation optimists also
emerge even if one assumes, as they do, that states are rational and
seek only to maximize their security]{.underline}. First, [nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} can [only work by **raising the risk of
nuclear**]{.mark} **[war]{.mark}**. For deterrence to be
**credible**]{.underline}, [there has to be a]{.underline} [**nonzero
chance** of nuclear use]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} nuclear [use is
**impossible**, **deterrence cannot be credible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It follows that [every nuclear deterrence relationship depends on some
probability]{.underline} of 24 nuclear use. [[The more]{.mark} such
relationships there are]{.underline}, **[[the greater the risk]{.mark}
of nuclear war]{.underline}**. Proliferation therefore increases the
chances of nuclear war even in a perfectly rationalist world.
Proliferation optimists cannot logically deny that nuclear spread
increases the risk of nuclear war. Their argument must be that the
security gains of nuclear spread outweigh this enhanced risk.

Estimating that risk is not simply a matter of pondering the conditions
under which leaders will choose to unleash nuclear war. Rather, as
Schelling established, the question is whether states will run the risk
of using nuclear weapons. [Nuclear [crisis]{.mark} bargaining
[is]{.mark} about [a "**competition in risk
taking**]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Kroenig counts some twenty cases in
which states]{.underline}---including prominently the United
States---[ran real risks of nuclear war in order to prevail in
crises]{.underline}. As Kroenig notes[, "By asking whether states can be
deterred or not ... proliferation optimists are **asking the wrong
question**.]{.underline} [The right question to ask is: **what risk of
nuclear war**]{.underline} [is a specific state willing to run against a
**particular opponent** in a]{.underline} **[given
crisis]{.underline}**?" [[The more]{.mark} nuclear- [armed
states]{.mark} there are, the more the opportunities for such risk-
taking and [the **greater the probability**]{.mark} **of nuclear
use**]{.underline}. 27 26 25

That Africa is the first among the world's regions to feel the
devastating human effects of climate change is now widely acknowledged.
[Arguably more significant than the]{.underline} **[economic
boons]{.underline}** [Russia stands to realize]{.underline} from the
aforementioned deals [are the adverse environmental effects that
resource mining could have on the populations of these
countries]{.underline}.

Putin's promise to help bring stability to the Central African Republic
also invites a human approach to the analysis of Russia's Africa policy.
According to the UN, the protracted conflict has displaced more than
642,000 people. During the past year, [the actions of Putin's
associate]{.underline} Yevgeny Prigozhin and Prigozhin's **[private
military company]{.underline}**, [Wagner Group, in the CAR have faced
increasing scrutiny]{.underline}. Columbia University professor Kimberly
Marten, for example, has [highlighted the group's]{.underline}
**[mercenary interests]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[CAR's]{.underline}** [mineral-rich]{.underline}
**[mines]{.underline}**. [Discerning]{.underline} exactly [what Putin's
promise entails therefore has a particular]{.underline} **[humanitarian
urgency]{.underline}**.

Foreign policy and domestic policy are inextricably connected. For this
reason, it is important also to examine the impact of foreign policy on
domestic social attitudes. [Russia has a]{.underline} **[notoriously
poor record on racism]{.underline}**, [particularly when it comes
to]{.underline} **[African migrants]{.underline}**, as the Los Angeles
Times highlighted back in 2014. Since the country hosted the FIFA World
Cup in 2018, [these problems have been]{.underline}
**[exacerbated]{.underline}** [by the presence of many Africans who
outstayed their Fan Visas in hope of seeking asylum or finding
work]{.underline}. In March of this year, Interior Ministry official
Andrei Krayushkin confirmed that [5,500 of these individuals remained in
Russia]{.underline}.

[Mixed race]{.underline} **[African Russians]{.underline}** [also
continue to face]{.underline} **[discrimination and
abuse]{.underline}**, as this Calvert Journal report shows. In the case
of Russia's "pivot to the East," official foreign policy has fostered
positive attitudes among the Russian population toward China and its
people. [To what extent the Kremlin's pivot to Africa will have an
analogous effect remains to be seen, but attention should be paid to
whether Putin's overtures to African leaders have any tangible effect on
the lives of Russia's own African population.]{.underline}

[Africa is not]{.underline}, as Belgium's King Leopold contemptuously
called it, [a "magnificent cake" that exists purely to sate the
appetites of great powers---**Russia among them**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it is an umbrella term that includes a plethora of independent actors
with their own agendas distinct from those of Moscow]{.underline},
Beijing, or indeed Washington. As the South China Morning Post recently
reported, **[Russia is playing catch-up]{.underline}** to China and the
West [in terms of developing economic ties with the
continent]{.underline}. With African nations---and the continent as a
whole---in ascendance on the international stage, it is time to rethink
the way we analyze great powers' Africa policies. And Russia's policy is
a good place to start.

**Russia will [interfere]{.underline} with African elections to support
[unstable autocracies]{.underline}.**

**Gathara 19**, Communications consultant, writer, and award-winning

//CHC-DS

However, as it seeks to reassert itself on the world stage, [Africa is
still seen as providing "low-cost, high-profile" opportunities to
burnish its prestige]{.underline}.

Still, the Africa of today is very different from that of the 1970s and
1980s and while maintaining some of the tactics that were successful in
yesteryears, such as the use of proxy forces in places like the Central
African Republic and the sale of light and heavy weapons to regimes with
dubious human rights records, [Russia has evolved others more in tune
with the times]{.underline}.

According to Proekt (The Project), an independent Moscow-based online
investigative news outlet, [Kremlin-linked teams have used social
media]{.underline} **["troll farms"]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[spin doctors]{.underline}** [to interfere in politics and elections
in 20 countries on the continent,]{.underline} particularly in
Francophone Africa, but with mixed success so far. In 2018 [they failed
in their attempt to]{.underline} **[engineer]{.underline}** [the
re-election of President Erie Radzaunarimampianina in Madagascar and
have been linked to **interference** in elections in
Zimbabwe.]{.underline}

According to the Financial Times "[across Africa, Moscow has deployed
teams of]{.underline} **[military instructors]{.underline}** [to train
elite presidential guards, sent arms shipments and]{.underline}
**[assisted shaky autocrats]{.underline}** [with election
strategies]{.underline}. It has also promised to build nuclear power
plants and develop oil wells and diamond mines."

The Guardian has also reported on leaked [documents show]{.underline}ing
[a]{.underline} **[wide-scale Russian effort]{.underline}** "[to bolster
its presence in at least 13 countries across Africa by]{.underline}
building relations with existing rulers, striking military deals, and
[grooming a new generation of 'leaders' and **undercover
'agents'**]{.underline}."

The goal of Russian efforts seems largely unchanged from the Soviet days
-- essentially to counter and limit the influence of others on the
continent. [The benefits for autocrats seeking to hang on to power on
the continent is]{.underline} similarly [easy to ascertain]{.underline}.
However, for their youthful subjects, many of whom have little
experience or recollection of the Soviet Union, the renewed Russian
interest is likely to be viewed with scepticism.

//CHC-DS

Russia's interest in Africa

It will be simplistic to frame the just-concluded Russia-Africa summit
as a copy-cat jamboree organized by Russia to latch on the bandwagon of
the increasingly fashionable trend of organizing and institutionalizing
Africa summits by countries like China, India, Japan, France, and the
United States. The truth is that, si[nce the 2000s, there has been a
noticeable **re-awakening** of Russia's interest in Africa]{.underline}.
Indeed, [between 2005 and 2015, Africa's trade with Russia grew by 185
percent,]{.underline} and [Russia has]{.underline} **[several
reasons]{.underline}** [to engage Africa more intensely]{.underline}.

Goal 1: [Projecting power on the global stage]{.underline}

In supporting African countries---who, notably, constitute the largest
voting bloc in the United Nations---[Russia is cultivating allies in its
challenge to the current United States and Euro-Atlantic-dominated
security order]{.underline}. This strategy is not going unnoticed:
Indeed, in 2018 former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton
accused Russia of [selling arms to African countries in exchange for
votes at the United Nations, among other nefarious
motivations]{.underline}.

Goal 2: [Accessing]{.underline} **[raw materials]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[natural resources]{.underline}**

**[Russia]{.underline}**---just like other major world powers---also
**[covets]{.underline}** [many of Africa's raw materials and is creating
joint projects and investments in order to access them]{.underline}.
From the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Central African
Republic, [Russian companies are]{.underline} **[scaling
up]{.underline}** their [activities in the mining of resources such as
coltan, cobalt, gold, and diamonds]{.underline}. In Zimbabwe, for
instance, a joint venture between Russia's JSC Afromet and Zimbabwe's
Pen East Ltd is [developing one of the **world's largest** deposits of
platinum group metal]{.underline}. In Angola, [Russian mining company
Alroser recently increased its stake in local producer Catoca to 41
percent]{.underline}, in a deal that provides the diamond giant with a
production base outside Russia. Despite joint ownership with Angola,
[Catoca operates **under Russian management**]{.underline}. Remarkably,
about one-third of Russia's African imports are agricultural, including
fruit, cocoa, coffee, and potatoes.

Goal 3: Arms exports and security

In recent years, Russia had become the largest supplier of arms to
Africa, accounting for 35 percent of arms exports to the region,
followed by China (17 percent), United States (9.6 percent), and France
(6.9 percent). Since 2015, Russia has signed over 20 bilateral military
cooperation agreements with African states. A Russian citizen, Valeriy
Zakharov, has even been appointed to be a national security advisor to
the president of the Central African Republic (CAR), Faustin-Archange
Touadéra.

[Russian arms are attractive to African leaders because]{.underline},
besides being relatively cheap, [deals with Russia are
**not**]{.underline} often **[held up by human rights
concerns]{.underline}** [cited by other countries like France and the
U.S.]{.underline} For instance, when the U.S. was dilly-dallying on
selling arms to Nigeria to fight Boko Haram in 2014 upon allegations of
human rights abuses by Nigerian soldiers, Nigeria turned to Russia and
was able to place an order for 12 attack helicopters.

Goal 4: [Supporting energy and power development in Africa through
Russian companies]{.underline}

[Lack of]{.underline} affordable, [reliable electricity in Africa makes
the region a prime and]{.underline} **[lucrative location]{.underline}**
[for Russia's energy and power industry]{.underline}. Several
state-owned Russian companies such as **[Gazprom]{.underline}**,
**[Lukoil]{.underline}**, **[Rostec and Rosatom]{.underline}** [are
active in Africa]{.underline}, with activities largely concentrated in
Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Nigeria, and Uganda. So far, Rosatom has signed
memorandums and agreements to develop nuclear energy with 18 African
countries, including Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Rwanda, Nigeria, and
Ethiopia. In 2018 alone, Rosatom agreed to build four 1200 MW VVER-type
nuclear reactors in Egypt---with construction and maintenance valued at
\$60 billion---with a Russian loan of up to \$25 billion at an annual
interest rate of 3 percent.

[Russia]{.underline} also [wants to use its mostly state-owned oil and
gas companies to create]{.underline} **[new streams of energy
supply]{.underline}**. In 2018, for instance, [Nigerian oil and gas
exploration company Oranto Petroleum announced that it would be
cooperating with Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, to develop **21
oil assets** across 17 African countries]{.underline}. [Several Russian
companies have also made significant investments in Algeria's oil and
gas industries and in Libya, Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, and
Egypt]{.underline}.

In [contemporary debates, this argument undercuts]{.underline},
modifies, and qualifies [characterizations]{.underline} held by so many
[of the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates as essentially
imperial]{.underline}, and the American order as an empire. In our
rendering, the [**U**nited **S**tate]{.underline} is [[not]{.mark} the
last [**Western empire**, but the first **anti-imperial**]{.mark} and
**post-imperial [great power]{.mark}** [in the **global
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our argument is thus focused on the
consequences of American foreign policy for the evolution of the
international system, and we do not in this confined treatment offer an
explanation for the origins of U.S. foreign policy. In short, we offer
an argument about impacts rather than the sources of America's
antiimperial and pro-Westphalian role.

Empires and State Systems: Historical Patterns

Empire has been the historically predominant form of order in world
politics. Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no
global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent
imperial and colonial ventures connected desperate regional systems,
doing so approximately five hundred years ago.7 Prior to this emergence
of a globalscope system, the pattern of world politics was characterized
by regional systems. These regional systems were initially very
anarchic, and marked by high levels of military competition. But almost
universally, they tended to consolidate into regional empires which had
fairly limited interactions with polities outside their regions.8 Thus,
it was empires -- not anarchic state systems -- that typically dominated
the regional systems in all parts of the world.

Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order
was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy.
Despite repeated efforts to consolidate Europe into one empire -- or
what the Europeans referred to as "universal monarchy" -- this region
remained a plural, multi-state political order. After the Peace of
Westphalia ending the Thirties Year War, this plural anarchic system,
the Westphalian system, and was sustained by a rough balance of power
among its autonomous states and the weakness of the claimants of
European empire. This Westphalian system was based on a roughly equal
distribution of power among its major units, sustained by various
balancing practices that thwarted a succession of regional European
empire-builders, and had an elaborate system of public international law
and ideological justification.9 While this system rested on a balance of
power, it was juridically crystallized into a system of mutually
recognized sovereigns.

Outside of Europe, however, the European states, including those that
were most active in preventing empire within Europe, were
extraordinarily successful in conquering and colonizing vast areas
across oceanic distances.10 The Europeans did not invent empire, but
they were spectacularly successful at empire building on a global scope,
largely because of the imbalance of power that stemmed from European
innovations in technology and organization.11 The Europeans conquered
and dominated empires, states, and peoples in every previously loosely
coupled or isolated regional system across the world. The Europeans also
successfully planted numerous colonies of settlers, mainly in the
temperate zones in North and South America, Oceania, and the southern
tip of Africa.12 States from the Western European core of the
Westphalian system thus brought into existence a global-scale political
system made up of vast multi-continental empires of conquered peoples
and a scattering of colonial "new Europes."13

This pattern of European empire building was different from its
predecessors, not just in its global scope, but also because the
European states were continuously warring against one another for
dominance within Europe. These struggles between states within Europe
against empire in Europe were fought on a global scale. Thus the first
"world war," defined as a war fought across multiple continents,
occurred in the later 18th century. In this struggle Britain sought to
thwart French attempts to dominate Europe and the battle lines were in
Europe, North America, South Asia, and across the global oceans. This
pattern of the globalization of intraEuropean warfare continued in the
20th century with the wars triggered by German efforts to dominate
Europe. The growing imbalance of power between the Europeans and the
rest of the world during the 18th and 19th century enabled the Europeans
to easily expand their empires at the expense of non-Europeans. But
during the same periods, the Europeans found it very difficult to
conquer each other within Europe. Thus vast armies wrought great
destruction fighting over tiny parcels of land in Europe, while
comparatively small European imperial expeditionary forces readily
mastered non-European armies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Thus a
balance of power underpinned the Westphalian system in Europe, while an
imbalance of power between Europe and the world underpinned imperial
expansion.

Anti-imperial and anti-colonial rebellions and resistance are as old as
empires, but successful rebellion against European imperial rule outside
Europe began in the 18th century with the revolt of the colonial settler
colonies in the Americas -- first in North America and then in South
America. This first wave of settler-colony rebellion marked the end of
what historians refer to as the "first British empire," as well as the
first great European empire in the Americas, that of Spain. The success
of this first wave of anti-imperial rebellion in Spanish America was
crucially facilitated by the weakening of Spain during the Napoleonic
wars for domination within Europe.

In the later-19th century, European empire building outside of Europe
entered a second wave, enabled by the new industrial technologies that
further amplified the imbalance of power between Europeans and
non-Europeans, which in turn allowed the Europeans to extend their
imperial domination into the large interior spaces of the continents,
particularly in Africa and Asia.14 In the 20th century, further wars
among the core European states weakened Britain, France, and Holland,
the leading European colonial powers, thus creating opportunities for
antiimperial independence movements in Asia and Africa. Paradoxically,
the fact that the Europeans were continuously fighting one another
fueled their imperial ambitions and successes, while at the same time,
such wars weakened them and helped enable the success of rebellions
against their empires.15 Thus as the British empire was reaching its
territorial zenith in the early years of the 20th century, Britain was
critically weakened by the world wars in Europe and Asia against the
aspiring German and Japanese empire builders.

The territorial aggression of the Axis Powers constitute a third wave of
empire building which was short lived and thwarted by the successful
mobilization of the "United Nations," a coalition led by the United
States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. A fourth wave of
empire building, by the Soviet Union and the international communist
movement in the second half of the 20th century, was thwarted and
dismantled by the United States and its allies.

The Pattern of American Anti-Imperial, Anti-Colonial, and
Pro-Westphalian Impacts

[[Against]{.underline}]{.mark} the [backdrop of]{.underline} this
[evolution of the international system and]{.underline} the [four [waves
of **empire** building]{.mark} and dismantlement]{.underline}, it
becomes possible to [see **more [clearly]{.mark}** the many
ways]{.underline} in which [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[played]{.mark} **important [anti-imperial]{.mark}**[,
anti-colonial]{.mark}]{.underline}, and pro-Westphalian
[[roles]{.underline}]{.mark}. 16

In each of the four waves of empire building and dismantlement, the
United States had an impact. The [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} was the [first]{.underline} "**[new
nation]{.underline}**" [to emerge from]{.underline} a
[**[rebel]{.mark}**lion [against]{.mark} European [imperial
rule]{.mark}]{.underline} during the first wave of modern empire. The
[United States]{.underline} also [[supported]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[independence of]{.underline} other [European settler
colonies]{.underline} throughout the Americas [and]{.underline}, with
the [Monroe Doctrine]{.underline}, helped [**sustain their
[independence]{.mark}** [against European efforts to
**recolonize**]{.mark}]{.underline} parts of the [Americas]{.underline}.
In the second wave of late 19th century empire-building, the [United
States]{.underline}, despite its great relative power, [[did not
establish]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[empire]{.mark} of its
own]{.underline} of any significance or duration. [And]{.underline}
during the latter part of the 20th century, the United States
[[pushed]{.mark} **European [decolonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus
[facilitating]{.underline} the [breakup of second wave empires.
In]{.underline} the [great world wars]{.underline} in the 20th century,
the [United States played]{.underline} an [**important role** in
[thwarting]{.mark}]{.underline} a third [**wave of [imperial
projects]{.mark}** [of **Germany**, **Japan**, and
**Italy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the second half of the 20th century,
the United States played decisive roles, both ideological and military,
in thwarting the fourth wave of empire building, the expansion of the
communist great power, the Soviet Union, as well as communist coups and
revolutions in many weak and small independent states.

The United States [[also]{.mark} played]{.underline} a [variety of
important roles in **[building]{.mark} and strengthening**]{.underline}
Westphalian [[institutions, moderating]{.mark} **inter-state
[anarchy]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} facilitating]{.underline} the [[ability
of states to survive as **independent**]{.mark} **members** of
international society]{.underline}. From its inception, the [United
States]{.underline} was [precocious in]{.underline} its [support
for]{.underline} the [law of nations]{.underline}, the [institutions
of]{.underline} the [society of states]{.underline}, particularly the
[laws of]{.underline} war and neutrality, and public international law,
as a means of [[restraining war and aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
both the 19th and 20th centuries, the [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, first regionally and then [[globally,
inspired]{.underline}]{.mark} and helped [**legitimate
[anti-colonial]{.mark}** [and anti-imperial **independence
movements**]{.mark} and]{.underline} national [liberation
struggles]{.underline} among [peoples struggling [against
empires]{.mark} all over the world]{.underline}. In the 20th century,
the [United States]{.underline} led the efforts to
[institutionalize]{.underline} Westphalian [norms of non-aggression
and]{.underline} sovereign [independence]{.underline}, first with the
League of Nations and then with the United Nations Charter. In the
second half of the 20th century, the [American]{.underline}-led [liberal
international order institutionalized **free trade** and **[multilateral
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thus providing the infrastructure
for a global economic system, thus [[enabl]{.mark}ing
**[smaller]{.mark}**]{.underline} and weaker [[**states** to sustain
their sovereign]{.underline}]{.mark}. Also in the second half of the
20th century, the [American]{.underline} system of [military
[alliances]{.mark} contributed to]{.underline} the [dampening of violent
conflicts]{.underline} among allied states, particularly in Europe and
East Asia, thus [[protecting]{.mark} the]{.underline} Westphalian
[[system from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [return of [violent conflict and
empire-building]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**IR is great \-\-- leads to better decisions which help avoid war.**

\[Dan, "Scholars Help Policymakers Know Their Tools," *War on the
Rocks*, 27 Aug,

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign [policy choices are
**not sui generis**]{.mark}, there are [patterns]{.mark} across space
and time that **[inform decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Policymakers recognize this and routinely draw lessons from history when
making foreign policy decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other
areas such as development and public health routinely rely on broader,
more general studies to craft policy. And, [[**broader scholarship** can
**improve** foreign policy performance]{.mark}, as [evidenced by the
ability of]{.mark} IR [academics to build on their]{.mark} own [work to
**predict outcomes**]{.mark}, including for example forecasting the
lengths of the conventional and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq
conflict in the 2000s]{.underline}.

But, even if one were to accept the limits of general work, there is a
growing body of academic work that evaluates foreign policy tools as
applied to a specific country or region. These studies ask questions
such as whether:

Development projects reduced insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone
strikes reduced insurgent violence in Pakistan; Development programs
increased civic participation and social capital in Sudan; Building cell
phone towers in Iraq reduced insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate
combatants into society in Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in
Liberia increased the legitimacy of the government there; Road projects
in India reduced insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's
failure in Congo; Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent
attacks from militants.

This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective.

A third critique is that much of this academic work on foreign policy
tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too quantitative and
technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik Voeten, [[there
is a **danger** in **not appreciating** the importance of rigorous
research design]{.mark}, including sophisticated [quantitative
techniques, for **crafting effective policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Sophisticated [research]{.mark} design is not the enemy of effective
policy, it [is **critically necessary**]{.mark} for it]{.underline}.
Certainly, [the current academic focus on building research designs that
permit causal inference speaks exactly to what policymakers care about
the most: if implementing a certain policy will cause the desired
outcome]{.underline}.

Or, put differently, [**[bad research]{.mark}** designs [make for **bad
public policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A classic example is school
busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some cities adopted
voluntary integration programs for public schools]{.underline}, in which
families could volunteer to bus their children to schools in
neighborhoods with different racial majorities. [Policymakers used the
favorable results for the voluntary programs to make the improper
inference that mandatory busing policies would also work]{.underline}.
[The result was bad public policy and violence]{.underline} in the
streets.

[Sophisticated [technical methods]{.mark} can [improve our ability to
make **causal inferences**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} can help
[[solve]{.underline}]{.mark} other **[[empirical
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consider that the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. [Assessing whether certain policies do win
public support requires collecting opinion data]{.underline}. A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques
have been used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

[Going forward, we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in
which mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective
than male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion
in combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians?

[Certainly, **[other areas]{.mark}** of public policy [understand the
importance]{.mark} of rigorous research design]{.underline}. [Economic
and development policy communities read the work of and employ economics
Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [[Policymakers incorporate the findings of]{.mark}
sophisticated [studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**,
**gender empowerment**, and **foreign aid**]{.mark}, knowing the best
policy decisions must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}.

Or consider public health policy. [**[Lives are literally on the
line]{.mark}** as [decision-makers must make decisions about]{.mark}
issues such as [**vaccinations**, **nutritional recommendations**, and
**air quality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Policymakers know they must use
sophisticated technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other
public health academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}.

Critics will argue that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from
contemporary academic IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics
let go of an obsession with technique, they will then be better able to
connect with policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree
that IR academics need to find ways to communicate their results in
clear, non-technical language. But [[the **technical
components**]{.mark} of the work **[need to be
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Stripping them out **directly
undermines** the ability of the research to give the **right**]{.mark}
kinds of policy **[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Let me conclude by noting that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR
academics should think about the big picture as well as smaller
questions, the forest of grand strategy as well as the trees of foreign
policy tools. [IR [academics have the potential to **make real
contributions** to]{.mark} big picture
**[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of
grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates
foreign policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}.

Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers need to know their
tools]{.underline}. [Rigorous IR research is the only way to evaluate
them effectively]{.underline}.

Like (and Why It's Still Worth Doing)", 5-5,

If this is the best we can do, then what's the point? Well, consider the
alternatives. For starters, [[we might decide to
skip]{.underline}]{.mark} statistical [[forecasting]{.underline}]{.mark}
altogether and just target our interventions at cases identified by
expert judgment as likely onsets. Unfortunately,
[[those]{.underline}]{.mark} expert [[judgments are]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[going to be]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[even less
reliable]{.underline}]{.mark}** guide [[than our]{.underline}]{.mark}
statistical [[forecasts, so this "solution" only **exacerbates our
problem**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Alternatively, we could take no
preventive action and just respond to events as they occur. If the net
costs of responding to crises as they happen are roughly equivalent to
the net costs of prevention, then this is a reasonable choice. Maybe
responding to crises isn't really all that costly; maybe preventive
action isn't effective; or maybe preventive action is potentially
effective but also extremely expensive. Under these circumstances, early
warning is not going to be as useful as we forecasters would like. If,
however, any of those last statements are false--if responding to crises
already underway is very costly, or if preventive action is (relatively)
cheap and sometimes effective--then [[we have an incentive to use
forecasts to]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[guide]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[action, in spite of]{.underline}]{.mark} the lingering [[uncertainty
about exactly]{.underline}]{.mark} where and [[when]{.underline}]{.mark}
those [[crises will occur]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even in situations where
preventive action isn't feasible or desirable, [[reasonably accurate
forecasts can still be useful if they spur]{.underline}]{.mark}
interested [[observers to **plan for
contingencies**]{.underline}]{.mark} they otherwise might not have
considered. For example, policy-makers in one country might be rooting
for a dictatorship in another country to fall but still fail to plan for
that event because they don't expect it to happen any time soon. [[A
forecasting model]{.underline}]{.mark} which identifies that
dictatorship as being at high or increasing risk of collapse [[might
encourage]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[policy-makers to
reconsider]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[expectations
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in so doing, [[lead them to **prepare better**
for that event]{.mark}.]{.underline} Where does that leave us? For me,
the bottom line is this: [[even though forecasts]{.underline}]{.mark} of
political instability [[are never going to be]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[[precise]{.underline}]{.mark} as we'd like, [[they can still be
accurate enough to be helpful]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as long as the
events they predict are ones for which prevention]{.underline}]{.mark}
or preparation [[stand a decent chance of making a]{.underline}]{.mark}

**Realists did not justify imperialism, their evidence is in the context
of colonial NOT post-colonial realism. People understand immoral actions
and the plan wouldn't actively increase war.**

[It is]{.underline} [common]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
[post-colonial]{.underline} [scholarship]{.underline} in IR
[to]{.underline} [present]{.underline} [**sweeping generalisations**
about]{.underline} [realist analysis]{.underline} [of
imperialism]{.underline}. In a famous paper, for instance, Enrol
Henderson argues that [Realism]{.underline} (with capital R to encompass
all strands), '[roots its conception of anarchy]{.underline} in the
Hobbesian view of the state of nature' (Henderson, 2013, 80). Echoing
Charles Mills, Henderson argues that this conception was not applicable
to 'the general state of mankind' but rather intended to describe the
state of affairs of 'non-whites' to rationalise imperialistic violence
against them and the appropriation of their land. Thus, 'a non-white
people, indeed the very non-white people upon whose land his fellow
Europeans were then encroaching, is his only real-life example of people
in a \[Hobbesian\] state of nature' (Mills, 1997, 65; cited in
Henderson, 2013, 80). [It follows]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, [the
concerns among]{.underline} [realists]{.underline} [and idealists with
anarchy]{.underline} [are grounded in a racist discourse]{.underline}
[that is concerned with the obligations of superior peoples]{.underline}
to impose order on the anarchic domains of inferior peoples in order to
prevent the chaos presumed to be endemic in the latter from spilling
over into the former's territories or self-proclaimed spheres of
interest. Similarly, the realist and idealist concern with power was
grounded in a racist discourse concerned largely with the power of
whites to control the tropics, subjugate its people, steal its resources
and superimpose themselves through colonial administration. (Henderson,
2013, 85)

**[There are two problems]{.underline}** [with **Henderson's**
**generalisation** about **realism**]{.underline}. First, [the
'**Hobbesian'** state of nature]{.underline} Henderson associates [with
**realism** has been **rejected** **by classical
realists**]{.underline}. For example, in response to Martin Wight's
Hobbesian interpretation of his work, Morgenthau replied in a letter to
International Affairs: To say that a truth is "hidden" in an "extreme"
dictum can hardly be called an endorsement of the dictum. [To call a
position "extreme]{.underline}" [is not to identify]{.underline}
[oneself]{.underline} [with the position]{.underline} [but to
disassociate oneself]{.underline} [from it]{.underline} ... I was trying
to establish the point, in contrast to Hobbes's, that [moral principles
are universal]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, hence, [are not created by
the state]{.underline}. (Morgenthau, 1959; on Carr's rejection of
Hobbesianism see, for instance, Linklater, 2000; Molloy, 2021)

Secondly, [the concept of anarchy]{.underline} [was]{.underline}
[indeed]{.underline} [central]{.underline} [to neo-realists]{.underline}
[such as Waltz]{.underline} (whom Henderson cites most extensively),
[but not to classical realists]{.underline}. [In response]{.underline}
[to those]{.underline} [who take]{.underline} [it]{.underline} [as 'a
matter of course that anarchy]{.underline} \[is\] [a basic assumption of
Morgenthau's]{.underline} "[realist' theory]{.underline}" for instance,
Hartmut Behr and Amelia [Heath]{.underline} [argue]{.underline} [that
'although this]{.underline} [may be true for]{.underline}
[Waltz]{.underline}, [it is not the case for Morgenthau']{.underline}
(Behr & Heath, 2009, 332). Since '**[the term anarchy is]{.underline}**
**[mentioned]{.underline}** [in Politics Among Nations]{.underline}
**[only three times]{.underline}**; and when Morgenthau refers to it, it
is in a critical dissociation from Hobbes' (Behr & Heath, 2009, 332).
Importantly, Behr and Heath note that Politics Among Nations originated
as a reflexive attempt to critique the ideological rationalisation of
power. It was only later that 'a plethora of neo-realists became cooks
in the "kitchen of power"' (Behr & Heath, 2009, 345). In this sense,
[Morgenthau's]{.underline} **[(classical) realism]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} Waltz's (**[neo)realism]{.underline}** [are
diametrically opposed]{.underline} in [their aims and methodologies: the
former rejects]{.underline} the '[value free' social
science]{.underline} of [the latter]{.underline} [and **pursues**
instead]{.underline} **[a normative critique of power]{.underline}**
(Karkour & Giese, 2020; Roesch, 2014; Williams, 2013).
[Morgenthau's]{.underline} [critique of power]{.underline} [runs
counter]{.underline} [to any social science]{.underline} that proceeds
[on the basis of its]{.underline} [rationalisation, let alone the
rationalisation of empire]{.underline}. Akin to Morgenthau, in The
Structure of Nations and Empires, Niebuhr presents a critique of power
as an instrument of imperialism. [The 'pretentions' of
power]{.underline}, according to Niebuhr, '[are the source of
evil]{.underline}, [whether they are expressed by kings and emperors or
by commissars and revolutionary]{.underline} statesmen' (Niebuhr, 1959,
298).

**[It is]{.underline}** thus simply **[not true]{.underline}**, pace
Henderson and other post-colonial IR theorists (as cited below), [that
classical realists]{.underline} such as Morgenthau and Niebuhr **[either
justified or omitted]{.underline}** **[imperialism]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [analyses]{.underline} of
international politics. **[Morgenthau]{.underline}**, as well as Niebuhr
(but unlike Carr), [**rejected** the Marxist explanation of]{.underline}
**[imperialism]{.underline}** [as **rooted in laissez faire
capitalism**]{.underline} [and the social question in Western
democracies. **Instead, they presented a long** **durée explanation of
imperial domination**]{.underline}: imperial domination, according to
Morgenthau and Niebuhr, [was a political problem]{.underline} [that
pre-dated the capitalist]{.underline} [structure of the global
economy]{.underline}. 'The economic interpretation of imperialism' that
Marxism proposes, according to Morgenthau, 'erects a limited historic
experience, based on a few isolated cases, into a universal law of
history' (Morgenthau, 1978, 53). The notion that 'capitalist societies'
wage wars in search of 'markets for their products and sufficient
investments for their capital' did not stand to empirical scrutiny
according to Morgenthau (1978, 52). For 'during the entire period of
mature capitalism' [Morgenthau observed]{.underline}, '[no war, with the
exception of the Boer]{.underline} [War, was waged by major]{.underline}
[powers]{.underline} [exclusively or even predominantly for economic
objectives']{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1978, 53). Furthermore, 'the main
period of colonial expansion which the economic theories tend to
identify with imperialism precedes the age of mature capitalism' and
'Louis XIV, Peter the Great, the Napoleon I were the great imperialists
of the modern pre-capitalist age' (Morgenthau, 1978, 54). 'What the
precapitalist imperialist, the capitalist imperialist, and the
"imperialistic" capitalist want' thus Morgenthau concluded, 'is power,
not economic gain' (Morgenthau, 1978, 55). To counter imperialism,
therefore, the scholar ought to address the problem of power---namely to
limit power, through an ethic of humility. Morgenthau incorporated such
an 'ethic of humility' into his, largely misunderstood among
post-colonial scholars, conception of the national interest. This 'ethic
of humility' calls for the acknowledgement of the deceptive nature of
power and acceptance of the 'lesser evil'. It is based on the premises,
which Morgenthau summarises in Scientific Man Versus Power Politics as
follows, Neither science nor ethics nor politics can resolve the
conflict between politics and ethics into harmony. [We have no choice
between power]{.underline} [and the common good. To act]{.underline}
[successfully, that is]{.underline}, **[according to the rules of the
political art, is political wisdom]{.underline}**. [**To know** with
despair that **the political act is inevitably evil**]{.underline}, and
to act nevertheless, [**is** **moral courage**]{.underline}. [To choose
among several expedient actions the least evil one is moral judgment. In
the combination of political wisdom, moral courage, and moral judgment,
**man** **reconciles his political nature with his moral
destiny.**]{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1946, 173)

**Realism is the most [ethical]{.underline} paradigm for international
relations --- it accepts the [inherent insecurity]{.underline} of the
nuclear age as a [precondition]{.underline} for genuine hospitality.
Rejecting national sovereignty and borders lapses into liberal
interventionism and [global nuclear civil war]{.underline}.**

Conditioned by the trace, [survival is]{.underline} thus
[**inseparable** from]{.underline} finitude and [the **constant threat
of [erasure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Derrida, 1976: 167). According to
Derrida (1984b: 65, emphasis added): 'it belongs to the trace to erase
itself, to elude that which might maintain it in presence'. In this way,
the trace also points to the elusiveness of life, and to the fact that
nothing can ever guarantee the infinite existence of anything. It tells
us that [life is nothing but a '**play of traces**', which **lacks an
absolute origin** and is **inherently mortal**]{.underline} (Derrida,
1984a: 15). [This]{.underline} play of traces brings us back to
Hägglund's notion of the 'time of life', which [[highlights the]{.mark}
**central [importance of]{.mark} temporal [finitude]{.mark}** [for
grasping]{.mark} the **general conditions of
[life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As he puts it: 'This radical finitude of
survival is not a lack of being that is desirable to overcome. Rather,
[the finitude of survival opens the chance for **everything that is
desired** and the threat of **everything that is feared**]{.underline}'
(Hägglund, 2008: 1--2). There is, then, an important 'double bind' to
the tracing of time. On the one hand, it is because nothing is infinite,
immortal or present in itself that new life can emerge. On the other
hand, the lack of self-presence means that life can never be immune to
alteration, contamination and death. [In order for anything to live, it
must consequently be **mortal** and **open to unpredictable
change**]{.underline} (Derrida, 1976: 143). Even if an infinite and
immortal life, free from dangers, might seem desirable, it would be a
self-refuting desire since it implies desiring the end of the
possibility to desire anything at all. More precisely, it would be the
same as desiring the end of the continuous flow of time that allows new
life to emerge while exposing everything that lives to the threat of
coming to an end. Immortality cancels out the time of mortal life and
renders survival obsolete. Counterintuitively, Hägglund (2008: 32--33)
thus notes, mortality can be seen as the 'best' or most desirable, while
immortality is the 'worst' or least desirable. [While [this]{.mark} may
seem like a **rejection** of life, it is, in fact, an **affirmation** of
life. It positively **[affirms the chance to live]{.mark}** precisely
[on the condition that inherent]{.mark} in any movement of survival [is
the **risk of**]{.mark} **life coming to [an end]{.mark}**[. Refusing
this]{.mark} risk [would be]{.mark} the same as **[refusing to
live]{.mark}**, since to live is to negotiate the relationship between
life and death.]{.underline} Temporal finitude is significant, moreover,
not only for grasping the general conditions of life, but for explaining
why [any act of survival **must encounter the uncertainty of the
future**]{.underline}. Returning to Waltz for a moment, [it is precisely
**[this]{.mark} uncertainty** that [makes it **impossible to know** if
today's friend will **stay a friend** or]{.mark} suddenly **[turn into
an enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline}: 'In the absence of an external
authority, a state cannot be sure that today's friend will not be
tomorrow's enemy', writes Waltz (2000: 10). [[If we]{.mark} were able to
**[acquire full knowledge]{.mark}** of if and when a friend becomes an
enemy]{.underline}, we would bring the future under our control.
However, then the future would no longer be a genuinely open future, in
which the chance of survival is inseparable from finitude and mortality.
[[Survival would]{.mark} then **[lose its value]{.mark}** and become
**redundant** as [life turns into]{.mark} **nothing but [a calculable
formula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So, what are the implications of
Derrida's notion of survival and his critique of the 'calculable' for
our understanding of 'ethics'? First of all, it means that [[ethics
**cannot be**]{.mark} **translated into [static]{.mark} ethical
ideals**]{.underline}. As Derrida has elaborated on in relation to a
wide array of issues, including justice, responsibility, hospitality,
friendship and the gift, [ethics]{.underline} rather [**depends on
maintaining openness** to the **perpetual coming of the
future**]{.underline}. This openness means that [none of these issues
**can ever be linked to something pure**, **uncontaminated** and
**incorruptible** that is immune to unexpected alterations.]{.underline}
To take one specific example, hospitality is, for Derrida, crucial for
thinking about ethics (see Derrida, 2000). This is because an [act of
hospitality suggests that the self **does not simply exist in pure
isolation** of what lies 'outside' the self, but **must always negotiate
its relation** with]{.underline} the non-self, that is, [the
other]{.underline}. Ethics is, for this reason, inseparable from
hospitality since both terms highlight the necessity of relating to and
opening up space for others. At the same time, [[hospitality cannot
be]{.mark} '**absolute**' or '[**pure**' in]{.mark} the sense of
**[conforming to a static]{.mark} metaphysical
[ideal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For Derrida, [not only would
[such]{.mark} an ideal [be **impossible to
achieve**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Kantian sense11, [it would be
**essentially [undesirable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because [the
**very aspiration** towards a pure metaphysical ideal would have as its
aim the **closure of the uncertainty** that makes the self--other
encounter **possible in the first place**. The welcoming of strangers
must therefore always involve a **chance** as well as a **threat**: the
chance of some sort of **positive** and **friendly transformation**, and
the threat that the other **turns into an enemy doing harm to the
host**]{.underline} (Derrida, 2000: 15; Hägglund, 2008: 103--105). The
only way to eliminate the potential threat inherent in any act of
hospitality would be to make the self completely immune to the other.
Such immunity, however, would close down the self--other encounter
before it could happen at all. Derrida (2003: 129) thus rhetorically
asks: The visit might actually be very dangerous, and we must not ignore
this fact, but would a hospitality without risk, a hospitality backed by
certain assurances, a hospitality protected by an immune system against
the wholly other, be true hospitality? Derrida's point here is that
[hospitality **categorically cannot correspond to something pure**, like
a **universal ideal situation beyond violence**]{.underline}. This is
because [without the **threat of violence**, the very act of welcoming
the other **would not be possible in the first place**]{.underline}. In
order for this act to be 'possible', it must simultaneously be
'impossible', in the pure metaphysical sense (see also Bulley, 2017: 12;
Vaughan-Williams, 2007: 121). [While ethics is often linked to a
**seemingly self-evident desire** to reach an **absolute metaphysical
ideal**, [Derrida]{.mark}'s philosophy **contests the desirability of
such ideals altogether** and [offers]{.mark} a **stark
[warning]{.mark}** [against **any attempt to immunize** the '**good**'
from the '**bad**']{.mark}, '**peace**' from '**violence**',
'**friends**' from '**enemies**', and so on]{.underline}. This is why,
in Derrida's view, [there has to be a **violent** or **non-ethical
opening of ethics**]{.underline} (Derrida, 1976: 140; 1978: 128). [To
desire the closure of this opening would be the same as desiring the
elimination of that which **makes any ethics possible at all**: its
exposure to the uncertainty of the future, and the indestructible threat
that inheres in all encounters with others]{.underline}. Rather than
linking ethics to a desire for the purely good,
[[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Derridean sense
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[**tied to an affirmation**
of]{.mark} the **[uncertainty]{.mark} of the future**, which opens up to
the '**good**' as well as the '**bad**'.]{.underline} The ethics of
neorealism [[Derrida's]{.mark} notion of]{.underline} the violent
opening of [[ethics fits]{.mark} **remarkably well**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the two core assumptions of Waltz's theory of
international politics: [[the **anarchic**]{.mark} **structure** of the
international political [system and]{.mark} **states' [desire to
survive]{.mark}** within this system]{.underline}. On this basis, it can
be argued that [there is]{.underline}, indeed, [an **ethics of
neorealism**]{.underline}. It is found in the 'Waltzian baseline' rather
than in attempts to use that baseline to establish law-like patterns of
behaviour.12 To grasp the ethics of neorealism, [it is]{.underline}
therefore [necessary to **shift focus**]{.underline} from causal laws
and testable hypotheses, [to the **structural conditions that shape**
and **affect the behaviour of states** in a **non-deterministic
manner**]{.underline}.13 Hence, [the 'structure']{.underline} in Waltz's
theory has [to be grasped as an **open structure** that leaves **ample
room for chance** and **contingency**]{.underline}. Crucially, [if we
could know for certain **what states will do** on the basis of either
the **structure of the system** or some **predetermined motives** of the
subjects within the system]{.underline}, the uncertainty of
international life would disappear and [the '**politics**' of
international politics would **lose its meaning**]{.underline}.14 Rather
than trying to rectify the lack of certainty by creating a stronger
sense of certainty, [it is]{.underline} therefore [**imperative to
affirm the uncertainties** created by the system. It is
important]{.underline}, moreover, [to **oppose the distinction between
ethical desirability** and **political possibility**, since the
reproduction of this distinction **blocks from view** the conditions of
international life that **make ethical thinking** and **action possible
in the first place**.]{.underline} Positivist social science and liberal
interpretations of Kant are thus, very crudely put, the main obstacles
to grasping the ethics of international life. In resisting both moves,
[neo[realism **does not**]{.mark} **seek to [close down]{.mark} the
violent opening of [ethics]{.mark} inherent in the structure of
anarchy**]{.underline}, for example, [[by **formulating**]{.mark}
**metaphysical [ideals]{.mark}** [informing states how they **should
act** or how they **ought to be**]{.mark}**come [friends rather than
enemies]{.mark}**. There **can be no absolute friendship** between
states, and [no state **can** ]{.mark}**ever [offer absolute
hospitality]{.mark}** to another state. At the heart of every
inter-state relation, there is **mistrust**, **uncertainty** and
**incalculability**. To positively affirm the latter is **not to say
that uncertainty** or **incalculability is good per se**. Rather, it
implies that they are seen as **basic** and **irrefutable conditions**
of international life, which, consequently, are **not even desirable to
overcome**]{.underline}. Hence, it also implies that as long as there is
international life, there must be 'the ominous shadow of the future
\[that\] continues to cast its pall over interacting states' (Waltz,
2000: 39). Crucially, Waltz's reference to [this]{.underline} shadow
[**should not be read** as an expression of **determinism**. It
expresses rather an **affirmation of uncertainty**: the 'uncertainty of
each about the other's future intentions and actions']{.underline}
(Waltz, 1979: 105). [In order to give friendship in international
politics a chance]{.underline}, so to speak, [the possibility that a
friend suddenly becomes an enemy **must never be eliminated**. Attempts
to **create absolute trust** in inter-state relations are therefore not
only **impossible to achieve in the practical sense**, but **essentially
undesirable**]{.underline}.15 Along similar lines, Derrida explains how
[friendship is possible **only if one remains open to the deception of
the other**, since it is precisely the **unconditional openness to
whatever may happen** in the encounter between self and other that makes
it possible to develop **any sort of friendship in the first
place**]{.underline} (Derrida, 2005: 219). Even if we were to accept
Alexander Wendt's (1999) distinction between different 'cultures of
anarchy', some of which are more 'friendly' than others, [[it is **not
self-evident** that]{.mark} a culture in which [friendship]{.mark} is
prioritized [over enmity is]{.mark} **actually a [better]{.mark}
one**]{.underline}. This is because in order to exclude the possibility
that a friend may suddenly become an enemy, one must first eliminate the
time of international life that makes the self--other encounter possible
in the first place. For the same reason, the key message of democratic
peace theory --- that all states should become democracies in order to
minimize or eliminate the possibility of wars --- is not only
practically impossible, but also ethically undesirable. It is impossible
to verify because there is no democracy that is immune to corruptibility
(Waltz, 2000: 10), but, in addition to that, it can be seen as
undesirable since [the notion that all states must conform to the same
universal ideal **cancels out their freedom to act**, to **take moral
responsibility** and so on]{.underline}. The undesirability of [[a
system that **eradicates**]{.mark} **violence**, **[borders]{.mark}**
and **discrimination**]{.underline} is further underlined by Waltz
(1979: 111--114) in his discussion of the 'virtues of anarchy'. Therein,
he attacks the idea of transforming the international system into a
world government. Not only [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} such a
transformation ['[be]{.mark} an invitation to prepare for
**[world]{.mark} civil [war]{.mark}**[']{.mark}]{.underline} (Waltz,
1979: 112), [but it would take away the **constitutive violence at the
heart of inter-state relations** in the structure of
anarchy.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} **constant [possibility of
war]{.mark}** in the international system [means]{.mark} that [states
will **always be wary of provoking others**]{.mark} in the search for
security]{.underline}. As he puts it: [The constant possibility
[that]{.mark} force will be used **limits manipulations**, [**moderates
demands**, and **serves as an incentive** for the **settlement of
disputes**]{.mark}. One who knows that pressing too hard may lead to war
has **strong reason to consider** whether possible gains are **worth the
risks entailed**]{.underline}.... The possibility that conflicts among
nations may lead to long and costly wars has ... sobering effects.
(Waltz, 1979: 113--114) In this way, [the conditions of peace in the
international system can be said to rest on the **constant possibility
of war**]{.underline}. In making this point, Waltz argues against moral
universalism. Hence, unwittingly or otherwise, he also opens up space
for ethical negotiation by recognizing the finitude of [the political
subject]{.underline}, who [is free to interact with others only on the
condition that self and other **do not have to conform** to the 'same'
universal ideal.]{.underline} [The subject is thus able to **take moral
responsibility** and ponder on **how to make ethical decisions**, which,
without **difference** and **alterity**, would turn into a **strictly
formal procedure** based on the '**mechanical application of
rules**']{.underline} (Zehfuss, 2009: 146). [Responsibility and ethical
decisions are]{.underline}, thus, [made possible **precisely by the
impossibility of predetermining** what is the '**right**' decision in
any given context]{.underline}. As Derrida argues, [irrespective of
**how thorough the decision-making procedure is**, and regardless of
**how much knowledge is acquired** before taking a
decision]{.underline}: the instant of the decision, if there is to be a
decision, must be heterogeneous to this accumulation of knowledge.
Otherwise, there is no responsibility. In this sense only must the
person taking the decision not know everything. Even if one knows
everything, [the decision]{.underline}, if there is one, [must advance
toward a **future that is not known**, that **cannot be
anticipated**]{.underline}. (Derrida, 2002b: 231) [The impossibility of
anchoring the decision in rational calculation is]{.underline}, in this
sense, [what **creates the chance for any decisions to be taken at
all**]{.underline}. The instant of the decision belongs, then, not to a
fully present moment in which the subject calculates the future
consequences of the decision, but to a future that is incalculable (see
Derrida, 2002a). [[It is]{.mark} precisely [this]{.mark}
**[incalculability]{.mark}**, and the **uncertainty of the future**,
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} Waltz's conception of [**[anarchy]{.mark}
positively [affirms]{.mark}**. Rather than making the instant of the
decision **obsolete** by transforming the decision into a **mere
application of rules**, anarchy makes the ethical decision
'**possible**'.]{.underline} Even if Waltz repeatedly claims that the
desire to survive is a purely pragmatic assumption made strictly for the
purpose of constructing an explanatory theory, it is not neutral or
innocent. First and foremost, Waltzian [neorealism expresses an ethics
due to the way it **affirms states' desire to survive** by stipulating
the **necessary conditions of their survival**]{.underline}. More
precisely, [[it]{.mark} affirms the uncertainty of international life by
**refusing to reduce the play of relations** between states to a
**calculable formula** or a **regulative ideal**, and that rather
**[embraces chance]{.mark}** and **contingency** as **central features**
of the anarchic system --- features that make states **simultaneously
free** and **insecure**]{.underline}.16 In this light, [the primary
significance]{.underline} of Waltz's theory [is **[not as]{.mark} an
[explanatory]{.mark} theory**, [but]{.mark} as a theory [that]{.mark}
affirms]{.underline} the time of international life, defined by [the
**uncertainty of the future**]{.underline} and the logic of the erasable
mortal trace.17 [It is this notion of the future that **[makes it
possible for states]{.mark}**, as finite political subjects, not only to
**survive**, but also [to]{.mark} try to **take moral responsibility**
and **[make ethical decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Why universal
ethical ideals are both impossible and undesirable What are the
implications of my reading of Waltzian [neorealism]{.underline} as an
ethics? First of all, it [contributes to a new understanding of the
difficulties inherent in **any attempt to theorize** what it might mean
to **replace the structure of anarchy** with an international or world
political order that is **supposedly 'more' ethical**]{.underline}. If
ethics is inextricably interlinked with the structural conditions of
survival, then [[any attempt to challenge]{.mark} neo[realism]{.mark}
from **an 'ethical' perspective** [must]{.mark} do so [by **replacing
one**]{.mark} **structure of [survival with another]{.mark}**, and there
can be **[no guarantees]{.mark}** that [the new structure will be **less
violent**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While this does not in any way
prevent such attempts from being made, it does highlight the risky
nature of trying to resolve problems of war and violence in
international politics on ethical terms. For example, [the idea of
creating [a new]{.mark} form of political [community that
**transcends**]{.mark} **the exclusionary borders of states** may seem
**naturally desirable**]{.underline} (e.g. Linklater, 1982). [Yet,
regardless of **how sophisticated theories become** in terms of
**articulating the content** and **meaning** of such a community, there
can be **no guarantees** that [attempts]{.mark} to actualize it
**[will]{.mark} not [result in]{.mark} even [more violence]{.mark}**.
There are no guarantees]{.underline}, as John Mearsheimer (1994: 44)
puts it, [that 'a **[fascist discourse far more violent]{.mark} than
realism** [will]{.mark} not [emerge]{.mark} as the **new hegemonic
discourse**'.]{.underline} Moreover, it is important to point out that
the value of a neorealist ethics is not that it provides a 'coherent
ethical theory'. One interesting attempt to create such a theory is
found in Frost's (2009) Global Ethics: Anarchy, Freedom and
International Relations. For Frost, the point of developing a coherent
ethical theory is to demonstrate how international relations can be
grasped primarily in ethical terms, rather than as a struggle for power
and survival. His assumption is that 'to engage in international
relations at all ... is to make ethical claims for oneself and to
recognize the ethical standing of others' (Frost, 2009: 19). Frost links
his theory partly to the diverse practices that shape international
interactions, and partly to an 'ethical background theory which
justifies the whole set of rules which constitute the practice' (Frost,
2009: 27). While the background theory is based on an English
School-inspired notion of the anarchic system/society of states, the
practices added to it have the potential to shape international
relations in a direction that is ethically desirable. Arguing for and
against the ethical standing of our interlocutors, 'we construct and
reconstruct the social practices within which international relations
are conducted' (Frost, 2009: 94). The main goal of these practices,
according to Frost, should be nothing less than resolving the tensions
within the current international system between citizen rights and
global human rights (Frost, 2009: ch. 3). In contrast to cosmopolitan
theories, however, he argues that this goal is attainable within the
anarchic structure of the system, through the ethical adjustment of that
system (Frost, 2009: 113). This adjustment involves renegotiating the
relationship between citizen rights and human rights through practice.
Frost (2009: 173) writes: 'Participants in global civil society and the
society of states need to take their own values seriously and need to
attempt to make them real for everybody everywhere'. [According to
Frost,]{.underline} [the **segregating borders of states** are thus
meant to **persist**, while the **violent forms of
exclusion**]{.underline} that these borders enable [are to **gradually
fall away** through the aspiration of [a **common** ]{.mark}**goal [that
embraces everybody everywhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From the
perspective of my reading of a neorealist ethics, however, [the notion
of a **common universal** goal underpinning Frost's ethical theory
[is]{.mark} not only **impossible**, but also **[undesirable]{.mark}**.
This is [not because the **ideal**]{.mark} **itself** [is
'**bad**']{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, it is because [[it is]{.mark}
**precisely [the absence of a]{.mark} common [goal beyond segregating
borders that makes ethic]{.mark}al negotiation [possible]{.mark}** in
the first place.]{.underline} [As soon as such an ideal has been
**formulated**, and the **guidelines for how to attain it** have been
**articulated**, the **incalculable future** in which the encounter
between self and other is allowed to play out is **cancelled
out**]{.underline}. As previously noted, [while this encounter might
result in **more** or **less violence**, it is the uncertainty of the
future that **makes the encounter possible** in the first
place.]{.underline} Frost's [attempt to formulate a **universal ethical
ideal** that **embraces everyone everywhere** while, at the same time,
**retaining the**]{.underline} segregating borders of the
[**international system** is thus **problematic**]{.underline}. The
primary reason for this, then, is that in articulating a universal
ethical ideal, his theory works to undermine the conditions of
international life. In brief, what Frost fails to recognize is that
[what makes international ethics possible is also what makes impossible
the **aspiration of a universal ethical ideal** that is **applicable to
everybody everywhere**]{.underline} --- like that of a perfect alignment
of citizen rights and human rights. [Rather than seeking to **resolve
these tensions**, the tensions should be **kept alive**. Only in this
way can we, moreover, maintain a **distinctly international ethics**
without reverting to a '**global ethics**']{.underline}. For [the
latter]{.underline} to make any sense, it [has to be based on ideals
that **transcend**]{.underline} the **[borders]{.underline}** of states,
whether those ideals are linked to a specific goal or just to a general
attitude of openness to political negotiation and contestation
(Hutchings, 2010: 215). [Irrespective of **what precisely they are
supposed to entail**, the ideals associated with a global ethics
**become problematic** as soon as the attempt is made to **transform
difference** and the **plurality of wills into one and the same
will**]{.underline}. It is problematic for the same reason that
philosophical attempts to create a new metaphysics that is supposed to
resolve the violence of metaphysics. [Such attempts **can only have as
their aim** the **ultimate destruction** of the **very possibility of
philosophical thought**]{.underline} and writing, [which]{.underline},
per definition, [are **metaphysical** and therefore
**violent**]{.underline} (see Derrida, 1978). The temporal horizon of
neorealism [To argue against the desirability of universal ethical
ideals is]{.underline}, essentially, [to **recognize the importance of
finitude** for thinking about international ethics]{.underline}. Waltz's
neorealist [**conception of international anarchy** and of the **desire
of states to survive** therein offers one way of **affirming this notion
of international ethics**. This is **not to say**]{.underline}, however,
[that international anarchy]{.underline} in Waltz's theory [should be
seen as a **perfect ideal** that all politics and ethics **must aspire
to maintain**]{.underline}. In order for my deconstructive approach to
the ethics of neorealism to make any sense, [the international must also
be seen as **something finite** and **deconstructible**, rather than as
an **end in itself**]{.underline}. To think of the finitude of the
international, [we **do not have to look** for something that
'**transcends**' or comes '**after**' the international, like a **world
government** or **cosmopolitan community**]{.underline}.18 [[We]{.mark}
only [have to]{.mark} focus on the principles that]{.underline},
according to Waltz, [are meant to **[keep]{.mark} the international
order [alive]{.mark}**: the **structure of [anarchy]{.mark}** and
**states' desire to survive**]{.underline}. While these are mutually
dependent, [they]{.underline} also [point to a situation in which the
struggle to stay alive **might threaten the system** in which this
struggle takes place]{.underline}. To illustrate this point,
[consider]{.underline} the issue of **[nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**, which Waltz controversially saw as a possible
method of creating a more peaceful international order (see Waltz,
1990b). For Waltz, [**[only if]{.mark} nuclear [catastrophe
remains]{.mark} a [real]{.mark} possibility** [will states need
to]{.mark} **actively [deter the]{.mark} nuclear
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19 Thus, [nuclear deterrence 'works'
**only if nuclear war remains a constant possibility**, hence only
insofar as the problem of nuclear war is **not permanently
resolved**]{.underline} (Waltz, 1990b: 743--744). [[What creates]{.mark}
the possibility of [nuclear war constitutes]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
this sense, [[the **conditions of**]{.mark} **international security**
and [**peace**. What makes]{.mark} the prospect of nuclear war different
from other wars is]{.underline}, of course, [the **planetary scale** on
which its effects are likely to be felt]{.underline}. As such, [it poses
a threat]{.underline} not only to individual states, but also [to the
**entire system of states**]{.underline}. On this point, there is
another parallel to be drawn between Waltz and Derrida, for whom
[[apocalyptic discourses]{.underline}]{.mark} on nuclear war are
interesting because they highlight 'the absolute effacement of any
possible trace' (Derrida, 1984c: 28). Hence, these discourses [**[raise
the stakes]{.mark} of survival [even further]{.mark}** [by pointing to
the **finitude of everything that lives**]{.mark}, as well as to all
those attempts at **keeping the apocalypse at bay**, **deferring it
through deterrence**]{.underline} and so on (Derrida, 1984d: 29).
Understood as a global threat to the entire international order, nuclear
war highlights the temporal horizon of the whole neorealist project as
conceived by Waltz. This is the horizon of the horizon, or the structure
of the structure, which gives meaning to the 'international' as a finite
as opposed to infinite category shaping the behaviour of states. [Rather
than **simply reaffirming a static world-view**, which **perpetually
reproduces itself** in a circular fashion]{.underline}, Waltz puts
forward a notion of [the international]{.underline} that [is **both
finite** and **mortal**. The international continues to live
on]{.underline} in this sense, [but only on the condition that it is
**exposed to the threat of coming to an end**]{.underline}. Other
examples of how the international system may come to an end relate to
the increased impact of global capital and global warming. While these
are often depicted as typical examples of transnational phenomena, they
nevertheless emanate from a system in which states are free to make
sovereign decisions, for example, on how to deregulate the emissions of
pollutants and financial markets. [Individual states are]{.underline}
thus [free to actively contribute to setting in motion processes that
might put an end to the system that conditions their
survival]{.underline}. In this way, [there is a **self-destructive
potential** built into the system, which threatens to **make it collapse
from within** and **on its own terms**]{.underline} (see also Frost,
2009: 163--168). Crucially, the self-destructive potential of
international politics does not contradict Waltz's theory. After all, he
argues that [the system **shapes**, **not determines**, state
behaviour]{.underline}. He recognizes that [as long as states interact
within an anarchic structure, they are **simultaneously free** and
**insecure**]{.underline}. This freedom and insecurity mean that
[survival in international politics **can never become a predictable
science** that is able to '**remove the uncertainty of
politics**']{.underline} (Waltz, 1990a: 37). [Sometimes, the struggle to
survive **does more harm than good** to the ones seeking to survive.
Sometimes, this struggle may even set in motion processes the effects of
which will be **felt on a planetary scale**, provoking an **irreversible
decay** of the entire system of sovereign states.]{.underline}
Conclusion The ethics of neorealism, as argued in this article, stems
from the mutual interaction of the two core themes of Waltz's theory:
[the **structure of anarchy** and **states' desire to
survive**]{.underline}. Together, they [affirm]{.underline} Derrida's
notion of [the **violent opening of ethics**: the opening to a future
that makes new life possible while exposing everything that lives to
finitude and the threat of erasure. Ethics and violence
are]{.underline}, thus, [**inextricably interlinked**, which means that
any attempt to immunize the former from the latter is **untenable**.
Before any **moral obligations**, and before any **normative
commitments**, the ethics of neorealism addresses the **more fundamental
problem** of what it means for states to live and be free in a system
that guarantees nothing]{.underline}. In this way, Waltzian [neorealism
articulates the **basic conditions of international life**, which **all
attempts to theorize international ethics**]{.underline}, either by
remaining 'within' the international system or by arguing in favour of
its transcendence, **[must come to terms with]{.underline}**. One of the
main challenges that springs from my reading of the ethics of neorealism
relates to how [[universal ethical ideals]{.mark} not only become
**impossible to achieve in the practical sense**, but are also
**fundamentally undesirable**]{.underline}. They are undesirable because
[the desire to fulfil them **[undermines the conditions that
make]{.mark} international [life possible]{.mark} in the first
place**]{.underline}. On this basis, a whole range of [**attempts to
theorize the meaning** and **implications** of international ethics,
which]{.underline} in various ways [hold on to the notion of **ethical
ideals beyond the violence of inter-state relations** within an anarchic
structure, become **untenable**]{.underline}. This even includes
classical realism and the thought of Morgenthau, whose sharp distinction
between ethical desirability and political possibility dissolves in
light of the neorealist ethics presented in this article. According to
this notion of ethics, then, [the desirable **cannot be placed beyond
political possibility** since it **essentially is political
possibility**]{.underline}: the possibility of whatever happens in the
interaction among states in the structure of anarchy. As was pointed out
in the penultimate section of this article, there is also a temporal
horizon of neorealism. This horizon is best illustrated by the threat of
**[[nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [highlights the **possible
end of the entire**]{.underline} international political [**system**.
The threat of nuclear war demonstrates why this system, just like the
state, ought to be seen as a **finite** as opposed to **infinite
category**. Stressing the finitude of the system [means that there is
**no metaphysical truth**]{.mark}, moral or otherwise, [to which
it]{.mark} either [**can** or **should conform**. It]{.mark} also [means
that there is **always space**, and **time**, for]{.mark} an **ongoing
ethical-political [negotiation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the latter
might very well include efforts to produce a 'lesser violence', its main
force is that of a perpetual coming of the future. [As long as this
future is **allowed to play out**, there is]{.underline}, I believe,
[**reason to be optimistic**: optimistic not about the **possible
fulfilment of universal ethical ideals**, but about the **future
itself**, and **whatever it holds for international life**.]{.underline}

if they can't explain [everything]{.underline} states do. The aff can't

The previous section documented how [[social variables]{.mark} **might**
be taken [as]{.mark} having the **potential** to transform international
politics]{.underline}. This section now turns to an explanation of why
[it is]{.underline} so [**hard to fulfill** such seeming
transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly [state interests]{.mark},
they [are]{.mark} **necessarily [subordinate]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
political **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as a sovereign entity with
control over its own foreign policy), "physiological"
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the safety from death and harm of
the state's population), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a baseline level of which is
necessary to ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and
its population do not exist, it **cannot achieve anything
else**]{.underline}---such as fulfilling a social role or expressing a
cultural identity---either.36 And since survival, security, and
prosperity all have a material base---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump
materialism" (he simply does not think the material base yields
determinate outcomes)---so too must states necessarily put the defense
of such interests ahead of social role fulfillment if they want to be in
a position to play any sort of role in future.37 [[That is **not to
suggest** that states **do not**]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes---or,
indeed, often---[[make ideationally driven]{.mark} foreign policy
[choices]{.mark} that are **detrimental** to their other interests. [It
is]{.mark} simply a description of [states' **incentive structure**,
which **much of the time** they]{.mark} end up
[follow]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.

[It is necessary]{.underline} at this point [to defend the notion that
[there is]{.mark}, in fact, [a **material base independent of the social
world**]{.mark} and [that]{.mark} characteristics of that material base
[can yield **causal outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all,
[military technology does not descend as **manna from heaven**, but
rather is created via **human agency** in response to perceived
threats]{.underline}, and thus it necessarily contains a dose of
military culture and broader social identity from the outset. The same
goes for the overall share of national economic resources allocated to
defense, and indeed, money itself is a socially constructed store of
value, albeit one premised upon underlying materially underpinned
wealth.38 Any assessment of strategic priorities is necessarily filtered
through the strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the
assessing; asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of
sea denial versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an
answer infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its
role in the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth.
The broader question of whether the sea--- like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation.

Even technologies with such seemingly self-evident destructive power as
nuclear weapons are not self-evidently "good" or "bad," either morally
or strategically, absent social interpretation. One might see them as
"bad" because of the potential humanitarian consequences of their use
(or because of the constraints they impose on conventional military
options), or "good" because of the casualties in conventional war they
prevent (and deterrence that they enable at low relative cost). Their
political meaning is thus socially constructed, even if the
physiological effects on human bodies of their detonation have only one
possible outcome. If military technology and resources require a social
component to be both developed and meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's
contention that there is indeed a "rump" material base but that it is
simply indeterminate---in the absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as
a cause of international outcomes becomes alluring.39

Crucially, however, [each of these social choices involves a **decisive
material effect** that is **not open to interpretation**. It may be
debatable whether nuclear weapons are "**good**" or "**bad**," but the
**effect** that one will have]{.underline} on the city and its
population of frail, carbon-based human animals over which it detonates
[represents a **single**, **determinate outcome**]{.underline}---and a
state facing another state armed with them must therefore make certain
necessary calculations based around that capability.40 In the same vein,
[while]{.underline} the [strategic threat/opportunity]{.underline}
constituted by geographical features, such as the oceanic moats enjoyed
by the United States and United Kingdom, [may be a matter of
interpretation, the **underlying material
factor**]{.underline}---humans' inability to cross water without
spending resources on capital (ships) that could otherwise have been
spent on further ground forces---[yields certain **necessary
outcomes**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the very **foundation** of relations
between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---secure second-strike
nuclear deterrence and its disincentivization of conventional
aggression41---[rests on a physical "**fact**"]{.underline}: the
relative impenetrability of water to the electro-magnetic spectrum and
the associated survivability that it provides to ballistic missile
submarines.

[The same goes for the decision over what **share of**]{.underline}
national economic [**resources** to allocate to defense. Choosing a
proportion may indeed be a **socially** and **ideationally informed
political choice**, but the **underlying size** of the resource
pools]{.underline}---and the military potentiality that they underpin---
rests on the total size of the state's capital stock (both human and
physical), which [is **not a matter of social
interpretation**]{.underline}. And while military technology is indeed
developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within the
technical bounds of the feasible. Such rebuttals apply more widely:
[[while the balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}, including resources
and technology, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed necessarily
[[interpreted through]{.mark} states' [social lenses, it]{.mark}
nonetheless **[conditions]{.mark} the bounds of [the possible]{.mark}**
even in the absence of social content]{.underline}. And when those
possibilities include hostile use, certain behaviors are necessitated by
prudent states seeking survival for their populations.

Realists should indeed be castigated if they infer predictions solely
from the balance of currently existing military hardware---a thin and
intellectually impoverished understanding of relative power---and
critics are correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not
the same as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done, in line with the behavioral output understanding of
power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from the input
understanding).42 But [[viewing]{.mark} total [state power in terms of
**overall assets**]{.mark}]{.underline}, defined as the state's total
stock of physical,43 financial,44 and human capital,45 [[does a **better
job** of]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[encompassing]{.mark} all the
**[relevant resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}---equipment, stores of
value, human bodies and brains---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, second,
[[providing an **effective measurable proxy** for the **underlying
causes** of behavioral power]{.underline}]{.mark} (given that [the
latter can only be observed **ex post**, and is therefore **not an
effective predictor** of outcomes]{.underline}). [[None of this is to
**deny**]{.mark} that there is [a **social element**]{.mark} to the
construction of all these power resources]{.underline}, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. [It is simply to point
out]{.underline}, rather, [that [states' power]{.mark} resources [and
their effects are **not wholly socially constructed**]{.mark} and that
the nonsocial element **produces certain effects**]{.underline}.

Turning to specific arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion
that achieving a particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a
certain international-social role might be a goal of states is
relatively uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent
constructivist work on Britain's pursuit of international status
suggests at the outset that states' social roles are not the same as
their interests, ambitions, values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work
later asserts that social role actually produces national interests,
thus implying that states cannot in fact have interests besides those
constituted by identity.48 Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a
theoretical dilemma: the more minimal former assertion is the harder to
refute, yet the more ambitious latter claim is necessary if
constructivists are to escape the realist retort that fulfilling a
social role is merely an interest of states---and a subordinate one to
materially underpinned survival at that---rather than the interest.
Escaping this retort is in turn necessary if constructivists are to be
able to claim that anarchy is indeed what states make of it socially,
since transforming the prevailing culture of anarchy would require
states to lower their guard against each other---and thus accept higher
risk to their survival, at least while the hoped-for transformation was
taking place---in pursuit of an international-social value.

The less contentious point---that playing a particular social role is
one of multiple interests---opens the way to conceding that the most
fundamental state interests remain "political" survival (of state
territory and institutions), "biological" security (of the citizenry's
bodies), and preserving some baseline level of economic prosperity,
since a state that cannot survive cannot achieve anything else. But if
that is the case, then from these materially underpinned vital interests
follows a need to be capable of defending them against potential
foes---and that, if it comes to it, means accomplishing certain military
missions.49 Such military capability is necessarily underpinned by
material resources, even as it also has a socially constructed
dimension. Such capability can be provided independently (internal
balancing), via allies (external balancing), or through some combination
of the two---prudent strategy, including eschewing avoidable
confrontation and aligning with the preferences of powerful allies, is a
key aspect of state success50---but either way, it rests on some
friendly actor's underlying resources. And reliance on external
balancing brings its own dangers, as recently experienced by European
NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51

In short, [such an analysis]{.underline}---while conceding that social
role and status are important to states, all else held equal, and that
such concerns sometimes drive them to act in imprudent
ways---nonetheless [suggests that hedging]{.underline} against
abandonment, coercion, or outright destruction [via balance-of-power
positioning is **likely to remain pervasive**. This is **not to say**
that there will not be variation in the **extent** and **severity** of
such competition. All manner of ideational variables might exacerbate or
reduce tensions]{.underline}, as discussed above, and even in the
absence of such social forces, overt, intensive competition may yield
self-destructive outcomes if it increases another side's insecurity and
causes them to adopt a more offensively capable strategic posture in
response.52 [The point]{.underline}, rather, [is simply that conflict
will never be a **wholly absent possibility** and that that reality
**must condition states' calculations**]{.underline}---often to the
point of some level of defensive hedging, if the state has the resources
and technology to make that feasible---even in times of broadly
cooperative relations.

[[A similar retort can be made against the claims]{.mark} that threat
perception and military [doctrine are]{.mark} both [so]{.mark}
**fundamentally [skewed]{.mark}** [by culture that they may be]{.mark}
**commonly** and **wholly [disconnected]{.mark}** [from balance-of-power
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for an end
to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition. While
this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive review, the
success of many states--- particularly resource-rich ones---in aping
military technological and professional best practice would seem to
suggest that much of the time states are able to achieve what Gray,
borrowing from marketing theory, dubs "good enough" force postures in
the face of strategic uncertainty.53 Similarly, when states do "die" in
the face of foreign aggression---a rare occurrence in post-1945
international politics---it is more often as a consequence of their
relative military weakness and geographical vulnerability than as a
consequence of a failure to perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key
contribution of the neoclassical realist research program has been to
demonstrate that [while domestic-political variables may **filter
strategic behavior** in multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are
still **underlying balance-of-power structural pressures** at the
international-systemic level that states **usually respond to**, even if
they do so **belatedly** or **imperfectly**]{.underline}.55 In short,
while Waltzian "socialization" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine may frequently be hindered---and
sometimes terminally compromised---by cultural factors, [[as a
description of]{.mark} the **workings of [the international
system]{.mark}** as a whole]{.underline} (as he intended his theory to
be), [[realist predictions]{.mark} of enduring concern and possible
competition over the distribution of material power [are **not
undermined** by]{.mark}]{.underline} this recognition.56 Tellingly,
despite their strong **[[ideational commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}**
toward democracy promotion and human rights enforcement under the banner
of upholding international order, Western states have recently had the
reprioritization of balancing against increasingly capable rivals forced
upon them by developments in the balance of power, whether that be
China's rise in Asia for the United States or Russia's (partial)
resurgence in Europe for the rest of NATO.57

Finally, [even **[national identity]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
**[nationalism]{.underline}** it engenders---the ideational "master
variable" underpinning the nation-state system---[[is]{.mark} itself
[forged by]{.mark} the interaction of **political group identity** and
the **survival imperative** under structural anarchy]{.underline}. To
paraphrase Tilly, [war **makes the state**, and the state **makes
war**]{.underline}.58 [Modern nation-states may have **originated** as
political groups of individually weak human beings with some shared
identity connection, but their choice to **form states** as protective
war machines capable of generating]{.underline} the military
[power]{.underline} necessary [to defend]{.underline} against similar
political units, [and the subsequent mutual reinforcement of national
identity and state strength, is **very much consistent** with realism's
predictions of [the **consequences of**]{.mark} **international
[structural anarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, as noted earlier,
Mearsheimer uses these grounds to argue that nationalism and realism are
mutually supportive theories.59 In the post-- Cold War world, moreover,
mutually threatening political groups' need to generate the military
power necessary for security under anarchy---the security dilemma, in
short---helps to explain the explosion of ferocious ethnonationalist and
sectarian conflict within and between the new states emerging from the
collapse of previously multiethnic communist federations, secular Middle
Eastern autocracies, and so forth.60 Such conflict has in turn forged
the identity of the states and state-like entities emerging from it. In
short, [while it is **certainly not impossible** for national identities
to shift]{.underline}, as noted above, [the **process** of their
generation nonetheless suggests that they are **endogenous** to---rather
than **readily capable of exogenously shifting** to
transform---international systemic security competition and
balance-of-power positioning]{.underline}, that they are as much a
dependent variable as an independent variable.

Uncertainty and the Menacing Shadow of the Future

The previous section outlined why some of the otherwise most convincing
[constructivist variables]{.underline} at work in international politics
nevertheless [**cannot promise** to transform international politics
away from a world of "**realist**," **security-motivated
balance-of-power positioning**]{.underline}. This section turns to
discuss why [this is something that social variables will **continue to
struggle with** as long as there is an international
system]{.underline}.

[The **principal barrier** to states ever setting aside their
inclination to guard against each other and instead embrace each other
as "friends"---**no matter how strong** their]{.underline} leaders' or
citizens' [desire to **transform the culture** of international
anarchy---is **uncertainty** over others' intentions]{.underline},
particularly their future intentions.61 Following the logic of the
prisoners' dilemma, a state62 that trusts that another means it no harm
while the other state concludes that it now has an opportunity to pursue
advantage may be punished severely for its complacency, rendering such
trust perilous, particularly in security affairs, where defection from
cooperation could result in the end of the "game" for one party.63

The meaning and implications of this "uncertainty" assumption merit
consideration, however. Human beings are constantly trying to impose
certainty on a contingent world via cognitive heuristics and neural
shortcuts, for the sake of their own mental well-being.64 Indeed, since
humans derive meaning and value from the self-imposed certainty of
ideational reinforcement, so too they can derive benefit from the
entrenchment of both amity with and enmity against "others," even when
this creates other complications and dangers.65 As a result, much of
international politics is influenced by habit, both the habit of
friendship and the habit of animosity.66 "Uncertainty" also means
different things to different people: for realists, it is a condition
from which to infer fear about others' possible behavior; for
constructivists, by contrast, it may simply refer to the inherent
indeterminacy of information until it is imbued with social content.67
It may be possible to build trust in others' benign intent over time and
thereby escape security competition, meanwhile, through their costly
signaling: forgoing capabilities and policy options that a potential
aggressor would not want to do without.68 States can also have the
certain "friendship" of those with whom they are balancing against a
third-party threat, and if that threat is long-lived, then so too may be
the certainty of alliance.69

Illustrating this "uncertainty about uncertainty,"70 consider one of the
highest profile oft-invoked security dilemmas: the Cold War escalation
of U.S.-Soviet hostility, during which the most seminal security dilemma
theorization took place.71 Robert Jervis---one of the concept's foremost
progenitors---subsequently questioned whether the Cold War can be
understood as a security dilemma after all, understood as a tragic cycle
of mutual threat between nonrevisionist security seekers driven by
uncertainty over the other's intentions. Neither side was "uncertain"
over whether the other was an adversary. And as subsequent archival
revelations document, each side did want to destroy the other, and
correctly inferred as much of its opponent.72

Jervis's "recantation" of the Cold War-as-security-dilemma is itself
bounded, however, and this bounding sheds light on the ways in which
varieties of uncertainty can still operate even between states with
"certain" mutual intent. "Greedy" states versus "security-seeking"
states are themselves binary ideal types that mask an underlying
spectrum. Practically all states are greedy, in terms of wanting to
improve their lot, if the costs are low enough.73 Conversely, few states
are greedy to the point of total unconcern for security; not even Nazi
Germany desired limitless global war. While there may not have been
uncertainty over each side's Cold War intent, therefore---enmity-driven
desire to defeat and ultimately destroy the other---there was still
uncertainty over underlying motivations. 74 A desire to exterminate an
enemy population may entail quite different behavior than a desire for
ideological supremacy, for example, and the two may therefore merit
different policy responses, even though both fall within the domain of
"hostile" intent. Such doubt over motivations---even within the
cognitively "certain" domain of U.S.-Soviet enmity---still added up to a
variety of security dilemma: [[the **most salient question**]{.mark} for
Americans [was not "**is the Soviet Union an enemy?**" bu]{.mark}t
rather "[**what might Moscow do** about situation X, in Y circumstances,
at time Z?"]{.mark} The same is evident]{.underline} in major power
politics [today. Washington is not "uncertain" over whether or not China
and Russia are its "adversaries,"]{.underline} defined in broad and
obvious terms, [but there is a **high degree of uncertainty** over what
**types** of rivals they represent and their **associated future
strategic choices**. Recognition of uncertainty's nonbinary
nature]{.underline}, in short, [**does not undermine** the argument that
states' inability to know others' future behavior with perfect
reliability **incentivizes them to worry** about possible future
dangers]{.underline}. Realists disagree over prospects for avoiding
security competition through signaling motivations, of course,75 but all
variants are united by recognizing the enduring significance of the
balance of material power.76

On top of these qualifications to the uncertainty-over-intentions
assumption come disagreements over the most appropriate response to such
uncertainty. [Conceding that we can never know another state's future
intentions with mathematical certainty, and therefore that the
worst-case outcome]{.underline}---surprise attack by a concealed
aggressor---[will always remain a hypothetical possibility **does
not**]{.underline} necessarily [**imply** that security is **maximized**
by treating such a scenario as **likely**]{.underline}. Provoking war
for fear of possible future war is like committing suicide for fear of
death, and given the balancing often generated by hostile behavior,
provoking others into uniting against oneself through attempted power
maximization can ultimately reduce one's security.77 [While worst-case
contingencies **always merit consideration**, [policy
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly decisions over how much of
the national resource base to devote to defense ("guns") versus
consumption and productive investment ("butter")78---[[**necessitates
probabilistic calculations** of]{.mark} the relative dangers of
**[overarmament]{.mark}**]{.underline} (provoking balancing alongside
domestic economic immiseration) [[versus
**underarmament**]{.underline}]{.mark} (attack by a better-armed
adversary).79 Intense security competition can therefore be an
irrational and self-defeating response to mere uncertainty over future
intentions, in the absence of other threat data.80 Both "realist" and
"constructivist" variables can feature among this threat data and
therefore play a crucial part in determining the optimal strategic
response to such intentions uncertainty, and that in turn conditions
whether the potential threat posed by each side's capabilities, be they
latent or realized, manifests itself as a security dilemma. For many
realists, the offense-defense balance of technology and geography
determines whether uncertainty over others' intentions merits military
confrontation and determines the (in)stability of states' strategic
relations.81 For constructivists, the solidarity/enmity borne of
sociocultural similarity/difference may be equally decisive.

But [**neither** of these observations---that uncertainty neither
carries a single meaning nor prescribes a single strategy---undermines
the **core claim** that survival has a **material base** that
necessitates **continual security-motivated concern** for one's position
in the balance of power. Survival may]{.underline} indeed [be
"**multiply realizable**,"]{.underline} with social/ideational variables
informing the path taken, alongside various "realist" variables.
[But]{.underline} given all [states']{.underline} need to safeguard a
materially based hierarchy of interests without wholesale reliance on
others' politically contingent (and therefore capricious)
benevolence---whether that be potential abandonment by erstwhile allies,
potential attack by erstwhile neutrals, or potential coercion by
either---their [position in the balance of power will **always remain
relevant** to their future security]{.underline}. And [given that
situation, the conditions for **mutual threat** and an associated
**security dilemma** to re-emerge are **unlikely to be permanently
expunged**]{.underline}, despite such a deterioration going unrealized
indefinitely in many cases due to other overlying factors.82 [Fear of
future conflict]{.underline}---at least against some state, if not
against any specific state---thus [remains an **endemic feature** of
international politics]{.underline}. And much of that is still down to
the enduring concerns of structurally based realism:
international-systemic anarchy, its absence of a reliable sovereign
enforcer of global peace, and the associated dangers of offensively
capable peers of unreliably benevolent intent.

Tellingly, while many contemporary states have achieved mutual
"friendship," they have rarely sustained it once the strategic factors
holding them together---such as alliance against a mutual threat, shared
membership of a great(er) power's dependency network, or some other
mutually beneficial exchange---have disappeared. This suggests that such
"friendship" is as much a dependent variable (an outcome of realist
balancing behavior) as an independent variable (a transformational force
in international politics).83 Even within the zone of friendship that
had come to characterize the European "community" by the late 1980s, for
example---probably the deepest case of intersubjective recognition,
cooperation, and sovereignty pooling to date---Britain and France still
worried intensely about the potential power imbalances created by German
reunification, and they were not content until reunified German power
was subordinated via a restated US commitment to NATO.84 As noted
previously, moreover, via both Trump and Brexit---ideationally motivated
shifts in foreign policy orientation85---Euro-Atlantic security
relations have recently displayed a dramatic backsliding, raising the
specter of alliance breakdown and coercive confrontation. The relative
power of all sides is critical to their ability to resist/dispense such
coercion and safeguard future security even in the possible absence of
alliance support. Even within the EU, the ability of members to resist
or dispense coercion comes down to relative power: witness Greece's
experience at German hands in the context of the Eurozone crisis, and
contrast it with the lack of sanction for Franco-German breaches of EU
rules.86 And between NATO and Russia, a 1990s moment of optimism over
developing friendship has retrenched to coercive confrontation as an
outcome of each other's choices.87 All these developments---which can be
interpreted as negative movement along the spectrum between cooperation
and conflict---illustrate the continuing centrality of relative power to
safeguarding a hierarchy of national interests without dependence on the
changeable commitments of others.

As a consequence, [[the **base conditions** for the security dilemma
will **always exist**]{.mark} between sovereign states under anarchy,
[even if it lies]{.mark}]{.underline} wholly
**[[dormant]{.underline}]{.mark}** for most states most of the time,
thanks to overlying factors. [Interstate [friendship does not]{.mark}
render deterioration to [a security dilemma **impossible**, and neither
does]{.mark} interstate [animosity **preclude**]{.mark}]{.underline}
stable and durable **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.88 [So while
identity---which]{.underline} in any case [is "**sticky**" and **slow to
change**---certainly matters to security relations, it is **unlikely to
trump** some combination of **power** and **informational
variables**]{.underline}.89 Of course, if international relations were
transformed by the emergence of a single world-state, the system would
no longer be anarchic and the units-formerly-known-asstates would not
need to rely on relative power for their security, and thus such
competition would end.90 That requirement, however, does not look likely
to be fulfilled anytime soon.

Conclusion

[Conflict and cooperation is not some binary "**either/or**" condition,
but]{.underline} rather [a **spectrum**]{.underline}. So too the
[security concerns]{.underline} borne of uncertainty over motivations
[are not some irreversible "on/off" switch]{.underline}, be that
permanently severe or permanently solved. There is certainly far more
peace in the world than the most pessimistic readings of realism would
seem to imply,91 and ideational similarity and solidarity---as well as
the power and informational variables beloved of realists---clearly have
something to do with this. [[Interests]{.underline}]{.mark} within the
parameters of continuing to survive [[are **socially
constituted**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and even the route to survival
itself represents an ideationally informed choice. [[But]{.mark} the
need to safeguard [a]{.mark} **[material]{.mark}ly underpinned
[hierarchy of interests]{.mark}** if states are to continue to
exist]{.underline}---a necessary prerequisite to performing any kind of
social role---[still [incentivizes]{.mark} them to **value their
position** in the [balance of power as a
**safeguard**]{.mark}]{.underline} against future dangers. Of course,
[[states **can** and **do** disregard certain incentive
structures]{.mark} in favor of others]{.underline}.92 [[But until
**all** states]{.mark} are known to [have done so---a **high
bar**]{.mark} **indeed**---[the potential for security competition to
re-emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} in the international system
[[will]{.mark} **continue to [exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And knowing
that, states will continue to prize the capabilities to provide for
their own security . . . and so on, creating enduring conditions for
security dilemmas to one day reappear, even though they go overlain by
other factors in most international relationships most of the time.

Both realists and constructivists therefore have work to do, in terms of
both refining their paradigmatic cores and recognizing the necessity of
analytically eclectic cross-pollination [to explain many of the **most
pressing questions** of real-world international politics]{.underline}.
Realists must do more to incorporate identity as a variable that
produces systemically significant variation in behavior rather than as
some adjunct bolt-on, whether that be via the post-1990s boom of
neoclassical theorization or attempts at microfoundationally elaborated
structural realism.93 Porter's work on the interaction of power and
habit in determining US grand strategy is a good recent example,
while---as noted earlier---Snyder's Myths of Empire remains a key
benchmark.94 Constructivists, for their part, must continue to
investigate the relationship between states' potentially infinite array
of socially constituted interests, their materially underpinned
hierarchy of core survival requirements, and the enduring concern for
relative power that the latter generates. Along the way, [both sides
must be **circumspect** in their appeals to allegedly "**smoking-gun**"
examples]{.underline}. For realists to claim that structure alone
explains World War II or the Cold War, for example--- missing the
universalist ideologies of German Nazism, Soviet communism, or US
liberalism---would be a stretch indeed. Equally, constructivists' most
beloved examples---amicable US-Canadian relations along an easily
passable land border, the relative underarmament of Germany and Japan,
greater American fear of a few North Korean atomic bombs than hundreds
of British thermonuclear warheads, the rise of European Union, and so
forth---can all be readily explained with reference to balances of
capability and information. "Analytic eclecticism" is easy to profess,
but the most pressing contemporary questions of world politics require
that theorists practice it too.

[For those **not interested** in resolving **paradigm wars** or
"**isms**" debates]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the intersection of
**material-structural pressures** on state behavior with socially
constituted foreign policy preferences **provides ample scope** for
investigating **crucial real-world questions** of our time]{.underline}.
Viewed in rationalist terms, this might involve investigating the role
of social variables in informing leaders' utility functions, and thus
their preference orderings under the overall structural constraint of
needing to ensure continued survival. Just how far could the United
States meddle in the Middle East at the behest of domestic interests,
for example, before it critically harmed its power position vis-à-vis
China? Extending the previous point, has US unipolarity created unique
space for a "crazy" foreign policy that disregards the balance of
power---both by the United States itself and by close US allies---and
will this change if or when unipolarity wanes?95 Relatedly, just how far
can the likes of Germany and Japan sustain their pacifistic foreign
policy orientations in the face of US relative decline or disengagement
and the likely associated need for them to provide more for their own
security? Changing tack, how does a small power like Sweden---say---make
its trade-off between providing mobile forces for an EU Battlegroup (a
cause it values), on the one hand, and maintaining large amounts of
conscripts and armor on its eastern border to hedge against Russia (a
threat that it cannot be rid of), on the other? Are UK efforts to
rebrand as an "aid superpower" facilitated by a nuclear deterrent and
the US alliance, say, providing leeway to follow an ideational foreign
policy under the cover of a "good enough" military umbrella? In short,
[[there is scope for]{.mark} **any number** of midlevel
[theories]{.mark} of foreign policy [under the **constraint of**]{.mark}
**still [recognizing]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} interstate
[balance-of-power considerations]{.mark} **continue to

Although the majority of the left has condemned the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, the left camp's unity is still lacking. [We would like to
address those on the left who still stick to]{.underline} "[a plague on
both houses]{.underline}" [position that views the war as an
inter-imperialist war]{.underline}.

[[It is **high time**]{.mark} [the left]{.mark} [**woke up** and carried
out a]{.mark}]{.underline} "[**[concrete analysis]{.mark}** of the
**concrete situation**]{.underline}" [[instead of reproducing]{.mark}
**[worn-out frameworks]{.mark}** [from the Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Overlooking Russian imperialism is a
**terrible mistake**]{.mark} for the left]{.underline}. [[It is Putin,
**not NATO**]{.mark}, [who is waging war]{.mark} on
Ukraine]{.underline}. That is why [[it is
**essential**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to shift our focus from
Western]{.mark} imperialism [to Putin's **aggressive
imperialism**]{.mark}, which has an **ideological** and **political**
basis in addition to an economic one]{.underline}.

[Russian [imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline} consists of two elements.
Firstly, it [[involves **revisionist**]{.mark} **Russian
[nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [After 2012, [Putin]{.mark} and his
establishment [moved]{.mark} from a civic concept of the
nation]{.underline} (as rossiysky, "related to Russia") [[to an]{.mark}
**exclusive**, **[ethnic]{.mark}ally** based [concept of
**Russianness**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as russkiy, "ethnically/culturally
Russian"). [[His aggression]{.mark} in **2014** and in **2022** [was
**legitimized** by the return of]{.mark} "**[originally]{.mark}**"
[Russian lands]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [this concept
of]{.underline} ([ethnic]{.underline}) "[Russianness]{.underline}"
[revives the **nineteenth-century**]{.underline} [imperial concept of
the Russian nation, which reduces Ukrainian and Belarusian identity to
**regional identities**]{.underline}. [According to this view, Russians,
Belarusians, and Ukrainians are a **single people**]{.underline}.
[Employing [this]{.mark} concept in **official rhetoric**]{.underline}
[[implies the **negation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} independent
[Ukrainian statehood]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is why we cannot say
with any degree of certainty that Putin only wants the recognition of
Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the Donbas. Putin may desire to
either annex or subdue the whole of Ukraine, threats which appear in his
article "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians" and in his
speech on February 21, 2022. Finally, [the perspective of Ukraine-Russia
peace talks look rather bleak]{.underline}, as Russia's negotiation team
is headed by former Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, one of the
most dedicated believers in the ideology of russkiy mir (the ethnic
Russian world) --- [a world where]{.underline}, **[believe
us]{.underline}**, [**no one** will be happy]{.underline}.

Secondly, even though Putin's aggression is hard to explain rationally,
current events have demonstrated that it may be reasonable enough,
nevertheless, to take Russian imperialist rhetoric at face value.
[Russian [imperialism is fueled by the desire to **change**]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called "**[[world
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Thus, [[Putin's demand for NATO's
withdrawal from Eastern Europe]{.mark} may [signal]{.mark} that [Russia
may **not stop**]{.mark} with Ukraine, and **[Poland]{.mark}**,
**[Latvia]{.mark}**, **[Lithuania]{.mark}**, [or]{.mark}
**[Estonia]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may be the **next
targets**]{.underline}]{.mark} of Putin's aggression. [[It is]{.mark}
**very [naïve]{.mark}** [to demand to]{.mark}
**[demilitarize]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Eastern Europe, because in the
light of **current circumstances**]{.underline}, [[that will only be
**appeasing**]{.mark} [Putin and will make]{.mark} Eastern European
[countries]{.mark} **[vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Putin's
aggression. [[Discourse about **NATO expansion
obscures**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Putin's desire]{.underline}]{.mark} to
divide the spheres of influence in Europe between the US and Russia.
Being in the Russian sphere of influence means a country's political
subordination to Russia and subjection to the expansion of Russian
capital. The cases of Georgia and Ukraine demonstrate that Putin is
ready to use force to influence the political affairs of countries which
he believes wish to leave the Russian sphere of influence. It is
important to understand that [Putin's understanding of key agents in the
world order is **basically limited** to the **US** and
**China**]{.underline}. [He **does not recognize** other countries'
sovereignty]{.underline}, regarding them as satellites of one of these
agents of the international order.

[Putin and his establishment are very **cynical**]{.underline}. They use
the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, American intervention in Afghanistan,
and the invasion of Iraq as a shield for the bombing of Ukraine. In this
context, the left must show consistency and say no to all imperialist
aggression in the world. [Today the imperialist aggressor is Russia, not
NATO]{.underline}, and if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine, it will
definitely continue its aggression.

Furthermore, [we must have **no illusions** about [Putin's
regime]{.mark}. It [offers]{.mark} **[no alternative]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} Western [capitalism]{.mark}. [It is an
**authoritarian**]{.mark}, **[oligarchic
capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The level of **inequality**]{.mark}
in Russia [has]{.mark} **[risen significantly]{.mark}**]{.underline}
during the 20 years of his leadership. [[Putin is]{.mark} not only [an
**enemy** of the **working class**]{.mark}, but also an enemy to all
forms of **democracy**]{.underline}. [Popular participation]{.underline}
in politics and voluntary associations [is treated with
**suspicion**]{.underline} in Russia. [Putin is essentially an
**anti-Communist** and an enemy to everything the left]{.underline}
fought for in the twentieth century and [is fighting for]{.underline} in
the twenty-first. [[In his worldview]{.mark}, the strong have a **right
to beat** the weak, [the rich have the **right to exploit**]{.mark} the
poor, and strongmen in power have the **right to make decisions** on
behalf of their **disempowered population**.]{.underline} [This
worldview must be dealt a **severe blow** in Ukraine]{.underline}. [In
order [for]{.mark} **[political change]{.mark}** [to come about]{.mark}
inside of Russia, the [Russia]{.mark}n army **[must be
defeated]{.mark}** in Ukraine]{.underline}.

We want to address a highly controversial demand, that of military aid
to Ukraine. We understand the repercussions of militarization for the
progressive left movement worldwide and the left's resistance to NATO
expansion or Western intervention. However, more context is needed to
provide a fuller picture. First of all, NATO countries provided weapons
to Russia despite the 2014 embargo (France, Germany, Italy, Austria,
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and Spain). Thus, the
discussion about whether weapons sent to the region end up in the right
or wrong hands sounds a bit belated. They are already in bad hands, and
EU countries would only be righting their earlier wrongs by providing
weapons to Ukraine. Moreover, the alternative security guarantees that
the Ukrainian government has proposed require the involvement of a
number of countries, and probably can be achieved only with their
involvement, too. Secondly, as numerous articles have emphasized, the
Azov regiment is a problem. However, unlike in 2014, the far right is
not playing a prominent role in today's war, which has become a people's
war --- and [our comrades on the **anti-authoritarian left** of Ukraine,
Russia, and Belarus are fighting together **against
imperialism**]{.underline}. As has become clear in the last few days,
Russia is trying to compensate for its failure on the ground with air
attacks. Air **[defense]{.underline}** will not give Azov any additional
power, but it [will help Ukraine **keep control** of its territory and
**reduce civilian deaths**]{.underline} even if negotiations fail.

In our opinion, [[the Left should demand]{.underline}]{.mark}:

- [the immediate withdrawal of all Russian armed forces]{.underline}
  from Ukraine

- [**new** targeted, personal **sanctions**]{.underline} [on Putin and
  his multimillionaires]{.underline}. (It is important to understand
  that Putin and his establishment care only about their own private
  assets; they are oblivious to the state of the Russian economy
  overall. The left can also use this demand to expose the hypocrisy of
  those who sponsored Putin's regime and army and even now continue
  selling weapons to Russia)

- [the sanctioning of Russian **oil** and]{.underline}
  **[gas]{.underline}**

- [[increased **military support** to Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
  particular the provision of air defense systems

- the introduction of UN peacekeepers from non-NATO countries to protect
  civilians, including the protection of green corridors and the
  protection of nuclear power plants (Russia's veto in the UN Security
  Council can be overcome at the General Assembly)

The left should also support those Ukrainian leftists who are resisting,
giving them visibility, centering their voices, and supporting them
financially. We recognize that it is the millions of Ukrainian essential
workers and humanitarian aid volunteers who make further resistance
possible.

A number of other demands --- support for all refugees in Europe
regardless of citizenship, the cancellation of Ukraine's foreign debt,
sanctions against Russian oligarchs, etc. --- are broadly accepted on
the left and, therefore, we do not discuss them here.

[[The Russian invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine [sets]{.mark} a terrible
[precedent for]{.mark} the resolution of conflicts which involve the
risk of **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is why the Left must
come up with our own vision of international relations and the
architecture of international security which may include multilateral
nuclear disarmament (which will be binding for all nuclear powers) and
the institutionalization of international economic responses to any
imperialist aggression in the world. [[The]{.mark} **military
[defeat]{.mark}** [of Russia should be the]{.mark} **[first
step]{.mark}** [towards]{.mark} the **[democratization]{.mark}** of the
global order]{.underline} and the formations of an international
security system, and [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [**international
[left]{.mark}** [must make a **contribution**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to
this cause]{.underline}.

**Putin is an [evil]{.underline}, [entitled brat]{.underline}. His

The world is trying to make sense of Russian President Vladimir Putin's
violent invasion of Ukraine. But his attack is not rooted in any
rational calculation of costs and benefits.

Instead, [Putin is making an **ill-conceived gambit**]{.underline} [to
reclaim his nation's stature as an **imperial power**]{.underline} and
assert Russia's prestige, authority and will on the world stage. Putin
has positioned himself as a frustrated representative of an aggrieved
fallen empire --- for example, lamenting "the paralysis of power and
will" that led to the complete "degradation and oblivion" of the Soviet
Union in 1991. Though this grievance seems situated within what Putin
has called the tragedy of the Soviet collapse, his imperial inspiration
extends even deeper into the country's past. [As Putin described it in a
**2012 speech**, the revival of Russian national consciousness
**necessitates** that Russians **connect** to their **past** and realize
that they have "a **common**, **continuous** history spanning over
**1,000 years**]{.underline}."

[Putin understands the post-Soviet global order through the prism of
**Russia's long history**]{.underline}. [And that history is
**inextricably tied**]{.underline} [to Russia's dynamic **imperial
mission**]{.underline} both in the past and today.

The first "Russian" state was established in present-day Kyiv in the 9th
century. But Kievan Rus' fell into ruin with the Mongol conquest of the
13th century, becoming a decentralized group of principalities that each
owed fealty and tribute to the Mongol khans.

By the late 15th century, though, the principality of Moscow, led by
Grand Prince Ivan III, turned the tables of fortune on the Mongols.
Ivan, known to history as Ivan the Great, renounced his land's
subordination to the Mongols and declared the sovereignty of Russia.
Ivan then subdued his neighbors, annexed their territory and centralized
Moscow's authority.

Ivan the Great came to power less than a decade after the Ottoman
conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Cultivating his imperial standing
with his marriage to the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, Ivan
claimed Byzantium's legacy for Muscovite Russia and adopted the title of
czar for himself. As czar, he asserted Russia's international influence
and stature by establishing diplomatic relations with foreign powers and
building the Kremlin to serve as an architectural manifestation of
Russia's new imperial power.

[By the]{.underline} start of the [16th century, the Russian **czars**
firmly conceived of their land as a **great empire**]{.underline}. For
them, Moscow was the Third Rome --- the heir to the Roman and Byzantine
empires. Though their imperial predecessors' empires had fallen, [the
Russian czars resolved to hold **absolute power**]{.underline} [to
ensure]{.underline} the dynamic and **[continued
expansion]{.underline}** of theirs.

In the 1550s, the czar known later as Ivan the Terrible extended his
country's territory along the southern Volga down to the Caspian Sea.
Twenty-five years later, Ivan sponsored expeditions that initiated
several decades of conquest and colonization of Siberia and large swaths
of Central Asia.

By 1648, Russia had moved across a continent and reached the Pacific
coast to become an enormous state with an unrivaled land mass. It was a
full-fledged colonial enterprise.

In 1654, Czar Alexis seized the territory that lay between Russia and
the Dnieper River. This included much of present-day Ukraine, including
Kyiv. While the dominions around Moscow were known as Great Russia or
simply Russia, much of what is present-day Ukraine was deemed Little
Russia in a clear reflection of its peripheral, colonized status.

Alexis's son Peter the Great took Russia's imperialist mission to new
heights. With a revamped army and newly founded navy, Peter the Great
defeated Sweden and expanded his empire in every direction. In
recognition of his military victories and territorial conquests, Peter
in 1721 declared Russia to be an empire and he, its emperor.

Several decades later, another great, the Empress Catherine, pushed the
empire's boundaries farther west through the partitions of Poland.
Catherine also took advantage of the weakening power of the Ottoman
Empire to expand Russia southward and create the region of Novorossiya,
which included the southern sections of present-day Ukraine. She then
solidified Russia's position on the Black Sea by annexing Crimea in
1783.

Many of Russia's imperial conquests were hard-won. In 1818, when Russian
forces attempted to conquer the Northern Caucasus, they encountered a
population that refused to be subdued. In answer to the guerrilla
warfare that the indigenous population unleashed against the invaders,
Russia burned villages to the ground, incinerated forests and took
civilians as hostages. Although by 1864 Russia had incorporated the
region into its empire, ethnic and religious tensions percolated and
would erupt in a new wave of violence over a century later with the
Chechen Wars in the 1990s.

[**Convinced** that Russia's status as a global power depended on its
**expansive empire**, Russian czars]{.underline} --- safe and secure in
their St. Petersburg palaces --- [expended **vast sums** of money and
the **lives** of young Russian soldiers to maintain **imperial
glory**]{.underline}. [Territory was **purchased** with the lives of
both **conquering armies** and their **resisters**]{.underline} [while
Russian rulers transformed the cities of the **metropole**]{.underline}
[with monuments erected to honor **imperial victories** and
**expansion**]{.underline}.

When Russia erupted in revolution in 1917, the empire collapsed.
Initially, the Bolsheviks expressed antipathy toward imperialism.
Indeed, they contended that regions like Ukraine that declared their
independence would be free from the weight of empire. But the
dislocation that came with the end of World War I did not bring the
worldwide socialist revolution that Vladimir Lenin expected. As a
socialist island in a sea of global capitalism, the Russian Empire was
resurrected by Lenin and the Bolsheviks within the federal structure of
the Soviet Union. For the next 70 years, Russia's traditional imperial
mission became entangled with the expansionist aims of communism.

To meet the surging economic and military power of the United States,
the Soviet Union in the late 1940s established satellite states
throughout Eastern Europe, with communist governments overseen by
Moscow. Using tanks, artillery and repression, the Soviets kept the
communist bloc until the 1980s, when Mikhail Gorbachev could no longer
use military force to retain power. The Soviets' imperial project was in
peril.

These liberatory impulses unleashed a ripple effect within the Soviet
Union itself, with the Baltic States and the Caucasus calling for
independence from Moscow. By the end of 1991, nationalist sentiments
within the assortment of nations that the Soviet Union had inherited
from the czarist imperialist state led to demands for autonomy and
spelled the end of the U.S.S.R.

[When Putin succeeded]{.underline} Boris [Yeltsin]{.underline} as
president of the Russian Federation [in **1999**]{.underline}, [he
claimed that his country was **entitled** to exert a **privileged
influence**]{.underline} [over the **post-Soviet states**]{.underline}.
Yet many of these nations balked at the local cronyism and corruption
that seemed to come with Moscow's continued influence. In the early
2000s, popular uprisings in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan ---
collectively deemed the Color Revolutions --- demonstrated these
countries' spirit of independence and, thereby, the limits of Russia's
and Putin's control of the region.

For Putin, this equated to an inglorious lack of prestige and power.
Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity that overthrew Putin's supporter,
President Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014 only intensified this perception.
[The Russian president's decision to move into eastern Ukraine and annex
Crimea was the]{.underline} **[opening salvo]{.underline}** [to reclaim
the power that imperial failure had eroded]{.underline}.

[Beyond economic sanctions, Putin faced **little
consequence**]{.underline} for this 2014 power play, [and his
**geopolitical machinations** surged]{.underline}. Russian interference
in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump's subsequent
derision of NATO probably convinced Putin of his ability to extend
Russia's global sway without substantial obstacles.

Over the past several years, as [Putin has **increasingly constricted**
Russian civil society, limited his country's **independent media** and
**news sources**, and **imprisoned** domestic opposition
leaders]{.underline}, he has enhanced his ability to pursue his aims
unencumbered. [Reviving the **imperialist dreams** of his **czarist
forebears**]{.underline}, Putin moved to reclaim the empire that he
believes was unjustly pilfered from Russia.

But [the determined resistance of the Ukrainian people]{.underline} to
Russian aggression [has shown the **folly** of Putin's vision of renewed
imperial grandeur]{.underline}. Having found independence from Moscow in
the years since 1991, [Ukrainians have no desire to return to their
**previous colonial status**]{.underline}. Despite Russia's superior
military might, the Ukrainian people have made a stand for their
sovereignty and their freedom, earning support and respect around the
world.

Conquest and glory have thus far eluded Putin and his forces. Instead of
finding renewed prestige through the global order, Putin finds himself
isolated and condemned, and his 21st-century version of Russian
imperialism vilified and reviled rather than championed.

**Prolif, war,**

lie**]{.underline}\"; ThePrint;

KL\]

The great NATO enlargement debate never ends. In the 1990s, U.S.
officials and academics argued about whether pushing the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization into Eastern Europe was likely to sustain the
post-Cold War peace or prematurely end it. More recently, critics have
charged that Russia's war in Ukraine is a natural response to the
aggressive expansion of America's most powerful alliance.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."

The "blame NATO" argument tells a story of hubris, arrogance and
tragedy. It holds that there was a golden chance for lasting peace in
Europe, but the U.S. threw it all away. Rather than conciliating a
defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it by expanding a vast
military alliance up to Russia's borders and even into the former Soviet
Union. This pursuit of American hegemony in a liberal-democratic guise
eventually provoked a violent rebuke.

In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia and Ukraine are just the
natural response of one great power whose vital interests are being
heedlessly threatened by another.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part,
to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But the idea
that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
geopolitically bizarre.

Far from being a historic blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the
**great American successes**]{.underline} of the post-Cold War era. [Far
from being the act of a domineering superpower, it was part of a long
tradition of **vulnerable states begging** to join America's liberal
empire]{.underline}. [And far from posing a mortal threat to Moscow,
NATO enlargement actually provided Russia with far greater
**security**]{.underline} [than it could have provided
itself]{.underline}.

NATO's big bang

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

[To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember
something]{.underline} that nearly [everyone has now
forgotten]{.underline}: [There was **no guarantee** that Europe would be
mostly **stable**, **peaceful** and **democratic** after the Cold
War]{.underline}. In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO
expansion as a catastrophe once warned that [a post-Cold War Europe
could become a **violent hellscape**]{.underline}.

[It wasn't an outlandish scenario]{.underline}. [A reunified Germany
might once again try to **dominate** its neighbors]{.underline}; [the
old enmity between Moscow and Berlin could **reignite**]{.underline}.
[The collapse of Soviet influence]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [could
liberate]{.underline} those [states to pursue]{.underline}
long-suppressed [**territorial claims** and **nationalist
agendas**]{.underline}. [**Ethnic tensions** and **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline} [might **explode**]{.underline} [as the
Cold War order crumbled]{.underline}.

[If the U.S. pulled back]{.underline} once the Soviet threat was gone,
[there would be no]{.underline} extra-European [superpower to **put out
fires**]{.underline} [on a continent with lots of **geopolitical
kindling**]{.underline}. "[The prospect of major crises, even
wars]{.underline}, in Europe [is likely to **increase
dramatically**]{.underline}," Mearsheimer predicted in 1990.

[NATO enlargement was the **logical answer**]{.underline} to these
fears. Expansion was a way of binding a reunified Germany to the West
and surrounding it with democratic allies. [Joining NATO required new
members to lay aside any **revanchist designs**, while allowing them to
pursue]{.underline} economic and **[political reforms]{.underline}**
[rather than investing heavily in military capabilities]{.underline} to
defend their newly won autonomy.

[NATO's move]{.underline} to the east [also ensured that Poland and
other states that easily could have built **nuclear weapons** didn't
need to, because they had **American protection**]{.underline}. Most
important, enlargement kept the U.S. firmly planted in Europe, by
preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from
becoming obsolete.

[**No other initiative** could have accomplished these
objectives]{.underline}. Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose
security cooperation agreements with former Soviet-bloc states ---
didn't offer the ironclad guarantees that came with NATO membership.
([If you want to understand the difference between]{.underline}
"[security partner]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[NATO
ally]{.underline}**," [just look at what is happening]{.underline} today
[to **Ukraine**]{.underline}, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

[Only American power]{.underline} and promises [could provide
**stability**]{.underline} in Europe, [and NATO was the continent's
**critical link**]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}. Since 1949,
Washington had tamped down rivalries between old enemies such as France
and Germany, while also protecting them from external threats. After
1991, NATO expansion took this zone of peace, prosperity and cooperation
that had emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern Europe as
well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier," protecting the continent from dangers
within and without.

Russia as the victim

Today, of course, the critics don't buy this account. They argue that
NATO expansion represented crude power politics, as the U.S. exploited
the Soviet collapse to engorge its own empire. What resulted, pundits
such as Thomas Friedman contend, was a sort of Weimar Russia --- a
country whose dignity was affronted, security imperiled and democracy
undermined by a harsh, humiliating peace.

There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy began to
wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration saw NATO
expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent.

In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues --- including
disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian economy in the
late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's relationship with the
West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.

First, all policies have costs. [The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites]{.underline} --- although we often
forget that Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, bringing Russia into elite Western institutions
such as the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in the
intervention in Bosnia in 1995-96. [Yet the cost of not expanding NATO
might have been **forfeiting** much of the stability that initiative
provided]{.underline}. [**Trade-offs** are **inevitable** in foreign
policy]{.underline}: [There was no magic middle path]{.underline} that
would have provided all the benefits with none of the costs.

Second, [if NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it
was a remarkably **benign**]{.underline} [and **consensual** form of
empire]{.underline}. When Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did
so at the urging of the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians. [The Baltic
countries and others were soon **banging at the door**]{.underline}.
[The states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were
**desperate** to **join America's** sphere of influence, because they
were desperate to leave Moscow's]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline}, too, [was part of an older pattern]{.underline}:
[The U.S. has often extended its influence by
"**invitation**]{.underline}" [rather than imposition]{.underline}. [The
creation of NATO]{.underline} in 1949 [was mostly a European
idea]{.underline}: [Countries]{.underline} that were [terrified of
Moscow sought protection from Washington]{.underline}. One reason
Putin's wars to keep countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so
abhorrent to Americans is that the U.S. empire has trouble keeping
members out.

Putin may not see it that way. All that matters to him is that the
mightiest peacetime alliance in history has crept closer to Russian
soil. But here a third fact becomes relevant: Russia was one of the
biggest beneficiaries of NATO's move east.

Making Russia safer

Open terrain has often left Russia vulnerable to invasion and
instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany
and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern Europe to wreak havoc on
Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason why the great strategist
George Kennan opposed NATO expansion --- because it would surely
re-activate this fear of encroachment from the west.

Yet this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat. The
alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign troops
in Eastern Europe. After the Cold War, America steadily withdrew most of
its troops and all of its heavy armor from the continent. U.S. allies
engaged in a veritable race to disarm.

The prospect that NATO could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was
laughable. What the alliance could do was tame the perils that might
otherwise have menaced the Russian state.

Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled snugly into an
alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket. NATO, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could "play a
containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry about a
nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy.

NATO expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack.

Putin's easy excuse

So what went wrong? Why couldn't Putin make his peace with a larger
NATO?

Part of the answer is that NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in
the sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony
in its near-abroad. The Soviet Union, and [the Russian
empire]{.underline} before it, [had traditionally sought to **control
countries** along their frontiers and used **brutal means**]{.underline}
to do it. [To say that NATO expansion caused Russian belligerence is
thus to make an **extremely dubious assertion**]{.underline}: [that
absent NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a
**satisfied**]{.underline}, **[status quo]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}.

And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire. [For 20 years, Putin has been **publicly lusting** after the
sphere of influence that the Soviet Union once enjoyed]{.underline}.
NATO expansion stood athwart that ambition, by giving Moscow's former
vassals the ability to resist its pressure.

[NATO]{.underline} also [threatened]{.underline} a certain type of
Russian government --- [an autocracy that was **never secure** in its
own rule]{.underline}. [A democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded
being neighbors]{.underline} with Western-leaning democracies, because
political liberty in those countries wouldn't have threatened to set a
subversive example for anti-Putin Russians.

Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early 2000s, and as Putin's
popularity declined with the Russian economy after 2008, the imperative
of preventing ideological spillover from a U.S.-backed democratic
community loomed large.

So Putin began pushing back against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he
invaded Georgia, a country that was moving --- too slowly for its own
safety --- toward the West. Since 2014, he has been waging war against
Ukraine, in hopes of rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's
westward drift. America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's
program of violent coercion.

West missed the danger signs

To be sure, U.S. officials made mistakes along the way. Because Russia
was prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s, Washington
acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without really
considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon has thus
been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of NATO's
eastern flank.

As Russia regained its strength, U.S. officials also failed to grasp the
danger of provoking Putin without adequately deterring him. When, in
2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for Georgia and Ukraine but
issued a vague statement saying that they would someday join the
alliance, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving Putin both the
pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by tearing those two
countries apart.

Yet there is a curious morality in [accounts]{.underline} that [blame
the West, which sought to protect **vulnerable** states]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe, [for the current carnage, rather than blaming Putin, who
has worked to **dismember** and **intimidate** those
countries]{.underline}. It is sloppy thinking to tally up the costs of
NATO expansion without considering the historic achievements of a policy
that served American, European and even certain Russian interests
remarkably well.

And if nothing else, NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between
Moscow and the democratic world to the east after one Cold War --- a
factor of great significance now that a second cold war is underway.

The legacy of NATO expansion isn't simply a matter of historical
interest. [Americans' understanding of the past has always
influenced]{.underline} their view of [what policies to pursue **in the
future**]{.underline}. [During the 1920s and 1930s]{.underline}, [the
widespread]{.underline}, if [inaccurate]{.underline}, [belief that
America had entered World War I to serve the interests of
**banks**]{.underline} [and **arms manufacturers**]{.underline} [had
a]{.underline} \[**[crushing]{.underline}**\] ~~paralyzing~~ [effect on
U.S. policy amid the **totalitarian aggression**]{.underline} [that set
off **World War II**]{.underline}.

Today, the U.S. faces a long, nasty struggle to contain Putin's imperial
project and protect an endangered world order. Introspection is an
admirable quality, but [the last thing America needs is another bout of
**self-flagellation**]{.underline} [rooted in another misapprehension of
the past]{.underline}. --- Bloomberg

i\'ve been thinking a lot about the role media plays in egging these
hate crimes on not just trump and his china blaming nonsense but also
the daily legitimate reports about the terrible things the chinese
government is doing like arbitrarily detaining two canadians to bully
canada into releasing monzo committing genocide against the uyghurs and
other ethnic minorities cracking down on hong kong\'s democracy pulling
shady neo-colonious moves in southeast asia and africa and much much
worse and we should criticize the chinese government international
pressure is the only thing that can get them to back off but i\'m
wondering what this non-stop positioning of china as that ominous
foreign boogeyman does to the perception of chinese people as a whole
and other asians and pacific islanders by extension i used to not flinch
when people would say china without information about kovid or china is
playing the long game to world domination because i instinctively know
that they\'re talking about the chinese government not ordinary citizens
because i as someone who was born and raised in mainland china i\'m well
aware that the chinese government does not represent me but now i\'m
wondering if the average person who grew up in the west can
conceptualize this if they\'re aware that the average chinese citizen
has no political power or influence over whether these atrocities are
happening you hear a lot about what the chinese government is doing but
do you ever hear about what\'s happening in china for ordinary people do
you have any idea what they\'re thinking whenever i speak up against
white supremacy and the lingering impact of western colonialism there\'s
always some guy in my comments who is like well china has a han
supremacist problem and is colonizing africa right now yes and i
criticize both the chinese and western governments but somehow just
because of my name and face some people equate me to this ominous evil
in their minds that it\'s china we can talk all day about how i don\'t
even have chinese citizenship anymore i\'m legally a canadian but i
don\'t want to make it seem like it\'d be okay to see all citizens of
the people\'s republic of china as the enemy either if you want to know
what it\'s like for an average chinese citizen imagine if trump and his
goons appointed themselves your government leaders because of their
connections and you had absolutely no option of voting them out imagine
not even being able to criticize trump without worrying that the police
might pay you a visit my family sees the stuff american comedians say
about trump they see a selfie i took with justin trudeau and they are
stunned in china politicians don\'t go on campaigns to win support they
don\'t take selfies with random people they do what their higher ups
tell them to do it\'s like ordinary citizens are base level employees at
a massive company and civil servants are the managers we occasionally
hear stuff about the top bosses like xi jinping but ultimately we have
no influence on the direction they decide to take the company and in
everything we see in public we have to maintain the position of oh yeah
our company is the best however most mainland chinese people that i know
are not blindly loyal to the ccp they\'ve just been conditioned to not
voice dissent out of fear of punishment but the grievances have their
own way of slipping out there are endless sensitive terms that get
automatically blocked on chinese social media but discussions still
happen using all sorts of slang to bypass the filters the chinese people
are always one step ahead of the censors we make jokes about getting
invited to tea whenever we say something out of line we laugh at
government propaganda we use vpns to go on youtube and twitter and
facebook we mock the socialist values cj king loves to talk about
because we\'re well aware that china has an attempted socialism in
decades and it is in fact one of the most capitalist countries on earth
if it were true that all mainland chinese people are brainwashed the
government wouldn\'t need to crack down so hard on free speech i am
chinese but i do not feel proud that the chinese government is getting
so powerful it even makes me feel hopeless sometimes when i think about
how other countries are too tangled up in their own messes and too
economically dependent on china to seriously stand up to the ccp and
chinese citizens themselves have too much to lose to rise up in a mass
revolution it is so infuriating to see that a few hundred people up high
in the ccp have their grip on that much power and there\'s currently no
reliable force out there that we can depend on to take them down this is
not what i want the future to look like i do not want the world to end
up in a second world war that god forbid escalates beyond cold but at
the same time that we\'re rightfully calling the ccp out for its
atrocities

Yet **[a wave of interest]{.underline}** [in pursuing solar system
colonization is building]{.underline}, whether its initial focus is the
Moon, Mars, or O'Neill-style space habitats. Jeff Bezos has argued
eloquently for [moving heavy industry off the home planet, **preserving
Earth** as a nature reserve, and building the space-based infrastructure
that will lower barriers and create opportunities for vast economic and
cultural growth]{.underline} (similar to how the Internet and a
revolution in microelectronics has allowed Amazon and numerous other
companies to achieve spectacular wealth). Elon Musk and **[Stephen
Hawking]{.underline}** both [suggested the need for a "hedge" population
of humans]{.underline} on Mars [to allow human civilization to reboot
itself in the event of a **catastrophe on Earth**]{.underline} -- [an
eggs-in-several-baskets approach]{.underline} which actually complements
the arguments made by Bezos. And while both are valid reasons for
pursuing colonization, there's a stronger, overarching rationale that
clinches it.

I'll assert that [a]{.underline} **[fundamental truth]{.underline}** --
[repeatedly borne out by history]{.underline} -- [is that expanding,
outwardly-focused civilizations are far **less likely to turn on
themselves**, and far more likely to expend their fecundity on growing
habitations, conducting important research and creating wealth
for]{.underline} their [citizens]{.underline}. A [civilization that
**turns away from**]{.underline} discovery and **[growth
stagnates]{.underline}** -- a point made by NASA's Chief Historian
Steven Dick as well as Mars exploration advocate Robert Zubrin.

[As a species, we have yet to resolve problems of extreme **political
polarization**]{.underline} (both internal to nation states as well as
among them), inequalities in wealth distribution, [deficiencies in civil
liberties, environmental depredations and war]{.underline}. Forgoing
opportunities to expand our presence into the cosmos to achieve better
outcomes here at home hasn't eliminated these scourges.

What's more, the **["cabin fever"]{.underline}** often decried by
opponents of colonization (when applied to small, isolated outposts far
from Earth) [turns out to be a potential problem for our own
planet]{.underline}. **[Without a relief valve]{.underline}** [for
ideological pilgrims]{.underline} or staunch individualists who might
just prefer to be on their own despite the inevitable hardships, [we may
well run the risk of **exacerbating** the **polarization** and
internecine strife]{.underline} we strive so hard to quell. [Focusing
humanity's attention and imagination on a grand project may]{.underline}
well [give us the running room we need to address these
problems]{.underline}. But the decision cannot be made by one country,
or one company, or one segment of the human population. If we do this,
it will of necessity be a truly international endeavor, a cross-sector
endeavor (with all commercial, civil, and defense interests engaged and
cooperating).

The good news: [Critical technologies such as propulsion and power
generation systems]{.underline} will **[improve over
time]{.underline}**. [Transit durations between celestial destinations
will shorten]{.underline} ([in the same way sailing vessels gave way to
steam ships and]{.underline} then to [airliners]{.underline} and
perhaps, one day, to point-to-point ballistic reusable rockets).
[Methods for obtaining critical resources on other planets will be
**refined** and enhanced]{.underline}. **[Genetic
engineering]{.underline}** [may be used to better adapt humans, their
crops and other biota to life in space]{.underline} or on other
planetary surfaces -- [to withstand the effects of low or micro-gravity,
radiation, and the psychological effects]{.underline} of long-duration
spaceflight.

As nation after nation lands their inaugural exploratory vessels on our
Earth's moon, and as billionaire space enthusiasts race to launch
passengers, satellites and other cargo into orbit, it's clearly time for
us to sit down as a species and debate whether our future will be one
highlighted primarily by growth and discovery, opening the solar system
to settlement and economic development, or one that eschews outward
expansion for conservation and preservation. Doing so would allow us to
focus our attentions on this planet, leaving the solar system in its
natural state, a celestial Antarctica stretching beyond Neptune.

I vote for growth. But one person, or one company, one community, one
nation, isn't a plurality here. [This debate - postponed for more than
50 years -- is one worth having. **Humanity's future** will be decided
by its outcome]{.underline}.

Many argue that [the world is in a state of crisis]{.underline} and that
the human race is the cause. [As a species, we are approaching an
important turning point in our history, and if we make the wrong
decisions we might be facing a future of **deprivation**, **over
population**, **hunger**, and **instability**]{.underline}. Ultimately,
many believe that [we will eventually be forced to colonize
space]{.underline}. Last year, the 100 Starship Symposium set on course
a project to design and build an economical and practical spacecraft for
interstellar travel.

But [with the very immediate worries about over population, it might
**not** be **a good idea to wait** for interstellar travel and the
colonization of other worlds]{.underline}. Fortunately, [there
are]{.underline} also [many suggestions in place for large space
structures designed as places for people to live in their millions, much
like a city is on Earth]{.underline}. Of course, building a space
habitat comes with thousands of challenges, including: construction in
space, recreating a livable atmosphere, recycling waste, producing
artificial gravity, transporting food and materials to the habitat, and
convincing people such a venture is worth it.

There\'s no strict definition for a \'space habitat\', but it\'s
generally agreed to be [a permanent human living facility on a celestial
body such as \'Mars One\']{.underline} (extra-terrestrial planets,
moons, or in a spaceship orbiting the Earth). [We may have]{.underline}
**[no choice but to build]{.underline}** one of [these in the
future,]{.underline} be it [initiated as a **matter of
survival**]{.underline} or an undeniable demand because of our desire to
explore and gain new knowledge by expanding in space. Ultimately, there
are a number of incentives to building such a habitat.

For [governmental bodies and world leaders faced with]{.underline} a
huge [an]{.underline}d **[unsustainable population]{.underline}**, the
concept of [a space habitat would be attractive]{.underline}. [Using the
materials available in the Solar System, there is the potential to build
enough surface area within space habitats to]{.underline} possibly
[house]{.underline} billions and even [**trillions** of
people]{.underline}. [Populations would have the space to expand
sustainably without destroying any current ecosystems, as well as
**relieving** the **pressure off Earth** to provide
resources]{.underline}. The planetary population could be
[**stabilized**]{.underline} and supported [with the extra space to
inhabit and develop agricultural plantations for food.]{.underline}

The expansion into space also offers up a wealth of privatized
opportunities, such as access to energy and other interplanetary
resources. **[On Earth]{.underline}**, [utilizing the Sun\'s energy via
solar cells is a disappointingly inefficient process with **unavoidable
problems**]{.underline} associated with the atmosphere and night. [In
space, solar panels would have access to nearly continuous light from
the Sun]{.underline}, and in Earth\'s orbit this would give us [1400
watts of power per square meter]{.underline} (with 100% efficiency).
This **[abundance of energy]{.underline}** [would mean]{.underline} that
we [could travel throughout much of the Solar System without
a]{.underline} terribly [significant drop in power]{.underline}.

[Material resources would also be in]{.underline}
**[abundance]{.underline}** [throughout the entire Solar
System]{.underline} (especially if you include mining opportunities on
Mars, Luna, and other moons). [Asteroids contain almost all of the
stable elements in the periodic table]{.underline}, and [without
gravity, extracting and transporting them]{.underline} for our uses
[could be done with ease]{.underline}. NASA is working on a project
where [one could manufacture fuel, building materials, water, and oxygen
just from resources found the Moon.]{.underline} The shift from Earth
based manufacturing and plantation to industries in space may not just
become feasible, but incredibly economically beneficial.

curtailed]{.underline} if we colonize space.**

In 2021, a new era of space exploration dawned with the first privately
organized flights ferrying civilian passengers across the line that
separates our planet from the rest of the universe. Much of the media
coverage of the three flights launched by Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin
and SpaceX has either been of the "isn't this cool" variety or has
characterized these endeavours as symbols of inequality. As such, [the
question of what the value of human spaceflight is has gone largely
unanswered]{.underline}.

Supporters of space exploration sometimes suggest that sending robotic
probes to the remote corners of the solar system and beyond can teach us
what we need to know about the universe at less cost and risk than
sending people. Yet, [for the]{.underline} **[safety of our
descendants]{.underline}** [and to reach humanity's full potential, we
must become **a multiplanetary species**]{.underline}.

**[Existential risk]{.underline}**

[Humans have a]{.underline} **[one in six chance]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[going extinct]{.underline}** [this
century]{.underline} according to [Oxford Philosopher]{.underline} Toby
Ord. In his book, The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of
Humanity, [Dr]{.underline} **[Ord]{.underline}** [lays out a variety
of]{.underline} **[long-tail risks]{.underline}** [that are both
**existential** and very **difficult to mitigate**]{.underline}. These
include nature-based risks like **[asteroids]{.underline}**,
[large-scale]{.underline} **[volcanic eruptions]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[stellar explosions]{.underline}**. Although we can
track many of these phenomena, [we do not have the
technology]{.underline} ([nor are we likely to develop it anytime
soon]{.underline}) [to prevent large eruptions or redirect large
asteroids]{.underline}. Initial efforts to nudge space objects are just
beginning. This is to say nothing of the [human-created risks
of]{.underline} **[nuclear war]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[bioweapons]{.underline}** [intentionally or
unintentionally]{.underline} released on the public, a scenario made
easier to imagine by the current pandemic.

[As long as humanity is]{.underline} **[grouped together]{.underline}**
[on a single planet there will always be a possibility that all of us
can be killed at once.]{.underline} It is [equivalent to having everyone
in a single building]{.underline}: **[there is always a risk greater
than zero]{.underline}** [of a collapse or fire that kills
everyone]{.underline}. [By **establishing**]{.underline}, at first,
small **[outposts]{.underline}** [and eventually larger scale
settlements on other planets, the risk of our species being destroyed is
**significantly curtailed**]{.underline}.

Realizing humanity's potential

On a more positive note, [human habitation in a greater variety of
settings will radically expedite science]{.underline} and commerce.
While we currently have small-scale experimentation with manufacturing
items in micro and zero gravity on the International Space Station, [the
potential for us to set up large-scale industry in different physics
requires us to have a presence on other celestial
locations]{.underline}.

[Large-scale settlements of people are hubs of innovation and human
flourishing]{.underline}. Just think of how many more discoveries and
marvels could be created by 80 billion people in the future instead of
today's 8 billion. [Our current planet has a]{.underline} **[limited
carrying capacity]{.underline}** [but our solar system can accommodate
many more people than any single planet]{.underline} can.

Just as cultural and geographic variety contributes to the richness of
our current society, [further expanding the diversity of human settings
would continue to]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}** the
**[creativity]{.underline}** of our species. Space travel itself has
already been an incredible inspiration to numerous
[scientists]{.underline}, [engineers and artists]{.underline} with many
people citing seeing the moon landing as one of the most formative
events of their lives.

Hastening science and technology development

The [technologies we develop on our way to becoming a multiplanetary
species will also benefit us here on earth]{.underline}. Today,
**[satellites]{.underline}** [are used to **monitor** carbon and other
**greenhouse gas emissions** to give us a better picture of the causes
of global warming and]{.underline} **[promote
accountability]{.underline}**. In her first speech devoted to space, US
Vice-President Kalama Harris said: "I truly believe **[space activity is
climate action]{.underline}**." In a recent report, the World Economic

Question 2: [[Wouldn't Ukraine]{.mark}'s standing up against the Russian
invasion [benefit NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}?

[The first thing to say is "**[so what?]{.mark}**]{.underline}" Our
support to peoples fighting imperialism shouldn't depend on which
imperialist side is backing them. [Otherwise, [by the]{.mark} **[same
logic]{.mark}**, [**justice** should be **sacrificed** to the **supreme
battle** against the]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[West]{.mark}ern
bloc]{.underline}," as some argue in neo-campist pseudo-left circles.
For my part, I wrote that [[a **Russian success**]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- an outcome that unfortunately still remains a real possibility ---
"[[would **embolden**]{.mark} US [imperialism]{.mark} itself and its
allies to continue their own **aggressive** behavior]{.underline}."
Indeed, the United States and its Western allies have already benefited
enormously from Putin's action. They should be warmly grateful to the
Russian autocrat.

[A successful Russian takeover of Ukraine would encourage the United
States to return to the path of **conquering the world** by force in a
context of exacerbation of the **new colonial division** of the world
and worsening of **global antagonisms**, while [a Russian
failure]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[adding to]{.mark} the US [failures in
**Iraq**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[Afghanistan]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[would reinforce]{.mark} what is called in Washington [the]{.mark}
"**[Vietnam syndrome]{.mark}**]{.underline}." [Moreover]{.underline}, it
seems quite obvious to me that [a Russian victory would considerably
strengthen **warmongering**]{.underline} [and the push towards increased
**military spending**]{.underline} [in NATO countries]{.underline},
which has already gotten off to a flying start, [while a Russian defeat
would offer much better conditions]{.underline} for our battle [for
**general disarmament**]{.underline} and the dissolution of NATO.

If [Ukraine were to succeed in rejecting the **Russian
yoke**]{.underline}, it is more than [likely that it would be vassalized
to Western powers]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the point is that, [if
it fails to do so, it will be **enserfed** to Russia]{.underline}. And
you don't have to be a qualified medievalist to know that [the condition
of a vassal is **incomparably preferable** to that of a
serf]{.underline}!

Question 3: How can we radical anti-imperialists support a resistance
that is led by a rightwing bourgeois government?

Should we support a people that resists against an over-armed
imperialist invasion only if its resistance is led by communists and not
by a bourgeois government? This is a very old ultra-left position on the
national question, which Lenin rightfully combatted in his time. [[A
**just** struggle against]{.mark} **national [oppression]{.mark}**, let
alone foreign occupation, [must be **supported**]{.mark} [regardless
of]{.mark} the **nature** of [its **leadership**]{.mark}: if this fight
is just, it implies that the population concerned **actively
participates** in it and **deserves support**]{.underline}, regardless
of the nature of its leadership.

[[It is]{.mark} **certainly [not]{.mark}** [the Ukrainian
capitalists]{.mark} who are [mobilizing]{.mark} en masse with the
Ukrainian armed forces]{.underline} in the form of an improvised
national guard and new-style "pétroleuses," [[but the **working
people**]{.mark} of Ukraine]{.underline}. And [[in their fight
against]{.mark} **Great [Russian imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[led by an **autocratic** and **oligarchic ultra-reactionary**
government in Moscow that presides over the destinies of one of the most
**unequal countries** on the planet, the Ukrainian people deserve our
**full support**]{.underline}. This certainly does not imply that we
cannot criticize the Kyiv government.

Question 4: [Isn't the ongoing war an inter-imperialist
war]{.underline}?

[If any war where each side is supported by an imperialist rival were
called an inter-imperialist war, then **all the wars** of our time would
be inter-imperialist]{.underline}, since as a rule, it is enough for one
of the rival imperialisms to support one side for the other to support
the opposite side. [An inter-imperialist war is **not
that**]{.underline}. [It is a direct war, and not one by proxy, between
two powers, each of which seeks to invade the territorial]{.underline}
and (neo)colonial domain [of the other]{.underline}, as was very clearly
the First World War. It is a "war of rapine" on both sides, as Lenin
liked to call it.

[[To describe the]{.mark} ongoing [conflict in Ukraine]{.mark}, in which
the latter country has **no ambition**, let alone **intention**, of
seizing Russian territory, and in which Russia has the **stated
intention** of subjugating Ukraine and seizing much of its
territory]{.underline} --- [to call this conflict
**[inter-imperialist]{.mark}**, rather than an **imperialist war of
invasion**, [is a]{.mark}n **extreme [distortion of
reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} **[primary]{.mark}**, **most [immediate]{.mark}**,
[function of]{.mark} the supply of [arms]{.mark} to Ukraine [is]{.mark}
therefore [that it helps]{.mark} it [oppose its
**enserfment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if, on the other hand, it
wishes its vassalization in the belief that it is the only guarantee of
its freedom. We must, of course, also oppose its vassalization, but
[[for the time being]{.mark}, [the **most urgent** need must be
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Of course, the direct entry into war of the other imperialist camp would
transform the current conflict into a true inter-imperialist war, in the
correct sense of the concept, a type of war to which we are
categorically hostile. For now, [[NATO members]{.mark} are declaring
that they will not cross the red line of sending troops]{.underline} to
fight the Russian armed forces on Ukrainian soil, or shooting down
Russian planes in Ukrainian airspace --- [despite Volodymyr Zelensky's
exhortations. This is because they [**rightly fear** a **fatal
spiral**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [skeptical]{.underline}, as they have
become, [[about]{.mark} the **rationality** of Putin who did not
hesitate to brandish [the]{.mark} **[nuclear threat]{.mark}** from the
outset.]{.underline}

Question 5: Can we support Western arms deliveries to Ukraine?

Since the Ukrainians' fight against the Russian invasion is just, it is
quite right to help them defend themselves against an enemy far superior
in numbers and armament. That is why [we are **without
hesitation**]{.underline} [in favor of the delivery of]{.underline}
defensive [weapons to the **Ukrainian resistance**]{.underline}. But
what does this mean?

An example: we are certainly in favor of delivering anti-aircraft
missiles, portable and otherwise, to the Ukrainian resistance. [To
oppose it would be to say that Ukrainians only have to choose between,
on the one hand, **being massacred** and seeing their **cities
destroyed**]{.underline} by the Russian air force, [without having the
means they need to defend themselves, or]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [fleeing their country]{.underline}. At the same time, however, we
must not only oppose the irresponsible idea of imposing a no-fly zone
over Ukraine or part of its territory; we must also oppose the delivery
of air fighters to Ukraine that Zelensky has been demanding. Fighters
are not strictly defensive weaponry, and their supply to Ukraine would
actually risk significantly aggravating Russian bombing.

In short, we are in favor of the supply to Ukraine of anti-aircraft and
anti-tank weapons, as well as all the armaments indispensable for the
defense of a territory. [[To deny Ukraine]{.mark} these deliveries
[is]{.mark} simply [to be]{.mark} **[guilty of failure]{.mark}** [to
assist a people in **danger**]{.mark}! We have called for the delivery
of such defensive weapons to the **Syrian opposition** in the past. The
United States **refused** and even prevented its local allies from
handing them over to the Syrians]{.underline}, in part because of the
Israeli veto. [**We know** what the **consequences** were]{.underline}.

**Stop [Westplaining]{.underline} Ukraine.**

The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine has lasted nearly a month,
killing over 3000 civilians and wounding more than 10000 of them. The
humanitarian crisis has attracted much attention on campus, with
students organizing vigils and fundraisers for disaster relief. Some
[progressives]{.underline} on campus, however, [have adopted the
**Russian talking point**]{.underline}, [holding the West and NATO
responsible for triggering the invasion]{.underline}. Curiously, [their
arguments]{.underline}, [in line with realist scholars they]{.underline}
[**usually despise** like John Mearshimer and Stephen
Waltz]{.underline}, [mainly concern the **security needs** of the
Russian state and the **imperialist nature** of NATO]{.underline}. They
contend that the "imperialist," U.S.-led NATO expansion, in violation of
its promise to the Soviet Union before the unification of Germany,
[triggered heightened anxiety in Eastern Europe and pushed Russia to
defend its sphere of influence]{.underline} via war. [What's more, being
in the same camp as isolationists like **Rand Paul**]{.underline},
**[they]{.underline}** also call for dialing down sanctions against
"ordinary Russians," and argue against **[any form]{.underline}** of
**[NATO intervention]{.underline}**.

[The seemingly innocent anti-war and anti-imperialist position taken by
some progressives is **harmful** for Ukrainians and other **oppressed
peoples**]{.underline} [fighting against autocratic
brutality]{.underline} for two reasons: 1) [on the surface level,
blaming NATO/the West]{.underline} **[denies any agency]{.underline}**
[of Ukrainians and their **legitimate wish** to join NATO and embrace
the West]{.underline}, and 2) in promoting their version of
anti-imperialism, [the anti-war left in fact embrace a form of
**U.S.-centrism** that **ignores atrocities** committed by adversaries
of the U.S., such as **Russia**, **China**, Cuba, Venezuela, and
**Iran**]{.underline}.

Let's take on [the]{.underline} "[Ukraine is the West's
fault]{.underline}" [argument]{.underline} first. [The problem of this
proposition is that it assumes that without NATO expansion, Russia would
**behave differently**]{.underline}. [Both **historical** and
**contemporary empirical evidence** suggests otherwise]{.underline}.
[Long before the establishment of NATO]{.underline} and since the reign
of Ivan the Terrible I in the 16th century, [Russia sought eastward
expansion to secure its relatively weak geopolitical]{.underline}
position that lacks strategic depth. As noted by renowned historian
Stephen Kotkin, Russian foreign policy "has been characterized by
soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country's capabilities" for
centuries. In a present day scenario, the best way for Russia to prevent
the eastward expansion of NATO would be to station troops alongside the
Russian-Ukrainian border without an invasion to achieve maximum
deterrence effect and bargaining power. In fact, [it was **Russian
aggression**]{.underline} [against Ukraine throughout the 21st century
that **accelerated**]{.underline} [Ukraine's embrace of]{.underline} the
EU and [NATO]{.underline}. Public opinion polls suggest that immediately
after the Cold War, only 37% of Ukrainians supported joining NATO. It
was not until after the Orange Revolution, when Russia poisoned
Yushchenko with neural toxins, that more than 50% of the Ukrainian
public embraced the idea of a national referendum on joining NATO.
[After the Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian support for NATO
reached a **historical height**, with more than 60% of Ukrainians
embracing the idea]{.underline}. Breaking down Putin's psyche, his
rationale to attack Ukraine, and the puzzling optimistic evaluation
before the war is a tall order. Historians are likely to debate causes
of the war for decades, but [it is **clear** that NATO expansion is
**not** a major factor in Putin's calculation to launch the
war]{.underline} --- [he **barely mentioned**]{.underline} [NATO in his
war-declaration speech]{.underline} right before the invasion [and
declared Ukraine to be an **imaginary state**]{.underline} [gifted by
Lenin]{.underline}. If there is anything that can be learned from the
ongoing war, however, it is that [allowing Ukraine to join NATO in 2008
would likely have prevented the Russian invasion]{.underline}: [the
**rock-solid peace** and security in **Poland** and the **Baltic
states**, countries that were traditionally in the Russian sphere of
influence, are the **best example**]{.underline} of how NATO manages to
protect member states from Russian aggression.

Contending with the uncomfortable idea that the vast majority of
Ukrainians support NATO and that NATO could have protected Ukraine, [the
anti-war left]{.underline}, as represented by Marjorie Cohn who gave a
talk at Swarthmore on March 2, 2022, [often resorts to **conspiracy
theories** backed by the Kremlin, claiming that the current pro-West
administration was the result of the]{.underline} "[illegimate neo-Nazi
coup]{.underline}" of 2014 [backed by the U.S]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} is essentially a claim that [not only]{.underline}
**[contradicts with reality]{.underline}** [but also **removes any
agency**]{.underline} [vested in the Ukrainian people]{.underline}.

[What is **more disturbing** than the flawed argument that ignores
internal political dynamics and **political agency**]{.underline} [of
Ukraine is its **moral implication**]{.underline}: [by identifying the
U.S. as the **only "bad guy**" in the world, leftists **ignore** and
indirectly **whitewash**]{.underline} [the evils committed by
autocrats]{.underline} around the world. Indeed, U.S. progressives are
facing an intellectual dilemma between criticizing U.S. imperialism and
addressing oversea authoritarianism today. [They believe that
criticizing autocracies in the global south would undermine their
project of dismantling U.S. imperialism]{.underline} --- [an **entirely
false** proposition]{.underline}, of course.

For years, [they have focused primarily on wrongdoings of the
U.S]{.underline}., [in part because of this **one-dimensional**
anti-imperialist project]{.underline}, [but also because of the
**unconscious U.S.-centrism**]{.underline} [that inevitably results from
**solely focusing** on U.S. behaviors]{.underline}. [The anti-war left
has criticized the]{.underline} U.S./the [CIA]{.underline}, [without
concrete evidence]{.underline}, [for offering support to pro-democracy
protesters in]{.underline} Syria, Hong Kong, and Venezuela, [and has
been **largely absent**]{.underline} [on issues such as the **annexation
of Crimea**]{.underline}, [**Assad's war crimes** against
civilians]{.underline}, **[Iran's proxy wars]{.underline}** [in the
Middle East, and **China's treatment** of ethnic minorities and Hong
Kong]{.underline}. Instead, [they focused mostly on where they deemed
U.S. policy to be]{.underline} [wrong]{.underline}, like in regards to
dealings with Yemen, Israel/Palestine, and Cuba. Why was this the case?
[The current generation of the anti-war left, born at the end of the
Cold War, have **never experienced** real threats firsthand from other
great powers]{.underline}. [Instead, they grew up in an
**America-dominated** world]{.underline} in which the power of the U.S.
was largely unchecked. [As such, their worldviews were shaped by events
such as the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}, where an omnipotent U.S.
failed to sustain its moral claim of establishing a democracy to replace
the Saddam regime. Thus, those born in this generation spent their
formative years criticizing the U.S. regime with a deep sense of guilt.
[This]{.underline} introspective [guilt]{.underline}, [coupled
with]{.underline} continued **[unchallenged]{.underline}** U.S.
[dominance]{.underline}, [resulted in the millennial anti-war left
supporting the **very ideas** they attempted to criticize]{.underline}:
[U.S. dominance and imperialism]{.underline}.

In adopting this viewpoint, [the anti-war left ended up where they
**exactly** did not want to be]{.underline}: [U.S.-centric]{.underline}.
As mentioned before, many [progressives have **ignored** human rights
violations and **atrocities** caused by many foreign powers]{.underline}
--- [Russia in **Syria**; Iran in **Yemen**, **Iraq**, and
**Lebanon**]{.underline}; [and China in **Hong Kong** and
**Xinjiang**]{.underline} --- [because these countries are adversaries
of the U.S. and can potentially undermine U.S. dominance]{.underline}.
Moreover, [instead of helping activists within these authoritarian
countries, anti-war progressives view them as **agents** of the U.S.'s
imperialist interests]{.underline} and advocate for U.S. isolationism,
[even when **real-life** human rights atrocities were being committed
against civilians]{.underline}. This is another mistake caused by their
belief that only the U.S. is capable of wielding real power in a
unipolar world and that critical events happening in other countries
have their roots in an American-centric system.

[This "anti-war" worldview]{.underline}, in part due to the breakdown of
the moral legacy of the U.S.- led, pro-democracy, and pro-openness
post-Cold War order after the Iraq War, [not only takes agency away from
other **oppressed peoples**]{.underline} [living under and being
threatened by **autocrats**]{.underline} in Russia, China, Iran, and
etc., [but also indirectly promotes another form of
**U.S.-centrism**]{.underline}, [in which **only** the U.S. is deemed to
have **any real power**]{.underline} [over the global
events]{.underline}. Progressive millennials now face the intellectual
challenge of refraining from 'westplaining' Ukraine and aligning their
worldview with moral claims about freedom and self-determination both
home and abroad. [Facing growing challenges posed by autocratic and
inherently imperialist powers like Russia and China, leftists in the
U.S. should **unequivocally stand** on the side of
**democracy**]{.underline} [rather than **apologize** for autocrats and
their **expansionist aggression** in the **name** of
"**anti-imperialism**]{.underline}."

**The assumption of Eurocentric IR as [fundamentally

Ontologies of Otherness: Liberal--local relations, 'hybridity',
'resistance' and the 'everyday'

Sensitive to the problem of such occlusion, [a major strand of recent
literature has emphasized the need to rethink]{.underline} the relations
between [the 'liberal']{.underline} and the 'local' in intervention
settings (Mac Ginty, 2011; Richmond, 2009, 2010, 2011), in what has been
labelled a 'fourth generation' approach (Richmond, 2011). This writing
has taken a much more proactive approach to research with and about the
peoples targeted by intervention, aiming to correct the impression of
smooth liberal transformation and the 'romanticization' of the local
(Mac Ginty, 2011: 2--4). [Yet, the paths it has taken have, quite
unwillingly, reinforced a Eurocentric understanding of intervention,
through the use of an ontology of 'Otherness' to frame the
issues]{.underline}. Prominent among these accounts is Richmond's (2009,
2010, 2011) recent work on 'post-liberal peace', which frames the key
problems of intervention through an ontological distinction between the
'liberal' and the 'local'. In earlier writing, the [liberal peace is
elaborated as genealogically endogenous to Western traditions of
thought, reflecting Enlightenment]{.underline}, modern and
post-Christian [values]{.underline} (Richmond, 2005). In post-conflict
settings, however, [it is critiqued for exercising]{.underline} forms of
[hegemony that suppress pluralism]{.underline}, depoliticize peace,
undermine the liberal social contract [and exercise a colonial gaze in
its treatment of local 'recipients' of the liberal peace]{.underline}.
In view of these various aspects of failure, the liberal peace is
characterized as 'ethically bankrupt' (Richmond, 2009: 558) and
requiring re-evaluation. [The 'local', on the other hand, is a space
characterized by 'context, custom, tradition and difference]{.underline}
in its everyday setting' (Richmond, 2010: 669), which is suppressed by
liberal peace interventions. [The]{.underline} very
[conception]{.underline} of the 'post-liberal peace' [is]{.underline}
thus [about]{.underline} the ways in which [two ontologically distinct
elements]{.underline} -- the 'liberal' and the 'local' -- are 'rescued
and reunited' via forms of hybridity and empathy, in which 'everyday
local agencies, rights, needs, custom and kinship are recognized as
discursive "webs of meaning"' (Richmond, 2010: 668). Mitchell (2011:
1628) has recently argued that Richmond's conception of the 'local' is
not 'a reference to parochial, spatially, culturally or politically
bounded places' but 'the potentialities of local agents to contest,
reshape or resist within a local "space"'. Richmond (2011: 13--14)
himself has also been concerned not to be understood as 'essentializing'
the 'local', emphasizing that it contains a diversity of forms of
political society. Indeed, in this more recent work, a more complex
conception of the 'everyday' as a space of action, thought and potential
resistance is elaborated. Despite these qualifications, however, there
is much conflation, interchangeability and slippage between these
conceptions of the 'local'. Accordingly, the ontology of Otherness,
understood as cultural distinctiveness and alterity, continuously
surfaces throughout the narratives of liberal and post-liberal peace.
[Not only is the liberal peace closely linked to the intellectual
trajectory of the 'West', but a conception of the 'local' as non-modern
and non-Western]{.underline} often [re-appears]{.underline}: This
requires that local academies and policymakers beyond the already
liberal international community are enabled to develop theoretical
approaches to understanding their own predicaments and situations,
without these being tainted by Western, liberal, and developed world
orthodoxies and interests. In other words, to gain an understanding of
the 'indigenous' and everyday factors for the overall project of
building peace, liberal or otherwise, a via media needs to be developed
between emergent local knowledge and the orthodoxy of international
prescriptions and assumptions about peace. (Richmond, 2009: 571,
emphasis added) [There is a clear emphasis here on the need to engage
with the 'indigenous' or 'authentic' traditions of non-Western life,
which seems to reflect an **underlying assumption of cultural difference
as the primary division** between these two parties. This reproduces the
division between the liberal, rational, modern West and a culturally
distinct space of the 'local]{.underline}'. Indeed, the call for a
post-liberal peace is often a call for peacebuilding to reflect a more
'culturally appropriate form of politics' (Richmond, 2011: 102) that is
more empathetic and emancipatory. This emphasis on tradition and
cultural norms as constitutive of the 'local' is carried through in
recent research on interventions in Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands.
These focus largely on the reinvigoration of 'customary' houses and
institutions as a form of 'critical agency' in distinction to liberal
institutions and the state (Richmond, 2011: 159--182). The point here is
not simply that there is an account of alterity or cultural difference
within the politics of intervention, but that [the liberal/local
distinction appears to be the central ontological fulcrum upon which the
rest of the political and ethical problems sit]{.underline} (see also
Chandler, 2010b: 153). Therefore, 'local' or 'everyday' 'agency' is seen
to be best expressed to the extent that it reclaims 'the customary' and
is not 'co-opted' by the internationals. It is understood as enhanced
where codes of 'customary law' become part of the new constitutional
settlement. A similar division can be seen in Mac Ginty's (2011)
framework, which sees the hybridities in peacebuilding as emerging at
the intersection of the 'international' and 'local' agents and
institutions. Again, this framework is built on an ontological
distinction between the two that repeatedly splits the
'Western'/'international' from the 'non-Western'/'local'. Even though
this is well qualified, overall Mac Ginty (2011: 94) defends this
distinction, arguing that if one were to abandon such potentially
problematic labels then this would lead to an abandonment of research
altogether. This can quite straightforwardly be read as a defence of the
basic ontology of the project, which is an ontology of the distinction
between the West and its Others, which meet through various forms of
hybridization. While Mac Ginty does not pursue the ethics of the
post-liberal peace in the same way as Richmond, [the]{.underline}
underlying intellectual [framework also uses this distinction as the
analytic pivot of the research]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} earlier
[define]{.underline}d [Eurocentrism as the **belief in Western
distinctiveness**]{.underline}, and I have argued that [this is
**philosophically fundamental to this strand of the critical
literature** that grapples with the relationship between the 'liberal'
and the 'local'.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} strand [has put
substantial analytic weight on fundamental cultural differences between
these two entities]{.underline}, even while disavowing any essentialism
and making some substantive conceptual efforts to move away from this.
[Such difficulties are indicative of the **deep hold that this
particular avatar of Eurocentrism has on the critical
imaginary**.]{.underline} By contrast, [the point made by]{.underline} a
wide variety of [other 'postcolonial' writers has precisely been against
such an ontology of the international, pointing instead to the
historically **blurred, intertwined and mutually constituted** character
of global historical space and 'culture']{.underline} (Bhabha, 2004;
Bhambra, 2010).

**Non-western IR [essentializes]{.underline} cultural tropes of non-US
peoples\-\--turns the K, reifies imperialism and undermines any
intellectual gains in their framework**

**Mena 20**, PhD Student at the department of International Relations at

production of Chinese International thought, China´s political economy
and the expansion of global capitalism (Ferran Perez, "The Trap of
Diversity: What Constitutes 'Non-Western IR Theory'?," E-IR,
<https://www.e-ir.info/2020/05/08/the-trap-of-diversity-what-constitutes-non-western-ir-theory/>)

[During the last decade]{.underline}, the field of International
Relations ([IR]{.underline}) [has witnessed the emergence of
'non-Western IR theory']{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan's seminal work
titled Non-Western International Relations Theory: Perspectives on and
Beyond Asia (2009) marked a watershed for the discipline. Acharya and
Buzan's book contributed to a disciplinary self-reflection, which
resulted in a wide range of academic publications aimed at turning the
field of IR into a more pluralistic discipline that respects the
subaltern voices that have been silenced by the imperial origins of IR.
For this reason, the celebration of 'cultural diversity' as an
ontological source has become the central focus of new theoretical
endeavours. Both the projects of 'Global IR' (Acharya, 2016; Yong-Soo,
2019) led by the prestigious scholar Amitav Acharya and the various
'national schools of International Relations' (Cho, 2013; Qin, 2018;
Shahi, 2019; Shih et al., 2019; Yan, 2019; Zhao, 2019) are prime
examples of this new phenomena. [Despite the welcoming efforts of
promoting 'cultural diversity']{.underline} (Acharya, 2016; Reus-Smit,
2018; Tickner and Blaney, 2012) to produce theoretical projects that
seek to transcend both the 'Western' and 'imperial' origins of the
discipline, [the field of IR has fallen into a dangerous dynamic that
stems from the very imperial origins of discipline: the **reification of
culture as an essentialist construction**]{.underline}. In this sense,
[essentialism is 'the view that cultures have fundamental or "essential"
properties, among them their values and beliefs']{.underline} (Goodhart
2003, p.940). [In the late 19th century, Western imperialism had to
imagine essentialist cultural forms]{.underline} beyond the domains of
the 'West' [to rationalise its 'civilising mission']{.underline} (Said,
2014). [In a historical and disciplinary twist]{.underline}, both [the
celebration of 'cultural diversity']{.underline} and the promotion of
pluralism have allowed and [legitimised the arrival of 'essentialist'
theoretical projects by a disciplinary 'back door']{.underline}. Put it
differently, [in an act of disciplinary redemption, the field of IR has
accepted forms of theorising that would have been disqualified some
years ago due to their essentialist tendency. For instance, the
celebrated 'Chinese school of IR' solely reactivates Confucianism as an
ontological source, dismissing thus other political traditions that
exist or have existed in China such as 1930's]{.underline} revolutionary
Chinese thought, Mao Zedong's thought, Buddhism or even a 'sinicised'
Islam. In this way, only Confucianism is equated with Chineseness.
Regarding the project of 'Global IR', Hurrel (2016, p.150), wisely
warned us about the dangers of [Global IR]{.underline} as it
'[can]{.underline} also [lead to a cultural and regional inwardness that
may **work to reproduce** the very ethnocentricities that are being
challenged']{.underline}. [This is perhaps one of the main paradoxes
that exist in IR given the massive and recent disciplinary efforts to
evade such 'essentialist' constructions]{.underline}. This is what I
call the 'trap of diversity' in IR. It is worth mentioning that the
production of 'non-Western IR theory' has manifested several degrees of
'essentialism'. Although, there are some great contributions (Hurrel,
2016) that seek to transcend these dynamics. Nonetheless, I contend that
such essentialism that informs the production of 'non-Western IR theory'
is a result of the impact of the 'dual legacy' (Chibber, 2018) of Edward
Said's Orientalism in the discipline of IR. As Chibber (2018, p.37)
argues '\[Said's\] legacy is therefore a dual one -- propelling the
critique of imperialism into the very heart of the mainstream on the one
hand, but also giving strength to intellectual fashions that have
undermined the possibility of that very critique'. Specifically, [in the
field of 'non-Western IR theory', these academic trends have been
crystallised in]{.underline} (neo)-Weberian and postmodern approaches
and [a problematic scholarly tendency to understand the production of
international theory as an independent intellectual process that is
completely disjointed from a specific form of political economy or
material reality]{.underline}. In this light, the main challenge that
the IR discipline has to address is the legacy of 'Western cultural
imperialism', in an idealist fashion, rather than the specific social
and geo-economic structure that both enabled and shaped the form in
which 'Western IR' has been materialised since 1919. As a result of this
idealist critique, it is widely recognised that 'cultural
representation' (Acharya, 2014) is indeed the deep structural problem of
the IR discipline rather than the material historical pillars and
infrastructure that enabled its emergence. The logical consequence of
this has been the mainstream approach that understands 'non-Western IR
thought' as the theory produced in non-western societies, which are in
opposition to the conventional geography of an eternal 'West'. Hence the
apparent importance of Confucianism, Hinduism or political Islam as
'non-Western' ontological sources in the new theoretical formulations.
[The activation of such cultural imaginaries as ontological foundations
from 'non-Western' societies]{.underline} in the context of the
production of 'non-Western IR theory' [is conceived as the logical step
towards a more pluralistic and 'cultural' egalitarian
discipline]{.underline}. [It is worth clarifying that I am not arguing
against cultural diversity. Cultural diversity is the very foundation of
humanity. On the contrary]{.underline}, I argue that [it is important to
critically engage with the very enterprise of 'non-Western IR theory' in
its current disciplinary form]{.underline}. Despite the respectable
efforts to turn the IR discipline into a more pluralistic field,
[critical scholars have taken for granted the essentialist notion of
'non-Western IR theory', uncritically assuming that such theory is only
produced in non-Western societies in a binary contrast to that of
conventional IR]{.underline}. [This not only reifies 'the West' as an
eternal and fixed entity but also **orientalises the
'non-West'**]{.underline}. For this reason, this article seeks to answer
the following question: what constitutes 'non-Western IR theory'.

To properly analyse the production of 'non-Western IR theory', we first
need to sketch out what we mean by 'the West' and its relationship with
the emergence of the IR discipline. In the next section, following the
work of Kees van der Pijl, I will define the 'West' as what he describes
as the 'Lockean Heartland'. The 'Lockean heartland' and the origins of
the IR discipline In his work titled The Discipline of Western
Supremacy. Modes of Foreign Relations and political economy, volume III,
the critical scholar Kees van der Pijl (2014) attributed the origins of
the IR discipline to the imperial pulses of what he describes as the
'Lockean heartland' (1998, 2006, 2007, 2014). According to Van der Pijl
(2006, p.13), 'the heartland is therefore best understood not as some
massive central island but as a networked social and geo-economic
structure comprising a number of (originally English speaking) states
and a regulatory infrastructure. Expansion occurs on two dimensions: one
of capital, to global proportions; and the other of the West, which by
definition has a more limited reach. In their combined advance across
the globe, the two progress in tandem was a way of live, a culture, and
a politics, with their means of coercion complementing discipline'. Its
Lockean nature stemmed from the specific legal culture which was
epitomised by Locke's Two Treatises of Government that took a
transnational form after the immigration from the British Isles to North
America and the settle colonialism that followed thereafter. Such
state/complex was sealed in the British Isles after the Glorious
Revolution in 1688. According to Van der Pijl (2006, p.8), 'the Lockean
state, governed by a constitutional monarch controlled by a parliament,
is the true bourgeois political formation; a state that 'serves' a
largely self-regulating, 'civil' society by protecting private property
at home and abroad'. This last point is crucial because it was the main
ontological source of the idealist IR theory produced in the 'Lockean
heartland' at the beginning of the 20th century. In parallel, during the
17th century, the expansion of the heartland and the Protestant
Reformation mounted geopolitical pressures on other contender states
such as catholic France. To not be dispossessed and 'resist
peripheralization by the Lockean heartland' (Van der Pijl 1998, p.78)
and catch-up with it, France was forced to develop a strong state. The
specific form of the new French state was described by Van der Pijl
(1998, p.79) as the 'prototype of the Hobbesian contender state'. Such
Hobbesian state/complex was characterised by 'the paramountcy of the
state as the institution driving forward the social formation and
pre-emptively shaping, by action, sometimes revolution from above, the
social institutions which have evolved 'organically, if not necessarily
autonomously, in the heartland' (Van der Pijl 1998, p.80). In such
state/complex, society is completely confiscated in favour of the social
and economic development of the state. As I will demonstrate later on,
this point is crucial to understand the production of 'non-Western IR
theory'. As Van der Pijl (1998, p.83; 2006, p.1) argues, the structure
of the 'Lockean heartland' vis-a-vis contender states has been the main
structural divide of world politics since the European Enlightenment
until the present. The evolution of international affairs has been
characterised by the expansion of the 'Lockean heartland' and the (semi
or full) integration of several contender states such as France,
Prussia, Japan, the Soviet Union, China to its expansionist network.
Against this backdrop, the origins of the IR discipline in 1919 was
marked by the willingness of the Anglo-American ruling elites of the
heartland via education institutions to produce academic knowledge to
legitimise and guide their imperial expansion. For this reason, as
Schmidt argues in (Van der Pijl 2014, p. viii) 'the academic discipline
is marked by British, and especially, American parochialism'. As we have
seen since its origins, the evolution of IR has gone hand in hand with
the imperial project of the Liberal West after the First World War. Due
to the historical evolution of the 'Lockean heartland' and its
dialectical relation with other contender states, the production of
international thought in its core was crystallised in an idealist form.
As Walker (1993, p.42) points out, 'if it is necessary to identify a
tradition of international relations theory, then the most appropriate
candidate is not 'realism' but 'idealism'. As Van der Pijl argues (2014,
p.ix), 'English-speaking social thought, which today dominates academic
life the world over, remains locked into the antinomy between
(materialist) empiricism and (religious-idealist) moral judgement.
Contender states and 'non-Western IR theory' With this in mind, I argue
that, paradoxically, the current production of mainstream 'non-Western
IR theory' (Cho, 2013; Qin, 2018; Shahi, 2019; Shih et al., 2019; Yan,
2019; Zhao, 2019) has been informed by the antinomy between
(materialist) empiricism and (religious-idealist) moral judgement, which
is the main characteristic of the 'English-speaking social thought' and
not that of other external societies to the Lockean heartland. In this
vein, despite the influences of Daoism and Confucianism in their
theoretical propositions, both Qin's constructivist relational theory
(2018) and Yan's moral realism (2019) are a case in point. The existence
of such persistent antinomy explains why the production of 'non-Western
IR theory' has been materialised in its current form and its unable to
transcend the logics imbued by the imperial origins of the discipline.
On the contrary, to overcome the 'trap of diversity' in the field of IR,
I propose an alternative path to conceive the development of
'non-Western IR theory'. Against culturalist approaches, I argue that
'non-Western IR thought' should be better understood as the knowledge
informed by the legacy of the structural experience of several
historical contender states since the 18th century. Put it differently,
the production of 'non-Western IR thought', rather than being a product
of a reified and sealed cultural background, is the logical consequence
of the knowledge that emerges from a specific structural position of a
given society within the wider historical structure of the 'Lockean
heartland' vis-a-vis contender states. In this vein, the distinctiveness
of the production of international knowledge in the 'non-West' is not
solely manifested by a cultural divergence but a structural one. In this
light, the primacy of the state over society, which is one of the main
characteristics of the contender states experience, is perhaps one of
the fundamental ontological foundations that has shaped the production
of 'non-Western IR Theory' since the 18th century. For this reason, in
addition to the 'Global IR' and the 'national schools of IR', the
international thought produced in contender states such as 18th century
France, Prussia, imperial Japan or the Soviet Union could also be
described as being produced in a non-Western setting. For instance,
following my argument, ontologically speaking, Prussian political
realism which is always regarded as the quintessential IR theory of the
'universal' West, has more in common with the Qin's Confucian relational
IR project (Qin, 2018) than with Anglo-Saxon liberalism. Both
theoretical projects are shaped by the same ontological premise of the
primacy of the state over society. For this reason, in the context of
the production of IR theory in China, the reactivation of Confucianism
as an ontological source to build the 'Chinese school of IR' is not a
solely consequence of its eternal existence within the Chinese
civilization but also due its political meaning within the wider
structural position of China. Put it differently, Confucianism is indeed
a political tradition that gives primacy of the state over society and
can rationalize best the structural contender posture of contemporary
China. This crucial structural ontological foundation that shapes the
production of 'non-Western IR theory' is one of the elements that has
been obscured by the dominant essentialist approaches that exist within
the discipline of IR. During the past decade, the field has tended to
emphasise the ontological value of 'cultural otherness' rather than the
existence of universal structural elements that are reproduced in
different cultural settings due to the geopolitical pressures of the
'Lockean heartland'. The obscuration of this crucial point not only has
to do with the internal evolution of the IR discipline in the
Anglo-American academia and its postmodern drift, but also with the
neoliberal forces that has shaped the discipline since the 1980s.
Davenport (2019, p.535) argues that these 'debates \[the Third Debate\]
should be understood, in both its timing and its substance, as a
phenomenon of neoliberal globalization: it was the reflection into
disciplinary IR of the enormous transformations through with so many of
the structures and hierarchies that had characterized the modern age
were disintegrated'. It is worth mentioning that I am not dismissing the
importance of culture in the process of production of IR theory.
Cultural multiplicity plays a fundamental role in shaping theoretical
knowledge and the diverse cosmovisions that enable communities to make
sense of the world. Nonetheless, with the alternative path that I have
outlined above, I attempt to denaturalise the deep-seated interpretation
of the problematic dichotomy between 'Western IR theory' vs 'non-Western
IR theory' which is reproduced in most of the mainstream literature on
'non-Western IR theory'.

Conclusion

This article has argued that the uncritical engagement with 'cultural
diversity' in the discipline of IR, which has been epitomised by the
development of 'non-Western IR theory', has not succeeded in
transcending the 'imperial' or 'Western' origins of the discipline. On
the contrary, [the interpretation of the production of non-Western
International thought as the knowledge produced by societies beyond the
territories of the West has reinforced new forms of
essentialism]{.underline}. This is what I have described as 'the trap of
diversity' in IR. For this reason, [the form in which 'non-Western IR
theory' has materialised should be understood as a form of disciplinary
'identity politics', a struggle for the representation of]{.underline}
abstract and [reified cultural entities, rather than as a real
theoretical challenge to question its imperial foundations and the
material infrastructure that enabled that specific production of
knowledge]{.underline}. In other words, I maintain that **[these
approaches are a disciplinary 'dead-end']{.underline}**.

There appears to be lot of disagreement in moral philosophy. Whether
these many apparent disagreements are deep and irresolvable, I believe
there is at least one thing it is reasonable to agree on right now,
[[whatever]{.underline}]{.mark} general [**moral [view]{.mark}** [we
adopt]{.mark}]{.underline}: that [it is very [important to
reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk]{.mark} that
[all]{.mark}]{.underline} intelligent [[beings]{.mark} on this planet
are [eliminated by]{.mark} an **enormous
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} a [nuclear
war]{.underline}. How we might in fact try to reduce such existential
risks is discussed elsewhere. My claim here is only that we --- whether
we're [[consequentialists]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[deontologists]{.underline}]{.mark}, or **[virtue
[ethicists]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- should [[all
agree]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we should try to save the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}.

According to [[consequentialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, we [should
[maximize]{.mark} the [good]{.mark}]{.underline}, where this is taken to
be the goodness, [[from]{.mark} an **[impartial
perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of outcomes. Clearly one thing that
makes an outcome good is that the people in it are doing well. There is
little disagreement here. [If]{.underline} the [happiness or well-being
of]{.underline} possible future [people is]{.underline} just as
[important]{.underline} as that of people who already exist, and if they
would have good lives, it is [not hard to see how reducing existential
risk is easily the **most important** thing]{.underline} in the whole
world. This is for the familiar reason that there are so many people who
could exist in the future --- there are trillions upon trillions... upon
trillions.

There are so many possible future people that reducing existential risk
is arguably the most important thing in the world, even if the
well-being of these possible people were given only 0.001% as much
weight as that of existing people. Even on a wholly person-affecting
view --- according to which there's nothing (apart from effects on
existing people) to be said in favor of creating happy people --- the
case for reducing existential risk is very strong. As noted in this
seminal paper, this case is strengthened by the fact that there's a good
chance that many existing people will, with the aid of life-extension
technology, live very long and very high quality lives.

You might think what I have just argued applies to consequentialists
only. There is a tendency to assume that, if an argument appeals to
consequentialist considerations (the goodness of outcomes), it is
irrelevant to non-consequentialists. But that is a huge mistake.
[[Non-consequentialism]{.underline}]{.mark} is the
[[view]{.underline}]{.mark} that [there's [more]{.mark} that
**determines rightness** [than]{.mark}]{.underline} the goodness of
consequences or [[outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}; it is [[not]{.mark} the
view]{.underline} that [[the latter don't matter]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Even John Rawls wrote, "[All ethical doctrines]{.underline} worth our
attention [take consequences into account in judging
**rightness**]{.underline}. One which did not would simply be
irrational, crazy." Minimally plausible versions of [deontology
and]{.underline} virtue [[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark} must be
[[concerned]{.underline}]{.mark} in part [[with
promoting]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[good]{.underline}]{.mark}, [from an
**impartial** point of view]{.underline}. They'd thus [imply **very
strong reasons** to reduce existential risk]{.underline}, at least when
this doesn't significantly involve doing harm to others or damaging
one's character.

What's even more surprising, perhaps, is that even if our own good (or
that of those near and dear to us) has much greater weight than goodness
from the impartial "point of view of the universe," indeed even if the
latter is entirely morally irrelevant, we may nonetheless have very
strong reasons to reduce existential risk. Even egoism, the view that
each agent should maximize ~~her~~ \[their\] own good, might imply
strong reasons to reduce existential risk. It will depend, among other
things, on what one's own good consists in. If well-being consisted in
pleasure only, it is somewhat harder to argue that egoism would imply
strong reasons to reduce existential risk --- perhaps we could argue
that one would maximize her expected hedonic well-being by funding life
extension technology or by having herself cryogenically frozen at the
time of her bodily death as well as giving money to reduce existential
risk (so that there is a world for her to live in!). I am not sure,
however, how strong the reasons to do this would be. But views which
imply that, if I don't care about other people, I have no or very little
reason to help them are not even minimally plausible views (in addition
to hedonistic egoism, I here have in mind views that imply that one has
no reason to perform an act unless one actually desires to do that act).

To be minimally plausible, egoism will need to be paired with a more
sophisticated account of well-being. To see this, it is enough to
consider, as Plato did, the possibility of a ring of invisibility ---
suppose that, while wearing it, Ayn could derive some pleasure by
helping the poor, but instead could derive just a bit more by severely
harming them. Hedonistic egoism would absurdly imply she should do the
latter. To avoid this implication, egoists would need to build something
like the meaningfulness of a life into well-being, in some robust way,
where this would to a significant extent be a function of
other-regarding concerns (see chapter 12 of this classic intro to
ethics). But once these elements are included, we can (roughly, as
above) argue that this sort of egoism will imply strong reasons to
reduce existential risk. Add to all of this Samuel Scheffler's recent
intriguing arguments (quick podcast version available here) that most of
what makes our lives go well would be undermined if there were no future
generations of intelligent persons. On his view, my life would contain
vastly less well-being if (say) a year after my death the world came to
an end. So obviously if Scheffler were right I'd have very strong reason
to reduce existential risk.

We should also take into account [[moral
uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}. What is it reasonable for one to do,
when one is uncertain not (only) about the empirical facts, but also
about the moral facts? I've just argued that there's agreement among
minimally plausible ethical views that we have strong reason to reduce
existential risk --- not only consequentialists, but also deontologists,
virtue ethicists, and sophisticated egoists should agree. But even
[[those]{.underline}]{.mark} (hedonistic egoists) [[who **disagree**
should have]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[significant]{.underline}]{.mark}
level of [[confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} that they are mistaken, and
that one of the above views is correct. [Even if]{.underline} they were
[90% sure]{.underline} that [their view is the correct one]{.underline}
(and 10% sure that one of these other ones is correct), [they would
have]{.underline} pretty [strong reason]{.underline}, from the
standpoint of moral uncertainty, [to reduce existential
risk]{.underline}. Perhaps most disturbingly still, [[even if we are
**only 1% sure**]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[well-being]{.mark}
of]{.underline} possible future [people [matters]{.mark}]{.underline},
it is at least arguable that, from the standpoint of moral uncertainty,
[[reducing]{.mark} [existential risk is the **most important**]{.mark}
thing in the world]{.underline}. Again, this is largely for the reason
that there are so many people who could exist in the future --- there
are trillions upon trillions... upon trillions. (For more on this and
other related issues, see this excellent dissertation).

RA: At the Buffalo conference on pain, you gave a paper that built on
some of the insights of your then most recent book, Thermonuclear
Monarchy. 1 In the book, you demonstrate the incompatibility of
democracy and nuclear arms at least in part on the grounds that, by the
nature of their deployment, nuclear arms make it impossible for the
populace to consent to their use. In your talk, you made a different but
related claim that focused on the relative silence of the population
regarding nuclear arms in the post-Cold War era. You were concerned, in
particular, with the difficulties of imagining the consequences of
nuclear war. I wonder if you could expand on this second point: [why it
is so hard to think about **[nuclear war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} ES: The
two points are deeply related. [The architecture]{.underline} of nuclear
arms [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the population **be
eliminated from the decision about**]{.underline}]{.mark} going to
[**[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It also requires that Congress be
eliminated from the decision about going to war---just because [the
nature of the **[tech]{.mark}**nology requires a tiny number of people
to do the launch. [The result]{.mark}]{.underline} of that architecture
[[is that people]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually, over seven decades,
[[have internalized]{.mark} the fact [that they're **worthless** when it
comes to the need to defend the country]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
carry out acts of mutual aid toward one another. We now simply abandon
the right of self-defense and the right of mutual aid and give unlimited
injuring power to the executive branch of government and fall silent.
RA: How much responsibility, how much blame, does one give to the
population for remaining silent? ES: That has always been a question.
Gandhi said, ''You can wake a man who's asleep, but you can't wake a man
who's pretending to be asleep.'' His statement marks a fork in the road.
If the population has been anesthetized and is genuinely asleep, then
they are morally innocent (even if infantilized and terribly reduced as
moral agents). [If]{.underline} instead [the population is pretending to
be asleep, [we are]{.mark} **morally [culpable]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
the population is [**[complicit with the genocide]{.mark}**
that's]{.underline} standing in the wings [**[waiting to
happen]{.mark}**.]{.underline} During my lecture and in many years of
working on disarmament, I stressed the first path and tried to outline
why waking up is difficult. In recent months, I've moved closer to the
position that your question identifies, the responsibility of the
population. I feel the force of Martin Luther King's statement,
''**[There comes a time when silence is betrayal]{.underline}**.'' I'm
almost at the point of believing that [[there is]{.mark} a wanton
[refusal to \[recognize\]]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~see~~ [the **imminent
[peril]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a refusal [[to]{.mark}
understand]{.underline} not just [that [we have a **responsibility to
reverse it**]{.mark},]{.underline} to dismantle it, but that **[we have
the ability to do so]{.underline}**, and that [[if we don't, **it is
going to happen**]{.mark}.]{.underline} I don't know if it's going to
happen this year. Or whether it's going to happen this century. But it's
almost inconceivable that it isn't going to happen. RA: Why is it that
people have such a hard time understanding this? If you allow that
people might honestly and ardently be trying to understand, what is it
that is getting in the way? ES: Four or five answers come to mind.
First, [[people]{.mark} often [lack]{.mark} key [pieces of
information]{.mark}.]{.underline} If you ask someone in this country
which nations have nuclear weapons, they are likely to say Iraq (which
has none), Iran (which has none), or North Korea (which has fewer than
60; leading experts say fewer than 20). The United States has 6,500. The
United States and Russia together own 93 percent of the world arsenal:
the other 7 percent is owned by the other seven nuclear states---in
order of numerical possession, France, China, the United Kingdom,
Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea (see fig. 1). An equally
profound misconception held by US citizens is the belief that our
nuclear architecture is for ''defense'' and ''retaliation.'' In fact we
have had a ''presidential first-use'' policy for the whole nuclear age.
The profound obscenity of that arrangement, which has only begun to be
glimpsed with the current president, has been an equally grave moral
wrong from day one. Second, [even [when]{.mark}]{.underline} American
~~citizens~~ \[[[denizens]{.underline}]{.mark}\] and residents
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[information, the outcome is
derealized by its **being future**]{.underline}]{.mark}---that is, [[the
unreality something has by having not yet happened is conflated with the
unreality something might have by being]{.mark} **merely
[imaginary]{.mark}**.]{.underline} People, it's true, are uninformed.
But once they become informed, even then the flash of insight fades from
their eyes after about ten minutes. RA: Why do you think that is? ES:
Because **[[they think ''future'' equals
''unreal.'']{.underline}]{.mark}** But we need to stop and understand
what we mean by ''future.'' [[If it takes 10,000 steps to put]{.mark} a
[nuclear architecture **in**]{.mark}to place, [9,999 steps have]{.mark}
already [been completed]{.mark}:]{.underline} we know how to split the
atom; we know how to provide enriched uranium; we know how to deliver
the bomb; we've completed not only the theoretical steps but the
materialization steps: we've made the bombs; we've completed the
delivery systems---Ohio-class submarines, the land-based ICBMs, and
airdelivery B-2s and B-52s. Unlike in China and India, the weapons in
the United States are already ''mated'' to the delivery systems; they
are on alert; specific weapons have been assigned to specific cities in
the countries of present enemies and, yes, even potential enemies. One
step remains: the order to launch. So 9,999 steps are present and
accounted for; one remains undone. While the 9,999 steps took vast
amounts of time and resources, the last one is designed to be carried
out in minutes. The word ''future'' does not apply to the 9,999 steps,
only to the last one. [[When people decline to address]{.mark} the
[nuclear peril on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[grounds that it is]{.mark}
an ''[unreal'']{.mark} worry]{.underline} because ''following the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki it hasn't yet happened,'' [[they
are]{.mark} **unknowingly [allying themselves
with]{.mark}**]{.underline} the position that [our]{.underline} own
Department of State and [**[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f
**[D]{.mark}**efense]{.underline} took in 1995. At that time,
seventy-eight countries asked the International Court of Justice to
declare the possession, threat of use, and use of nuclear weapons
illegal on the basis of the humanitarian and environmental instruments
such as the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide, the Geneva Protocols, the Declaration of Saint Petersburg,
the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Rio
Declaration on Environment and Poverty, and many others. Though the
United States worked to invalidate the application of these protocols to
our nuclear weapons one at a time, an argument they used over and over
was that the firing of the weapons was ''future,'' hence
''hypothetical,'' hence ''suppositional''---this despite the billions of
dollars that each year go into polishing and oiling the architecture of
earth's destruction to keep it in a present-tense state of constant
readiness. RA: At the conference you also spoke about the problem of
''statistical compassion.'' ES: Let's call that the third reason why the
population is asleep. [American indifference to our own genocidal
nuclear architecture comes from the **constraints on compassion** when
**large numbers** of people \[become\]]{.underline} ~~stand~~ [to be
injured]{.underline}. Public health [physicians distinguish between
narrative compassion]{.underline} (where one or two or three people are
at risk) [and **statistical compassion**]{.underline} (where thousands
or millions are at risk).2 [We're fairly good at the first]{.underline},
and have many occasions to strengthen our capacity through daily acts of
friendship and from reading literature. [We're terrible at the
second]{.underline}, and have almost no training in strengthening our
feeble abilities in this region. The nuclear peril of course entails the
second: recent work on nuclear winter by Alan Robock and his colleagues
shows that [[if]{.mark} even [a small fraction of the]{.mark} current
[world arsenal is fired]{.mark}]{.underline} (one one-hundredth of one
percent of the total available blast power), [[forty-four million people
will be casualties]{.mark} on the first afternoon [and one billion in
the weeks following. The]{.mark} small [shrug people make when the
subject of nuclear weapons comes up]{.mark}]{.underline}---the little
lift and fall of the shoulders---[[means they have]{.mark} just [run
a]{.mark} quick [check on]{.mark} their interior brain-and-soul
[equipment and can report: nope, **nothing in there in**]{.mark} **the
way of [statistical compassion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} RA: Narrative
compassion and statistical compassion seem to take place in widely
separate spheres. How then do you see them coming into conflict with
each other? ES: For me, a frightening example occurred in the Bulletin
of Atomic Scientists, the wholly admirable body that sets the Doomsday
Clock (now at two minutes to midnight) and that works round the clock to
educate the people of the United States and the world about the hazards
of nuclear weapons. Yet in commemorating the seventieth anniversary of
the Nagasaki bombing in August of 2015, they published a historically
factual narrative about the pilots of the plane delivering the atom bomb
to Nagasaki, how many things went wrong and had to be repaired
midflight. The lead-in read, ''A typhoon was coming, the fuel pump
failed, they had to switch planes, things were wired incorrectly, they
missed their rendezvous, they couldn't see the primary target, they ran
out of gas on the way home, and they had to crash-land.'' But the worst
part was when ''the Fat Man atomic bomb started to arm itself,
mid-flight.''3 The story, narrated in edge-ofyour-seat suspense, is an
example of narrative compassion utterly preempting the possibility of
statistical compassion: the crew might die, but if they had in fact died
over the Pacific, tens of thousands of persons would not have been
burned into nonexistence that day. RA: Your emphasis at the conference
was on the nature of physical pain itself. ES: Yes, that was my central
subject. In terms of our conversation now, we can say that a fourth and
fifth reason for [indifference arise from the difficulty of
**comprehending pain**]{.underline}, whether it takes place in one
person's body or in the bodies of millions, and whether it occurs in the
past, present, or future. (But if I were listing the reasons in the
order of importance, these two would be near the top.) Once we exhaust a
small handful of adjectives for physical pain, two (and almost only two)
metaphors arise: the metaphor of the weapon (one may say it feels as
though a knife is sticking in my shoulder blade even if it isn't); and
that of body damage (one may say it feels as though my elbow has snapped
in two, even if it hasn't). The Body in Pain concentrates on problems
arising from the first; a later essay (''Among Schoolchildren'')
concentrates on the second.4 Both metaphors, if carefully controlled,
can help us understand the felt experience of another person's pain; but
both are highly volatile and can lead us far away from understanding. An
example of the benign or genuinely expressive potential is provided by
findings in neuroscience that we have mirror neurons that help us
recognize another person's physical pain. When you look at the actual
experiments that were done, however, you see that the test subject is
asked not to listen to a sufferer's report of pain but to observe, for
example, a pin being stuck into someone's hand or the administration of
a small electric shock. The experiments show not our comprehension of
another person's pain but our recognition of the aversivenes of being
subjected to a weapon---often closely related to but by no means
identical with physical pain. [The very fact that a weapon can be
separated from the site of the injury means that the attributes of pain
can be lifted away from the sufferer and conferred on the agents
inflicting the harm, so now it is not the pain that is world destroying
but the inflictor of the pain]{.underline}. There are many examples of
this in the case of nuclear weapons. For example, the mushroom cloud is
often regarded as ''awesome,'' some even say ''sublime.'' But the
hibakasha, the survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, say, ''We saw no
mushroom cloud.'' A mushroom cloud is what you see if you're an observer
far away, seated high in the sky in the airplane that dropped the
weapon, or standing on the ground scores of miles beyond the radius of
the harm. Like any sensible mortal, I admire J. Robert Oppenheimer, but
his endlessly quoted statement following the Trinity test, ''I
remembered the line from the Hindu scripture \...I am become Death, the
destroyer of worlds,'' allows the scale of the injury to be transferred
across the weapon and conferred on the agents, who now perceive
themselves as magnificent, thrilling, almighty in their power.
Oppenheimer even prefaces the quotation by saying that Vishnu here takes
on a multi-armed form ''to impress'' the prince. The name he chose for
the test, ''Trinity,'' shows this same fabrication of godlikeness. What
if instead Oppenheimer had said, ''I remembered the goddess Guanyin
whose name means 'The one who perceives the sounds of the world' and the
sounds I heard were excruciating cries, unbearable shrieks of tens of
thousands scalded together in an instant of molten flesh.'' The first
statement is a fiction: Oppenheimer is neither a multi-armed god nor a
three-personed god; the second statement (could we hear Guanyin) is
accurate; if we could internalize and practice the second statement, we
would disarm immediately. [The image of the nuclear weapon,]{.underline}
which might help make visible the pain and suffering it will bring
about, [instead captures the gigantic scale of the suffering, only to
lift that ''giganticism'' away from the site of suffering altogether and
confer it on the human agents]{.underline}---ordinary men, small in
stature and in number, but who now appear gigantic. [Insofar as any
shred of ''suffering'' still remains visible, we believe it is the
suffering of the nowgigantic human agent who is in mighty peril. Thus
[the nation spends billions]{.mark} of dollars [on a presidential
fallout shelter while convincing the public]{.mark} that fallout
[shelters]{.mark} for the population [are
ridiculous]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Thinking in an Emergency, and again
in Thermonuclear Monarchy, I contrast the Swiss shelter system---Swiss
law requires that every house have a fallout shelter;5 the law was
reaffirmed in a 2003 referendum that had an 80 percent turnout at the
polls---with the staggering constructions that have been made in the
United States for\... the people? no---for the president and those close
to him, a shelter inside a mountain, with buildings and a lake that is,
according to observers, large enough for waterskiing. One country,
[Switzerland, believes in what the Swiss call ''equality of survival'';
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} other country, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, **[believes]{.mark} that [only the agents of
nuclear \[disaster\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} ~~holocaust~~
[**[deserve]{.mark} the chance for [survival]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Much more detail on the multiple presidential fallout shelters is
described by Garrett M. Graff in a recent book, Raven Rock: The Story of
the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself---While the Rest of Us
Die. The nuclear architecture requires that either the weapon be
invisible (buried in a submarine or buried in a cornfield, like the 450
ICBMs) or, when it is visible, it must become the path across which the
magnificent prowess of the human agent is seen---he's so thrilling, so
important, so vulnerable; here, please, take my tax money, use all of it
to protect the man who will launch our nuclear missiles. What should
bring us to our knees in sorrow and shame instead brings about a dutiful
salute to the thermonuclear monarch. If one thinks fallout shelters for
the population are ridiculous (ignoring the fact that the medically
sophisticated Swiss have data showing otherwise), then it is informative
to contrast the money lavished on our nuclear architecture with ordinary
forms of safety structures for the population like bridges, dams, roads,
levees. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in their 2017 report on
infrastructure, gave our bridges a ''Cþ'' (56,000 are ''structurally
deficient''), our dams a ''D'' (2000 have a ''high-hazard potential''),
our levees a ''D'' (\$80 billion is needed for structural repair), and
our roads a ''D'' (one out of every five miles of highway pavement is
''in poor condition'').6 Might Americans be given a choice on whether
they want their taxes spent on infrastructure or---as is currently the
case---on nuclear weapons and presidential fallout shelters? Or has ''no
taxation without representation'' disappeared along with all our other
basic democratic principles?(112-118) RA: That all follows from the
instability of the weapon; what about the second field of
representation, body damage? ES: The phenomenon of body damage is like
the image of the weapon but works in a much different way---almost the
opposite. Whereas the problem of the weapon is its very separability
from the body (and the way to make it benign is to retether it to its
referent in the body), the problem of body damage is that it overlaps,
overrides, and eclipses the personhood of the one underneath the damage.
Either one looks away, or, if one looks, one recoils. Visual artists and
writers---from Peter Paul Rubens and Andrea Mantegna in the Renaissance
to fin de sie\`cle artists Ka¨the Kollwitz, Aubrey Beardsley, Edvard
Munch, Joris-Karl Huysmans, to twentieth-century Guatemalan writer
Miguel Asturias---all solve this problem by finding a way to double the
location, so that personhood remains intact in our perceptual field even
if the human body is at that moment being obscenely shredded. 118
Representations If you visit the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, you will
probably find yourself, as I did, surrounded by young schoolchildren,
who look with courage on the visages of those who were incompletely
incinerated in the bombing of that city (see figs. 2, 3, and 4). In the
United States, few adults face up to the faces of those harmed there. In
February of 2016, the Central Square Library in Cambridge agreed to let
me---and Joseph Gerson, an American Friends Service colleague---do a
monthlong program on the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with weekly
lectures and an exhibit of books, drawings, and photographs. The morning
after we put up the exhibit, we found all the photographs of injuries
had been removed. The effort to put on an exhibit about Hiroshima and
Nagasaki at the Smithsonian Institution in 1994 led to such controversy
that it had to be canceled---with one exception: the Enola Gay (the
plane that delivered the bomb) was put on display. Here we circle back
to the phenomenon of the weapon being perceptually severed from the site
of the pain. It's in part because of museums like those in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki that so many people in the Japanese population are passionately
in support of nuclear disarmament. In preparation for a disarmament
demonstration in New York, Cambridge and Boston activists (I include
myself) worked for months to bring supporters to the march: after
endless work, approximately one hundred did so. But one thousand
Japanese men and women arrived that morning in New York; they carried a
petition signed by six million of their countrymen, who collectively
paid for the travel costs of the thousand who came. RA: Can you provide
any examples of authors who ''double the location,'' as you have just
described, ''so that personhood remains intact'' while the ''human body
is being \...shredded''? ES: Miguel A´ngel Asturias's Men of Maize
begins with a heroic Indian in Guatemala, who ordinarily protects his
people no matter what; he is able to do so, in part, because he has a
level of sensory acuity that approaches genius. He knows the scent of
every flower; he can discern the whole recipe of scents present in the
forest in any given moment. The European colonizers can commit a
slaughter of his people only if they can divert this heroic leader; and
the only way to divert him is to subject him to horrible, scalding,
obscene pain. Asturias must convey to us the felt experience of pain,
the turning of the body inside out, and he chooses to do this through
the associated phenomenon of body damage; but in order to do so without
eclipsing the personhood of Gaspar Il´om, he decouples the body damage
from the hero. The book opens with a dog, which the invaders have used
as a test case for their pain-inducing poison laced with glass. The dog,
in excruciating pain, zooms hysterically through the village square,
covered with open sores, his penis erect, howling in a way that is
aversive to everyone who hears and sees. This horrible scene conveys the
obscenity of pain, the obscenity of bodily damage. By obscenity, I mean
interior substances in the body which come before us without our
consent, come before us before we are mentally prepared to comprehend
what we are seeing. But the story separates this bodily desecration from
the person, for now, having seen the dog, we need only be told that
Gaspar Il´om has drunk this glass-laced poison to understand why he
abandons his post, submerges himself in the lake, drinks all its waters,
and eventually comes out. He has survived. But during the moments when
he disappeared below the surface of the water, his people have been
slain. RA: I wonder how you think about the role of the visual in that
context. Do you think of the visual as akin to a language? ES: In visual
art one can see the same phenomenon taking place, as when Ka¨the
Kollwitz refuses to let an injured victim be portrayed as what Shelley
called ''a monstrous lump of ruin.'' In her 1900 etching and aquatint
The Downtrodden, she pushes the wounds on the body just beyond the
body's edge onto a linen sheet on which the person is lying. These
mouthlike, liplike structures of open wounds are there but are not
permitted to compromise figure 4. Photographs of survivors of the atomic
bomb in the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum. An Interview with Elaine Scarry
121 our recognition of the sufferer's personhood. Even somebody like
Aubrey Beardsley, in one of his posters, puts the wound in a tree rather
than on the body of the woman. And yet the woman has attributes that
make the viewer see the analogy, just like Marty South and the trees in
your account of Hardy's The Woodlanders \[Scarry is referring to Rachel
Ablow's account in Victorian Pain\]. Her posture, for example, is
exaggeratedly erect and treelike. She wears a high-waisted skirt that is
made to be a visual analogy with the tree. But our perception of her
personhood remains uninterrupted. RA: One issue you have raised recently
is the particular difficulty of thinking about the specific kinds of
injuries caused by nuclear war, namely burns. There was a striking
moment in your talk when you discussed the protocols used in burn units
to help doctors and nurses in looking at burn victims. It seems so
intuitively right that caretakers would have difficulty looking at these
patients. It seems to suggest something about the limits on the
imagination in terms of suffering. I'm wondering what it is about burns
that makes it so hard to imagine the suffering they entail. Is it about
the skin as the site of humanity? Is it about the face? ES: It is the
visage. Without preparation and help, when we see the complete
mutilation of the body, especially the face, we mistakenly feel we are
seeing the mutilation of personhood. The ''rule of nines'' is devised to
enable rescue workers to look at a gravely burned person and (instead of
having their own minds shut down in sorrow and confusion and revulsion)
to assess instantly the gravity of the injury, start appropriate
treatment, and report the scale of the injury to the hospital awaiting
the person's arrival. Each part of the body is assigned an
easy-to-remember number that is a multiple of nine (see fig. 5).
Counting forms a key part in many forms of emergency rescue, and this is
one instance. The numbers, once totaled, tell the rescuer the next step,
such as whether to insert an IV for fluid resuscitation. The need to
train the perceptions of those who hope to help those who are burned is
also illustrated by a procedure called ''staying.'' During the years
when I was part of a research group on suffering at the Hastings Center
for Ethics, I heard a lecture by a physician-nurse who worked in a burn
unit. She mentioned that because of the difficulty oflooking at a
severely burned person, nurses assigned to burn units may begin to avert
their eyes when speaking with a patient, decline to touch the patient,
or stand at a greater distance each day, or request a transfer after a
few days. To counteract these problems, caretakers can participate in a
class on ''staying'' where they recognize the temptation to withdraw
from the patient and practice trying to overcome that withdrawal. While
the ''rule of nines'' and ''staying'' are brilliant inventions, we
should recognize that in nuclear war there will be few rescue workers
and nurses. A study in the Netherlands of what would happen if a
terrorist brought into Rotterdam a very small 12 kg weapon (the size
used in World War II) found that of those who had not immediately
evaporated, four thousand persons would require burn beds.7 They noted
that in all of the Netherlands there are only a hundred burn beds. A
leading hospital in Boston, Mass General, has seven burn beds. The burn
beds themselves---what few there are---will disappear in a nuclear
strike. On the floor of the UK Parliament, the possession of four
Trident submarines has repeatedly been justified by the potential need
to bomb Moscow. In response, a Scottish study by John Ainslie looked at
the scale of damage that would actually take place if a nuclear missile
were launched against the Ministry of Defense building in Moscow: along
with the Ministry of Defense, four major hospitals would be destroyed
and four others subjected to fire and radiation that would make them
inoperable. Thirty-one schools would also be destroyed with at least
700,000 children slain.8 If the missile is larger, so, too, will the
disappearance of hospitals be larger. An article by Steven Starr, Lynn
Eden, and Theodore A. Postol in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists shows
that if an 800-kiloton weapon were detonated above Manhattan, the center
of the blast would be four times the temperature of the sun, and, within
''tens of minutes,'' a firestorm will cover 90 to 150 square miles.

RA: Was the artistic strategy that you just described of doubling the
location so as to protect personhood apparent in the real-world examples
you were citing, the Nagasaki children, the ''rule of nines,''
''staying''? ES: I think so. It is not accidental that the Nagasaki
Atomic Bomb Museum is itself physically beautiful in its architecture,
or that as you enter you pass lavish cascades of paper cranes, inspired
by the child Sadako Sasaki, like cherry blossoms in spring, or that you
see an inscription about Nagasaki's exceptional generosity to
outsiders---its many centuries of open trade with foreign companies, a
level of cosmopolitan hospitality not at that time found to the same
degree in other regions of Japan; you see engraved inscriptions from
Dwight D. Eisenhower and from the ''United States Strategic Bombing
Survey, Summary Report (Pacific War), July 1946'' saying unequivocally
that the atom bomb was not needed to end the war. All these elements,
and many others, keep the personhood of the city's inhabitants in view,
side-by-side with the excruciating vision of burnt faces. The ''rule of
nines'' lets one reconstruct the body out of a beneficent invention,
toylike in its simplicity. In ''staying,'' the very name of the
procedure holds the injury within the frame of sympathetic personhood.
RA: Let's return to Ghandi's forking path. You've sketched the reasons
why the US population is innocently sleeping. But what if they're
feigning sleep? ES: [I am]{.underline} sometimes [[floored by the
discrepancy between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[attention we give to
injuries]{.mark} that have happened **[when we can't do
anything]{.mark}**]{.underline} to change them [[and]{.mark} the
[attention we give to injuries that haven't yet happened when by
intervention we]{.mark} **absolutely [can prevent
them]{.mark}**.]{.underline} I don't know how to explain this.
[I]{.underline} have always [assumed]{.underline} that those [acts of
trying to talk about the pain of torture victims in the
1970s]{.underline} in my case, or the pain of people in World War II,
the Holocaust, that those acts [are meant to act as a warning to the
future. What is our motive for thinking about the **unchangeable
injuries** of the past if not to increase our ability to prevent such
injuries in the future? Yet almost incomprehensible is the distance
between the willingness to think about events from the past we can't
possibly change and the complete comfort with **feeling that future
massacres need not concern us**.]{.underline} Or worse, that one is
slightly superior to protesting a wrong: intellectually superior because
the moral wrong is an obvious moral wrong, and we only like to address
sophisticated, hard to discern moral wrongs. It might be embarrassing to
have to stand on a street corner with a sign or attend a public meeting.
[Imagine]{.underline}, though, [if we forgave the complicity with past
acts of enslavement or genocide by saying, ''People saw that it was
wrong, but they considered it too intellectually obvious, too
compromising of their dignity, to have to stand up and
protest]{.underline}.'' Or take the argument that the aspiration to
dismantle nuclear weapons is now many decades old, and we must turn to
fresh undertakings: imagine that someone tried to defend those who
tolerated slavery in 1860 because they had been hearing antislavery
sentiment since 1820 and now considered such sentiments ''stale.'' [We
would never give a ''pass'' to anyone in the past who **excused their
inattention to slavery**]{.underline} or the ~~transfer of people to
concentration camps~~ [on either of those two grounds; yet we believe
such **arguments release us from addressing weapons whose outcome is
instant genocide**.]{.underline} There are historical periods in which
people were dissuaded from protesting because dissidents were beaten
(Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate) or killed (Dietrich
Bonhoeffer in Germany). No such beatings or death threats excuse our own
silence today. RA: Staying with this point about the relative ease of
imagining pain past as opposed to pain in the future, do you attribute
that to sentimentality? It sounds so reprehensible put in those terms. I
wonder how you account for it. ES: I think you are right to worry that
[**our [attention to the past begins to look like
sentimentality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The argument is sometimes made by
academics that [sympathy is less about compassion or the desire to
ameliorate pain than it is a kind of **cultural signaling** of our moral
goodness. To me that thesis seems horrifying]{.underline}: it lets the
many who ignore past pain excuse their own inattention on the grounds
that the few who do attend to pain are only doing so to announce their
own goodness. So [I feel a strong aversion to that
argument;]{.underline} it works to reduce still further the number of
those who show any wish to help. However, if **[it turns out that
[we]{.mark} only [speak about irremediable injuries from the past
while]{.mark} a huge [architecture of massacre
\[is\]]{.mark}]{.underline}** ~~stands~~ **[[waiting]{.mark} to be
used]{.underline}**, then one has to ask oneself: why were we looking at
injuries in the distant past? Is it just sentimentality? Is it just
cultural signaling?9(124-5)

//CYang

One reason to **[trust [markets]{.mark}]{.underline}** is that [they
[are better]{.mark} at setting prices [than people. If you set prices
too high]{.mark}]{.underline}, many a [[socialist
government]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[found, citizens]{.mark} will be
**needlessly [deprived]{.mark}** [of goods. Set them too low, and there
will be excess]{.mark}ive [demand and]{.mark} **ensuing
[shortages]{.mark}**. This is true for all goods]{.underline}, including
health care and labor. And there is [**[little reason]{.mark}** to
believe]{.underline} that the [next batch of
[socialists]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington or London [[would
be]{.mark} **any [better]{.mark}** at setting prices [than their
**predecessors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [government-run health
care]{.underline} systems in Canada and European countries are [plagued
by long wait times]{.underline}. A 2018 Fraser Institute study cites a
median wait time of 19.8 weeks to see a specialist physician in Canada.
Socialists may argue that is a small price to pay for universal access,
but a [market-based approach]{.underline} can [deliver]{.underline} both
[**coverage** and **responsive** service]{.underline}. A [full
government]{.underline} takeover [isn't]{.underline} the only
[option]{.underline}, nor is it the best one.

Beyond that, markets are also good at rationing risk. Fundamentally,
socialists would like to reduce risk --- protect workers from any
personal or economywide shock. That is a noble goal, and some reduction
through better functioning safety nets is desirable. But getting rid of
all uncertainty --- as state ownership of most industries would imply
--- is a bad idea. Risk is what fuels growth. People who take more
chances tend to reap bigger rewards; that's why the top nine names on
the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans are not heirs to family
dynasties but are self-made entrepreneurs who took a leap to build new
products and created many jobs in the process.

Some leftist economists like Mariana Mazzucato [argue]{.underline} that
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} might be able to step in and [become
**laboratories for [innovation]{.mark}**. But that [would be a
**historical anomaly**]{.mark}; socialist]{.underline}-leaning
[governments]{.underline} have typically been [less innovative than
others]{.underline}. After all, [bureaucrats]{.underline} and
worker-corporate boards [have [**little incentive** to upset the
s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}]{.underline} or compete to build a better
widget. [[And]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[when government
programs]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[spurred
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [as in the]{.underline} case of the
[[internet]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[it took the **private sector** to
recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[value and create a
market]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And that brings us to a third reason to believe in markets:
productivity. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon, have looked to
today's economic problems and suggested that productivity growth --- the
engine that fueled so much of the progress of the last several decades
--- is over. In this telling, the resources, products, and systems that
underpin the world's economy are all optimized, and little further
progress is possible.

But that is hard to [square with **reality**. [Innovation]{.mark} helps
economies [do more with fewer resources]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[**increasingly [critical]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} addressing
[climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}, for example --- which is a [form
of productivity growth]{.underline}. And likewise, many of the products
and [[technologies people **rely on**]{.mark} **every day** [did not
exist]{.mark}]{.underline} a few [years ago]{.underline}. These [goods
make inaccessible services]{.underline} more [available]{.underline} and
are changing the nature of work, often for the better. Such
[[gains]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[made possible by
**capitalist**]{.mark} **systems** that encourage [invention and growing
the pie, not]{.mark}]{.underline} by [[socialist]{.mark}
systems]{.underline} that are [more [concern]{.mark}ed [with how]{.mark}
the **[existing pie is cut]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is far too soon,
in other words, to write off productivity.

[Discourse on food ethics often advocates]{.underline} the
**[anti-capitalist idea]{.underline}** [that we need **less capitalism,
less growth, and less globalization**]{.underline} if we want to make
the world a better and more equitable place, [with arguments focused
on]{.underline} applications to food, globalization, and a [just
society]{.underline}. For example, arguments for this anti-capitalist
view are at the core of some chapters in nearly every handbook and
edited volume in the rapidly expanding subdiscipline of food ethics.
None of these volumes (or any article published in this subdiscipline
broadly construed) focuses on a defense of globalized capitalism.1

More generally, [discourse on global ethics, environment, and political
theory]{.underline} in much of academia---and in society---increasingly
[features this anti-capitalist idea]{.underline} as well.2 The idea is
especially prominent in discourse surrounding the environment, climate,
and global poverty, where we face a nexus of problems of which
capitalism is a key driver, including climate change, air and water
pollution, the challenge of feeding the world, ensuring sustainable
development for the world\'s poorest, and other interrelated challenges.

[It is]{.underline} therefore [important to ask whether this
anti-capitalist idea is justified by **reason and
evidence**]{.underline} that is as strong as the degree of confidence
placed in it by activists and many commentators on food ethics, global
ethics, and political theory, more generally.

In fact, many **[experts]{.underline}** [argue that this
[anti-capitalist idea]{.mark} is **[not supported]{.mark} by reason and
argument and is actually wrong**]{.underline}. The main contribution of
this essay is to explain the structure of the leading arguments against
the anti-capitalist idea, and in favor of the opposite conclusion.
[I]{.underline} begin by [focus]{.underline}ing [on]{.underline} the
general argument in favor of [**well-regulated globalized capitalism**
as the key to a **just, flourishing, and environmentally healthy
world**. This is]{.underline} the most important of all of the arguments
in terms of its consequences for health, wellbeing, and justice, and it
is [endorsed by experts in the **empirically minded
disciplines**]{.underline} best placed to analyze the issue, [including
experts in long-run global development, human health, wellbeing,
economics, law, public policy, and other related
disciplines]{.underline}. On the basis of the arguments outlined below,
[well-regulated capitalism has been endorsed]{.underline} by recent
Democratic presidents of the United States such as Barack Obama, and [by
progressive Nobel laureates]{.underline} who have devoted their lives to
human development and more equitable societies, [as well as
by]{.underline} a wide range of [experts in government and leading
**n**]{.underline}on**[g]{.underline}**overnmental
**[o]{.underline}**rganization**[s]{.underline}**.

The goal of this essay is to make the structure and importance of these
arguments clear, and thereby highlight that discourse on global ethics
and political theory should engage carefully with them. The goal is not
to endorse them as necessarily sound and correct. The essay will begin
by examining general arguments for and against capitalism, and then turn
to implications for food, the environment, climate change, and beyond.

Arguments for and against Forms of Capitalism

The Argument against Capitalism

[Capitalism is]{.underline} often [argued to be a key driver of many of
society\'s ills: inequalities, pollution]{.underline}, land use changes,
[and incentives that cause people to live differently than in their
ideal dreams]{.underline}. Capitalism can sometimes deepen injustices.
These negative consequences are easy to see---resting, as they do, at
the center of many of society\'s greatest challenges.3

And at the same time, it is often difficult to see the positive
consequences of capitalism.4 What are the positive consequences of
allowing private interests to clear-cut forests and plant crops,
especially if those private interests are rich multinational
corporations and the forests are in poor, developing countries whose
citizens do not receive the profits from deforestation? Why give private
companies the right to exploit resources at all, since exploitation
almost always has some negative consequences such as those listed above?
These are the right questions to ask, and they highlight genuine
challenges to capitalism. And in light of these challenges, it is
reasonable to consider the possibility that perhaps a different economic
system altogether would be more equitable and beneficial to the global
population.

The Argument for Well-Regulated Capitalism

However, **[things are more complicated than the arguments above would
suggest]{.underline}**, and [the benefits of capitalism]{.underline},
especially for the world\'s poorest and most vulnerable people,
[are]{.underline} in fact myriad and **[significant]{.underline}**. In
addition, as we will see in this section, many experts argue that
**[[capitalism is not the]{.mark} fundamental [cause of]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** previously described [**[problems]{.underline}**
[but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather [an essential component of the **[best
solution]{.mark}s**]{.underline} to them [and]{.underline} of [the best
methods for promoting our goals of health, well-being, and
justice]{.underline}.

To see where the defenders of capitalism are coming from,
[consider]{.underline} an analogy involving [a response to a pandemic:
if a country administered a rushed]{.underline} and untested
[vaccine]{.underline} to its population that ended up killing people,
[we would not say that vaccines were the problem. Instead, the problem
would be the]{.underline} flawed and sloppy policies of vaccine
[implementation. Vaccines might]{.underline} easily
**[remain]{.underline}** absolutely **[essential]{.underline}** to the
correct response to such a pandemic [and could]{.underline} [also be
essential to promoting health]{.underline} and flourishing, more
generally.

[The argument is similar with capitalism]{.underline} according to the
leading mainstream arguments in favor of it: [Capitalism is an essential
part of the best society we could have]{.underline}, just like vaccines
are an essential part of the best response to a pandemic such as
COVID-19. [But]{.underline} of course both
[[cap]{.mark}italism]{.underline} and vaccines [can be [implemented
poorly]{.mark}]{.underline}, and can even do harm, especially when
combined with other incorrect policy decisions. But **[that [does not
mean]{.mark} that [we should turn against]{.mark}
them]{.underline}**---quite the opposite. [Instead, we should **embrace
them as essential**]{.underline} to the best and most just outcomes for
society, [and educate ourselves]{.underline} and others [on]{.underline}
their importance and on [how they must be **properly designed and
implemented**]{.underline} with other policies in order to best help us
all. In fact, [the argument in favor of capitalism is even more dramatic
because it claims that much more is at stake than even what is at stake
in response to a global pandemic]{.underline}---[what is at stake with
capitalism is]{.underline} nothing less than **[whether the world\'s
poorest and most vulnerable billion people will remain in conditions of
poverty and oppression]{.underline}**, or if they will instead finally
gain access to what is minimally necessary for basic health and
wellbeing and become increasingly affluent and empowered. The argument
in favor of capitalism proceeds as follows:

Premise 1. Development and the past. [Over]{.underline} the course of
[recorded]{.underline} human [history, the majority of [historical
increases in health]{.mark}, wellbeing, and justice have occurred in the
last two centuries]{.underline}, largely [as a result of]{.underline}
societies adopting or moving toward **[capitalism]{.underline}**.
[Capitalism is a relevant cause of these improvements]{.underline}, in
the sense that [they [could not have happened]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}to such a degree [if it were not for capitalism and would **not
have happened to the same degree [under any
alt]{.mark}ernative**]{.underline} noncapitalist approach to structuring
society. The argument in support of this premise relies on observed
relationships across societies and centuries between indicators of
degree of capitalism, wealth, investments in public goods, and outcomes
for health, wellbeing, and justice, together with econometric analysis
in support of the conclusion that the best explanation of these
correlations and the underlying mechanism is that large increases in
[health, wellbeing, and justice are largely driven by increasing
investments in public goods. The scale of increased wealth necessary to
maximize these investments requires **capitalism**]{.underline}. Thus,
[as capitalist societies have become dramatically wealthier]{.underline}
over the past hundred years (and wealthier than societies with
alternative systems), [this has allowed **larger investments in public
goods**,]{.underline} which simply has not been possible in a sustained
way in societies without the greater wealth that capitalism makes
possible. Important [investments in public goods include]{.underline}
investments in basic **[medical knowledge]{.underline}**, in health and
nutrition programs, [and]{.underline} in the institutional
[capacity]{.underline} and know-how [to **regulate**]{.underline}
society and [**capitalism** itself]{.underline}. As a result,
[[cap]{.mark}italism [is a]{.mark} **primary [driver]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} positive outcomes in **health and wellbeing**]{.underline}
([such as]{.underline} increased **[[life
expectancy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[lowered]{.mark} child and
maternal [mortality]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[adequate calories]{.mark}
per day, **[minimized]{.mark} infectious [disease]{.mark} rates**, a
[lower]{.mark} percentage and number of people in **[poverty]{.mark}**,
and more reported **[happiness]{.mark}**]{.underline});5 [and in
**justice**]{.underline} ([such as [reduced]{.mark} deaths from
[**war**]{.mark} and homicide; [higher]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}rankings in **[human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}indices; the [[reduced]{.underline}]{.mark} prevalence of
**[[racist]{.mark}, sexist, homophobic [opinions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in surveys; [[and]{.mark} higher [literacy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}rates).6 These **[[quantifiable]{.mark} positive
[consequences]{.mark} of global capitalism]{.underline}** dramatically
[[**outweigh**]{.mark} the negative consequences]{.underline} (such as
deaths from pollution in the course of development), with the result
that [the net benefits from capitalism in terms of health, wellbeing,
and justice have been greater than they would have been under any known
noncapitalist approach]{.underline} to structuring society.7

Premise 2. Economics, ethics, and policy. [Although capitalism has often
been ill-regulated]{.underline} and therefore failed to maximize net
benefits for health, wellbeing, and justice, **[it can become
well-regulated]{.underline}** so that it maximizes these societal goals,
[by including mechanisms]{.underline} identified by economists and other
policy experts [that do the following]{.underline}:

- optimally8 **[regulate negative effects]{.underline}** such as
  pollution and monopoly power, [and invest in public goods]{.underline}
  such as education, basic healthcare, and fundamental research
  including biomedical knowledge (more generally, policies that correct
  the failures of free markets that economists have long recognized will
  arise from "externalities" in the absence of regulation);9

- [ensure equity and distributive justice]{.underline} (for example, via
  wealth redistribution);10

- [ensure basic rights]{.underline}, justice, and the rule of law
  independent of the market (for example, by an independent judiciary,
  bill of rights, property rights, and redistribution and other
  legislation to correct historical injustices due to colonialism,
  racism, and correct current and historical distortions that have
  prevented markets from being fair);11 [and]{.underline}

- [ensure that there is no alternative way of structuring society that
  is more efficient]{.underline} or better promotes the equity, justice,
  and fairness goals outlined above (by allowing free exchange given the
  regulations mentioned).12

To summarize the implication of the first two premises,
[**well-[regulated cap]{.mark}italism** [is
**essential**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} best achieving our
ethical goals]{.underline}---which is true even though capitalism has
certainly not always been well regulated historically. Society can still
do much better [and **[remove]{.mark} the large
[deficits]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}in terms of health, wellbeing,
and justice **[that exist under]{.underline}** the current inferior and
**[imperfect]{.underline}** versions of **[capitalism]{.underline}**.

Premise 3. Development and the future. [If]{.underline} the global
spread of [capitalism is allowed to continue]{.underline}, desperate
**[poverty can be]{.underline}** essentially
**[eliminated]{.underline}** in our lifetimes. Furthermore, [this can be
accomplished **faster**]{.underline} and in a more just way [via
**well-regulated**]{.underline} global **[capitalism]{.underline}**
[than by **any alternatives**. [If]{.mark} we]{.underline} instead [opt
for **[less cap]{.mark}italism**]{.underline}, less growth, and less
globalization, then desperate **[[poverty will]{.mark}
continue]{.underline}** to exist for a significant portion of the
world\'s population into the further future, [and the world will
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}a **[[worse]{.mark} and less
equitable]{.underline}** place than it would have been with more
capitalism. For example, [in a world with less capitalism, [there would
be]{.mark} more **[overpop]{.mark}ulation, [food
insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, air
**[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ill health, injustice,
[[and]{.mark} other problems]{.underline}. In part, this is because of
the factors identified by premise 1, which connect a turn away from
capitalism with a turn away from continuing improvements in health,
wellbeing, and justice, especially for the developing world. In
addition, [fertility declines are also a consequence of increased
wealth, and the size of the population is a primary determinant of
**food demand and other [environmental
stressors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.13 Finally, as discussed at length in
the next section of the essay, [capitalism can be naturally combined
with optimal **environmental regulations**]{.underline}.14 [Even
bracketing]{.underline} anything like optimal [regulation]{.underline},
it remains true that sufficiently **[wealthy nations reduce
environmental degradation]{.underline}** as they become wealthier,
[whereas developing nations that are nearing peak degradation will
remain **stuck at the worst levels of degradation if we stall growth**,
rather than allowing them to transition]{.underline} to less and less
degradation in the future [via capitalism]{.underline} and economic
growth.15 In contrast, [well-regulated [cap]{.mark}italism [is a key
part of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the best way of coping with these
problems, as well as a key part of **[[dealing with climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, global [**food production**, and
other]{.underline} specific [challenges]{.underline}, as argued at
length in the next section. Here it is important to stress that we
should favor well-regulated capitalism that includes correct investments
in public goods over other capitalist systems such as the neoliberalism
of the recent past that promoted inadequately regulated capitalism with
inadequate concern for externalities, equity, and background distortions
and injustices.16

Conclusion. [Therefore, we should be in favor of capitalism over
noncapitalism]{.underline}, and we should especially favor
well-regulated capitalism, which is the ethically optimal economic
system and is essential to any just basic structure for society.

[This]{.underline} argument is impressive because, as stated earlier in
the essay, it [is based on **evidence**]{.underline} that is so striking
that it leads a bipartisan range of open-minded thinkers and activists
to endorse well-regulated capitalism, including many of those who were
not initially attracted to the view because of a reasonable concern for
the societal ills with which we began. To better understand why such a
range of thinkers could agree that well-regulated capitalism is best, it
may help to clarify some things that are not assumed or implied by the
argument for it, which could be invoked by other bad arguments for
capitalism.

One thing the argument above does not assume is that health, wellbeing,
or justice are the same thing as wealth, because, in fact, they are not.
Instead, [the argument]{.underline} above [relies on]{.underline}
well-accepted, [**[measurable indicators]{.underline}**]{.mark} of
health and wellbeing, such as increased lifespan; [decreased early
childhood mortality; adequate nutrition; and other empirically
measurable]{.underline} leading [indicators]{.underline} of health,
wellbeing, and justice.17 Similarly, [the argument that
[cap]{.mark}italism [promotes]{.mark} justice, **[peace]{.mark}**,
freedom, human rights, and tolerance relies on empirical
metrics]{.underline} for each of these.18

Furthermore, the argument does not assume that because these indicators
of health, wellbeing, and justice are highly correlated with high
degrees of capitalism, that therefore capitalism is the direct cause of
these good outcomes. Rather, the analyses suggest instead that something
other than capitalism is the direct cause of societal improvements (such
as improvements in knowledge and technology, public infrastructure, and
good governance), and that [capitalism is]{.underline} simply [a
**necessary condition** for these improvements]{.underline} to happen.19
In other words, the richer a society is, the more it is able to invest
in all of these and other things that are the direct causes of health,
wellbeing, and justice. But, [to maximize investment]{.underline} in
these things [societies need well-regulated capitalism]{.underline}.

As part of these analyses, [it is often stressed that current forms of
capitalism]{.underline} around the world [are]{.underline} highly
[defective]{.underline} and must be reformed in the direction of
well-regulated capitalism because they lack investments in public goods,
such as basic knowledge, healthcare, nutrition, other safety nets, and
good governance.20 [In this way, an argument for]{.underline} a
particular kind of [**progressive reformism** is an
essential]{.underline} part of the analyses [that lead many to endorse
the more general argument for well-regulated capitalism.]{.underline}

Although these analyses are nuanced, and appropriately so, it remains
the case that the things that directly lead to health, wellbeing, and
justice require resources, and the best path toward generating those
resources is well-regulated capitalism. And on the flip side, according
to the analyses behind premise 1 described above, [[an anti-capitalist
system]{.mark} would not produce the resources that are needed, and
[would]{.mark} thus [be a **disaster**]{.mark}, especially for the
**poorest billion**]{.underline} people who are most desperately in need
of the resources that capitalism can create and direct, to escape from
extreme poverty.21

Commercial Space -- Profit and Non-Profit

There are really two major categories in the commercial sector, the
profit driven and the non-profit. The classic for-profit companies
include not only those designing, building, launching, and operating
satellites but also [the [tech]{.mark} sector]{.underline} that [[is
**turning**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**raw [space data into
gold]{.mark}** through machine-learning analytics]{.underline}. Since
for-profit companies are no longer dependent upon the revenues generated
by the Cold War space race culture of a bygone era, this new generation
of space companies is able to more efficiently capitalize on Moore's
Law, the nonstop exponential growth in chip density, and the associated
networking technology co-evolving with it. This new generation is
[building profitable businesses]{.underline} helping [[to **clean
up**]{.mark} **our [oceans]{.mark} of garbage**]{.underline} and debris
[with satellite [surveillance]{.mark}, reconnoitering to]{.underline}
assist in **[[enforc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[laws that]{.mark}
protect our oceans from illegal]{.underline}**, unregulated, unlicensed
**[fishing]{.underline}**, something [that is **rapidly depleting** the
**world's most valuable and essential lifeforms**]{.underline}. It's
[leading]{.underline} in [the innovative use of low-cost satellite
constellations to produce **ubiquitous remote-sensing data**, [enabling
**small business**]{.mark} owners [to be]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[profitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and less wasteful. For example,
precise timing signals from space are already optimizing transportation
of people, goods, and services, with even further gains anticipated with
the introduction of artificial intelligence to assist drivers, perhaps
even someday replacing them entirely.

The non-profit sector is the other side of commercial space, concerned
more for the general welfare of society, but every bit as integral to
this new space enterprise. Much **[like every century]{.underline}**
before it [in human history, ours is not without its **unique
challenges**]{.underline}, [some of which have been a consequence of the
last, and **all of which the space [data]{.mark} domain [can be
leveraged to]{.mark}**]{.underline} help [**[solve]{.mark}**. Examples
are **endless**, but one challenge that this new space community is
uniquely well-adapted for is to]{.underline} further [inform **worldwide
[resource allocation]{.mark}** for the **21st century and
beyond**]{.underline}. These [two primary resources are **[sustainable
water]{.mark}** and the materials needed for **adequate
[housing]{.mark}** []{.mark}for an **ever-increasing human population**.
As cities and urbanization continue to expand, **governmental planning**
challenges]{.underline} such as transportation design optimization for
goods and services [are **only**]{.underline} the
**[beginning]{.underline}**. [Additionally, through]{.underline} using
[inexpensive remote sensing]{.underline} technologies, some [members are
designing space data analytics to **[mitigate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
human suffering from [**[plagues]{.mark}**, **contain
[outbreaks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [combat]{.underline}ing
[**illegal [poaching]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Some are connecting with
other non-profits to [curtail **human
[trafficking]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the sex trade [or]{.underline}
forced labor for migrant debt repayment. Still others are helping
non-governmental organizations in their work to [expose the use of
**child**]{.underline}ren as [**soldiers**. Addressing these challenges
has little to do with resuscitating dreams]{.underline} conceived [by
long deceased science-fiction writers and much]{.underline} more [to do
with **turning "swords back into plowshares**" to **solve real [threats
to humanity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Other non-profit initiatives include pursuing an even more foundational
understanding of who we are and how to be the best custodians of our
environment. Much as exploring and monitoring the world's oceans has
advanced civilization through a better understanding of human life and
the planet, so too does exploring and monitoring from space. Low Earth
orbit (LEO) provides a unique vantage point to look back on the planet
and understand what is happening, anticipate what might happen and
prepare for the future. In addition to better understanding Earth,
responsible and rapid exploitation of the low Earth orbit domain will
enhance the understanding of the solar system and the rest of the
universe. Small satellites already offer low-cost platforms to study and
explore what lies beyond the Earth. Other members are pioneering the use
of zero-carbon, hydrogen-based reusable propulsion systems to ensure we
don't worsen our atmosphere using kerosene-fueled rockets for the coming
tsunami of satellite launches. [Finally, a mission
**[ensuring]{.mark}**]{.underline} the general welfare and [**[planet
survival]{.mark}** for the **next thousand years** is **finally
[confronting]{.mark}** the **existential [threat]{.mark}** [that

**Space resource extraction solves sustainability.**

**Whittington '20** \[Mark; November 22; writes frequently about space
and politics, has published a political study of space exploration

The Biden approach to NASA seemed to be expressed best by Lori Garver,
who served as NASA's deputy administrator during the Obama
administration. According to the Space Review, she said, "If we don't
put some really significant resources into allowing humanity to be
sustained on this planet, we're not going to have the time to leave it.
You can't really do one without the other."

That last sentence is truer than, perhaps, Garver realizes. An article
in Astronomy Magazine suggests that [[the]{.mark} ultimate
[solution]{.mark} to climate change [will be to move]{.mark} **resource
[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **heavy industry [off]{.mark}
the [planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The notion seems like science
fiction, but some very serious people are looking at the idea of **[[a
space-]{.mark}based industrial [revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Jeff
Bezos, who made his billions from Amazon.com and now runs a space launch
company called Blue Origin, [suggests "zoning" Earth for
residential]{.underline} [areas and "light industries."]{.underline}
[Mining and manufacturing]{.underline}, two of [[the **biggest
sources**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} environmental
[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[would move]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[off]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[planet]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The moon and asteroids are the sources of untold mineral wealth. A
single asteroid, 16 Psyche, is said to contain 10,000 quadrillion
dollars' worth of metals. The quoted figure is somewhat misleading. If
one were to bring all the gold on 16 Psyche to Earth, its price would
collapse, making it into a cheap, industrial metal.

The point, however, is that [[only]{.mark} by turning humankind into a
**[space]{.mark}-faring civilization** [can]{.mark} we **[avoid]{.mark}
environmental [catastrophe]{.mark} while maintaining technological
progress.**]{.underline} The fact further suggests that the Artemis
program has an environmental dimension that Team Biden would do well to
recognize and to consider when formulating space policy for the incoming
administration.

American law already recognizes the right of companies to extract
resources from the moon and other celestial bodies, thanks to Title IV
of the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act. The act was
passed in 2015 on a bipartisan basis and signed into law by Obama.

Currently, [NASA has been attempting to gain international recognition
of Earth humans' right to extract and own space resources]{.underline}
as part of the Artemis Accords. The accords have been signed by nine
nations, besides the United States, with more to follow.

The point of all of this, going back to what Garver said, is that
climate change and space exploration are inseparably linked. She likely
meant that Earth needs to be sustained so that humankind can expand into
space. However, the opposite is also true. **[[Humankind must expand
into space so]{.mark} that [the Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the pale
blue dot that the late-Carl Sagan once celebrated, [[can be]{.mark}

\[language modified\]

At the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1950, physicist Enrico [[Fermi
famously posed]{.underline}]{.mark} to his colleagues [a simple
question]{.underline} borne of complex math: **['[Where are
they]{.mark}?']{.underline}** He was asking about aliens---intelligent
ones, specifically. The Italian-American scientist was [puzzled as to
why \[hu\]mankind **hasn't detected any signs** of intelligent life
beyond our planet]{.underline}. He reasoned that even if life is
extremely rare, you'd still expect there to be many alien civilizations
given the sheer size of the universe. After all, some estimates indicate
that there is one septillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
stars in the universe, some of which are surrounded by planets that
could probably support life. So, where are they, and why aren't they
talking to us? This is known as [[the **Fermi paradox**.]{.mark} It's
[based on]{.mark}]{.underline} mathematical ideas like [[the Drake
equation]{.underline}]{.mark}, which was devised to estimate the number
of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way. Scientists use the
equation by multiplying seven variables, as Elizabeth Howell outlined
for Space: N = R\* • fp • ne • fl • fi • fc • L N = The number of
civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions
are detectable. R\* = The rate of formation of stars suitable for the
development of intelligent life. fp = The fraction of those stars with
planetary systems. ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an
environment suitable for life. fl = The fraction of suitable planets on
which life actually appears. fi = The fraction of life bearing planets
on which intelligent life emerges. fc = The fraction of civilizations
that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their
existence into space. L = The length of time such civilizations release
detectable signals into space. The Drake equation is incredibly
speculative, or, as astronomer Jill Tarter once said, it's "a wonderful
way to organize our ignorance." It remains a puzzling problem. However,
[[a new paper]{.underline}]{.mark} from scientists at the Future of
Humanity Institute at Oxford University [[provides an
**updated**]{.mark} Drake [equation]{.mark}]{.underline}, one [that
incorporates **"realistic distributions of uncertainty"** and **"models
of chemical and genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life."**
By doing so, [the researchers say they dissolve the Fermi
paradox]{.mark} and provide even [more reason to think **we're
alone**]{.mark} **in the universe**]{.underline}[. [The updated
equatio]{.underline}]{.mark}[n effectively takes each variable and
[combines]{.mark} many **[historical estimates]{.mark}** that scientists
have used to create an uncertainty range, one that highlights just how
much scientists still don't know]{.underline}, as study author Anders
Sandberg told Universe Today: "Many parameters are very uncertain given
current knowledge. While we have learned a lot more about the
astrophysical ones since Drake and Sagan in the 1960s, we are still very
uncertain about the probability of life and intelligence. When people
discuss the equation it is not uncommon to hear them say something like:
\'this parameter is uncertain, but let's make a guess and remember that
it is a guess\', finally reaching a result that they admit is based on
guesses. \"But this result will be stated as single number, and that
anchors us to an \*apparently\* exact estimate---when it should have a
proper uncertainty range. This often leads to overconfidence, and worse,
[the Drake equation is very sensitive to bias: if you are hopeful a
small nudge upwards]{.underline} in several uncertain estimates [will
give a hopeful result]{.underline}, and if you are a pessimist you can
easily get a low result." After Sandberg and his colleagues combined
these uncertainties, [the results showed a distribution pattern of the
likelihood that humanity is alone in space]{.underline}. "We found that
[even using]{.underline} the [guesstimates]{.underline} in the
literature (we took them and randomly combined the parameter estimates)
[one can have a situation where the mean number of civilizations in the
galaxy might be fairly high---say, a hundred---and yet the probability
that we are alone in the galaxy is 30%!]{.underline} The reason is that
there is a very skew distribution of likelihood. "[If we instead try to
review the **scientific knowledge**, things get **even more
extreme**]{.underline}. This is [because [the probability of getting
life and intelligence]{.mark} on a planet [has]{.mark} an \*[extreme\*
uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} given what we know---[we cannot rule
out]{.underline} that [it happens nearly everywhere there is the right
conditions, but we cannot rule out that [it is **astronomically
rare**.]{.mark} This leads to an even stronger uncertainty about the
number of civilizations, drawing us to conclude that **[there is a
fairly high likelihood that we are alone]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, we \*also\* conclude that we shouldn't be too surprised if we
find intelligence!"

I do not, however, think that **[[the rev]{.mark}olutionary road
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** implausible. Rather, it is
**[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least [inside the rich
capitalist democracies]{.underline}. [And between the implausible and
the impossible the choice is clear.]{.underline}

Again, [this can be framed as an empirical hypothesis]{.underline}:
**[[You do not see rev]{.mark}olution[s]{.mark} [in developed capitalist
democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Przeworski and Limongi (1997)
have written, [there has **never** been a revolution in a moderately
middle-class democracy]{.underline} (see also Przeworski, 2019).
[[Drawing on a **thousand years of data**]{.underline}]{.mark},
cumulatively collected across 37 democratic countries, [they show that
[**not one had collapsed** with]{.mark} a per-capita [GDP higher
than]{.mark} that of [Argentina]{.mark} in 1976. A]{.underline}mong
countries with half that figure, collapse was exceedingly rare. Even a
modest GDP brings with it an enormous amount of regime stability.
[[These]{.mark} data in fact [include **any kind of regime
collapse**]{.mark};]{.underline} [narrowing the data to socialist
revolution makes the empirical case against it even more
impressive.]{.underline} Any case for revolution must begin by
acknowledging rather than ignoring this evidence.

To look at this question in a different way, I draw on the
Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive, which contains information on
revolutions (rather than government collapse) for over 200 countries
since 1919. [Their definition of revolution is very broad]{.underline}
(see footnote 7) [and includes "attempts" to overthrow government as
well as "unsuccessful" rebellions]{.underline}. The data were compiled
from newspaper sources and warrants caution, but nonetheless constitutes
the most systematic evidence available for these questions. In Figure 9,
I present the GNP per capita distribution of revolutions, from 1919,
where GNP is first available, to the present. By considering only those
country-years with revolutions I reduce the observation count from
17,520 to 184. Unlike Przeworski, I do not further restrict the data to
democracies. The graph displays an extreme skew: The vast, overwhelming
majority of cases of revolutionary threat occur in countries with a per
capita GNP below \$5,000 USD. For reference, the figure for the US in
the data is about \$65,850 in 2019. The hypothesis above---that we do
not see revolutions in developed democracies---seems borne out by the
evidence.

Figure 9. Histogram of country-years with revolutions.

Source: Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive. Data drawn from 200
plus countries between 1919 and 2018 are then restricted to
country-years (N = 184) in which there were "revolutions," as well as a
"major government crisis" and "anti-government protests."

Why exactly is this true and what are the mechanisms to explain it? Why
is the revolutionary strategy impossible for a country like the US?
There are, at bottom, three reasons, each of which stands alone as a
sufficient condition to snap the last threads of one's revolutionary
faith.23 The first two suggest that revolution is unachievable, and the
last suggests that even if it is achievable, socialism by revolutionary
means is unachievable. [The revolutionary road is closed on the
following grounds:]{.underline}

(1) **[Workers do not want it]{.underline}**

(2) **[Capitalists would sooner grant reforms]{.underline}**

(3) **[[A smashed state is]{.mark} more [likely to result in
tyranny]{.mark}]{.underline}** than deep democracy

[[Not only has there never been a successful revolution]{.mark} in a
developed democracy, **[there has never]{.mark} been [a working class
that]{.mark} has [wanted one]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Erikson and
Tedin, 2015; Sassoon, 1996).24 There are no clear cases where the
dominant inclination of the working class in a developed democracy was
revolutionary. Recall that the above graph also includes attempts and
unsuccessful cases. It is self-evident that workers have not joined
revolutionary groups en masse at any point in the context of a rich
democracy. Nor were their aspirations to join such groups thwarted by
violence or ideology. When gains inside a capitalist democracy are
available---either individual or collective ones, and this has been true
even through the neoliberal period, where median living standards have
continued to (slowly) go up and not down---it is not worth risking
everything for an uncertain future (Thewissen et al., 2015).25 More
important than the dynamic point is the static one: When standards of
living are moderately high, as shown in Figure 9, the modal worker has
more to lose than her chains. This is not an argument against socialism;
but to revise Werner Sombart, the life raft of revolution really was
shipwrecked on shoals of roast beef and apple pie.

Therefore[, the reasons workers are not revolutionary are materialist in
character. Explaining their reformist politics does not require appeal
to venal trade union leaders or false consciousness. Most people wish to
**minimize risk** in their lives, and **[rev]{.mark}olution
[involves]{.mark} taking on [colossal risks]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For
example, [home-ownership in the developed world hovers around 70%; this
means that **a lot of [people have a lot to lose]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

By contrast, [the materialist case for revolution proposes that people
favor it when their expected post-revolutionary standards of living are
greater than their current standard]{.underline} (Roemer, 1985). But
[when we add moderate risk- and loss-aversion the calculation
changes]{.underline} (Kahneman and Tversky, 1991). Say you have a low
income, but own a few assets, maybe a house, a car, and perhaps you also
have a child; what risk profile would you require to gamble your modest
holdings for an uncertain future which might be better but might be
worse? Even if you are certain that the probability of better is greater
than the probability of worse, you have to envision workers as a class
of inveterate gamblers to take the bet. Moderately cautious people who
prefer a bird in the hand will still view the downside risk as too
great. Equal gains and losses are not experienced equally. This is the
loss aversion phenomenon. But the assumption of a population confident
about improved standards of living---and a willingness to take risky
strategies to achieve them---is itself unwarranted. This is the risk
aversion phenomenon. The modal worker is of course correct to suspect
that her post-revolutionary welfare is uncertain; socialists after all
do not have satisfactory answers to the problems of coordination,
motivation, and innovation under socialism (for attempted answers that
are provocative and oftentimes brilliant, see Albert, 2004; Cottrell and
Cockshott, 1992; Corneo, 2017; Roemer, 1994; and Wright and Hahnel,
2016). When one compares the status quo to a future where both heaven
and hell are seemingly plausible, it is perfectly rational that people
everywhere would abandon the barricades. And abandon them they did.

Now perhaps the revolutionaries have persuaded us that negative outcomes
are far-fetched, that we are very confident that revolution will usher
in, eventually, the land of milk and honey. It is still the case that in
this model the promised land will only be reached after a social
breakdown of unknown duration: A complete overhaul in the organization
of production will lead to some middle period of deteriorating material
welfare as capitalists rapidly exit the economy. This means chaos and
uncertainty, but it could also mean war. The interregnum could last a
year, but it might last two decades, and however optimistic we are about
the end point, we cannot in advance know how long this interim phase
will persist. In the meantime, revolutionary enthusiasm will wane,
erstwhile supporters will decamp, a "stay-the-course" electoral strategy
will be outflanked by competitor parties promising a return to normalcy,
and the desire to consolidate gains will make the authoritarian impulse
greater. From a materialist perspective, the uncertain passage through
what Przeworski (1986) calls the "transition trough" makes the journey
less appealing.26

To my mind, these factors explain why **[[all working classes]{.mark} in
all developed democracies [have been]{.mark} decidedly
[reformist]{.mark} in orientation]{.underline}**. [The reason why
revolutionary socialism has always been marginal in rich capitalist
economies]{.underline}---and will always be outflanked by
reform-oriented socialism---[is that only the latter consistently
deliver hi]{.underline}gh (and usually increasing) standards of living
and low (and usually decreasing) levels of risk. As long as the Mad Max
world of catastrophic collapse can be avoided, reform-oriented parties
will always better capture the enthusiasm of poor and working people.

Thus, when we try to explain the non-revolutionary attitudes of our
working-class friends and family, we do not need to lean on the false
consciousness account, for there is a more parsimonious materialist
explanation. As such, any case for revolution must be non-materialist in
character: You can be a materialist or a revolutionary, but not both.

This is the dilemma the revolutionaries must consider: [Revolution is
only possible when the forces of production are underdeveloped, but it
can only be successful when they are sufficiently developed to make
socialism]{.underline} (or communism) [objectively
viable]{.underline}.27 As Elster (1986) has argued, [the circumstances
under which revolutions **spark and succeed never
coincide**.]{.underline}

What about the **[[capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Under these
circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that they [will [fight]{.mark}
[**far harder** against a revolution than]{.mark} they would against
[reformist drives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [ignoring the response
from capitalists violates Elster's first law of political rationality:
Never assume your opponent is less rational than you. [If revolution
were the alt]{.mark}ernative]{.underline}, [[employers would grant
every]{.mark} imaginable **[reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from far
higher taxes to the rejiggering of power relations in the workplace. In
a mugging, most people will surrender their wallet before their life.

Actors in the state ought to respond in more or less the same way---that
is, as long as you admit your adversary the competence to read the
situation as well as you. If our theory of the state suggests that it
acts on behalf of the capitalist class, its apparatchiks would
anticipate and preempt any revolutionary crusade with a cocktail of
concession and repression. And while it will certainly contest reforms,
it will devote all of its resources to break the revolution.
Nonetheless, this means that revolutionaries can play a crucial role,
even if it is not to foment revolution. Militancy is a powerful strategy
to foment reform (for an argument about the history of social democracy
along these lines, see Piketty, 2014).

Thus far, the main reason revolution is off the table is because no one
wants it---not workers, nor employers, nor the state.

The third point above asks us to imagine the prospects for revolutionary
success even if we ignore the wrinkle that workers have neither an
interest nor capacity to make it. But let us pretend they did:
**[Why]{.underline}** then would [we imagine that total social breakdown
would prompt a deepening of [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} [rather than
**authoritarian entrenchment**]{.underline}? [This happy outcome [has
never]{.mark} before [emerged in the]{.mark} [wake of social
collapse,]{.mark}]{.underline} and there is little reason why the final
showdown with the American military ought to produce fertile ground for
deepening democracy in all spheres of life. In fact, evidence from the
General Social Survey suggests that in response to recession and
economic downturn people tend to become less altruistic and less
concerned with questions of fairness.28 After situations of economic
crisis, voters tend to shift to the right (Lindvall, 2014). The old
union song cries out that "we can bring to birth a new world from the
ashes of the old," but life is not birthed on ash. None of the
historical case studies track this narrative, and indeed everything we
know about human psychology suggests that social devastation makes
people more, not less, prone to demagoguery. This means that even if a
revolution were achievable, it is probably undesirable.

The argument I have thus far laid out against revolution contends only
that it is off the table in middle-class democracies. I have in mind
social dynamics within developed capitalist democracies, countries "like
the US," but the premise no longer holds true if we imagine a society
that has already suffered some sort of catastrophic societal
disintegration---at that point all bets are off. We are of course now
talking about a world we are not living in, but it is worth considering
the thought experiment nonetheless.

It is possible that America, after some world-historic environmental or
economic collapse, begins to look something more like Russian feudalism
than contemporary developed capitalism. Revolution then might again be
on the table, but the context of desperation and scarcity in this
scenario gives little reason to expect it would incubate an egalitarian
democratic society. The historical evidence is unambiguous: None of the
communist revolutions of the 20th century ushered in deeply democratic
egalitarian social structures. Not only are there no examples, but there
are also no clear mechanisms on offer.

The fact that this scenario generates an interest in bringing about an
egalitarian society by means of revolution does not mean there will be a
capacity to do so. The theory is little more than "where there is a will
there is a way." But, as Elster (1980: 124) argues, the general
interests of society do not secrete the conditions for their
fulfillment. Interests and capacities need not overlap.

There is a final reason to be skeptical of non-evolutionary strategies:
The highly dubious premise that the system we erect the morning after
will actually work. [A [socialist economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, if
plopped down tomorrow, [[would be]{.mark} so [rife with **unintended
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} and pathologies that [it is easy to
imagine a democracy voting its way back into capitalism]{.underline}.
[This is true even if we believe]{.underline} (mistakenly, in my view)
[that the socialist calculation debate is solvable in the age of big
data]{.underline} (Morozov, 2019). Interlocutors in the calculation
debate have had very little to say about the politics of transition.
Indeed, [[it is hard to **imagine success**]{.underline}]{.mark} of any
kind [[without]{.mark} a **slow and [incremental]{.mark}
[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [experimenting with bits and
pieces along the way]{.underline}---as we have been doing for the past
century[. An experimental approach is likely [the only way to
avoid]{.mark} **devastating [blunders]{.mark}** that **undermine the
whole project**]{.underline}. [Moments of institutional upheaval and big
change may at times be necessary, but to be successful they will have to
rest on a foundation of smaller changes that have been
tested.]{.underline}

**Sudden transition kills [two-thirds]{.underline} of the world within
[two weeks]{.underline}\-\--ONLY gradual transition via reformism is
possible in the modern world\-\--prefer ev from the world's [most famous

Global Unrest

There are many contradictions in the capitalist system, and some are
more salient than others. The incredible class and social inequalities
and collapsing environmental conditions are obvious priorities. But then
comes the "too big to fail, too monstrous to survive" contradiction.
Neither the social inequality nor environmental degradation issues can
be addressed without taking on this underlying contradiction. [A
socialist and anti-capitalist program will have to negotiate a
knife-edge path between preserving that which services the world's
population and which appears too big and foundational to fail while
confronting the fact that it is becoming **too monstrous** to survive
without sparking geopolitical conflicts that will likely turn the
innumerable small wars and internal struggles already raging across the
planet into a **globaconflagration**]{.underline}.

This is the core of the problem. [**[In Marx's time]{.underline}**, [if
there was a **sudden collapse**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[of
capitalism]{.underline}**, [[most people]{.mark} in the world
[would]{.mark} still [have been able to feed]{.mark} [themselves]{.mark}
and reproduce.]{.underline} They were reasonably self-sufficient in
their local area procuring the kinds of things they needed to live and
reproduce. [[People could put]{.mark} some sort of [breakfast on]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}ir [table]{.mark} irrespective of what was going on in the
**global economy** and in **global markets**]{.underline}. [[Right
now]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[that's no longer the
case]{.underline}]{.mark} in many parts of the world. [[Most]{.mark}
[people in the]{.mark} **U**nited **S**tates, in much of
[Europe]{.mark}, in Japan, and now increasingly in [China]{.mark},
[India]{.mark}, Indonesia, [and]{.mark} in Latin [America]{.mark} are
[depend]{.mark}ing more and more [on]{.mark} the delivery of [food
through]{.mark} the circulation of [capital]{.mark}. In Marx's time,
perhaps 10 percent of the global population was vulnerable to
disruptions in the circulation of capital, as opposed to many more who
were subject to famines, droughts, epidemics, and other environmental
disruptions]{.underline}. The crisis of European capitalism in 1848 was
part a product of harvest failures and part produced by a speculative
crash focused on railroad finance. [Since then, [capital]{.mark}
operating in the world market has largely [eliminated]{.mark} the
prospect of [starvation]{.mark} due to supposedly natural causes. If
there is famine the underlying causes]{.underline} (as opposed to the
immediate triggers) [can invariably be traced to failures in the social
and political system of capitalist governance and
distribution.]{.underline} [Much of [the world]{.mark}'s population
[is]{.mark} now [dependent upon]{.mark} the circulation of capital to
procure and ensure its food supply, access the fuels and the
[energy]{.mark} required [to support daily life]{.mark}, and to maintain
the elaborate structures and equipment of communication that facilitate
the coordination of basic production requirements]{.underline}.

[Capital]{.underline}, right now, [may be too deeply implicated in the
**reproduction of daily life** to fail. [The]{.mark} economic
consequences and social impacts and [costs of a]{.mark} massive and
prolonged [failure in the continuity of capital circulation will be
catastrophic and]{.mark} potentially **[lethal]{.mark}** for a
significant portion of the world's population.]{.underline} To be sure,
indigenous and peasant populations in the Andean highlands may survive
quite well, but [if the flow of capital shuts down]{.underline} for any
prolonged period, then [**maybe [two-thirds of the world's population
would within a few weeks be threatened with starvation]{.mark},**
deprived of fuel and light, while being rendered immobile and deprived
of almost all capacity to reproduce their conditions of existence
effectively]{.underline}. **[[We cannot]{.mark} now
[afford]{.mark}]{.underline}** any kind of [sustained and prolonged
attack upon or [disruption]{.mark} of capital circulation [even if
the]{.mark} more **[egregious forms of accumulation are strictly
curbed]{.mark}**. [The]{.mark} kind of [fantasy]{.mark} that
[revolutionaries]{.mark} might once have [had]{.mark} -- which was that
capitalism could be destroyed and burned down]{.underline} overnight and
that something different could immediately be built upon the ashes --
[**[is impossible today]{.mark}** even supposing there ever was a time
when such a revolutionary overthrow might have happe]{.underline}ned.
Some form of the circulation of commodities and therefore of money
capital has to be kept in motion for some considerable time lest most of
us starve. It is in this sense that we might say that [[capital
appears]{.mark} to be now **[too big to fail]{.mark}.**]{.underline} We
[may aspire to make our own history, Marx observed, but this can never
be done under conditions of our own choosing. These conditions dictate a
politics that is about sustaining many existing commodity chains and
flows while socializing and perhaps gradually modifying them to
accommodate to human need]{.underline}s. As Marx noted in his commentary
on the Paris Commune,

in order to work out their own emancipation, and along with it the
higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending by its own
economical agencies, they \[the working classes\] will have to pass
through long struggles, through a series of historic processes,
transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realize, but
to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing
bourgeois society is pregnant.

[[The task is to]{.mark} identify that which **lays latent in our
existing society to [find a peaceful transition to a more socialist
alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Revolution
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[a]{.mark} long [process not an
event]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**No disease impact.**

**Adalja '16** --- Amesh; an infectious-disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh. He writes regularly at Tracking Zebra. June

//CYang

But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. With each outbreak of a
[**[headline]{.mark}-grabbing** emerging infectious [disease]{.mark}
comes]{.underline} a **[fear of extinction]{.underline}** itself. The
fear envisions a large proportion of humans succumbing to infection,
leaving no survivors or so few that the species can't be sustained. I'm
[[not afraid]{.mark} of this **apocalyptic scenario**]{.underline}, but
I do understand the impulse. [Worry about the end is a
**quintessentially human** trait]{.underline}. Thankfully, [so
is]{.underline} our [resilience]{.underline}.

For most of mankind's history, infectious diseases were the existential
threat to humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at
killing people: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out an
estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century Black
Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5
percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half of all
humans who have ever lived.

Any yet, of course, [[humanity]{.mark} continued to
flourish]{.underline}. Our [species']{.underline} recent [explosion in
lifespan is]{.underline} almost exclusively [the result of]{.underline}
the [[control]{.mark} of infectious [diseases through **sanitation**,
**vaccination**, and]{.mark} **antimicrobial
[therapies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only in the modern era, in which many
infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial world, do people
have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the
8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching siblings and
friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, smallpox, measles,
and the like.

So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now?

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. Fortunately, [[outside of fiction]{.mark}, there's [no
reason]{.mark} to expect **alien [pathogens]{.mark}** to [wage war
on]{.mark} the [human race]{.mark} any time soon]{.underline}, and my
[[analysis suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[any]{.underline}]{.mark}
real-life [domestic [microbe reaching]{.mark} an **[extinction]{.mark}
level** of [threat]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [is just as
[unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by
infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short.

Any [apocalyptic [pathogen]{.mark}]{.underline} would [need to possess a
**very special combination** of two attributes]{.underline}. First, it
would have to be [[**so unfamiliar** that no]{.mark} existing
[therapy]{.mark} or vaccine could be [applied]{.mark}]{.underline} to
it. Second, it would need to have a [high [and]{.mark} surreptitious
[transmissibility **before symptoms**]{.mark} **occur**]{.underline}.
The first is essential because any microbe from a known class of
pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could serve as
models for containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the
hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even the most
astute clinicians.

The three [infectious [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} most likely to be
[considered **extinction-level threats** in the world today]{.underline}
--- influenza, HIV, and Ebola --- [[don't meet
these]{.underline}]{.mark} two [requirements]{.underline}. Influenza,
for instance, despite its well-established ability to kill on a large
scale, its contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift
away from our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known unknown."
While there are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at
least the time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And
in the modern era, a [full-fledged industry of]{.underline} influenza
[preparedness exists, with effective **vaccine strategies** and
**antiviral therapies**]{.underline}.

HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is
similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, [HIV's
dependency on blood and body fluid for transmission]{.underline}
(similar to Ebola) [requires]{.underline} [intimate]{.underline}
human-to-human [contact, which limits contagion. **Highly potent**
antiviral therapy allows]{.underline} most [people to live
normally]{.underline} with the disease, [and]{.underline} a substantial
group of [the population has **genetic mutations** that render them
impervious to infection]{.underline} in the first place. Lastly, simple
prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users
and barrier contraceptives --- when available --- can curtail
transmission risk.

[Ebola]{.underline}, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as
several others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to
the fact that it [spreads]{.underline} almost [exclusively through
people with **easily recognizable symptoms**]{.underline}, plus the
taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by simple
supportive care.

Beyond those three, [every]{.underline} other known [disease falls short
of]{.underline} what seems [required to wipe out humans]{.underline} ---
which is, of course, why we're still here. And it's not that diseases
are ineffective. On the contrary, [diseases' failure]{.underline} to
knock us out [is a testament to]{.underline} just [how resilient humans
are]{.underline}. Part of our [**evolutionary heritage** is [our immune
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, one of the [[most complex on the
planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, even without the benefit of vaccines or the
helping hand of antimicrobial drugs. This [system]{.underline}, when
viewed at a species level, [can adapt to]{.underline} almost [any enemy
imaginable. [Coupled to **genetic variations**]{.mark}]{.underline}
amongst humans---which [open up the possibility for a range of
advantages, from **imperviousness**]{.underline} to infection [to a
tendency for mild symptoms]{.underline} --- this [**adaptability**
ensures]{.underline} that almost [[any]{.mark} infectious
[disease]{.mark} onslaught will [leave]{.mark} a **[large]{.mark}
proportion** of the [population alive]{.mark}]{.underline} to rebuild,
[in contrast to]{.underline} the [fictional Hollywood

While the immune system's role can never be understated, an [**even more
powerful** protector is]{.underline} the faculty of
[[consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Humans are not the most prolific,
quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle
identified, [humans are]{.underline} the [rational]{.underline}
animals---[and]{.underline} it is this fundamental [distinguishing
characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions]{.underline},
think in principles, and plan long-range. These capacities, in turn,
[allow [humans]{.mark} to [modify]{.mark}, [alter]{.mark}, [and
improve]{.mark} themselves and]{.underline} their [environments.
Consciousness]{.underline} equips us, at an individual and a species
level, to [make nature safe for the species through]{.underline} such
[**[technological]{.mark} marvels** as antibiotics, antivirals,
vaccines, and sanitation]{.underline}. When humans began to focus their
minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased
being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, [human
consciousness]{.underline} became [infectious [diseases' **worthiest
adversary**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Price Of Growth --- Destruction Of The Environment?

But isn't there a price for this growth: environment devastation? Of
course, nobody would deny that industrialization causes environmental
problems. But the [[assertion]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[growth]{.mark}
**automatically [leads]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} ever
accelerating [[environmental degradation is]{.mark} **simply
[false]{.mark}**[. Yale]{.mark} University's **[E]{.mark}**nvironmental
**[P]{.mark}**erformance **[I]{.mark}**ndex]{.underline} (EPI) [[uses
**16 indicators** to rank]{.mark} countries on [environmental health,
air]{.mark} quality, [water, biod]{.mark}iversity, [natural resources
and pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [indicators]{.underline} have
been selected to [reflect]{.underline} both the current baseline and the
[dynamics of **national ecosystems**]{.underline}. One of the Index's
**[most striking [findings]{.mark}]{.underline}** is that there [is a
[**strong correlation** between]{.mark}]{.underline} a state's [[wealth
and]{.mark} its [environmental performance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most
[**developed [capitalist countries]{.mark}** [achieve **high
environmental standards**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those [countries
with]{.underline} the [worst EPI]{.underline} scores, such as Ethiopia,
Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger, are all poor. They [have]{.underline}
both [low investment capacity for infrastructure]{.underline}, including
water and sanitation, and tend to have weak environmental regulatory
authorities.

Contrary to prevailing perceptions, [industrial development and
**[tech]{.mark}nological advances**]{.underline} have contributed
[significantly]{.underline} to [[reliev]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the
[[burden on the environment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Both Indur Goklany in
his book The Improving State of the World and Steven Pinker in chapter
ten ("The Environment") of his book Enlightenment Now demonstrate that
[[we are]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[living longer]{.mark},
healthier [lives]{.mark} in unprecedented prosperity]{.underline}, but
we are also doing [so [on a]{.mark} **comparatively [clean]{.mark}**
[planet]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Researchers]{.underline} have [confirmed]{.underline} that economic
freedom --- in other words, more [capitalism]{.underline} --- [leads to
higher]{.underline}, not lower, [environmental quality]{.underline}.

Every year, the Heritage Foundation compiles its Index of Economic
Freedom, which analyzes individual levels of economic freedom, and thus
[[capitalism]{.mark}, in countries around the world]{.underline}. The
Heritage Foundation's researchers also [measure]{.underline} the
[correlation between]{.underline} each [country's environmental
performance]{.underline} and its economic freedom. The [[results
**couldn't be clearer**]{.underline}]{.mark}: the world's [[most]{.mark}
**economically [free]{.mark}** [countries achieve]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[highest environmental performance]{.underline}]{.mark} rankings
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} an average [score of
[76.1]{.mark}]{.underline}, followed by the countries that are "mostly
free," which score an average of 69.5. [In **stark
contrast**]{.underline}, the [[economically]{.underline}]{.mark}
"repressed" and "mostly [[unfree]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[countries]{.underline} [**all score** less than
50]{.underline}]{.mark} [for environmental performance]{.underline}.

Is Government The Best Solution To Environmental Problems?

Anti-capitalists frequently claim that central government is the best
solution to environmental problems. And there is no doubt that state
regulations to safeguard the environment are important. But state
regulations, cited by anti-capitalists as a panacea for environmental
issues, often achieve the opposite of what they were intended to do.
Hardly any other country in the world touts its green credentials as
much as Germany. According to even the most conservative estimates,
Germany's so-called "energy transition" is set to cost a total of almost
€500 billion by 2025.

But the results of this massive investment is sobering, as an analysis
by McKinsey reveals, "Germany is set to miss several key energy
transition targets for the year 2020, and the country's high power
supply security is at risk unless new generation capacity and grid
infrastructure are built in time for the coal and nuclear exit and
electrification of transportation networks is accelerated."

For decades, environmentalists in Germany focused on shutting down
nuclear power plants. However, the phasing out of nuclear power has left
Germany in a poor position in terms of CO2 emissions compared to other
countries. It is not without good reason that Germany's energy policy
has been described as the dumbest in the world.

The latest generation of nuclear power plants are much safer than their
predecessors. Despite what environmentalists might claim, impartial
calculations have confirmed that it is impossible to meet the world's
energy needs from solar and wind power alone. Enlightened
environmentalists are therefore now calling for nuclear power to be
rightfully included in the fight against climate change. And yet, this
is precisely what is being prevented in Germany by politicians --- not
capitalism. This example, just one of many, shows that government
environmental policy is often ineffective. In some instances, it even
achieves the opposite of what it was originally intended to, i.e. it
exacerbates existing environmental problems.

It is [[also wrong to think]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[capitalism]{.mark} **necessarily [leads]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} ever [greater [waste of]{.mark} **limited
[natural resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Just take the
[[smartphone]{.underline}]{.mark} for example, one of the most
environmentally friendly of capitalism's many achievements. With just
[one small device]{.underline}, a [**whole [plethora of
devices]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} used to [consume
resources]{.mark}]{.underline} in the past, such as the [[telephone,
camera, calculator, navigation]{.underline}]{.mark} system,
[[dictation]{.underline}]{.mark} machine, [[alarm]{.underline}]{.mark}
clock, [[flashlight]{.underline}]{.mark} and many others, [have been
[replaced]{.mark}]{.underline}. Smartphones [also]{.underline} help to
[reduce]{.underline} the [consumption of paper]{.underline} as many
people choose not to take notes on paper [and]{.underline}, for example,
[use their iPhone instead of a calendar]{.underline} to enter
appointments.

[[Those who call for]{.underline}]{.mark} "[system
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}" instead of "climate change" [[do
not]{.underline}]{.mark} usually [[say which system
they]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[prefer]{.underline}]{.mark}. All they
are really sure of is that any new system should not be based on free
market economics and that the state should play the decisive role. The
[**simple [fact]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[failed in **every country every
time**]{.mark} it]{.underline} has been [tried]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} socialism has [damaged the environment more than any
capitalist system]{.underline}. Murray Feshbach documents examples of
the environmental destruction wrought by socialism in his book
Ecological Disaster. Cleaning Up the Hidden Legacy of the [[Soviet
Regime]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the book progresses through chapters
such as "A Nuclear Plague," "Dying Lakes, Rivers, and Inland Seas" and
"Pollution of the Air and Land," it becomes clear that this
non-capitalist system was [[responsible for]{.mark} the [**greatest
environmental destruction** in history. Anti-capitalists
may]{.mark}]{.underline} well [[reply]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[they]{.mark} [do not want]{.mark} a system like [the Soviet
Union]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, they
[[cannot name a **single real-world system**]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[at any time in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[history]{.underline}]{.mark}
of \[humankind\] ~~mankind~~ --- [[that provides better **environmental

[[There is **no**]{.mark} **scientific [basis]{.mark}** [to
suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**climate breakdown** will]{.mark}
"annihilate **intelligent life**" (by which I assume the]{.underline}
report [authors [mean **human extinction**]{.mark})]{.underline} by
2050.

However, climate breakdown does pose a grave threat to civilization as
we know it, and the potential for mass suffering on a scale perhaps
never before encountered by humankind. This should be enough reason for
action without any need for exaggeration or misrepresentation!

A "Hothouse Earth" scenario plays out that sees Earth's temperatures
doomed to rise by a further 1°C (1.8°F) even if we stopped emissions
immediately.

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

This word choice perhaps reveals a bias on the part of the author of the
article. A temperature can't be doomed. And while I certainly do not
encourage false optimism, assuming that humanity is doomed is lazy and
counterproductive.

Fifty-five percent of the global population are subject to more than 20
days a year of lethal heat conditions beyond that which humans can
survive

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

This is clearly from Mora et al (2017) although the report does not
include a citation of the paper as the source of that statement. The way
it is written here (and in the report) is misleading because it gives
the impression that everyone dies in those conditions. That is not
actually how Mora et al define "deadly heat" --- they merely looked for
heatwaves when somebody died (not everybody) and then used that as the
definition of a "deadly" heatwave.

Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:

[[are]{.mark} **very [difficult]{.mark}** [to make and **vary**]{.mark}

Deadly heat conditions across West Africa persist for over 100 days a
year

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

The deadly heat projections (this, and the one from the previous
paragraph) come from Mora et al (2017)1.

It should be clarified that "deadly heat" here means heat and humidity
beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in the region
subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone instantly
dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al are
conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not check
the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason to
think they are in error.

Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research fellow, Potsdam Institute for

This is a highly questionable conclusion. The reference provided in the
report is for the "Global Catastrophic Risks 2018" report from the
"Global Challenges Foundation" and not peer-reviewed literature. (It is
worth noting that this latter report also provides no peer-reviewed
evidence to support this claim).

Furthermore, if it is apparently beyond our capability to model these
impacts, how can they assign a 'high likelihood' to this outcome?

While it is true that warming of this magnitude would be catastrophic,
making claims such as this without evidence serves only to undermine the
trust the public will have in the science.

Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for
Atmospheric Research:

It seems that [**the eye-catching [headline]{.mark}-level

The content of the IFLScience article is mostly an accurate
representation of the contents of the Breakthrough report, but [the
article tends to gloss over **important caveats and
probabilities**]{.underline} that are [given in the report]{.underline}.
The least accurate part of the IFLScience article is the headline, which
is an outright misrepresentation of the report. The article title states
that there is, overall, [**a "high probability"** of human civilization

that, [[in **the most unlikely, "long-tail"**]{.mark} **biophysical

[are]{.mark} **much [more severe]{.mark} than we expect**, [**THEN**

Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for

The article uncritically reproduces claims from a recent report released
by an Australian thinktank regarding the purported "end of human
civilization" due to climate change over the next 30 years. [While there
is plenty]{.underline} of [scientific evidence]{.underline} that
[climate change will pose]{.underline} increasingly [**existential
threats** to **the most vulnerable individuals in society**]{.underline}
and to key global ecosystems, [**even these dire outcomes** aren't
**equivalent** to the "**annihilation of intelligent
life**,"]{.underline} as is claimed in the report.

Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:

The report this article is based on describes a scenario which is
unlikely, but several aspects of what is included in the report are
likely to worsen in coming decades, such as the occurrence of deadly
heatwaves. [**The conclusion** of **a high likelihood** that **human
civilisation** will end is **false**, although there is **a great deal**
of evidence]{.underline} that [there will be]{.underline} many
**[damaging consequences]{.underline}** to continued global warming over
the coming decades.

Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory:

I don't think it's so easy to discount the essential warning of this
report. However, it would have been stronger if the authors were more
careful not to mention the unsupported concept of near-term human
extinction, and the unsupported probabilistic claim that there is a
"high likelihood" of their 2050 scenario which includes the collapse of
civilization. [I do not understand why **non-scientist
writers**]{.underline} (neither report author is a scientist) [feel a
need to **exaggerate** sound scientific findings]{.underline}, when
those findings are already quite alarming enough. I feel that humanity
should undertake urgent climate action just as the report authors do,
but I feel that [misrepresenting the science is **unhelpful** and
**unnecessary**]{.underline}.

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

This is a classic case of a media article over-stating the conclusions
and significance of a non-peer reviewed report that itself had already
overstated (and indeed misrepresented) peer-reviewed science --- some of
which was already somewhat controversial. It appears that there was not

New Report Warns "High Likelihood Of Human Civilization Coming To An
End" Within 30 Years

Richard Betts, Professor, Met Office Hadley Centre & University of
Exeter:

The headline overstates the conclusions of the report (which is already
overdoing things). The reports says it presents a scenario, and under
that scenario and all the assumptions within it, the report claims that
there is a "high likelihood of human civilization coming to and end" ---
but even then, the report itself does not give the end of civilisation
within 30 years. [The [process]{.mark}]{.underline} supposedly leading
ultimately to collapse [[**begins** around **2050** but takes **a long
time**]{.mark} **to take effect**]{.underline}. Also [the

As I point out in that linked (and free!) book: [[we're nowhere
near]{.mark} **any [limit]{.mark}**]{.underline} that need bother us.
[[We've]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[800,000 years of
**nickel**]{.underline}]{.mark} left (assuming no recycling) [[and 34
million of **cobalt**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [enough to]{.underline}
be [getting along with]{.underline}, given the average lifespan of a
species is three million years.

So why the worrying that we are? Mainly, it's because [[people
**misunderstand** the]{.mark} **technical [jargon]{.mark}**
[used]{.mark}]{.underline} in the industry. [[They talk about mineral
reserves and]{.underline}]{.mark} mineral [[resources without
realizing]{.mark} that [these are not a]{.mark} **fair
[indication]{.mark}** [of usable resource]{.mark}]{.underline}. No, [not
even a guide, not an estimation, [there]{.mark} **simply [is no
link]{.mark}** at all]{.underline}.

A [[mineral reserve]{.mark} is [something]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} have [drilled]{.underline}, tested, dug up a
bit [and [processed]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we have now proven that we
can extract this at current prices, using current technology, [and make
a profit doing so]{.underline}. [[This is an economic
definition]{.underline}]{.mark}: roughly speaking, [the stock
[at]{.mark} **already [existing]{.mark}** [mines]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A mineral resource is where we're pretty sure all of that is true --
we've just not proved it yet. And then there's the stuff we've not got
around to looking at -- which is true of the bulk of the planet and the
bulk of all minerals. [[This is]{.underline}]{.mark} like

Just look at that famed Club of Rome report, Limits to Growth. They,
entirely correctly, note that mineral reserves are going to last 30 --
50 years. They then, again **[entirely
[correctly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, note that [[mineral
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} can and [will be [converted into reserves
by]{.mark} the [application of]{.mark}]{.underline} time and
[[money]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their [[prediction comes
from]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[incorrect
[assumption]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[current reserves
are]{.underline}]{.mark} an [indication of [the **total**]{.mark}
**amount [available]{.mark}** to us]{.underline}.

But they then simply assume that resources out there are only 10 times
current reserves. Hmm, 10 x 30 -- 50 years is 300 to 500, isn't it? So
it's not all that much of a surprise that they tell us that society is
doomed, doomed, in only a couple of centuries when they add a bit of
exponential growth in usage. Their prediction comes from their
assumption, that wholly incorrect one, that current reserves are an
indication of the total amount available to us.

All [too many [predictions of this sort]{.mark} are [based on
**entirely**]{.mark} and **totally [wrong]{.mark}**
[assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [truth is
[we]{.mark}]{.underline} simply [[do not have]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[shortage of **any mineral**]{.underline}]{.mark}, over any human
timescale, that we might want to use. [Any policy based upon the
assumption]{.underline} that we do [is]{.underline} provably
[wrong]{.underline}. So we'd better revisit those policies based upon
this incorrect assumption pretty sharpish, shouldn't we?

\"Stable Jobs or iPhones? The Dilemma of Innovation in Socialism,\"
Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 52, Vol. 4, p. 642-649\]

**Note: DPS = Democratically Planned Socialism**

[One]{.underline} of the [advantage]{.underline}s [for
[innovation]{.mark} in DPS is]{.underline} that [it can]{.underline}
effectively [take into account social and environmental
costs,]{.underline} including the jobs lost or disrupted by the
introduction of a new technology.8 [But this can also be
**problematic**, in that it [is]{.mark} likely to make **innovation
[slower]{.mark}** [in **socialism**]{.mark} than in **capitalism**.
[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [majorities are **not immune**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} some of [the **same [factors]{.mark}** [that
caused **Soviet**]{.mark} **manager[s]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark}
technologically [conservative]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On the one hand, DPS should not suffer from taut planning, unrealistic
plan targets imposed from the top down, or an incentive structure that
discourages risk-taking by trying out new technologies. But on the other
hand, [[innovation is]{.mark} **always [disruptive]{.mark}** in any kind
of **economic system**. As old technologies are **superseded**, product
lines become **obsolete** and production processes are changed, and as a
result certain]{.underline} kinds of [jobs are **no longer needed**.
[Even with]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[employment guarantee]{.mark}, the
loss of one's job may have to involve **retraining**, **changing
careers**, or **moving**]{.underline} across the country. So, [it is
reasonable to expect]{.underline} that [workers will **resist new
technologies**]{.underline}.9 Yet at the same time, in their capacity as
consumers, they will demand new and better products.

[This is]{.underline} the "[Stable jobs or iPhones?" dilemma. We can
prioritize]{.underline} cutting-edge [consumer products, or]{.underline}
we can prioritize [stable employment, but]{.underline} perhaps **[not
both]{.underline}**.10 In DPS, the people will be able to decide between
one and the other, on a case-by-case basis, so that [[some]{.mark}
innovations]{.underline} will be pursued, others [[will be
scrapped]{.mark} because of their **disruptive effects**, [and]{.mark}
some]{.underline} will be [[introduced at]{.mark} a **deliberately [slow
pace]{.mark}**. Meanwhile, capitalism always comes down in
favor]{.underline} of the iPhones despite the conflict with stable jobs.
[Since socialism will not]{.underline} always do this, [it is likely
that socialism will have]{.underline} more job security but [fewer
**cutting-edge**]{.underline} consumer [products than
capitalism]{.underline}.

[[If there is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**[international
rivalry]{.mark}** between **socialism** and **capitalism**, the
[citizens]{.mark} of the two]{.underline} kinds of [societies
will]{.underline} be able to [[compare]{.mark} their
[lifestyles]{.mark}]{.underline} with those in the other economic
system. Workers living under capitalism may be attracted by the stable
jobs, shorter working hours, democratic workplaces, and social benefits
provided by socialism. However, [[those]{.underline}]{.mark} living
[[under socialism will]{.mark} likely also [be **attracted** by]{.mark}
the **rapid [introduction]{.mark}** of new]{.underline} consumer [goods
under capitalism]{.underline}. Moreover, [as long as the **speed of
innovation** in socialism is **lower**]{.underline} than that in
capitalism, [the "**consumer gap**" with capitalism would
**grow**]{.underline} over time.

This may not be considered a problem for socialism if most of the
population value stable jobs more than iPhones, but there would likely
be a minority who do not. If the consumer gap is large enough, and/or
that dissenting minority has an overriding preference for new consumer
goods, then [we have a category of people with a **material interest**
in **supporting capitalism**, which values a **new
technology**]{.underline} over job stability, [even though they are part
of the working class]{.underline}.

[[A common response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[flaws]{.mark} of
Soviet socialism [has been]{.mark}]{.underline} to [propose **[other
models of socialism]{.mark}** that [would not have]{.mark} those
[**flaws**. But the **trade-off** between **job security** and
**innovation** is not]{.mark} one that can be **[easily
eliminated]{.mark}** within socialism. It is not due to]{.underline} the
[overly centralized or undemocratic nature of Soviet
socialism]{.underline}.

Furthermore, there is a [[military]{.underline}]{.mark} aspect to the
[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} problem. Innovations that aid the
military are also likely to have a disruptive effect on employment, as
in the case of consumer-oriented innovations. This is a problem because
it might [[put DPS at]{.mark} a **military [disadvantage]{.mark}** with
respect to capitalism, [which would **hurt**]{.mark} the [**socialist
side** in **i**]{.mark}**nternational [r]{.mark}elations** [even if
no]{.mark} military [conflict takes place.]{.mark} If [one side]{.mark}
knows it would **lose any war**]{.underline} that did take place, then
[that side [will **act timidly**]{.mark} and avoid even nonviolent
confrontation]{.underline}, so as [to **avoid provoking** the other
side]{.underline} into war. [For both sides to stand]{.underline} a
[good chance of success in a peaceful rivalry, they must be]{.underline}
more or less [evenly matched]{.underline} militarily, [so that neither
feels that it can do whatever it wants with impunity]{.underline} or
that it must tread lightly to avoid confrontation.

[[The Cold War was]{.underline}]{.mark} a [multifaceted
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline} between two different systems. [[Any
future socialist]{.mark} economic [order will]{.mark} most
[likely]{.mark} face capitalism in a]{.underline} somewhat [[similar
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}. Can such a struggle be won by socialism
without matching capitalism's rate of technological development? That is
the question.

In [[1820, 94%]{.mark} of the]{.underline} world's
[population]{.underline} was [[living in]{.mark} **extreme
[poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 1910, this figure had fallen to 82%,
and by 1950 the rate had dropped yet further, to 72%. However, the
[[**largest** and **fastest** decline]{.mark} occurred between
1981]{.underline} (44.3%) [and [2015]{.mark}]{.underline}
([[9.6%]{.underline}]{.mark}). Reading these figures, which were
compiled by Johan Norberg for his book Progress, is enough to make
anyone rub their eyes in disbelief. For [[according
to]{.underline}]{.mark} leftist [[anti-capitalists, these were]{.mark}
the very [decades]{.mark}]{.underline} in which [so [much
went]{.mark}]{.underline} so [[wrong]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}.
In his book Capital in the 21st Century, the left-wing French economist
Thomas Piketty writes that it is precisely this period that is allegedly
so problematic. He [bemoans]{.underline} a [widening of]{.underline} the
[gap between the rich and]{.underline} the [poor in terms
of]{.underline} income and [wealth]{.underline} in the period from 1990
to 2010. But [what is **more important**]{.underline} to these hundreds
of millions of people --- [that they are no longer starving,
or]{.underline} that the [wealth of]{.underline}
multi-[millionaires]{.underline} and billionaires [may have
increased]{.underline} to an even greater extent than their own standard
of living?

According to Norberg, 200 years ago, [[at]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[birth of capitalism, there were only]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[60
million people]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world who were
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} living [[in]{.mark} **extreme
[poverty]{.mark}**[. Today there are]{.mark} **more than [6.5
billion]{.mark}** people]{.underline} who are [not living in extreme
poverty]{.underline}. Between 1990 and 2015 alone (in Thomas Piketty's
view the devastating years in which social inequality rose so sharply),
1.25 billion [[people **around the world** escaped]{.mark} extreme
poverty]{.underline} --- [50 million per year]{.underline} and [138,000
every day]{.underline}.

Glorifying The "Good Old Days"

Johan Norberg himself used to be a left-winger and an
[[anti-capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}. In his book, he admits that he
[[**never thought** about how people lived]{.mark} before]{.underline}
the industrial revolution, when [there was [no medicine]{.mark}, no
[antibiotics]{.mark}, no **clean [water]{.mark}**, nowhere]{.underline}
near enough [[food]{.mark}, no [electricity]{.mark}]{.underline} and no
clean water. He confesses that he pretty much imagined this epoch of
humanity as a trip to the countryside. But the [**[reality]{.mark} of
the past** [was]{.mark} **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
the early 19th century, [[poverty rates]{.underline}]{.mark} were
[[higher]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[in]{.mark} the [richest
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} then [[than]{.underline}]{.mark} they are
[[today in]{.mark} the **[world's poorest]{.mark}
countries**]{.underline}. In the [United States]{.underline}, Great
[Britain and France]{.underline}, between 40% and [50% percent of the
population lived in conditions]{.underline} that [we]{.underline} now
[describe as]{.underline} [extreme poverty]{.underline}. Today, the only
countries with such high poverty levels are all in sub-Saharan Africa.
Across Scandinavia, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Spain, roughly 60% to
70% of the population lived in extreme poverty. And between 10% and 20%
of Europeans and Americans were officially described as beggars and
vagabonds.

It is estimated that 200 years ago some 20% of the inhabitants of
England and France were unable to work at all. At most they had enough
strength to walk slowly for a few hours each day, which condemned them
to begging for the rest of their lives. Karl Marx foresaw the
impoverishment of the proletariat, but when he died in 1883, the average
Englishman was three times richer than in 1818, the year in which he was
born.

Life expectancy

[Progress over recent decades]{.underline} is [**particularly
[evident]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} terms of [[life
expectancy]{.mark} gains]{.underline}. Life expectancy at birth has
[[increased]{.mark} **more than [twice]{.mark}** as much in the last
century]{.underline} as in the 200,000 years before. The
[probability]{.underline} that a [child born today]{.underline} will
[reach retirement age]{.underline} is [higher than]{.underline} the
[probability of previous generations]{.underline} ever [celebrating
their **fifth birthday**]{.underline}. In 1900, the [average life
expectancy]{.underline} worldwide [was 31]{.underline} years; [today it
stands at 71]{.underline} years. [[Of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [roughly
[8,000 generations]{.mark} of Homo sapiens]{.underline} since our
species emerged approximately 200,000 years ago, [[only]{.mark} the
[last four]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[experienced]{.mark} **massive
[declines]{.mark}** [in mortality]{.mark} rates]{.underline}.

Hunger

In the last 140 years there have been [[106]{.mark} **major
[famines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, each of which has [cost more than
100,000 lives]{.underline}. The [[death toll]{.underline}]{.mark} has
been [**particularly [high]{.mark}** [in socialist
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Soviet Union, China,
Cambodia, Ethiopia and North Korea, [killing]{.underline} tens of
millions of [people through]{.underline} the [forced transfer of private
means of production]{.underline} to public economies [and]{.underline}
the [use of hunger as a weapon]{.underline}. The book The Power of
Capitalism describes in painful detail the [biggest socialist experiment
in history]{.underline}, Mao's "Great Leap Forward" at the end of the
1950s. About 45 [million Chinese died at that time]{.underline}.

Travel And Hospitality Sectors Need To Reimagine Their Business Models

The [[annual]{.mark} number of [deaths]{.mark}]{.underline} due to major
famines [[fell]{.underline}]{.mark} to 1.4 million in the 1990s --- not
least [[as a result of]{.underline}]{.mark} the collapse of socialist
systems worldwide and China's [move toward
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. As late as
[[1947]{.underline}]{.mark}, the United Nations stated that around
[[half of the]{.mark} world's [population]{.mark} was **chronically
[undernourished]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 1971, this had fallen to 29%,
ten years later it was only 19%. [[By 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
proportion of people suffering from malnutrition [worldwide]{.underline}
had [fallen to [11%]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Prophets Of Doom]{.underline} Have [Always Got It Wrong]{.underline}

[If there is one thing we]{.underline} can [learn from
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[**[doom-mongers]{.mark}** have **[always been
wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 1968, a [highly acclaimed
book]{.underline} was published [with]{.underline} the [provocative
title **[The Population Bomb]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The book
[stated]{.underline} that the [1970s]{.underline} would
[see]{.underline} the [world plagued by numerous famines]{.underline},
which would result in hundreds of millions of people starving to death.
Another book, [**[Famine 1975]{.mark}**!, predicted]{.underline} that
[famine]{.underline} would [reach catastrophic proportions]{.underline}
within 15 years. While [[anti-capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}
frequently glorify the past, they [[always regard the future
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[strong]{.mark} sense** of
**[doom]{.mark} and gloom**]{.underline}. In 1972, for example, the
highly influential [[Club of Rome warned]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[emissions]{.mark} of]{.underline} practically [every
pollutant]{.underline} now seemed to be [[rising exponentially. In
fact]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the decades to come,
[[pollution]{.underline}]{.mark} would not only stop growing, but
**[actually [decrease]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And
[[drastically]{.underline}]{.mark} so. [**Total [emissions]{.mark}**
from the world's]{.underline} six [leading]{.underline} air [polluters
[fell by]{.mark}]{.underline} more than
[[two-thirds]{.underline}]{.mark} between 1980 and 2014.

The Environment

[Norberg]{.underline} also [confirms]{.underline} the extent to which
[[environmental conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[improved]{.mark}
over the last few decades]{.underline}. While acknowledging the impact
of climate change, he also points out that the [amount of energy needed
to produce]{.underline} one unit of [prosperity]{.underline} in the
Western world has [decreased]{.underline} by 1% per year every year
[[over]{.mark} the **past [150 years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As he
demonstrates, there are [ways]{.underline} and means [to cut CO2
emissions without reducing growth, trade and]{.underline} access to
[energy]{.underline}. These include [**more [efficient
production]{.mark}** processes, [less energy-intensive
construction]{.mark}]{.underline} methods, [new energy sources and
fuels]{.underline}. As he also explains,
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and companies are now [working on
[fourth-gen]{.mark}eration nuclear [power]{.mark}]{.underline} plants,
all of which have passive safety systems, [that]{.underline} can
[[generate **hundreds**]{.mark} **of times** [more
energy]{.mark}]{.underline} from the same resources [[and do not
have]{.underline}]{.mark} the same [[waste]{.underline}]{.mark} problems
as their predecessors. Stephen Pinker, in his book Enlightenment Now!,
also confirms that [[all]{.mark} manner of [environmental
problems]{.mark}]{.underline} have [**[declined]{.mark} sharply** in
recent decades]{.underline}, despite the fact that most people believe
they have actually increased. Pinker also sees nuclear energy as the
most important means of combating climate change. In the past, according
to Pinker, [people's [innovative power]{.mark}]{.underline} to solve
problems [has **[repeatedly]{.mark} been
[underestimated]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- but a [[departure
from]{.mark} [progress]{.mark}]{.underline} and growth, he warns, will
[[lead to the **opposite** of what environmental]{.underline}]{.mark}
and climate [[protectors hope]{.mark} for]{.underline}.

Redistribution?

In his book, Norberg cites a seemingly [**[endless]{.mark} array** of
facts]{.underline} that [prove]{.underline} the [[benefits]{.mark} of
economic progress]{.underline}. The [weekly hours worked]{.underline} by
the average American [are now 25 hours less than]{.underline} they were
in [1860]{.underline}. At the same time, [people enter]{.underline} the
world of [work later]{.underline} in life, [retire earlier and live
longer]{.underline} after retirement. All of these [positive
developments]{.underline} are [the [result of **tech**]{.mark}**nical
progress** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**economic [system]{.mark}**
[that made this]{.mark}]{.underline} progress
[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark} in the first place. A [[study of **180
countries**]{.mark} over four decades [shows]{.mark}]{.underline} that
the [[increase in income]{.mark} for]{.underline} the
[poorest]{.underline} in a society is [**primarily [due]{.mark}** [to
growth]{.mark} rather than redistribution]{.underline}: 77% of income
growth for the poorest 40% of a population are directly linked to the
average growth of a country. [[Capitalism]{.mark} is not the
problem]{.underline}, as anti-capitalists tell us. In fact, it is
[capitalism]{.underline} that has **[very successfully
[solved]{.mark}]{.underline}** many of [[the world's]{.mark} **most
serious [problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the last two centuries.

[fallen]{.mark} by]{.underline} nearly **[two-thirds]{.underline}**,
from 1.9 billion [to around]{.underline} **[650 million]{.underline}**.
[[Life expectancy]{.mark} has]{.underline}
**[[risen]{.underline}]{.mark}** in most of the world, [along

[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[access to
[education]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [while]{.underline} **[[infant
mortality]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [fallen]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Despite perceptions to the contrary, the [average person]{.underline}
born today [is likely to have access to]{.underline} **[more
opportunities]{.underline}** [and have a]{.underline} **[better quality
of life]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} at [any other point in human
history]{.underline}. Much of this [increase in]{.underline} human
[wellbeing has been [propelled by]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[rapid]{.underline}** [economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} driven
largely by state-led industrial policy, particularly in poor-to-middle
income countries.

However, this growth has come at a cost: between 1990 and 2019, global
emissions of CO2 increased by 56%. Historically, economic growth has
been closely linked to increased energy consumption --- and increased
CO2 emissions in particular --- leading some to argue that a more
prosperous world is one that necessarily has more impacts on our natural
environment and climate. There is a lively academic debate about our
ability to "absolutely decouple" emissions and growth --- that is, the
extent to which the adoption of clean energy technology can allow
emissions to decline while economic growth continues.

Over the past 15 years, however, [something has]{.underline} **[begun to
change]{.underline}**. [Rather than a]{.underline} 21st [century
dominated by]{.underline} **[coal]{.underline}** that energy modelers
foresaw, [global [coal]{.mark} use]{.underline} **[[peaked]{.mark} in
2013]{.underline}** [[and is]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[structural [decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
We have [succeeded in [making]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[clean energy
cheap]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} **[solar]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[power]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[battery]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[storage]{.underline}** [[costs

**[solar]{.underline}**, [**[wind]{.underline}**,
**[hydro]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- [than from coal over the past two
years]{.underline}. And, [according to]{.underline} some major [oil
companies, [peak oil]{.mark} is upon us --- not [because]{.mark} we
have]{.underline} **[run out of]{.underline}** cheap
**[oil]{.underline}** to produce, [but because [demand
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[falling]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and
companies expect]{.underline} **[further decline]{.underline}** [as
consumers]{.underline} increasingly [shift to]{.underline}
**[e]{.underline}**lectric **[v]{.underline}**ehicle**[s]{.underline}**.

The world has long been experiencing a relative decoupling between
economic growth and CO2 emissions, with the emissions per unit of GDP
falling for the past 60 years. This is the case even in countries like
India and China that have been undergoing rapid economic growth. But
relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a world where global CO2
emissions need to peak and decline in the next decade to give us any
chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in line with Paris
Agreement targets.

Thankfully, [there is]{.underline} **[increasing evidence]{.underline}**
that [the [world]{.mark} is [on track to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[absolutely decouple]{.underline}**]{.mark} CO2
**[emissions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} economic
**[growth]{.underline}** --- [with global CO2
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} **[potentially]{.underline}** [having
[peak]{.mark}ed]{.underline} **[[in]{.mark} 20[19]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and unlikely to]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[substantially]{.underline}** [in the coming decade]{.underline}.
While an emissions peak is just the first and easiest step towards
eventually reaching the net-zero emissions required to stop the world
from continuing to warm, [it demonstrates]{.underline} that [linkages
between emissions and economic activity are]{.underline} **[not an
immutable law]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} rather [simply a result
of our]{.underline} **[current]{.underline}** [means of energy
production]{.underline}.

In recent years [we have seen]{.underline} **[more and
more]{.underline}** [examples of absolute decoupling]{.underline} ---
economic [growth accompanied by]{.underline} **[falling]{.underline}**
[CO2 emissions]{.underline}. Since 2005, [[32
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} with a population of at least one million
people [have]{.underline} **[absolutely]{.underline}**
[[decoupled]{.mark} emissions from]{.underline} economic
[growth]{.underline}, both [for]{.underline}
**[terrestrial]{.underline}** [emissions]{.underline} (those within
national borders) [and]{.underline} **[consumption]{.underline}**
[emissions]{.underline} (emissions embodied in the goods consumed in a
country). This [[include]{.mark}s [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
Japan, Mexico, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Poland, Romania,
Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, Belarus, Austria,
Bulgaria, El Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway,
Ireland, New Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia,
Estonia, and Cyprus. Figure 1, below, shows the declines in territorial
emissions (blue) and increases in GDP (red).

To qualify as having experienced absolute decoupling, we require
countries included in this analysis to pass four separate filters: a
population of at least one million (to focus the analysis on more
representative cases), declining territorial emissions over the
2005-2019 period (based on a linear regression), declining consumption
emissions, and increasing real GDP (on a purchasing power parity basis,
using constant 2017 international \$USD). We chose not to include 2020
in this analysis because it is not particularly representative of
longer-term trends, and consumption and territorial emissions estimates
are not yet available for many countries.

There is a wide range of rates of economic growth between 2005-2019
among countries experiencing absolute decoupling. Somewhat
counterintuitively, there is no significant relationship between the
rate of economic growth and the magnitude of emissions reductions within
the group. While it is unlikely that there is not at least some linkage
between the two factors, [there are]{.underline}
**[plenty]{.underline}** [of examples of countries]{.underline} (e.g.,
Singapore, Romania, and Ireland) [experiencing both]{.underline}
**[extremely rapid]{.underline}** economic [growth and]{.underline}
**[large reductions]{.underline}** [in CO2 emissions]{.underline}.

One of the primary [criticisms of]{.underline} some [prior
analyses]{.underline} of absolute decoupling [is that they
ignore]{.underline} **[leakage]{.underline}**. Specifically, the
offshoring of manufacturing from high-income countries over the past
three decades to countries like China has led to "illusory" drops in
emissions, where the emissions associated with high-income country
consumption are simply shipped overseas and no longer show up in
territorial emissions accounting. There is some truth in this critique,
as there was a large increase in emissions embodied in imports from
developing countries between 1990 and 2005. After 2005,
[however]{.underline}, **[structural [changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
China and a growing domestic market [[led to]{.mark} a [reversal]{.mark}
of these trends]{.underline}; the [amount of
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} ["**[exported]{.underline}**]{.mark}"
[from]{.underline} **[developed]{.underline}** [countries
to]{.underline} **[developing]{.underline}** [countries has]{.underline}
**[actually [declined]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over the past 15
years]{.underline}.

This means that, [for many countries, both]{.underline}
**[[territorial]{.underline}]{.mark}** emissions [[and]{.underline}
**[consumption]{.underline}** [emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} (which
include any emissions "exported" to other countries) [have]{.underline}
**[[jointly declined]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, on average,
[consumption emissions have been]{.underline} **[declining slightly
faster]{.underline}** [than territorial emissions]{.underline} since
2005 in the 32 countries we identify as experiencing absolute
decoupling. Figure 2, below, shows the change in consumption emissions
(teal) and GDP (red) between 2005 and 2019.

![Chart, bar chart Description automatically

There is a pretty wide variation in the extent to which these countries
have reduced their territorial and consumption emissions since 2005.
Some countries --- such as the UK, Denmark, Finland, and Singapore --
have seen territorial emissions fall faster than consumption emissions,
while the US, Japan, Germany, and Spain (among others) have seen
consumption emissions fall faster. Figure 3 shows reductions in
consumption and territorial emissions for each country, with the size of
the dot representing the size of the population in 2019.

University and is one of China's most prominent legal scholars. The core
of his argument is set forth in the opening paragraphs:

> If AI remains under the control of market forces, it will inexorably
> result in a super-rich oligopoly of data billionaires who reap the
> wealth created by robots that displace human labor, leaving massive
> unemployment in their wake.
>
> But China's socialist market economy could provide a solution to this.
> If AI rationally allocates resources through big data analysis, and if
> robust feedback loops can supplant the imperfections of "the invisible
> hand" while fairly sharing the vast wealth it creates, a planned
> economy that actually works could at last be achievable.

There are a couple of things wrong with this. First, there is the
obvious point that [Marxists have been prophesying the end of capitalism
**since 1848**]{.underline}. Second, Der Spiegel has run covers
prophesying massive unemployment due to robots since 1964. These
predictions are yet to eventuate.

[Feng]{.underline} hopes that state-owned AI will revive the long-dead
idea of socialist central planning. He is probably wrong about this
because he **[overestimates the capabilities of AI]{.underline}** and
what it is good for. His reference to "[big data analysis]{.underline}"
indicates that he is referring to the particular class of data-hungry
machine learning (ML) models popular today. These algorithms [require a
**lot of data**]{.underline} because they rely on mimicry rather than
understanding and independent reasoning. [ML does **not work like human
learning**]{.underline}. Human children do not need ten thousand tagged
images to tell the difference between cats and dogs, but contemporary ML
does.

Given a particular task, if the purpose is known, [a human can seek to
serve that purpose **even if there are surprises**, i.e., unanticipated
changes in circumstance. The **opposite is true** for a digital
mimic]{.underline} that knows nothing of the purpose it serves. This is
why [anything **novel**]{.underline} [or out of the ordinary tends to
**break ML**]{.underline}. For example, the error rate of systems
looking to distinguish feral trees from native trees can increase
dramatically if the live aerial photos start to differ from the photos
used to train the model. Shifts in satellite orbit, the time of day
pictures are taken and even modest moves in geography and vegetation can
degrade model accuracy. [Contemporary ML-based AI is very much a case of
highly trained horses for **very specific courses**.]{.underline}

As is commonly said, [a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence
[is **brittle**]{.underline} (but fast) whereas [human intelligence is
**robust**]{.underline} (but slow). [If the task is to]{.underline} land
a drone, **[provide song recommendations]{.underline}**, or even predict
protein folding, [then mimicry can work **well**]{.underline}, given a
sufficiently varied quantity of training data. [If]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [rationality or the ability to provide **nuanced reasoning
for past decisions is required**]{.underline}, [mimicry
**flops**]{.underline}. The ability to deal with the unexpected is one
of the great strengths of Homo sapiens.

Feng's claim is simply that AI oligarchs are bad and the only credible
fix is a "socialist market economy" governed by a Marxist one-party
state. This is a false dichotomy; [our choice is **not
between**]{.underline} [these **two extremes**]{.underline}. We agree
that AI oligarchs are an unattractive prospect. However, there are
existing remedies for cartels, monopolies, and harmful AI products in
the pluralist West. [**Targeted regulation** is a **better fix** for
capitalism's defects than a **revolution**]{.underline} led by an
alliance of workers and peasants. As a result of Frances Haugen's
testimony, [many in the US Congress are looking to **clip the wings of
social media**]{.underline}. [The EU has **led the world in regulating
AI**]{.underline} products, introducing rights to explanations, rights
to be forgotten, and rights to data privacy. The Australian government
has released draft legislation to expose anonymous trolls to defamation
actions by removing the "platform" shield of social media and making
them "publishers" accountable for the views their users post just like
traditional media. The "wild west" days of the information age are over.

But [Feng offers a typically Marxist "**all or nothing**"
argument]{.underline}. To fix the problems of competitive capitalism,
his solution is a Marxist political monopoly based on the revolutionary
expropriation of the expropriators. His argument is unconvincing because
[it is based on a hopelessly dated **caricature of
capitalism**]{.underline}. "Laissez-faire capitalism as we have known
it," he says, "can lead nowhere but to a dictatorship of AI oligarchs
who gather rents because the intellectual property they own rules over
the means of production."

The obvious problem with this argument is that [laissez-faire capitalism
is **extinct**]{.underline}, long since [abandoned in favour of
**regulation**, **anti-trust legislation**, and **redistribution through
the welfare state**. Feng overstates the **market power**]{.underline}
of the AI oligarchs, most of whom make their money selling ads in a
competitive market. [He says nothing about the **coercive
power**]{.underline} [of a **political monopoly**, that can silence
policy competition by throwing it into the **gulag**.]{.underline}

[The **most sinister aspect**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} current [AI
is **what a one-party state can do with it**]{.underline}. Silicon
Valley has given China the technical tools to set up the world of 1984.
Now [the **party telescreen** can monitor the likes of **Winston Smith**
24/7]{.underline}. Instead of a screen on the wall, it's the mobile
phone in your pocket connected to the Internet that can be used to track
you and monitor what you click on, who and what you message, and keep
you and all your fellow citizens under constant surveillance for
"counter-revolutionary" views. [In China, the Internet and social media
have evolved to be a **tyrant's dream**. Comrade political
officers]{.underline} in technology firms monitor online [posts for
"objectionable" material and have **unlimited powers of
"moderation."**]{.underline}

The Achilles heel of this political strategy is that it creates a
culture in which people are afraid to think and speak freely. When you
have to filter every word you say in case it offends the powers that be,
you are strongly motivated to avoid risky creative thinking. In a
society where the state can control everything and purge celebrity and
wealth, [talented people vote with their **feet**]{.underline} and
[migrate to places where they can **get rich**]{.underline} and famous
and say what they think. Those that remain settle for the safety of
government-approved groupthink. As a result of this systemic dampening
of creativity, [the economy **stagnates**]{.underline} in the long run.

Aspects of contemporary AI theory align with the intuitions of Karl
Popper as expressed in The Open Society and Its Enemies. Driven mostly
by reaction to the totalitarian horrors of fascism and communism in
World War II, Popper intuited that [social truth is best served by
policy competition and piecemeal social engineering **not policy
monopoly**]{.underline}. Contemporary AI, in the form of discussion of
the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in reinforcement learning (a
variant of ML), explains why.

Exploitation is a strategy whereby the AI takes a decision assumed to be
optimal based on data observed to date. In essence, it is about trusting
past data to be a reliable guide to the future, or at least today.
Exploration, by contrast, is a strategy that consists of not taking the
decision that seems to be optimal based on existing past data. The AI
agent bets on the fact that observed data are not yet sufficient to
correctly identify the best option. Obviously, exploitation works better
in closed and well-understood systems, but exploration is a better bet
in those that are open and poorly understood.

Even if decisions are made by the most generally intelligent AI
possible, [the optimal strategy for that AI is to **subdivide
tasks**]{.underline}, **[duplicate itself]{.underline}**, [and
**specialize for local conditions**]{.underline}. In other words, a
swarm of individuals each making their own choices can learn from the
best of what its population tries. [If all individuals are constrained,
then the ability of the swarm to learn and change is]{.underline}
\[[destroyed]{.underline}\] crippled. There are exceptions, particularly
where the cost of an individual failing is so high it is comparable to
the whole population failing (for instance, letting more people have
access to a button that ends the world is worse than letting fewer
people have access to this button). But, generally speaking, more
**[distributed control]{.underline}** consistently [beats more
**centralised control**]{.underline}. By employing many different, often
contradictory policies at once, we constantly explore as we exploit.
Applying this recent technical insight retrospectively to history, [it
explains]{.underline} the **[sustained stagnation of Marxist
economies]{.underline}**.

Presently, no functioning state has either completely central or
distributed control. We are all somewhere in between. In the mid-19th
century, when The Communist Manifesto was published, there was hardly
any spending on social services. Income tax was three percent in the UK,
there was no such thing as company tax, and the welfare state did not
exist. What existed was the parish and the poorhouse. In the days of
Gladstone and Disraeli, with property-based suffrage and a budget than
went mostly on the Army, the Navy, and servicing debt incurred during
the Crimean War, one could plausibly claim, as Marx and Engels did, that
"the executive of the modern state was nothing but a committee for
managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie." In the 19th century,
spending by the UK government was less than a 10th of GDP. Today it is a
third. Half the UK budget, one-sixth of GDP, goes on health, education,
and welfare.

[A degree of central planning is desirable]{.underline} to provide
infrastructure, to support basic research, and to ensure that everyone
has access to education and health services. [Regulation is
required]{.underline} to enforce contracts, to facilitate cooperation,
to provide minimum standards for products and services, and to enforce
rules on safety, pollution, and so on. **[However]{.underline}**, as an
overall policy, [maximising **individual autonomy**]{.underline} within
reason, [erring towards **computational efficiency**]{.underline} and
distributed control, [will yield dramatically **better outcomes than
central control by the AI of a one-party state.**]{.underline}

[Central planning ignores]{.underline} what is arguably the greatest
advantage of distributed control and local adaptation: [**error
correction**. It also ignores the fact that **"fairness" is notoriously
hard to define**]{.underline} in AI terms, assuming resources are to be
fairly allocated. A central planner might select what is best for an
average human, but what is best is often far from obvious. [Humans are
**quite dissimilar**]{.underline} from one another. [We share goals only
in the most **general sense**]{.underline} (for example, we seek to
avoid pain, find food, take shelter, and so forth). [We **rarely
agree**]{.underline} on what we want to do today or any other day, and
our beliefs about how to achieve things are often inconsistent.

The best possible central planner, mathematically, is a pareto-optimal
super-intelligence. This is a software agent that learns faster to
predict more accurately than any other agent, on average across all
possible tasks. This is the theoretical upper limit of intelligence
(allowing for debate over the exact definition of intelligence itself).
However, even this theoretical perfection will always be out-performed
by those with a more specifically relevant inductive bias toward a given
task (those who are less intelligent in general, but more suited to the
task at hand). In other words, even the most intelligent being possible
would make mistakes when compared with the possibilities presented by
distributed control, localised adaptation, and selective evolution. The
same goes not just for correcting mistakes, but for improving our lot in
life. Every beneficial innovation in history was an instance of an
individual breaking ranks to correct a perceived flaw in the norm, to
adapt to the specific situation at hand. Innovation requires
disobedience. To centralise control is to encourage stagnation.

The problem with [state-run monopolies]{.underline} is that they [are
**inherently inefficient**]{.underline} because they lack the error
correction provided by competition. [Markets provide **error
correction**]{.underline} [in the form of people **deciding products
suck** and **buying elsewhere**]{.underline}. In the realm of ideas,
error correction occurs when people say a party's policy does not work,
but this option is removed when free speech is curtailed. In China,
[those who criticise]{.underline} [government policy]{.underline} (or
government officials) **[disappear]{.underline}** and get silenced. Only
a lucky few like Peng Shuai have global profiles high enough to get
noticed. Notwithstanding their claims about "participatory" democracy,
in the one-party state, dissidents and innovators are purged in
darkness.

[The history of the communist world is **replete with economic
disaster**. **Millions** died]{.underline} as a result of famines caused
by Stalin and Mao. [Marxist doctrine underlies the economic
underperformance of **China compared to Taiwan**. AI **cannot save
Marxism**, but it can be used by Marxists to **serve their agendas of
surveillance** and **social control**]{.underline}. AI can be used to
bring about the death of democracy and enable the rule of a digital Big
Brother.

[Forced to choose between AI oligarchs who make fortunes selling ads,
regulated by elected governments]{.underline} that the people can
replace, [or a society ruled by AI platforms staffed with political
officers who repress all criticism]{.underline} of the party line, [the
**former is preferable**]{.underline}.

Since the Earth consists only of a finite amount of matter and energy,
we clearly cannot indefinitely consume its contents without eventually
drowning in waste or starving to death. But even this obvious insight
contains a misconception. [[We **never**]{.mark} actually
'[consume']{.mark} matter and energy in the first place. We are forever
bound by the **first law**]{.underline} of thermodynamics, which
dictates that [matter and [energy]{.mark} are [**never created** or
**destroyed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [only **transformed**]{.underline}.

This brings us back to [economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Fundamentally, it [is the process of human beings [transform]{.mark}ing
matter and [energy into]{.mark} **more [valuable forms]{.mark}** via the
development of **theoretical and practical knowledge**]{.underline}. It
is '[economic value']{.underline} which [increases
**exponentially**]{.underline}, measured (very)roughly by GDP. The
crucial point is that while [the extraction of finite physical resources
**cannot increase indefinitely on a finite planet**, economic growth
**actually can**.]{.underline}

Steven Pinker describes the infinite potential of economic growth
eloquently in his book Enlightenment Now:

'...[it's a **fallacy** to think that people "**need
resources**"]{.underline} in the first place. [They need ways of growing
food, moving around, lighting their homes, displaying information, and
other sources of well-being. They satisfy these needs with
**[ideas]{.mark}**]{.underline}: with recipes, formulas, techniques,
blueprints, and algorithms for manipulating the physical world to give
them what they want. [The human mind]{.underline}, with its recursive
combinatorial power, [[can explore an **infinite space**]{.mark} **of
ideas**]{.underline}, and is [not limited by the **quantity of any
particular kind of stuff**]{.underline} in the ground.'

Of course, [it's abundantly clear]{.underline} from history that most
[civilisations have failed miserably to generate and implement the
requisite knowledge to provide for the needs and desires]{.underline} of
their citizens. This brings us to [Hickel's]{.underline} empirical
[claim]{.underline}: that [our]{.underline} own current [trajectory is
leading us to disaster.]{.underline}

2\. Prediction or prophesy?

One might reasonably suspect that the promise of infinite economic
growth would only be plausible for a sufficiently advanced civilisation
--- particularly one that has managed to wean itself off fossil fuels.
[We should therefore ask if decoupling]{.underline} economic
[growth]{.underline} from resource use [is]{.underline} likely to be
[feasible]{.underline} given our relatively primitive level of
technological development.

On Hickel's account, things are not looking good. He cites several
studies which suggest there is no way to avoid running out of resources
if we continue with our current rate of economic growth.

The main problem with these [studies]{.underline} is that they tend to
[presume a **certain fixed '[biocapacity']{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Earth. This concept and the corresponding notion of [humanity's
'ecological footprint' [have]{.mark} **many
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the most fundamental of which is that
[they [depend **arbitrarily** on]{.mark} our **[current]{.mark} level of
scientific and technological [development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
is because [the maximum level of human consumption that our planet can
support is **not fixed**]{.underline} by some natural law --- [it
depends entirely on the **sophistication of our technology** to convert
raw materials efficiently]{.underline} into life-supporting forms.

[The very same lump of matter and energy has **vastly different
properties**]{.underline} to us humans depending on the level of and
quality of our knowledge. Major scientific
[[breakthroughs]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [allow us to
**[do]{.mark} dramatically [more with less]{.mark}**. One kilogram of
**uranium**]{.underline} [contains]{.underline} two to [three million
times more]{.underline} energy [than]{.underline} the same amount of
[coal]{.underline} or oil, but [this]{.underline} fact [went
**completely unnoticed**]{.underline} by everyone up until fundamental
breakthroughs in physics in the 20th century.

Similarly, the [invention of **[desalination]{.mark}**]{.underline}
techniques [[unlocked]{.mark} the effectively **boundless supply of
[seawater]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the rest of the Middle East
suffers water shortages, [Israel has a **surplus**]{.underline} ---
thanks to advances that have reduced the costs of desalination by
two-thirds since 1990.

One study mentioned by Hickel calculated that we'll be using 95 billion
metric tons of resources globally in 2050. But this figure is
meaningless without a corresponding estimate of what fraction that is of
the Earth's total resources. And [we **can't know what Earth's total
resources are**]{.underline} because we cannot predict future
fundamental technological advances.

At one point Hickel declares that the sustainable level of global
resource use is about 50 billion metric tons a year, without citing any
source or justification. The authors of the 2012 study he references
cited this same figure as a possible upper limit on global resource
extraction, being roughly the level of extraction there was in 1992. But
why choose this year? Because that was the year of the first United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In other words, it
was picked out of a hat.

[Even where]{.underline} these [studies make allowances for future
improvements in how efficiently we use resources, they only allow for
greater efficiency in the use of resources **we currently know
about**]{.underline}. If the future is anything like the past, [[we will
discover]{.mark} **whole [new ways to build]{.mark} and power
[things]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and replace whole classes of raw
materials we currently depend upon]{.underline}.

Then there's the fact that these studies' predicted improvements in
resource efficiency are themselves woefully pessimistic. The most
optimistic prediction in the studies Hickel mentions is that resource
efficiency will double by 2050. But almost [any consumer product we use
today requires **far fewer resources**]{.underline} to build and run
[than]{.underline} their equivalent [32 years ago]{.underline}. While
it's a somewhat trite example, take the iPhone. This one product has
replaced landline push-button phones, pagers, cameras and camcorders,
calendars, alarm clocks, audio-recorders, flashlights, maps, GPS, credit
cards, and more. We should only expect this kind of dematerialization to
accelerate over the next 32 years, given the rapid advances being made
in nanotechnology and materials science.

This fundamental fallacy driving the pessimism of these studies was
eloquently captured by David Deutsh in his book The Beginning of
Infinity. In the chapter 'Unsustainable', Deutsch reflects on Paul
Erlich warning his high school class in 1971 of the impending global
ecological collapse, a tragedy which never came to pass:

> '[Ehrlich thought]{.underline} that [he was investigating a planet's
> physical resources and predicting their rate of decline]{.underline}.
> In fact [he was prophesying the **content of future
> knowledge**]{.underline}. And, by envisaging a future in which only
> the best knowledge of 1971 was deployed, [he was implicitly
> **assuming** that only a small and rapidly dwindling set of problems
> **would ever be solved again**]{.underline}.'

It's perfectly acceptable and prudent to make predictions about future
resource scarcity, so long as you remember that such predictions are
based on our current level of scientific knowledge. Such analyses play a
crucial role in motivating us to invest more in advancing our knowledge,
but [[Hickel]{.underline}]{.mark} mistakenly [interprets]{.underline}
their [[findings as **fatalistic**]{.underline}]{.mark} signs that we
must cease economic growth altogether. And [this]{.underline}, as I'll
show below, [is simply **not an option**.]{.underline}

**[Never]{.underline} give socialists a math textbook.**

Thermodynamics in Environmental and Marxist theory,\"

As discussed earlier, a common if not predominant use of
Georgescu-Roegen's theory of [[entropy]{.underline}]{.mark} since
Rifkin's popularization in the 1980s [has been to [create the
**illusion**]{.mark}**ary appearance [of a]{.mark} robust physical
[basis]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} neo-Malthusian and
[anti-development ideologies, not to support a **[Marx]{.mark}ist
critique of neo-classical economics**]{.underline}. Hence Burkett's
embrace of Georgescu-Roegen's theory is curious given Burkett's own
valuable critique of neo-Malthusian views (Burkett, 1998).

In Rifkin's work, [the entropy concept is extended to its **apocryphal
limits**. Entropy appears]{.underline} as a pollutant, [as]{.underline}
an indicator of cosmic disorder, the inexorable outcome of all economic
activity, [the mother of **ecocatastrophe**]{.underline}.
(Georgescu-Roegen enthusiastically endorses Rifkin's treatment of the
subject (Georgescu-Roegen, 1980). Rifkin, as noted, favors a
pre-industrial global population of less than one billion people, and
rejects the use of computers since they generate entropy (1989 edition,
190-191)! Should we wonder whether Rifkin's more recent books were
composed on a word processor rather than a less entropic typewriter?

[[Entropy is **too abstract**]{.mark} **and coarse**]{.underline} a
concept [to illuminate most issues in the environmental
discourse]{.underline} unless the full context of its use is thought
through---the "ascent from the abstract to the concrete" in Marxist
epistemology (Ilyenkov, 1982). [[Its invocation]{.mark} in the
environmental discourse commonly [serves **little
purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} [other [than **to avoid**]{.mark}
**[clarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} while [[creating the **illusion of
rigor**]{.underline}]{.mark} [because a concept from theoretical physics
is used]{.underline}. [Is entropy a useful measure of
unsustainability?]{.underline} A consideration of the physical entropic
flux (roughly equivalent to the radiant energy flux) from the Earth's
surface should demonstrate that appealing to anthropogenic (man-made)
entropy production as a measure of negative environmental impacts fails
to recognize their real qualitative aspects.

This entropic flux is dominated by the natural heat production from both
solar radiation interacting with the Earth's surface and incoming
radiation from the greenhouse effect. [[Any]{.mark} plausible
anthropogenic [contribution is **trivial**.]{.mark} The
greatest]{.underline} potential [anthropogenic contribution arises from
global **warming**]{.underline}. Since to a good first approximation the
entropic flux is equal to the incoming solar flux divided by the
absolute temperature (Schwartzman, 1999, 2002, 162-163), a [[5
deg]{.mark} C global [rise]{.mark} in surface temperature [will
lower]{.mark} this [flux]{.mark} by **about [2%]{.mark},**]{.underline}
which is derived from the ratio of absolute temperatures (288/293), the
global incoming solar energy flux being the same (recall that the
denominator of the entropy flux expression is always the absolute
temperature). [Whatever the change in entropic flux arising from
changes]{.underline} in the Earth's surface temperature, [the entropic
[flux]{.mark} in itself will [tell us **nothing about**]{.mark} **actual
[impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} of global warming, [which
are]{.underline} both the linear and **[nonlinear]{.underline}**
outcomes of fossil fuel consumption and other sources of anthropogenic
greenhouse gases. The concrete linkage of cause and effect must be
worked out from application of the sciences of biogeochemistry,
climatology, oceanography, ecology etc. Likewise, while the entropy of
mixing gives some insight into general aspects of pollution it fails to
capture the relevant qualitative aspects so critical to the health of
humans and nature (Schwartzman, 1996).

On a cosmological scale, the [increase in entropy in the universe is
inevitable]{.underline} as expressed in the Second Law, [but this very
increase is the necessary requirement for the **emergence** and
**maintenance of self-organized systems**. The debt of self-organizing
systems to "chaos" is the environmental increase in
entropy]{.underline}. As we shall see [sustainable societal
self-organization on the planet Earth is **only limited** by the
**low-entropy solar flux**, a limit with **no practical
consequences**]{.underline} far into the future, [with the entropic debt
paid as the **heat flux to space**, the **ultimate heat
sink**]{.underline}. This future, I argue, is only achievable by the
contingent outcome of global red-green struggle.

Given the mineral and fossil fuels reserves of the Earth's crust, the
\"economic system is\... doomed to \"run down\" as the low entropy
material resources on earth are dissipated and become unavailable\"
(Burkett, 2005, 135, quoting Georgescu-Roegen). [[We do **not** need
a]{.mark} **fallacious [fourth law to tell us]{.mark}
this**]{.underline}, the first and second laws provide sufficient
explanation. Without the use of incoming solar radiation, this system
will ultimately run out of available energy to do work. It is important
to point out that even without the use of incoming solar radiation as a
prime source of energy (aside from the low efficiency collection by
photosynthesis, the basis of agriculture), [this system is **not
isolated**]{.underline} since waste [heat is dissipated, ultimately
**radiated into space**]{.underline}. Nuclear energy, even fusion power
will only postpone this ultimate fate in a real economy limited to the
terrestrial environment since this energy source utilizes the finite
reserves of fissionable (or, in the future, fusionable) raw material.
**[The solar fusion reactor 93 million miles away]{.underline}** [is the
**true sustainable alternative**.]{.underline}

Thus the inescapable flaw of the fourth law is its neglect of the
possible flow of energy into/out of the system which is defined as
closed but not isolated. [By converting low entropy, high temperature
energy]{.underline} (solar radiation) [to high entropy, low temperature
heat, work can be produced to **recycle indefinitely**]{.underline}
(footnote 2). A caveat: indefinitely does not mean \"eternally\" (even
protons may have a finite half-life). To get concrete about this issue,
the relevant time scale is hundreds, even millions of years, not
eternity. Moreover, we should be considering the urgent prospect of
solarizing and demilitarizing human society in the 21st century, not in
the distant future, when humanity will plausibly expand outward in our
solar system and even further into the galaxy if it survives the present
epoch of destructive capital reproduction and future challenges.

Interestingly, in one text Georgescu-Roegen (1976, 8) incorrectly
defines "closed" as entailing no exchange of matter or energy with
\[[the]{.underline}\] [environment]{.underline} (recall that in
thermodynamics this [is defined as an **"isolated" system**,
not]{.underline} a **["closed" system]{.underline}**); he still
maintained that according to the second law matter along with energy is
subject to irrevocable dissipation. This confusion may be linked to his
pessimistic view on harnessing solar energy since the latter is the
relevant energy flux to consider for the closed but not isolated system
containing economic activity on the earth's surface. Thus, immediately
following his formulation of the fourth law in his 1980 text we find his
argument that there is no immediate prospect of solar energy (high
efficiency) going from feasible to viable, i.e., escaping from its
perpetual status as a parasite on fossil fuels, the dominant
contemporary energy source. Parenthetically, I found no evidence that
Georgescu-Roegen ever explicitly corrected himself by acknowledging his
definition of closed systems in this paper (Georgescu-Roegen 1976) was
wrong.

But Burkett claims that the concept of unavailable matter, "the
inevitability of friction, corrosion and decomposition" transcending
energy reductionism is critical to Georgescu-Roegen's insight.
Therefore, Burkett argues that since the "earth is open to massive solar
energy inflows but basically closed materially, it is not surprising
that low-entropy matter, not energy, emerges most clearly as the
ultimate constraint on human production" (Burkett, 2005, 119-120). I
welcome Burkett's implied rejection of Georgescu-Roegen's views on solar
viability. But his argument regarding the implications of "unavailable
matter" is highly problematic, recognizing that it is a partial retreat
from the strong version of the fourth law. On what time scale? What are
the real and potential fluxes of low entropy solar energy that can
reclaim this dissipated matter? Just what determines the
"unavailability" of high entropy matter? Does this alleged constraint
imply that near future migration to the moon or asteroid Belt is
necessary? Is waste heat a critical concern with respect to the
utilization of solar energy? And finally is this spectre of "unavailable
matter" really relevant to a future solarized physical economy? My short
answer to each of the previous three questions is: no.

What is the ultimate limit to global energy consumption? Presently the
global anthropogenic (human-created) energy flux is equal to 0.03% of
solar flux to land. Or, to put it another way, [humanity currently uses
an amount of energy]{.underline}, mostly from fossil fuels, equivalent
[to **0.03%**]{.underline} [of the solar energy reaching the land
surface of earth]{.underline}. Hence tapping this solar flux has a huge
potential as the energy basis of a solar utopia, with much smaller
impacts on global ecology than the present unsustainable reliance on
fossil fuels and nuclear power (Schwartzman, 1996). Thus, for a solar
energy source, the waste heat flux back into space is to a very good
first approximation not incremental to the natural infrared flux from
the Earth's surface, at least until such time as human energy demand
increases many hundreds of times. This is precisely the same argument
made by Kaberger and Mansson (2001) referenced but unfortunately not
addressed in Burkett's paper. Of course, I am not claiming that the
first basis for human civilization, low efficiency biomass energy, can
be the basis of this solarized economy. Only high-efficiency solar
energy can do this. The conflation of the two is common in
Neo-Malthusian treatment (e.g., Huesemann, 2001, 2003).

Recycling

Now, more specifically on the possibility of \"complete\" recycling in
an open system, Burkett's discussion of this issue (Burkett, 2005, 132)
lacks sufficient concreteness with respect to a real physical economy on
the earth's surface, consistent with Georgescu-Roegen and Daly's
abstract treatment. In practical terms, [[100%]{.mark} recycling
[efficiency is **not required**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Kaberger and
Mansson\'s (2001) illuminating discussion). Given the possibilities of a
future dematerialized solar economy, with a lower throughput than now,
and of course recognizing that current information technology is not
really dematerialized under current capital reproduction, as Burkett
rightfully argues, (2005,135), the huge solar flux is again the basis of
any ultimate limit to practical recycling on the earth\'s surface, and
not the entropic flux of waste heat. The latter would be dissipated
anyway by the absorption of solar energy on a land surface (with an
albedo, i.e., reflectivity, of about 0.3-0.4, with 0 being perfectly
absorbing and 1 being perfectly reflecting (like an ideal white
surface). Under these conditions, [the]{.underline} \"tremendous
[[increase in the entropy]{.mark} of the environment\']{.underline} or
the "adverse material effects of waste heat on eco-systems" [resulting
from recycling]{.underline} (Burkett, 2005,132-133) [[is an
**illusion**]{.underline}]{.mark} for a solarized economy as Kaberger
and Mansson (2001) show. Unfortunately, [Burkett's
discussion]{.underline} of the case made for the plausibility of total
recycling in an industrial society (citing Ayres, 1999) [does not
**confront the qualitative difference**]{.underline} between a solarized
and a depletable-energy-based economy.

Many will see the Young Labour Twitter account saga as yet another
battle in the perpetual civil war between the left and the right of
Labour, and as Young Labour---one of the last bastions of Corbynite
socialist supremacy---attempting to undermine Keir Starmer's leadership,
which they see as a betrayal of Labour values. While Starmer's
moderation on economic policy, as seen in his attempts to reposition the
Labour Party as business-friendly and his equivocations over tax policy,
may be misplaced overreactions to Corbyn's devastating loss in 2019, his
return to foreign policy more in line with international norms certainly
is not. Corbyn's anti-American, "anti-imperialist" politics not only
alienated much of the electorate (according to a 2020 poll, 65% of
people in the UK support NATO), but were only dubiously progressive. The
left was correct to call out America's foreign policy blunders in Iraq
and elsewhere---however, [constructive criticism of American overreach
has now been replaced by an **overarching**]{.underline},
**[hyper-reductive]{.underline}** [ideology that places America and
neoliberalism at the **centre** of the world's ills]{.underline}.
Corbyn's sympathy for Nicolás Maduro's authoritarian regime in Venezuela
and his flirtations with Hamas and Hezbollah are symptomatic of this
outlook. And [there is **no clearer example** of the manifestation of
this ideology than in the supposedly left-wing **criticisms of
NATO**]{.underline}, which Corbyn himself espouses.

Young Labour's preposterous [idea that it was]{.underline} "[NATO
aggression]{.underline}" [that precipitated the Russian invasion betrays
a **fundamental misunderstanding**]{.underline} [of NATO's
function]{.underline}. [NATO troops were deployed in Poland and the
Baltic states in a **defensive response**]{.underline} [to the **largest
military build-up** since **World War II**]{.underline}. [This was **not
escalatory brinkmanship**]{.underline} [by the US trying to impose its
will on the world]{.underline}. Unlike the Russians in Belarus and in
Russian-occupied Crimea, the [US offered **no shows of
force**]{.underline} and undertook no "military exercises," as they are
euphemistically called. [This was NATO operating at its most
**fundamental level**]{.underline}: [as an alliance for **mutual
defence**]{.underline}. [Countries that still bear **deep scars** from
**centuries** of **Russian imperialism**]{.underline} [were
**understandably concerned** at the potential of spillover from any
conflict in Ukraine and so]{.underline}---**[quite
reasonably]{.underline}**---[requested additional support from their
larger NATO allies]{.underline}. [It is rather **ironic**]{.underline}
[that the]{.underline} "[anti-imperialist]{.underline}" [contingent of
the left would have quite **happily abandoned**]{.underline} [the very
defensive commitments that have prevented these sovereign nations from
being **preyed on** by a **revanchist**, **imperialist**
Russia]{.underline}.

Some of NATO's left-wing critics argue that it is the organisation's
expansion into Eastern Europe that has forced Russia onto a paranoid
warpath, but this argument does not hold water either. [Countries join
NATO by **democratic consent**]{.underline}---[a fact that only the
**most absurd** CIA conspiracy theories can explain away]{.underline}.
[Had Russia been a **good neighbour** to its Eastern European former
client and satellite states, perhaps NATO would not have
expanded]{.underline} beyond Germany. [Instead, Russian
leaders]{.underline} since Boris Yeltsin [have viewed Russia's **former
sphere** as the country's **birth right**]{.underline}, [crushing
nascent separatist movements within Russia's own borders with **horrific
brutality**]{.underline}, [while supporting pro-Russian separatist
movements in **Moldova** and **Georgia**]{.underline}. This cynical
policy would have collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions
had it not devolved into the blood-and-soil imperialism that we see
playing out in the invasion of Ukraine. Yeltsin may be remembered
through rose-tinted glasses as a cheery drunkard, but his desperation to
maintain Russia's status as a superpower set Russian foreign policy on
course to where it is today. Putin has now simply taken that foreign
policy to its logical conclusion. No wonder much of Eastern Europe
wished to join NATO, the one alliance that could give these nations
credible anti-imperialist protection.

[NATO is too often **viewed reductively**]{.underline}, [as an American
sphere of influence, in much the same way as the **Warsaw Pact**
countries comprised a Soviet sphere of influence]{.underline}. [It is
true that a **degree of alignment** with some American foreign policy
goals and values is implicit in NATO membership, but this is in **no
way**]{.underline} [equivalent to the influence the Soviets exerted over
their client states during the Cold War]{.underline}. [NATO members are
**sovereign states** and have **acted against** US interests in the
past]{.underline}. For instance, Turkey recently (wrongly) invaded
America's Kurdish allies in Syria. Likewise, [NATO]{.underline}
(**[rightly]{.underline}**) **[refused]{.underline}** [US requests for
assistance during the invasion of **Iraq**]{.underline}. As [these
**concrete actions** demonstrate]{.underline}, [NATO is **far more**
than an American-led sphere and has remained **grounded**]{.underline}
[in the **democratic principles**]{.underline} [upon which it was
founded]{.underline}, even though the US is able to leverage more power
than it did at NATO's founding in 1949. [The characterisation of NATO as
a tool of American imperialism]{.underline}, then, [is **demonstrably
false**]{.underline}.

[Criticism of NATO is not limited to the realm of geopolitical
machinations]{.underline}. [Many on the left see it as a vessel for
American business interests and neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}.
[History has **shown otherwise**]{.underline}. It was Clement Attlee's
British Labour government that signed the North Atlantic Treaty in 1947,
founding NATO. And while Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that
signatories should "eliminate conflict in their international economic
policies" and "encourage economic collaboration," this did not prevent
Attlee's government from being one of the most transformative in British
history: it established the modern welfare state and continues to be
widely celebrated by the Labour left today. [**Norway** and
**Denmark**]{.underline}, [both **founding members** of
NATO]{.underline}, [are **flourishing** social democracies where social
democrats and **democratic socialists** have spent **more time** in
power than in opposition since 1949]{.underline}.

Clearly, [NATO **has not impeded** progressive political movements
within its member states]{.underline}. In fact, [the existence of NATO
has had **positive repercussions**]{.underline} [for the European
left]{.underline}. The [unification of Western Europe under a single
military alliance]{.underline} [forced member states to **abandon** the
**nationalist**]{.underline} [and **revanchist grudges**]{.underline}
[that had dogged European politics for **centuries**]{.underline}. The
political moderation this encouraged has meant that---even in those
European countries where social democrats have not had much political
success---the right-wing opposition generally takes the form of
Christian Democrats, who are far more moderate than the reactionary,
nationalist conservative parties that were prominent prior to World War
II. At the same time, the strength of NATO's collective opposition to
the Soviet Union prevented that brand of highly authoritarian and
reactionary socialism from gaining traction in Europe. Instead, leftist
movements have been largely characterised by a more liberal tradition,
which opposes state-sponsored violence and emphasises human rights.

[Far from propping up the military-industrial complex]{.underline}---as
NATO is often accused of doing---[mutual defence and the guarantee of
peace have allowed **defence spending** to be **dramatically
decreased**]{.underline} [throughout Europe]{.underline}. Part of this
decrease may be attributed to the end of the Cold War---but defence
spending has been on the decline since the 1960s and this is at least
partly due to the peace between Western European neighbours that NATO
has assured. In fact, defence spending has arguably declined too much.
Most nations in the alliance have still not met NATO's defence spending
target of 2% of GDP, leaving America to foot the remaining bill. While
this has meant that many European nations have been able to develop
their welfare states, this has been at the expense of Americans, who
still face a particularly vicious brand of capitalism with limited
safety nets.

As Germany's overnight policy shift following the invasion of Ukraine
has shown, committing to the 2% target is not a tall order. It would
enable us to maintain our collective defence while allowing America a
much-needed financial reprieve. It would also diminish America's
influence upon the alliance, allowing European nations more of a say on
collective defence policy and procurement. Hopefully, this would
encourage a shift away from the American military-industrial complex and
toward a more competitive, less monopolised defence industry, which
holds less sway over governments.

History is often viewed as an inexorable march of progress and
development from the barbarism of war to enlightened peace. This seems
to be the underlying thinking of NATO's left-wing detractors. But just
as Rome fell, [peace and progress are never inevitable, nor should they
ever be **taken for granted**]{.underline}. Francis Fukuyama's argument
that we have reached the end of history has been widely derided by many
on [the left]{.underline} who find the idea that humanity will not
progress past neoliberal democracy absurd. I agree with them---but [in
looking only forward, they have **failed** to **look
back**]{.underline}. [The fact that they see capitalist liberal
democracy as the **archenemy** of peace and progress is not only
**extraordinarily privileged**]{.underline} [but **terrifyingly
dangerous**]{.underline}. The west's terrible interventions in Iraq and
Afghanistan have confirmed this narrative for many. This thinking
explains Young Labour's tweets: NATO is to blame for Putin's invasion,
since neoliberalism is the sole force of evil in the world. However, [as
the tanks rolled into Ukraine, history returned once more to remind us
that there are **far darker**, **more dangerous** enemies of
progress]{.underline}. [It is these enemies that NATO continues to
**forestall** and, in doing so, allow for the **peace** and **progress**
of which]{.underline} we [Europeans are beneficiaries
today]{.underline}. While it is a tragedy that it has taken the whiplash
of war for us to look back at history, I hope these events may foster
newfound gratitude for NATO and the peace and progress that it has
helped achieve. I look forward to the day when the progressive left---of
which I am proud to be a part---will view NATO, alongside the NHS and
the welfare state, as one of Labour's greatest achievements.

In the wake of Russia's war against Ukraine, demand for NATO membership
has spiked once again, even in the historically neutral countries of
Finland and Sweden. Further south, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are
also desperately seeking a fast track to NATO membership.

[Many]{.underline} in the West [see NATO as a tool of U.S. imperialism
and empire]{.underline}, and in important ways it is. NATO has afforded
the United States the legitimacy to militaristically intervene abroad,
most notably in the case of Libya in 2011. NATO is both a cause and
effect of the United States' global hegemony via its grand strategy of
primacy, despite the end of Cold War rivalries.

[In the post-Cold War era, **however**, NATO **did not grow** simply
because the United States dictated it]{.underline}. [On the contrary,
**foreign demands** for security assurances have **consistently
spurred**]{.underline} [NATO's enlargement]{.underline} long before
Russia's war in Ukraine.

NATO's eastward enlargement is member-driven. Yet, both pro-NATO and
[**anti-NATO** Western commentators and analysts often **ignore**
Eastern European **regional voices**]{.underline}. [They reduce Eastern
Europeans to **objects without agency**]{.underline} that the West may
choose to act upon.

[Unless scholars and **policymakers**]{.underline} [delve into the
**regional complexities**]{.underline} [and the
**demand-side**]{.underline} [of NATO membership in
**earnest**]{.underline}, [they will miss **important dynamics** at play
and make it harder to **steer** or **predict** future U.S. foreign
policy trends]{.underline}. [They will continue to understand world
politics only through the **preferences** and **choices** of **Western
leaders**]{.underline}.

[A **more complete**]{.underline} [picture of NATO's
trajectory]{.underline} in the twenty-first century [emerges only when
**allowing room** for the **agency** of other countries and
citizens]{.underline}. Even a more restrained U.S. foreign policy
requires an assessment of why [there remains so much **local demand**
for NATO]{.underline}, which is partially driven by the West's
complicity in spurring authoritarian regimes in Europe.

NATO Membership Was Popular in Eastern Europe

It is now clear to even casual observers why countries bordering Russia
have sought NATO membership, often with high public support at every
step of the way. These countries have been ringing the alarm on
escalating Russian aggression for decades.

And still, prominent Western voices, from [**conservative libertarians**
and]{.underline} European leftists to [**American neorealists** and Fox
News' **Tucker Carlson**, blame NATO's eastward expansion for Russia's
aggression. They claim that Ukraine's nonalignment is a **core national
interest** for Russia]{.underline}. [The Democratic Socialists of
America]{.underline} even [released a statement blaming Western
imperialist expansion]{.underline} for stoking Russia's legitimate
fears. Of course, [Russian foreign policy perpetuates this **same
narrative**]{.underline}.

But as neo-realist John Mearsheimer has himself admitted, Ukraine
presents a vital national interest to Russia because "[Putin is a **19th
Century** man]{.underline}." In other words, [Ukraine's NATO aspirations
are **only threats** to Russian core interests when seen through the
lens of its **imperial past**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} renewed
imperialistic **[ambitions]{.underline}**. [Also telling is Putin's
recent statement on **Sweden and Finland**'s]{.underline} pending NATO
membership applications. [He proclaimed that Russia]{.underline} "[has
**no problem**]{.underline} ... [these countries do not pose a **direct
threat** to Russia]{.underline}." [Only Ukraine poses a problem. Yet,
**neither Ukraine nor NATO** directly threatens Russia's **borders**,
**sovereignty**, or **physical survival**]{.underline} [in **any clear
way**]{.underline}. Moreover, [**until now**, Ukraine had **little
chance**]{.underline} [of joining NATO]{.underline} in the coming years.
Therefore, [it is **imperialism**, **not** core interests or **NATO
enlargement**, that drives Russian aggression]{.underline} in Ukraine.

These prominent voices do not consider that **[Russian
aggression]{.underline}** [has been the **primary reason**]{.underline}
[Baltic and Eastern European countries have **sought**]{.underline}
[NATO's protection]{.underline}. At its most basic iteration, [Russia
aims to halt NATO expansion to preserve a **privileged sphere of
influence**]{.underline} [and **domination** in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. In contrast, [Eastern European countries seek NATO
membership to ensure their **survival**]{.underline} [as **sovereign**
nation-states against a regional imperial power]{.underline}. [NATO,
**with all its flaws**, has been a **guarantor of
sovereignty**]{.underline} [for its European members]{.underline}.

It is not surprising that [new members have shown **strong public
support**]{.underline} [for NATO]{.underline} prior to accession. As
shown in the table below, ten out of eleven countries that joined NATO
in the 2000s did so with public support over 50 percent, often even over
70 percent, prior to membership. The only country that bucked this trend
was Montenegro, which at the time of polling in 2017 was divided between
pro-Western and pro-Russian factions.

Public opinion data taken from the Pew Research Center in 2021 continues
to show strong, consistent support for NATO among Eastern European and
Balkan countries.

Note: Publicly-available poll sources hyperlinked within the table. Most
recently available data prior to the accession of the country listed.

[Therefore, it is **misleading** to use the language of NATO "expanding
into]{.underline}" the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999, the
Baltic [countries]{.underline} in 2004, and then the Balkan states in
2009 and onward. Furthermore, [NATO is **not a monolith**]{.underline}.
[Member states **disagree ardently** at times, even against **key U.S.
demands**]{.underline} [as in]{.underline} the case of the 2003
intervention in **[Iraq]{.underline}**, [where NATO had **no
involvement**]{.underline} [given member objections]{.underline}.

[In trying to condemn Western imperialism, such passive language
**perpetuates imperialist notions** and **withholds agency** from
non-Western citizens]{.underline}.

[Eastern and Southern European countries **actively sought**
membership]{.underline} in the alliance, [**prioritizing** NATO
accession in their foreign and domestic policies for
**decades**]{.underline}. [When these countries finally joined the
alliance, many citizens **cheered in relief**]{.underline}.

Even countries that do not directly border Russia are enthusiastic about
NATO membership, particularly in the Western Balkans. This is because
the United States is not the only imperialist power afoot.

The Case for NATO in the Western Balkans

While Western imperialism should be condemned, so should the non-Western
variety. [In Eastern Europe, it was the Soviet Union that embodied the
**worst of imperialism**]{.underline}. [Today it is Russia, with its
numerous **military invasions** and **occupations** in the region since
1999]{.underline}.

In the Western Balkans, [the United States and NATO have not posed an
existential threat to the citizens of **Albania**, **Croatia**,
**Bosnia** and **Herzegovina**, **Greece**, and **Kosovo**]{.underline}.
Instead, these citizens worry about threats to their homelands stemming
from regional hegemons and revisionist powers, including Russia, Serbia,
and Turkey.

For instance, in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia, citizens
and leaders fear the rise of a revisionist Serbia echoing the
aspirations of a Serbian-led Yugoslavia, now called Serb World. [The
**genocides** and **gruesome wars** of the 1990s remain fresh and
terrifying reminders of such **existential fears**, as **mass graves**
of **civilian victims**, continue to be uncovered]{.underline}. For
others, it is the rise of a revisionist Turkey, renewed land grabs, the
suppression of minority rights in Greece, or fears of a Russian-backed
coup in Montenegro that spark dread. The youngest state in the region,
Kosovo, fears for its very survival as it vies for United Nations (UN)
recognition against Serbia's derecognition campaigns and
hyper-nationalist mobilizations, as well as Russia's opposition.

Balkan and Eastern European [support for NATO membership **originates**
from a **history of oppression** by regional powers, prompting **strong
demands** for **external protection**]{.underline}. [Any scholar or
policymaker who does not acknowledge this **local reality** will
**reproduce incomplete perspectives**]{.underline} [or worse, promote
accounts that **hollow out local agency**]{.underline}.

Even Anti-Imperialists Cite Imperialist Solutions

[Discussing NATO]{.underline} enlargement within Eastern Europe and the
Balkans [without delving into the **complexities** of **regional
history** and **politics** is an **imperialist project**]{.underline}.
[When Western actors explain NATO membership through the lens of
**Western machinations** and **blame** European states for their NATO
aspirations, they are **really saying** that Eastern European and Balkan
countries should be content to serve as **buffer states** between
empires and accept their lot as **second-class** nations]{.underline}.

Ironically, [even when famous scholars]{.underline} such as Mearsheimer
[**critique** U.S. imperialism and militarism, they still manage to
**promote a world** in which **only the United States** has **agency**
and **only** the United States' **great power rivals
matter**]{.underline}.

The West can engage in self-criticism of its foreign policy without
blaming the victims of other imperialist powers. In fact, [the West can
begin its **moral reckoning** by understanding and accepting how its
**accommodation of Russia**]{.underline} and other local aggressors [has
**inflamed regional fears**]{.underline} [and **magnified demands** for
NATO enlargement]{.underline}.

For instance, [by buying Russian energy on Russia's terms
and]{.underline} remaining ~~mute~~ [or even **legitimizing** Russia's
invasions of its weaker neighbors, the United States and European Union
have perpetuated **corruption**]{.underline} [and
**authoritarianism**]{.underline} [in Russia and Europe]{.underline}. By
propping up authoritarian "ethnocrat" leaders in the Western Balkans in
the name of regional stability, the West has inflamed regional
imperialists, encouraged separatist agendas, and exacerbated instability
and tension. All of this only fuels regional demands for NATO
protection.

Instead of blaming the victims of another imperialist power, the West
should focus on its own complicity in enabling regional aggressors.

Other countries have agency in international relations; NATO membership
proves it. [**Any account** that portrays NATO's eastward expansion only
through the lens of **Western politics dismisses** Eastern European and
Balkan countries as **powerless pawns** of empire]{.underline}.

**NATO is an [instrument]{.underline}, not a theology. They must prove

Of course, [NATO's obituary has been written many times
before]{.underline}. In the opening to Why NATO Endures, quietly one of
the best books on the alliance, Wallace J. Thies wryly notes that Henry
[Kissinger]{.underline} owns the unique distinction of having [declared
the alliance to be in serious peril in each of the first six decades of
NATO's existence]{.underline}.\[5\] For the time being, [**better
policies** on how NATO is used should be the **focus**, rather than
scrapping it altogether]{.underline} or withdrawing U.S. support. Key to
this will be working to enhance strategic stability between the alliance
and Russia.

DE-MYSTIFYING THE PAST

To some extent, NATO is a victim of its own myth-making. Support for the
alliance is often couched in somber testaments to the wisdom of the
founders and odes to the selfless nobility of collective defense. The
reality is quite different.

Interestingly, the main strategic rationale for NATO that emerges in the
pages of Thies' book is as a complement to the Marshall Plan: just as
funds from that initiative would allow the Europeans to rebuild their
economies, NATO would remove the burden from the European allies of
having to devote scarce money to their militaries. It would also provide
psychological reinforcement to nations still traumatized by the Second
World War, living in Stalin's long shadow. Once the West European
economies had stabilized and rebounded, they could---in theory---take on
a greater share of their defense and the United States could
recede.\[6\]

Thus, in the late 1940s, many U.S. officials didn't expect to base
American troops in Europe indefinitely.\[7\] Nor did they necessarily
expect them to have to fight. While the Soviets might attempt mischief
within their own sphere of influence---as seen in the 1948 coup in
Czechoslovakia and the blockade of West Berlin---their ability and
willingness to go beyond that was considered limited by key thinkers
such as George Kennan, who believed the Soviet military and people too
spent from the Second World War to threaten Western Europe.\[8\]
Moreover, Stalin was seen as distinct from Hitler in terms of his
willingness to pursue risk. While the Soviet leader might try to
capitalize on existing chaos and weakness, he wasn't disposed to the
outright aggression that characterized the Nazi regime.\[9\]

But in a prescient prelude to the defensibility issues surrounding the
admission of the Baltic states, not a great deal of thought was given to
how Western Europe would actually be defended when the alliance was
formed---at least in terms of conventional forces. Of course, in April
1949, America still had a nuclear monopoly.

The Soviet detonation of its own atomic device in August 1949 changed
the U.S. calculus somewhat, but it was events around the world a year
later that truly focused America's mind on what it had signed up for in
NATO. The conventional defeats suffered by the U.S. military in the
opening stage of the Korean War ,  as much as any development, led to a
realistic discussion of what collective defense would really look like
in Europe---almost eighteen months after the alliance's inception.\[10\]
It was only then that planners on both sides of the Atlantic began to
take seriously the practical questions of defensibility and to set up
integrated military structures---such as the Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe, or SHAPE---to coordinate those efforts.\[11\]
Subsequently, NATO's role as an institution and U.S. force deployments
in Europe would both take on permanence.

The ad hoc nature of this process is the point worth underscoring. NATO
was not formed by strategic gods implementing their divine wisdom; it
was the result of hardworking government officials and political leaders
doing their best to deal with the security challenges of the day using
the means at their disposal. That is all the alliance has ever been, and
we exalt its past at the risk of its future.

[NATO AS AN **INSTRUMENT**, NOT A THEOLOGY]{.underline}

Understanding that NATO outlasted its original purpose---to allow the
Europeans to focus on rebuilding their economies in tandem with the
Marshall Plan---well before the end of the Cold War illustrates that the
alliance has always been an adaptable instrument. It is true that some
twentieth-century luminaries such as Kennan and Dwight Eisenhower didn't
foresee NATO evolving into a permanent fixture in European security at
its inception.\[12\] But should that have stopped the alliance from
becoming an effective military bulwark against the Soviets as the Cold
War developed and demands on the alliance evolved?

Just as it adapted and changed throughout its early history, [NATO's
purpose now can be **whatever is required**]{.underline}. This doesn't
mean that NATO should do everything---or be everywhere. The past thirty
years have shown that there are some things the alliance does better
than others and also that there are questionable benefits to unending
expansion of its membership. President George W. Bush's support for
Georgian and Ukrainian membership at the 2008 Bucharest Summit is the
most prominent example of this and likely contributed to both the August
War in Georgia and Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.\[13\]

But here, too, perspective is needed. [Because the alliance should
consider ending expansion doesn't mean previous rounds were inherently
mistakes]{.underline}. [Enlargement permanently settled the **Polish
Question**]{.underline}---[which provided grist for a **century and a
half** of European **wars**]{.underline}---[and also has]{.underline} on
balance [contributed to **stability** between Russia and the Baltic
states]{.underline}. Likewise, [being realistic about the failure of the
Libya intervention doesn't mean the 1995 operation to stop **ethnic
cleansing** in **Bosnia** was also a mistake]{.underline}. [The 1999
Kosovo intervention probably falls somewhere in the
middle]{.underline}.\[14\]

[NATO frankly does its best work when no one hears about
it]{.underline}. [Its strength lies in the **day-to-day** military
cooperation it fosters and the general sense of **deterrence** and
**stability** it promotes]{.underline}. These contributions are neither
as dramatic as facing off against the Red Army at the height of the Cold
War, nor as controversial as the Libyan intervention, but they would be
glaring in their absence.

[Why arbitrarily remove the structure that provides that
stability]{.underline}---[both with **Russia** and also among NATO's
many **disparate members**]{.underline}? Withdrawing NATO protection
from the Baltic states or the smaller Balkan members, for example, will
not preclude the possibility of their becoming involved in a war with
Russia or Serbia; just the opposite, it could make it more likely. Once
such a conflict begins, is it certain the United States will not be
entangled or affected even if it is no longer actively participating in
NATO?

Again, it is worth reiterating that NATO is an instrument. Many of the
alliance's opponents may actually be opposed to the way the United
States and its partners have employed force since the end of the Cold
War---especially in the case of operations falling under the rubric of
regime change. [The argument]{.underline}, implicit in Posen's OpEd, for
example, [is that NATO needs to be taken away from reckless U.S.
policymakers to prevent them from future adventures]{.underline}.

[This argument is **backwards**]{.underline}. [Yes, the **consequences**
of]{.underline} three decades of continuous [military operations should
be examined.]{.underline} [But]{.underline} increasing national
restraint and [making **better strategic decisions** seems like a
**smarter path** than summarily scrapping an **effective**]{.underline},
[**tested tool** that could play an **essential role** in a wiser
foreign policy]{.underline}.

**NATO brought [peace]{.underline} to Europe. The critique

The great NATO enlargement debate never ends. In the 1990s, U.S.
officials and academics argued about whether pushing the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization into Eastern Europe was likely to sustain the
post-Cold War peace or prematurely end it. More recently, critics have
charged that Russia's war in Ukraine is a natural response to the
aggressive expansion of America's most powerful alliance.

Now Russian officials, and even President Vladimir Putin himself, have
echoed --- and sometimes directly cited --- American scholars such as
political scientist John Mearsheimer, who argues that the current crisis
"is the West's fault."

The "blame NATO" argument tells a story of hubris, arrogance and
tragedy. It holds that there was a golden chance for lasting peace in
Europe, but the U.S. threw it all away. Rather than conciliating a
defeated rival, Washington repeatedly humiliated it by expanding a vast
military alliance up to Russia's borders and even into the former Soviet
Union. This pursuit of American hegemony in a liberal-democratic guise
eventually provoked a violent rebuke.

In this telling, Putin's wars against Georgia and Ukraine are just the
natural response of one great power whose vital interests are being
heedlessly threatened by another.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part,
to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But the idea
that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
geopolitically bizarre.

Far from being a historic blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the
**great American successes**]{.underline} of the post-Cold War era. [Far
from being the act of a domineering superpower, it was part of a long
tradition of **vulnerable states begging** to join America's liberal
empire]{.underline}. [And far from posing a mortal threat to Moscow,
NATO enlargement actually provided Russia with far **greater
security**]{.underline} [than it could have provided
itself]{.underline}.

NATO's big bang

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

[To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember
something]{.underline} that nearly [everyone has now
forgotten]{.underline}: [There was **no guarantee** that Europe would be
mostly **stable**, **peaceful** and **democratic** after the Cold
War]{.underline}. In fact, many of the analysts who now view NATO
expansion as a catastrophe once warned that [a post-Cold War Europe
could become a **violent hellscape**]{.underline}.

[It wasn't an outlandish scenario]{.underline}. [A reunified Germany
might once again try to **dominate** its neighbors]{.underline}; [the
old enmity between Moscow and Berlin could **reignite**]{.underline}.
[The collapse of Soviet influence]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [could
liberate]{.underline} those [states to pursue]{.underline}
long-suppressed [**territorial claims** and **nationalist
agendas**]{.underline}. [**Ethnic tensions** and **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline} [might **explode**]{.underline} [as the
Cold War order crumbled]{.underline}.

[If the U.S. pulled back]{.underline} once the Soviet threat was gone,
[there would be no]{.underline} extra-European [superpower to **put out
fires**]{.underline} [on a continent with lots of **geopolitical
kindling**]{.underline}. "[The prospect of major crises, even
wars]{.underline}, in Europe [is likely to **increase
dramatically**]{.underline}," Mearsheimer predicted in 1990.

[NATO enlargement was the **logical answer**]{.underline} to these
fears. Expansion was a way of binding a reunified Germany to the West
and surrounding it with democratic allies. [Joining NATO required new
members to lay aside any **revanchist designs**, while allowing them to
pursue]{.underline} economic and **[political reforms]{.underline}**
[rather than investing heavily in military capabilities]{.underline} to
defend their newly won autonomy.

[NATO's move]{.underline} to the east [also ensured that Poland and
other states that easily could have built **nuclear weapons** didn't
need to, because they had **American protection**]{.underline}. Most
important, enlargement kept the U.S. firmly planted in Europe, by
preventing the centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from
becoming obsolete.

[**No other initiative** could have accomplished these
objectives]{.underline}. Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose
security cooperation agreements with former Soviet-bloc states ---
didn't offer the ironclad guarantees that came with NATO membership.
([If you want to understand the difference between]{.underline}
"[security partner]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[NATO
ally]{.underline}**," [just look at what is happening]{.underline} today
[to **Ukraine**]{.underline}, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

[Only American power]{.underline} and promises [could provide
**stability**]{.underline} in Europe, [and NATO was the continent's
**critical link**]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}. Since 1949,
Washington had tamped down rivalries between old enemies such as France
and Germany, while also protecting them from external threats. After
1991, NATO expansion took this zone of peace, prosperity and cooperation
that had emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern Europe as
well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "America has continued to
serve as Europe's pacifier," protecting the continent from dangers
within and without.

Russia as the victim

Today, of course, the critics don't buy this account. They argue that
NATO expansion represented crude power politics, as the U.S. exploited
the Soviet collapse to engorge its own empire. What resulted, pundits
such as Thomas Friedman contend, was a sort of Weimar Russia --- a
country whose dignity was affronted, security imperiled and democracy
undermined by a harsh, humiliating peace.

There is a kernel of truth here, too. Once Russian democracy began to
wobble in 1993-94, officials in the Bill Clinton administration saw NATO
expansion --- in part --- as a way of preventing a potentially
resurgent, aggressive Russia from rebuilding the Soviet sphere of
influence. Russian leaders of all stripes griped about NATO expansion
from the early 1990s onward, warning that it could jeopardize the peace
of the continent.

In hindsight, NATO expansion was one of several issues --- including
disputes over the Balkans and the collapse of the Russian economy in the
late 1990s --- that gradually soured Russia's relationship with the
West. Yet this story omits three vital facts.

First, all policies have costs. [The price of NATO expansion was a
certain alienation of Russian elites]{.underline} --- although we often
forget that Clinton softened the blow by continually courting Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, bringing Russia into elite Western institutions
such as the Group of Seven, and making Moscow a partner in the
intervention in Bosnia in 1995-96. [Yet the cost of not expanding NATO
might have been **forfeiting** much of the stability that initiative
provided]{.underline}. [**Trade-offs** are **inevitable** in foreign
policy]{.underline}: [There was no magic middle path]{.underline} that
would have provided all the benefits with none of the costs.

Second, [if NATO expansion was a manifestation of American empire, it
was a remarkably **benign**]{.underline} [and **consensual** form of
empire]{.underline}. When Clinton decided to pursue enlargement, he did
so at the urging of the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians. [The Baltic
countries and others were soon **banging at the door**]{.underline}.
[The states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were
**desperate** to **join America**'s sphere of influence, because they
were desperate to **leave Moscow's**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline}, too, [was part of an **older pattern**]{.underline}:
[The U.S. has often extended its influence by
"**invitation**]{.underline}" [rather than imposition]{.underline}. [The
creation of NATO]{.underline} in 1949 [was mostly a European
idea]{.underline}: [Countries]{.underline} that were [terrified of
Moscow sought protection from Washington]{.underline}. One reason
Putin's wars to keep countries from escaping Moscow's empire are so
abhorrent to Americans is that the U.S. empire has trouble keeping
members out.

Putin may not see it that way. All that matters to him is that the
mightiest peacetime alliance in history has crept closer to Russian
soil. But here a third fact becomes relevant: Russia was one of the
biggest beneficiaries of NATO's move east.

Making Russia safer

Open terrain has often left Russia vulnerable to invasion and
instability emanating from Europe. Napoleonic France, Imperial Germany
and Nazi Germany all swept through Eastern Europe to wreak havoc on
Russian or Soviet territory. This is one reason why the great strategist
George Kennan opposed NATO expansion --- because it would surely
re-activate this fear of encroachment from the west.

Yet this was a red herring, because NATO posed no military threat. The
alliance committed, in 1997, not to permanently station foreign troops
in Eastern Europe. After the Cold War, America steadily withdrew most of
its troops and all of its heavy armor from the continent. U.S. allies
engaged in a veritable race to disarm.

The prospect that NATO could invade Russia, even had it wanted to, was
laughable. What the alliance could do was tame the perils that might
otherwise have menaced the Russian state.

Germany could hardly threaten Russia: It was nestled snugly into an
alliance that also served as a strategic straitjacket. NATO, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had candidly said in 1990, could "play a
containing role" vis-à-vis Berlin. Moscow didn't have to worry about a
nuclear Poland --- Warsaw didn't need nukes because it had the
protection of the United States. Aside from the Balkan wars of the
1990s, Eastern Europe was comparatively free of the geopolitical
intrigues and military quarrels that might have made Russia jumpy.

NATO expansion hadn't just alleviated Europe's security problems; it had
protected Russia's vital interests as well. Moscow might have lost an
empire, but it had gained remarkable safety from external attack.

Putin's easy excuse

So what went wrong? Why couldn't Putin make his peace with a larger
NATO?

Part of the answer is that NATO expansion wasn't really the problem, in
the sense that Russia didn't need that pretext to seek renewed hegemony
in its near-abroad. The Soviet Union, and [the Russian
empire]{.underline} before it, [had traditionally sought to **control
countries** along their frontiers and used **brutal means**]{.underline}
to do it. [To say that NATO expansion caused Russian belligerence is
thus to make an **extremely dubious assertion**]{.underline}: [that
absent NATO expansion, Moscow would have been a
**satisfied**]{.underline}, **[status quo]{.underline}**
[power]{.underline}.

And this is exactly why a bigger NATO has posed a real problem for
Putin. After all, safety from external attack isn't the only thing that
states and rulers want. They want glory, greatness and the privileges of
empire. [For 20 years, Putin has been **publicly lusting** after the
sphere of influence that the Soviet Union once enjoyed]{.underline}.
NATO expansion stood athwart that ambition, by giving Moscow's former
vassals the ability to resist its pressure.

[NATO]{.underline} also [threatened]{.underline} a certain type of
Russian government --- [an autocracy that was **never secure** in its
own rule]{.underline}. [A democratic Russia wouldn't so much have minded
being neighbors]{.underline} with Western-leaning democracies, because
political liberty in those countries wouldn't have threatened to set a
subversive example for anti-Putin Russians.

Yet, as Russia became more autocratic in the early 2000s, and as Putin's
popularity declined with the Russian economy after 2008, the imperative
of preventing ideological spillover from a U.S.-backed democratic
community loomed large.

So Putin began pushing back against NATO's eastward march. In 2008, he
invaded Georgia, a country that was moving --- too slowly for its own
safety --- toward the West. Since 2014, he has been waging war against
Ukraine, in hopes of rebuilding the Russian empire and halting Kiev's
westward drift. America's vision of Europe has now run into Putin's
program of violent coercion.

West missed the danger signs

To be sure, U.S. officials made mistakes along the way. Because Russia
was prostrate, militarily and economically, during the 1990s, Washington
acquired a bad habit of issuing security guarantees without really
considering how it would fulfill them in a crisis. The Pentagon has thus
been scrambling, since 2014, to devise a credible defense of NATO's
eastern flank.

As Russia regained its strength, U.S. officials also failed to grasp the
danger of provoking Putin without adequately deterring him. When, in
2008, NATO declined to endorse membership for Georgia and Ukraine but
issued a vague statement saying that they would someday join the
alliance, it created the worst of all worlds --- giving Putin both the
pretext and the time to pre-empt future expansion by tearing those two
countries apart.

Yet there is a curious morality in [accounts]{.underline} that [blame
the West, which sought to protect **vulnerable** states]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe, [for the current carnage, rather than blaming Putin, who
has worked to **dismember** and **intimidate** those
countries]{.underline}. It is sloppy thinking to tally up the costs of
NATO expansion without considering the historic achievements of a policy
that served American, European and even certain Russian interests
remarkably well.

And if nothing else, NATO expansion pushed the dividing line between
Moscow and the democratic world to the east after one Cold War --- a
factor of great significance now that a second cold war is underway.

The legacy of NATO expansion isn't simply a matter of historical
interest. [Americans' understanding of the past has always
influenced]{.underline} their view of [what policies to pursue **in the
future**]{.underline}. [During the 1920s and 1930s]{.underline}, [the
widespread]{.underline}, if [inaccurate]{.underline}, [belief that
America had entered World War I to serve the interests of
**banks**]{.underline} [and **arms manufacturers**]{.underline} [had
a]{.underline} \[**[crushing]{.underline}**\] ~~paralyzing~~ [effect on
U.S. policy amid the **totalitarian aggression**]{.underline} [that set
off **World War II**]{.underline}.

Today, the U.S. faces a long, nasty struggle to contain Putin's imperial
project and protect an endangered world order. Introspection is an
admirable quality, but [the last thing America needs is another bout of
**self-flagellation**]{.underline} [rooted in another
**misapprehension** of the past]{.underline}. -- Bloomberg

Fighting climate change is often considered a valuable but secondary
goal for many security-minded politicians who see it as a distraction
from the real threats posed by terrorism in Syria, Russian aggression in
Europe, and the potential of a nuclear Iran. But [even a **hard-nosed
realist**]{.underline} [should support international cooperation on
climate change]{.underline}. [Due to climate change's impact as a
"**threat multiplier**]{.underline}," [the benefits of cooperation now
**outweigh** the potential gap in relative gains]{.underline} between
cooperating countries. [When climate change is viewed as an **external
threat**]{.underline} similar to a hostile state, [**realist theory**
concludes]{.underline} that [the United States should ally with other
threatened countries]{.underline} against it until the threat subsides.

Realism and the relative gains problem

Realism, one of the grand theories of international relations, is a
worldview and set of assumptions about the way the world works that
dates back to Thucydides of ancient Greece. [Realism has]{.underline}
long [been the **dominant strand**]{.underline} [of thinking in U.S.
national security circles and **undergirds** much of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}. Realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz, focus on
the state as the primary actor in international politics; assume anarchy
in the international system is the principal force shaping state action;
and believe states are primarily concerned with their own power and
security---often at the expense of mutually beneficial cooperation.

Realist scholars and practitioners have traditionally spent little time
devoted to climate change compared with adherents of liberalism---the
other grand theory of international relations. For realist theorists
focused on hard power and interstate warfare, debates about peak carbon
dioxide emissions and global temperature goals are ancillary at best to
the primary challenges facing states. Furthermore, realists such as
Joseph Grieco are skeptical of the potential for international
cooperation on most issues, arguing that even when cooperation would be
mutually beneficial to both parties, states often fail to cooperate
because one state would gain more than the other.

This is known as the relative gains problem. Realists argue that states
are not only concerned with maximizing their own absolute gains but they
are also concerned with their gains relative to the gains of other
states out of concern that they may end up relatively weaker even if
they are stronger in absolute terms.

But [the relative gains problem **does not prevent** all forms of
cooperation]{.underline}, even when one state gains disproportionately.
[For realists, the main reason that a state would cooperate is if the
gains of cooperation are so large that they **overcome** the relative
gains problem]{.underline}---a threshold that is usually only met when
states face an external security threat.

Climate change as an external security threat

For years, scientists have warned of the potential implications of the
current wave of changes to the Earth's climate. 2014 was the hottest
year ever recorded and continued a trend of rising sea levels that
threaten major coastal cities and even some island nations, as well as
more intense and frequent severe weather events, increased
desertification of vital arable land, and climate-driven migration,
which has contributed to the European refugee crisis.

If the most pessimistic projections are realized without international
action, the planet could warm by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end
of this century. To put it another way, that is the same as the global
temperature change that occurred during the last ice age but at 10 times
the speed. [Failure to **limit** climate change and better manage
**global resources**]{.underline} [will soon disrupt the **physical**
and **economic** security of citizens]{.underline} across the planet.

Climate change does not fit the traditional realist image of a security
threat, but as [climate change **intensifies** existing conflicts and
**exacerbates instability**]{.underline}, [states are increasingly being
forced to **grapple with** and **defend against** it, just as they would
a hostile adversary]{.underline}. Whether through the extreme weather
events that have killed 2.5 million people since 1980, the rising sea
levels that threaten to swallow island nations such as the Maldives, or
the droughts that doubled the price of wheat in the lead up to the 2011
Arab uprisings, climate change is threatening lives, destabilizing
states, and disrupting economies in ways an adversarial state might
using different means.

[U.S. intelligence, military, and diplomatic agencies are already
thinking through the **security implications**]{.underline} [of a
warming planet]{.underline}, an acidifying ocean, and an increase in
extreme weather events. In 2008, the National Intelligence Council began
a multiyear project analyzing the implications of climate change for
U.S. national security interests between 2008 and 2030 and concluded
that climate change would likely exacerbate political instability,
migration crises, and intrastate warfare. [The U.S. Department of
Defense's]{.underline} "2010 Quadrennial Defense [Review]{.underline}
Report" [identified climate change as one of the **key
issues**]{.underline} [that will shape the future security
environment]{.underline}, affecting the U.S. military's capabilities,
missions, and operations. The U.S. Department of State's 2015
"Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review" highlighted climate
change as a "national and global security threat," as well as one of the
department's four strategic priorities.

For U.S. security officials, climate change now meets the high threshold
used by realists for international cooperation, regardless of a
potential relative gains gap.

An alliance against climate change

Realists such as Stephen Walt argue that [when faced with a hostile
external threat, threatened states will **band together**]{.underline},
[creating an alliance to counter the threat]{.underline} and to restore
a balance of power in which no one actor can overpower the others. These
alliances are usually narrow and short-lived, lasting until the
threat---whether it be Napoleonic France or the Islamic State of Iraq
and al-Sham---recedes. If the threat of climate change is now comparable
to the threat of a hostile state, then [the realist response would be to
develop an **international alliance** against climate
change]{.underline}.

President Barack Obama's administration has largely adopted this
approach, enlisting not only traditional European and Japanese allies in
the effort but also nontraditional partners such as China, India,
Brazil, and Indonesia. The direct and indirect threat posed by climate
change has altered the calculus of countries such as China and India,
which previously cited the principle of common but differentiated
responsibilities as a reason for not fully contributing to a global
effort to fight climate change. This is in part a relative gains
argument that says unified action to combat climate change would
disproportionately hurt economically developing and newly industrialized
states in light of differing national circumstances. The diverse range
of countries participating in the alliance against climate change
reflects the new geopolitics of the issue, in which both developing and
developed countries are affected by, contribute to, and thus are
responsible for fighting the problem.

As with alliances against hostile states, the alliance against climate
change should not be expected to remake the global order or resolve
disagreements with partner countries on other issues. [As history has
shown]{.underline}, however, [the United States can **successfully
work** with nontraditional partners or even competitor states to combat
a common threat]{.underline}, whether improving relations with China to
counter the Soviet Union in the 1970s or leading a diverse coalition of
nations to fight piracy off the Horn of Africa more recently.

Abstract Creating institutions that effectively manage interstate
conflict is a priority for policy-makers. In this article we demonstrate
that military allies are well positioned to influence the
crisis-bargaining behavior of both challengers and targets in ways that
often lead to peace. Through a three-player game-theoretic model, we
demonstrate that a target's alliances not only have an effect on the
demand that the challenger makes, but also on the behavior of the
target. When a target values an alliance highly, an ally's
recommendation for settlement can encourage the target to concede to
demands without further escalation. [Our **statistical analysis**
provides evidence in support of the theoretical finding]{.underline}.
Allies can both deter challengers and restrain partners, and as a
result, can encourage peaceful behavior not only from adversaries, but
from member states as well. [Our **study** thus sheds **new
light**]{.underline} [on the role of military alliances as potential
conflict management devices]{.underline}.

Interstate wars cost more than thirty million lives during the twentieth
century, and nine new interstate wars have begun since the end of the
Cold War.1 Finding ways to avoid interstate disputes and to manage those
that arise short of war, therefore, is a major priority for
policy-makers and for scholars of international relations. [It is **well
recognized**]{.underline} [that military alliances play a role in
conflict prevention by deterring attacks]{.underline} on their members,
but less attention has been paid to the role of allies in conflict
management. We argue that [allies]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}
coercive [actors with a **stake** in the dispute]{.underline},
[are]{.underline} sometimes [especially **well positioned**]{.underline}
[to help resolve disputes]{.underline} short of war.

We examine the influence of allies to a target state on crisis
bargaining. Not only do [allies have an interest in the outcome of
crisis bargaining]{.underline} but [they]{.underline} also may [have the
ability to make **credible threats**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} both
the challenger and the target that [influence the bargaining stances of
**both disputants**]{.underline}. [A target's ally can make it clear to
the challenger]{.underline} that [if the challenger demands too much,
the ally will intervene]{.underline} in the war on behalf of the target.
[But]{.underline} a target's ally may also be able to make a credible
threat to the target---that [if the target refuses to concede to a
demand that the ally finds reasonable, the ally will not
intervene]{.underline} in the war on the target's behalf. [The ally
may]{.underline} therefore [have a **moderating effect** not only on the
challenger's demand]{.underline}, [but also on the **target's
response**]{.underline}, making peaceful settlement more likely. We
refer to the former as the deterrence effect of alliances, and the
latter as the restraining effect of alliances.

To study this process, we develop a three-player game-theoretic model.
Most recent game-theoretic models of crisis bargaining assume that a
challenger and a target bargain without influence from any outside
states.2 Yet, allies who would be obligated to intervene in a war that
develops between a challenger and target will often cast a shadow over
crisis negotiations. Dyadic bargaining models that assume a challenger
and a target bargain without influence from any outside states are
inadequate for our understanding of conflict dynamics in such
situations.

We derive a number of propositions about the relationships between such
factors as the costs of war, the value of the stakes, and the value of
an alliance and specific outcomes. The demands challengers make, the
conditions under which targets concede demands without fighting, and the
conditions under which targets resist demands militarily are all
influenced by the presence of an ally. [Given the **richness** of our
**formal results**]{.underline}, we make no attempt to test all of the
implications of the model. We do, however, discuss a few stylized cases
that highlight different outcomes, and [we provide a **large-N**
empirical test of one proposition drawn from the model]{.underline}. We
find support for the claim that when a target depends heavily on an
alliance for security, that target is less likely to resist a challenge
militarily.

Our [**research** suggests that military alliances have an influence in
international politics **well beyond** collaborative war fighting and
deterrence]{.underline}. [Alliances **deter conflicts**, which in itself
is a **force for peace**, but even when challengers are not
deterred]{.underline} from making demands, [allies can facilitate
**peaceful settlement**]{.underline}. [Alliances can be important
institutions for **conflict management**]{.underline}, [not only among
their members, but between their members and outside states as
well]{.underline}. As such, [alliances can be broad institutions for
**peace** that play an **important role** in maintaining]{.underline}
the **[stability]{.underline}** of the international system.3

on war intensity\"; Uppsala University;

The purpose of [this paper]{.underline} was to [conduct a
comparative]{.underline} case **[study]{.underline}** [analysing the
effect of NATO PSOs and UN PKOs on **war intensity**]{.underline}, to
help fill the existing gap concerning disaggregated research on non-UN
peacekeeping operations. To do so, this paper focused on comparing NATO
peace support operations and UN peacekeeping operations abilities to
mitigate war intensity through a structured focused comparison and
aspects of theory-testing process tracing. However, results of the
analysis did not confirm the proposed theory that UN PKOs would mitigate
war intensity to a greater degree than NATO PSOs, but rather seem to
imply that some [NATO PSO]{.underline} might [**reduce** war intensity
to a **greater extent**]{.underline} [than UN PKOs]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the results also imply that NATOs **seemingly biased**
behaviour **does not**]{.underline} necessarily **[hamper]{.underline}**
[their abilities to provide security guarantees, nor does it necessarily
hinder NATO from using persuasion effectively]{.underline}.

Thus, some possible policy implication of this study is that
[Peacekeeping organisations can **use force** against warring parties in
an armed conflict **without hampering** potential peacekeeping efforts,
and that strict peacekeeper impartiality might **hamper** conflict
mitigation]{.underline}. Furthermore, this paper also indicates that
[NATO peacekeepers are suitable alternative to UN
peacekeepers]{.underline} when the UN is either unable or unwilling to
send peacekeepers themselves, and that [NATO PSOs can **mitigate** war
intensity to a]{.underline} similar or [even **greater degree** than UN
PKOs.]{.underline}

**Peacekeeping reduces violence. It's the [strongest empirical
law]{.underline} in IR.**

[Reality]{.underline}, however, [tells a **different
story**]{.underline}. Over the last twenty years, [numerous **empirical
studies**]{.underline} [have examined the role of]{.underline}
third-party [peacekeeping in reducing violence around the
world]{.underline}. [The data **overwhelmingly** reveal that
peacekeeping]{.underline}, especially UN peacekeeping, [is surprisingly
**effective**]{.underline}. [Using **different datasets** and
**statistical models**]{.underline}, [leveraging different time periods
and measuring peacekeeping in]{.underline} somewhat [different
ways]{.underline}, **[dozens]{.underline}** [of researchers at
**different universities**]{.underline}, [with **diverse funding**
streams and **different preferences**, have all found that peacekeeping
has a **large**]{.underline}, **[positive]{.underline}** [and
**statistically significant**]{.underline} [effect on reducing violence
of **all sorts**]{.underline}. Despite the very real problems associated
with UN [peacekeeping]{.underline}, it [is **remarkably effective** at
bringing peace]{.underline}.

This review article has three goals. The first is to summarize the
results of past empirical research to move the debate beyond the
question of whether peacekeeping works to the more pressing questions of
how, when and why it works. The second goal is to reveal the limitations
of current quantitative studies in order to identify areas in which
scholars can make big, new contributions to the field. The final goal is
to propose a new research agenda that is heavily evaluative --- one that
informs policy makers about the specific practices, mission
compositions, and mandates that work, and also identifies the local,
regional, and international conditions that amplify or diminish
peacekeeping's success. This type of research could help reduce the
costs of peacekeeping operations (PKOs), eliminate some of the negative
consequences of interventions and potentially save even more lives.

What the Current Evidence Reveals

[Numerous **large-n** statistical studies have explored the
relationship]{.underline} between third-party peacekeeping and different
forms of violence (Dorussen 2014; Gizelis, Dorussen and Petrova 2016);
Di Salvatore and Ruggeri 2017; Sandler 2017). [What is **most
striking**]{.underline} [about these studies is the **consistency** of
their findings]{.underline}. [Almost all of them find that peacekeeping
is **highly effective**]{.underline} [at preventing violence **before**
it begins, reducing violence in the **midst** of war and preventing
violence from **recurring** once it has **ended**]{.underline}. All else
equal, [countries and regions that receive peacekeeping missions
experience **less armed conflict**, fewer **civilian** and
combatant]{.underline} **[deaths]{.underline}**, [fewer **mass
killings**]{.underline}, [longer periods of post-conflict
**peace**]{.underline} [and fewer repeat wars]{.underline} than those
that do not receive peacekeepers. [This relationship]{.underline} ---
[between peacekeeping and **lower levels** of violence]{.underline} ---
[is **so consistent**]{.underline} [across different large-n analyses
that it has become one of the **strongest findings**]{.underline} [in
the **international relations** literature to date]{.underline}.

The power of peacekeeping is all the more striking given that the UN
tends to intervene in the toughest cases. Multiple scholarly studies
have found that the UN Security Council tends to send peacekeepers to
countries with more violence, particularly bad governments and ongoing
conflict (Beardsley and Schmidt 2012; Costalli 2013; de Jonge Oudraat
1996; Fortna 2004a; Fortna 2008a; Gilligan and Sergenti 2008; Gilligan
and Stedman 2003; Hegre, Hultman and Nygard 2019 Ruggeri, Dorussen, and
Gizelis 2017). The most recent study by Ruggeri, Dorussen and Gizelis
(2018) found that UN peacekeepers are deployed to places experiencing
active conflict. Using geographically and temporally disaggregated data
on UN peacekeepers' deployment in eight African countries between 1989
and 2006, they find that [peacekeepers tend to be deployed to the
**dangerous frontlines** of a conflict]{.underline}. Their research did
reveal some problems with deployment. Peacekeepers tended to arrive late
and be sent to conflict zones near urban areas, ignoring violence
further afield. But [the fact that peacekeepers often go to the **most
demanding** places]{.underline} (even if late and disproportionately
urban) [suggests that academic studies have]{.underline} probably
**[underestimated]{.underline}** [the effectiveness of peacekeeping at
reducing violence]{.underline}.

[These findings do not imply that peacekeeping works **all the
time**]{.underline}, or as efficiently and successfully as it could.
There are many well-known cases such as Bosnia and Rwanda where UN
peacekeeping failed. There are also additional cases such as those in
South Sudan and Malí where peacekeeping missions are not progressing
well (Autesserre 2010; Autesserre 2014; Day 2019; Howard 2008; Van der
Lijn 2019).1 Moreover, we understand that the data and analyses of even
the best quantitative studies are imperfect. Analysis of peacekeeping
and violence is constrained by the messy and sometimes unreliable nature
of data on death rates, the potentially untenable assumptions made by
scholars in employing statistical models in cross-national and
cross-conflict analysis, and the hard constraints (both practical and
ethical) on scholars' ability to randomize treatments in ways that make
airtight causal inferences possible. The findings in the quantitative
literature can also appear mixed or contradictory on some topics, when
in fact [the disparity is due to **different** research designs and
empirical strategies]{.underline}. [This can be **confusing** and can
also **distract**]{.underline} [from the **bigger** and **more
important** picture, which is that peacekeeping **works amazingly
well**]{.underline} [given its many challenges]{.underline}.

[In what follows we present **overwhelming evidence**]{.underline} [from
more than **two dozen** studies that peacekeepers]{.underline}: (1)
[reduce civilian and military deaths]{.underline}, (2) [prevent the
spread of violence]{.underline}, (3) [help]{.underline} belligerents
[achieve peace and]{.underline} (4) [help countries maintain the
post-conflict peace]{.underline}.2 We also provide an overview of the
general problems related to peacekeeping that the qualitative literature
explores.

Last week, the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Foreign Policy---a
bipartisan advocacy group calling for congressional oversight of
America's lengthy list of military interventions abroad---released the
results of a survey that show broad public support for Congress to
reclaim its constitutional prerogatives in the exercise of foreign
policy (see Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution) and for fewer
US military interventions generally. Undertaken last November by J.
Wallin Opinion Research, [the new survey revealed]{.underline} "[a
national voter population that is **largely skeptical**]{.underline} of
the practicality or benefits [of **military intervention**
overseas]{.underline}, including both the physical involvement of the US
military and also extending to military aid in the form of funds or
equipment as well."

Bill Dolbow, the spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Foreign
Policy, said, "We started this initiative to give a voice to the people
and the people have spoken---Congress needs to enact more oversight
before intervening in conflict abroad."

The headline findings show, among other things, that
**[86.4]{.underline}** [percent of those surveyed feel the American
military should be used only as a **last resort**]{.underline}, [while
**57** percent feel that US military aid to foreign countries is
**counterproductive**]{.underline}. The latter sentiment "increases
significantly" when involving countries like Saudi Arabia, with 63.9
percent saying military aid---including money and weapons---should not
be provided to such countries.

In August 2020, the man who is now U.S. President Joe [Biden's deputy
national security advisor]{.underline}, Jonathan Finer, co-[wrote a
privately circulated **memo** titled]{.underline} "**[Ending the
'Forever Wars]{.underline}**.'" Written with two others who have since
joined the Biden administration, Christine Abizaid and Brett Rosenberg,
the memo laid out a detailed program for extricating the United States
from the two-decade-long campaign dubbed the "war on terror" that began
on 9/11.

Six months into Biden's presidency, the administration has said little
about its longer-term plans in dealing with Islamist terrorist groups
around the world, apart from announcing the withdrawal of U.S. troops
from Afghanistan. [And yet airstrikes by **drones** and other U.S.
**kinetic operations**]{.underline} in trouble spots around the world,
outside conventional battlefields, [have **dramatically
dropped**]{.underline} since Biden took office. [The president imposed a
**partial moratorium**]{.underline} [as his team conducts an **intensive
review**]{.underline} [of **every aspect** of America's global
counterterrorism efforts]{.underline}, which have spread over two
decades from Afghanistan post-9/11 to "Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Libya,
Somalia, and parts of the Maghreb, Southeast Asia and West and Central
Africa," as the Finer memo notes.

This limited stand-down is happening in spite of rare exceptions like
this week's airstrikes by U.S. F-15s and F-16s on storage facilities
used by Iran-backed militias in Iraq.

And while Finer's 13-page memo has hardly become official administration
policy, it's notable that [Biden's]{.underline} senior [team seems to be
**acting**]{.underline} on some of its recommendations---and that Finer
himself is one of the top officials working on a broad review of
counterterrorism policy led by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.

One of the recommendations enacted from the memo is **[to]{.underline}**
"\[[**r\]aise the threshold** for use of force]{.underline}." This
[includes eliminating]{.underline} "[strikes against
individuals]{.underline} whose specific identities are not known and
[who are not]{.underline} identified as tied to immediate \[U.S.\] force
protection concerns or otherwise [posing an **imminent
threat**]{.underline}" to the United States, as the memo puts it.

According to the Finer memo, "[Operations requiring force should be
considered **extraordinary**, require **approval** at the highest
levels, and pursued only when **absolutely necessary**, for instance, to
avert a clear and **present danger** to **U.S. persons**]{.underline}."

The [Biden administration has since **restricted** field commanders from
making **independent decisions**]{.underline} on strikes outside of
conventional battlefield zones. [Under the new rules the]{.underline}
"[military and the C.I.A. must now obtain **White House
permission**]{.underline} [to attack terrorism suspects]{.underline} in
poorly governed places where there are scant American ground troops,
like Somalia and Yemen," the New York Times reported on March 3. A
forthcoming directive is also being prepared by the Department of
Defense laying out stricter guidelines for limiting civilian casualties
in overseas attacks and setting new and higher thresholds for future
U.S. attacks.

Already [there has been a **dramatic reduction**]{.underline} [of drone
attacks and other types of airstrikes]{.underline}, which once reached
thousands a year. "The \[United States\] appears to be in a holding
pattern in most conflict theaters that it still has a presence
in---[with **no** reported strikes in Yemen, Libya, Pakistan, or Somalia
since Biden took office]{.underline}. [U.S. strikes are
continuing]{.underline} in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria---though [at
**historically low** rates]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} Chris Woods
of [the]{.underline} London-based **[Airwars]{.underline}** [monitoring
organization]{.underline}, considered perhaps [the **most reliable**
tracker of U.S. airstrikes around the world]{.underline}. "What the
strategic plan here is, other than for Afghanistan, we don't yet know."

Until Biden took office, the U.S. military had often followed a pattern
of secretly striking alleged terrorists from the air without any
accountability or announcement: no casualty lists, no public
after-action reports, and few follow-up investigations about collateral
damage. "Cumulatively we're talking tens of thousands of civilians
conservatively who have died in America's wars since 9/11"---almost all
without acknowledgement, Woods said.

No truly reliable figures exist, especially for drones, since for most
of its existence the drone program has been shrouded in secrecy. In his
final year in office, President Barack Obama briefly opened the window,
revealing that during his term drone strikes, conventional airstrikes,
or cruise missiles used outside conventional war zones like Afghanistan
had killed as many as 116 civilians. But other independent monitors put
the figures much higher. Obama's successor, Donald Trump, made the
numbers classified again.

[The cutback in drone strikes is **one element** of a **much bigger
rethink**]{.underline}. One Biden administration official who has been
involved in discussions said that while a policy isn't yet set and it's
not clear when it will be, the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11 is an
important target date in what is amounting to an exhaustive evaluation
of the overseas terrorist threat. The [Biden]{.underline}
administration, he said, [is now focused on **demoting**]{.underline}
[the Islamist terrorist threat]{.underline} on the priority list of U.S.
strategic interests.

"[Biden **wants** one of his major foreign policy accomplishments to be
to **end the forever wars**]{.underline}," said this official, who would
speak about internal deliberations only on condition of anonymity. [The
president is expected to]{.underline} deliver a speech that will sketch
out the broad outlines, including possibly setting new
[restrict]{.underline}ive and transparent drone rules, announcing the
shutdown of **[Guantánamo Bay]{.underline}** ([where only about **40**
prisoners remain out of a total of nearly **800**]{.underline}), [and
upgrad]{.underline}ing [the focus on **domestic** violent extremists,
away from al Qaeda]{.underline} and its affiliates.

"[He wants to show]{.underline} we made the world safer, to say that [we
are taking a **multilateral approach**]{.underline} [and returning to
**smart power**, reducing our military footprint and increasing our
**diplomatic footprint**]{.underline}, and adapting to new threats of
today," the official said.

The White House team is also seeking a broader reorientation toward what
the president has called "the battles for the next 20 years, not the
last 20," including climate change, the threat from China, COVID-19-type
pandemics, and America's economic and social problems at home.

"[At the Department of Defense]{.underline} but also in the U.S.
intelligence community, [counterterrorism has taken a **back
seat**]{.underline}," said Seth Jones, a senior vice president and
counterterrorism expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "The focus of efforts is primarily on how to deal with China
and to some degree Russia. And you don't need drones to deal with either
of them. It's just not a priority, and that's a big shift certainly from
the Obama years and partly the Trump years."

**They're down [dramatically]{.underline}.**

KL\]

When it comes to fighting war without soldiers, the weaponized drone has
been an essential tool --- perhaps the most iconic weapon in the United
States' post-9/11 war on terrorism. Given Biden's pledge that
over-the-horizon counterterrorism operations would continue around the
world, it would be reasonable to expect that drone use would have
continued --- or become even more common. In fact, the opposite has
happened. [The U.S. has **stopped bombing** Afghanistan **entirely**
since the withdrawal, and strikes are **down dramatically**]{.underline}
[in other theaters as well]{.underline}. The long-standing practice of
American drones regularly raining missiles on suspected terrorists and
unfortunate civilians has ended --- at least for now. One might suspect
that this drop-off was the result of growing public criticism of the
drone war and recent revelations about the civilian casualties it has
caused. But the decline predates the revelations; [it's a trend that
began **several years** ago]{.underline}.

What happened to the drone war? Why, in the new over-the-horizon era,
are drones being used so rarely? And what are the implications of a
world in which dozens of nations now have the deadly capability --- and
are using it more often, not less?

The drop-off

The United States' first drone strike came on the first day of the U.S.
war in Afghanistan --- Oct. 7, 2001 --- when a CIA Predator drone fired
a Hellfire missile near Kandahar, narrowly missing Taliban leader Mullah
Omar. The escalation that followed was swift and steep. In the two
decades since, the U.S. has used weaponized drones thousands of times as
part of air campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia,
Syria and Yemen.

Since Biden took office, there have been just 39 declared U.S. strikes
(including air, drone and ground operations) in Iraq and Syria. In
Somalia, nine strikes have been carried out under Biden compared with
276 under Donald Trump. The Biden administration has ordered only two
reported strikes in Yemen and none in Pakistan, once ground zero of the
American drone war. (There were 122 strikes in 2010.)

Overall, [U.S. airstrikes]{.underline} (including both drones and manned
strikes) [were down **42 percent**]{.underline} [in 2021 from the year
before]{.underline} --- [falling from 1,459 to **852**.]{.underline}
[That may still seem like a lot, but consider that there were nearly
**13,000**]{.underline} [strikes in 2016]{.underline}, when the war
against ISIS was at its height.

To the extent this development has received any media coverage,
observers have tended to credit the Biden administration. In fact, the
decline began earlier. "The bulk of what's being discussed is the result
of trends began under the Trump administration, although I wouldn't
really frame it as the result of Trump's specific policy decisions, as
the way the wars are going," David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at
New America, told Grid.

According to the monitoring site Airwars, March 2019 was the last month
when the U.S.-led coalition launched more than 100 air and artillery
strikes in Iraq and Syria. (There were 389.) Not coincidentally, this
was the month that the last remnants of ISIS's "caliphate" fell. After
that, the tempo of strikes fell dramatically; in all of 2020, there were
only 201. Similarly, in Yemen, the number of airstrikes peaked at 131 in
2017, according to New America. In 2020, there were only four. In
Pakistan, the steep drop-off in drone strikes began even earlier, in the
second half of the Obama presidency.

height="3.180823490813648in"}

According to Sterman, "the one exception that I definitely would
acknowledge and think is clearly something to do [with]{.underline}
Biden is **[Somalia]{.underline}**, where [there was a high pace of
strikes under Trump]{.underline}. [Biden just]{.underline} [**completely
paused** it]{.underline}." The Biden administration did carry out at
least four strikes against al-Shabaab militants in Somalia in the summer
of 2021, but there's been no sign of a return to the pace of strikes
under Trump.

Bombing less --- or less to bomb?

There are signs that while the drop-off predates his presidency, [Biden
is **listening** to the drone war's critics]{.underline}.

Shortly after taking office, [Biden **quietly imposed**]{.underline}
[limits on drone strikes and commando raids]{.underline} outside of
declared war zones like Afghanistan and Syria. [The CIA and military now
must obtain White House permission]{.underline} for strikes in Yemen and
Somalia, among other theaters of counterterror operations. (Under Trump,
commanders had been allowed to make their own decisions on strikes in
those countries.) [Biden also ordered a **review** of U.S. targeting
policy]{.underline}. Several analysts I spoke with suggested [commanders
may be **reluctant** to order strikes until the **new guidelines** are
in place]{.underline}.

But the overall drop-off may be driven less by White House policy than
by changes on the battlefield. In short, there may be fewer strikes
because there are fewer targets.

The original al-Qaeda, the group that carried out the 9/11 attacks, is a
shell of its former self and hasn't been linked to an attack against the
U.S. in years. ISIS at one point threatened to redraw the map of the
Middle East, but since 2019, it has largely been driven underground.
This isn't to say that there still aren't violent Islamist militant
groups operating around the world --- there are likely even more of them
than there were in 2001 --- but the vast majority are focused on local
grievances and enemies rather than what Osama bin Laden once called the
"far enemy": the United States.

In the specific case of Afghanistan, Robert Grenier, former CIA head of
counterterrorism and a Grid contributor, points out that drone strikes
there and across the border in Pakistan were always less about
counterterrorism per se than about preventing attacks against NATO and
Afghan forces: "With the drawdown of U.S. and NATO troops, there was a
commensurate drop in the number of attacks against them, and a similar
drop in drone operations designed to protect them."

Now that the U.S.-backed Afghan government has fallen to the Taliban,
Grenier said "the current administration is focused on maintaining an
over-the-horizon capability, rather than a pattern of actual
over-the-horizon strikes. As of now, militants of various stripes in
Afghanistan, to include those who are ISIS affiliated, do not appear to
be much focused on Americans."

**Intervention is an ethical policy tool that [reduces]{.underline}
global violence.**

**Gritten 20** (William Gritten; Contributing Writer @ the Week; 3/2/20;
\"In defense of \'endless\' wars\"; *The Week*;
https://theweek.com/articles/896649/defense-endless-wars)

[As the]{.underline} two-decade-long U.S. [war in Afghanistan comes to
its]{.underline} technical [end]{.underline} with a peace deal signed
between the U.S. and the Taliban, [both poles of the current political
spectrum have concluded]{.underline}, along with most of the country,
[that the massive investment of resources and lives in this conflict
was]{.underline} materially, not to mention morally,
[fruitless]{.underline}. Western confidence has been undermined, and the
belief that prosperous democracies can project their power for good now
seems anachronistic --- naive to some, arrogant to others. [There is a
**consensus**: It is time to \"**end our endless wars**.\"]{.underline}

However, [[it is **dangerous** to draw such an **unqualified
conclusion**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair learned
[from **[Kosovo]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- where [[intervention
**stopped a war**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[and
**Rwanda**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- where [[calls for intervention went
**unheeded** and]{.mark} up to [a **million people were
butchered**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- that [inaction can in fact be
**shameful**]{.underline}, and this fostered a categorical conviction in
righteous humanitarian intervention that propelled them into the follies
of this millennium\'s first decade in Iraq and Afghanistan. The belief
that liberalism can be forced on societies at gunpoint was then handed a
crusading energy by the shock of 9/11. But [now, the received wisdom is
intervention does not work]{.underline}, but what if this new conviction
propels us into the next decade\'s disaster? [Why must we **swing
between such unnuanced extremes?**]{.underline}

It is important we understand that [sometimes **failing to intervene**
is the **more costly decision**, both **morally** and in terms of
**national self-interest**]{.underline}.

[When it comes to [the **Afghan** ]{.mark}**war**, the mistake was **not
in the intervention itself**, rather in **how it was
managed**]{.underline}. Soon [after the initial invasion
\[**defeated**\]]{.underline} ~~crippled~~ [the **Taliban**]{.underline}
and sent it into hiding, its [leadership consistently asked to meet at
the negotiating table, but were **rebuffed**]{.underline}.
Understandably, Washington\'s blood was up after September 2001, and the
Bush administration was categorical: \"We do not negotiate with
terrorists.\"

[This was a **mistake**. Talks could have brought a reduction in NATO
involvement under **better terms** than are being agreed now. The
intervention could have been conducted with a **pragmatism** that
acknowledged the **impossibility of all-out military victory** and
brought the Taliban to the table **early**]{.underline}. The [**NATO
[presence]{.mark}** could still have [brought]{.mark} the country what
it did: [**huge improvements** in **ag**]{.mark}**riculture**,
**[infrastructure]{.mark} projects** like the successful Dahla Dam
rebuild, [the]{.mark} **social [empowerment of women]{.mark}**[, and
**health initiatives**]{.mark} like the one [that **vaccinated children
nationwide.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Writing in The Atlantic, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is right to
decry the \"approach to foreign policy that relies on the U.S. military
to achieve the impossible, instead of doing the hard work of
statecraft.\" But this isn\'t, as she claims, an argument for ending the
endless wars: We can, and should, ask the military to do the possible,
while running intensive statecraft at the same time.

Many think the cost of military intervention is simply too high --- but
there are times when the cost of doing nothing is far greater. This is
the case, for example, in Syria, where more than 1 million internal
refugees face what the U.N. calls the \"biggest humanitarian horror
story of the 21st century.\"

Learning the wrong lessons from Western intervention in Iraq and
Afghanistan, the [Obama]{.underline} administration [chose not to
provide the rebels who rose up in 2011\'s Arab Spring with the support
necessary to **topple** Syrian President Bashar al-**Assad**. [A
**stronger**]{.mark} **U.S. [commitment]{.mark}** early on [could have
**prevented ISIS from rising**]{.mark} **in Syria** --- [and prevented
the **huge, expensive war**]{.mark} against ISIS [that
followed]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would also have helped stem the tide
of refugees that continues to fuel de-democratizing forces across
Europe. [It could also have meant the end of the]{.underline} rapacious,
[**vindictive Assad**, who now **terrorizes his people** for **daring to
resist him**]{.underline}. [Intervening in Syria **now** would be a
mistake, and this is another lesson: To be effective, intervention must
be **timely**.]{.underline}

[The U.S. did maintain a limited troop presence [in]{.mark} Northeastern
**[Syria]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but, to President Trump, these troops
were simply more Americans involved in an endless war. As far as he saw
it, the generals and national security advisers who urged him to let
them stay were just repeating the conventions that got the U.S. too
deeply involved in the Middle East to begin with. So, [[Trump **got the
troops** out --- and all **hell broke loose**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Turkey and Assad moved to **fill the vacuum**, America\'s **Kurdish
allies** were **betrayed**, **ISIS fighters** escaped captivity, and a
**million** homeless Syrians now face **devastation**.]{.underline}

[[In **Libya**]{.mark}, another country whose civil war seems to be
reaching a nightmarish crescendo after a botched Western intervention,
[the problem was **not in the intervention**]{.mark} **per se**,
[but]{.mark} in, as]{.underline} former President [Obama himself
diagnosed, \"[**failing** to plan for the **day
after**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} That failure, he contends, was his worst
mistake as president. Obama shared Trump\'s instinct for retrenchment
--- most people agree with them both today --- but here he directly
admits that instinct was wrong: [It was [**more** investment]{.mark},
**not less**, that [would have prevented today\'s Libyan]{.mark}
hellscape]{.underline}. But why did Obama fail to commit fully after
Moammar Gaddafi was toppled? Surely it was the
[[mistakes]{.underline}]{.mark} made in Iraq and Afghanistan that
drained, and continue to drain, Western governments of the confidence in
their ability to do good through action.

[[There are **many examples** of **effective intervention**]{.mark} and
**long-term presence**[,]{.mark} and they\'re **not obscure**:
[**Japan**, **Taiwan**, and **Eastern Europe**]{.mark} have their own,
complex, imperfect stories, but [each is a **relatively stable,
prosperous beneficiary** of **many decades** of]{.mark} political and
military [investment]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United Nations Command in
South Korea maintains a presence amid a war that has technically never
ended since its outbreak in 1950.

Another, lesser known example is [the British-led United Nations
involvement in Sierra Leone, in which military intervention ended a
**violent decade-long civil war**]{.underline}. [The Revolutionary
United Front]{.underline}, whose leaders were convicted of war crimes in
2009, [was bearing down on Freetown, the country\'s capital, but the
British intervention **stopped them short** and **brought
peace**]{.underline}. What\'s more, [**long-term engagement** in the
conflict\'s wake **bolstered institutions** and **restored
stability.**]{.underline} [Sierra Leone is still a country with
problems, but it is **no longer a country at war**]{.underline}. It is
no coincidence that this successful campaign began in 2000, at the
height of Western confidence, before the tragedy of 9/11 turned
intervention from something undertaken with discernment, strategy, and
planning, into a solipsistic exercise in emotional therapy, craving
glorious, impossible, all out victory.

\"The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the
statesman and commander have to make is to establish \... the kind of
war on which they are embarking,\" wrote the Prussian General Carl Von
Clausewitz, in Vom Kriege (On War), 200 years ago, \"neither mistaking
it for, nor trying to turn it into, something that is alien to its
nature.\" Failing to heed this guidance led to mistakes in Iraq and
Afghanistan, but heeding it, as Western governments could have done in
Syria soon after the Arab Spring by giving decisive support to
legitimate democratic forces, can lead to intervention that works.

[After the Afghanistan chapter closes, the world will **continue to
present Western governments** with **stark** and **urgent decisions** on
**whether they should intervene**. If the horror currently developing in
**Idlib** province were unfolding, instead, in 1999, then
Washington]{.underline}, intoxicated with recent successes and moral
certitude, [would be working much harder to protect the refugees --- and
that would be the **right thing to do. Caution** is always appropriate,
but the window of opportunity is **invariably narrow**, and **closing
fast.**]{.underline}

[As a broader geopolitical strategy, **[well-judged
intervention]{.mark}** plus its sometimes-necessary accompaniment ---
**indefinite military effort** --- [can help **keep**]{.mark} **the
forces of [totalitarianism at bay]{.mark}**[;]{.mark}]{.underline} not
everywhere, and never without diplomatic engagement. [Rather than
**vacillating** between **opposite doctrines** that say intervening is
**good or not,** or realistic or not, democracies should be **engaging
their collective thought** to **get better at it**]{.underline}. We must
remember that the destructive force behind the Afghanistan conflict was
the collapse of the Twin Towers, not the principle of intervention
itself, or even that of endless war.

**[External]{.underline} humanitarian intervention is
necessary\-\--emphasis on 'local solutions' guarantees
[genocide]{.underline} and [protracted conflict]{.underline}**

**Stockton 98** -- former lecturer of sociology, Executive Director of
the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (Nicholas, "In Defence of
Humanitarianism," Disasters, 22.4)

There are four [major [challenges to the humanitarian
system]{.mark}]{.underline} that have caused great damage to its
reputation. These [[can be summarised as]{.underline}]{.mark}: The
demonisation of the \'undeserving\' disaster victim and asylum seeker.
The \'new [[pragmatism\' that favours]{.mark} the resolution of \'local
problems\' by [local actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. The growing hegemony
of the theory of welfare dependency. The end of the \'age of innocence\'
in media relations with aid agencies. The \`undeserving\' disaster
victim Perhaps the most insidious challenge to humanitarian values has
been the widely reported claim that many disaster victims have no one
but themselves to blame. Indeed, in the case of Rwanda it has become a
commonplace that the \'extremist Hutu\' leadership was able to sustain
its political control over the refugee population by their astute
manipulation of humanitarian aid. This story line was and is used by
many, including African Rights, the US and Rwandan governments, to
justify the forced repatriation of most of the refugees (or \'fugitive
Hutu extremists\' as they have been labelled), and the \'disappearance\'
of the remainder. [[This argument]{.mark} has also [suited many]{.mark}
official [aid agencies who found]{.mark} in [it a]{.mark}n excellent
[reason to]{.mark}]{.underline} suspend humanitarian aid and to [be
\'pragmatic\', i.e. to **[do nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline},
irrespective of any further distress experienced by this group of pariah
refugees. This argument is flawed in many places. First, by no means all
refugees were guilty of genocide. Indeed some 750,000 of those forcibly
repatriated or \'lost in Zaire\' were children under five. Over 1.5
million were under 16 years of age. Of those who disappeared in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, some 50,000 were children under five,
the majority of whom had never set foot in Rwanda. Second, withholding
humanitarian assistance on the grounds that those in need may be
criminals is like suggesting that the ambulance service should conduct
triage on the basis of alleged criminality rather than upon the clinical
urgency of each case. This is the arbitrary application of punishment
before trial and it constitutes cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment
on a massive scale. Such treatment is arguably a crime against humanity
as the right to life applies to all people. This right is non-derogable
and cannot be legally removed as an act of capricious vengeance. Third,
rights are indivisible and inalienable. [The [withholding of]{.mark}
humanitarian [aid]{.mark}]{.underline} as a substitute for judicial
action [[is]{.mark} ethically and morally
[indefensible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, extra-judicial killings and
deaths arbitrarily meted out through \'humanitarian sanctions\' simply
serve to reinforce fear, prejudice and to fuel the cycle of violence,
revenge and retribution. The concept of the \'undeserving victim\' is
therefore morally and ethically untenable, and practically
counter-productive. It represents an outright rejection of the
principles of humanity, impartiality and universalism, fundamental
tenets of human rights and humanitarian principles. When
operationalised, the evidence from the Great Lakes and elsewhere is that
the abandonment of humanitarian principles in fact reinforces the
culture of impunity\--it does not, as many had naively predicted,
eradicate it. The \`new pragmatists\': local solutions for local
problems As well as blaming the victims, [many [commentators]{.mark}
have [claim]{.mark}ed that [aid]{.mark} [prolongs suffering]{.mark} as
it obviates]{.underline} the need for local people to invent [local
solutions]{.underline} and that it undermines political accountability
and the social contract between citizen and state. Warlords can tear
countries to shreds in the full knowledge that the humanitarian system
will clear up the mess afterwards, and in effect, subsidise the human
costs of warfare. Furthermore, as humanitarian aid does not discriminate
between just and unjust causes, it consequently acts as quartermaster to
all parties to any conflict and thereby prolongs warfare, irrespective
of any moral and ethical considerations. Humanitarian aid also diverts
attention away from long-term political solutions and focuses solely
upon treating symptoms. With no prospect of international humanitarian
action, local leaders would be obliged to act more humanely and
responsibly. [[This]{.mark} argument [assumes]{.mark} that [the \'root
cause\']{.mark} of the problem [is]{.mark} to be found and [resolved
locally]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, forget colonialism,
imperialism and apartheid, forget structural adjustment, forget
international debt, forget economic globalisation, forget the
international arms trade and forget rapacious corporate behaviour.
Forget covert superpower military and intelligence operations. While not
going to the other extreme by claiming that external agency is to blame
entirely for the post-Cold War increase in the numbers of internal
conflicts, these external forces can surely not be completely absolved
of all responsibility either. Available evidence suggests that
international aid is a drop in the ocean compared to war economies. For
example, total international aid to Afghanistan stands at about \$120
million per annum. The UK street value of Afghanistan\'s annual
production of narcotics is an estimated \$15 billion. This is about 150
times more than is spent annually on international aid to Afghanistan
and perhaps five times the amount spent on humanitarian aid globally in
1997. If only an estimated \$45 million is paid to Afghan farmers, the
remainder is presumably shared out between international drug dealers
and Afghan \'warlords\'. This would suggest that cutting humanitarian
aid would have little or no impact upon the ability of the Afghans, and
their foreign sponsors, to wage war, nor do many in Afghanistan believe
that it would persuade the warlords to shoulder the burden of the
humanitarian programme and spend less on waging war.(n5) Criminalised
economies obviously thrive on lawlessness and the collapse of civil
authority. Embargoes on humanitarian aid can however strengthen the hold
that warlords and drugs barons have over already desperate people. [Bad
as well as good local solutions also exist and [it is very hard to see
how humanitarian assistance]{.mark} necessarily [favours]{.mark} [only
bad]{.mark},]{.underline} or conversely, only good local
[[solutions]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Were it not so tragic, [it would
be]{.mark} **almost [laughable]{.mark}** [to suggest that
without]{.mark} humanitarian [aid wars and natural disasters would
stop.]{.mark} It is like saying that we can prevent traffic accidents
and fires by abolishing ambulances and fire-engines. [Confusing
correlation with causation is a]{.mark} **potentially [deadly
error]{.mark}** [in this]{.mark} policy
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the cessation of
humanitarian aid to Rwandan refugees in 1996, the wars in the region
have all heated up and tens of thousands have died. Some speak about the
resumption of the genocide in Rwanda. This contrasts with a lull in
political violence in the region [[during the height of the humanitarian
programme]{.mark} in 1995 and 1996]{.underline}. Arguably, [[the Great
Lakes was a more peaceful place]{.mark} with international humanitarian
aid and protection than it has become without it]{.underline}. Yet
[humanitarian [protection was]{.mark}]{.underline} quite deliberately
[[suspended and]{.underline}]{.mark} tens of [[thousands]{.mark} of
people [were sacrificed on the altar of]{.mark} a]{.underline}
convenient combination of political correctness and short-term financial
expediency that seem to underpin the \'new pragmatists\', \'do no harm\'
and [[\'local solutions\']{.mark} policies. [Cutting]{.mark}
humanitarian [assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} as a punishment for waging
war [[is]{.mark} now [advocated]{.mark} by some [as a]{.mark} global
[panacea for ending conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [only likely [result is]{.mark} that the
[victims of war will have their sentences enhanced]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Finally, and perhaps most crucially, those who are willing to trade
lives and suffering today for political gains tomorrow should perhaps
examine the reliability of economic, political and social forecasting.
The demonstration of causation and attribution in a globalised
environment is perhaps more difficult than ever. The application of \'do
no harm\' policies is tantamount to playing God\--a deadly, perhaps
totalitarian business to indulge in without the benefit of 20:20 future
vision, a faculty which is conspicuous by its obvious absence. There is
no firmly established relationship between the provision of humanitarian
aid and the prolongation of war, either in quantitative or in
qualitative terms. Aid policies, including the application of
\'humanitarian\' sanctions or embargoes, founded upon such arguments are
built upon weak theory and anecdote only. Much of the \'new
pragmatists\' argument is been captured in the phrase \'humanitarianism
should not be used as a substitute for political action\' which most
prominently surfaced from the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance
to Rwanda (Borton et al., 1996). In co-opting this argument, the \'new
pragmatists\' have slightly modified the sentence, with a profound
transformation in meaning and implication. For example, a British
Foreign Office official writes that \'humanitarianism as a substitute
for political action is unsatisfactory\' (Evans, 1997). Does that mean
that the UK will not provide humanitarian assistance if it is seen to be
at odds with its political interests? Such an argument travesties the
actual meaning of the Joint Evaluation\'s conclusion which might well
have included a caveat to the effect that political action (or inaction)
should not be used as a substitute for humanitarian action. [This lesson
very clearly emerges from the latest study of international assistance
co-ordination in the Great Lakes]{.underline} (Lautze et al., 1998).
[The failure to mount coherent]{.underline} political and military
[interventions in 1994 allowed the genocide to happen. Again, [in
1996/7]{.mark}, some blame for tens of thousands of predictable deaths
in the Great Lakes region must be attributed to the failure (or
subversion) of international political will]{.underline} to guarantee
protective asylum or custody for those at risk (see, for example,
Stockton, 1996). [In this case [**\'local solutions\'** were applied,
while]{.mark} international [humanitarians]{.mark} mainly [watched
in]{.mark} frustrated impotence and [exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Does anyone now wish to claim this as a great success?

**Even if humanitarianism has flaws, it is more effective than
non-intervention\-\--representing the harm is better than sweeping under
the rug**

**Stockton 98** -- former lecturer of sociology, Executive Director of
the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (Nicholas, "In Defence of
Humanitarianism," Disasters, 22.4)

As many as 100 NGOs are said to have turned up to \'help\' in Goma in
1994 (Borton et al., 1996). The place was awash with the modern symbols
of international aid: T-shirts, car stickers and flags. Humanitarian
\'heralds\' were there, the NGO press officers, doggedly pursuing
journalists, brandishing their new angles on the story, often relating
to their own agency\'s courage, skill and impact. All clamoured for
television coverage and made claims about what could be achieved, some
of which were indeed outrageous. [[Many have subsequently argued that
the relief system is]{.underline}]{.mark} now badly [[out of
control,]{.mark} having become a self-perpetuating expatriate
industry]{.underline} unscrupulously [exploiting]{.underline} other
people\'s [misery]{.underline}. Where genuine compassion exists, it is
all too often combined with a gross naivety and amateurism that produces
unforeseen and damaging side-effects. Finally, the international
agencies operate in a manner that grants their staff near complete
impunity for professional incompetence. They can get away, literally,
with murder. [While there is doubtless]{.underline} some
[truth]{.underline} in all of this, [it is important to establish how
generalisable the picture is]{.underline}. **[[There is very little
empirical evidence that actual harm has been
caused]{.underline}]{.mark}** by increased numbers of agencies per
se.(n9) In fact increased agency competition has certainly demanded more
efficient and more professional approaches. It also offers the donors,
both private and official, more choice of potential implementation
partners. Indeed in the \'development\' zone, many of the same critics
of the humanitarian scene actually celebrate institutional proliferation
as an indicator of the health of \'civil society\'. [It is surely right
that humanitarian agencies pursue television and media coverage of major
humanitarian calamities. Would it be better to ignore them or cover them
up? [The failure to engage]{.mark}]{.underline} much serious [[media
attention to long-term suffering and structural poverty is hardly likely
to be remedied through **cleansing our screens** of disaster
stories]{.underline}]{.mark}. Surely it makes little sense to argue that
because some ambulances leave the scene of some accidents
\'empty-handed\' that in future ambulances will be despatched one at a
time, no matter what the scale and severity of the reported incident. If
in Goma some agencies turned up unnecessarily, it is very important to
consider carefully what might have happened if an insufficient number
had turned up, before jumping to the conclusion that it is possible to
define and plan for an optimal response. [Of course]{.underline} the
[humanitarian agencies]{.underline} and their staff are not perfect.
[But compare their response after the disaster of the Great Lakes with
that of governments]{.underline}. While [France, the UK and the US
variously denied responsibility and buck passed furiously]{.underline},
the [NGOs got on with the Sphere project]{.underline},(n10) [People in
Aid]{.underline},(n11) [and the]{.underline} [Humanitarian
Ombudsman]{.underline} (n12) project. These very complex exercises in
inter-agency co-operation, involving hundreds of very diverse
organisations, are laying down clear standards of ethical behaviour,
minimum standards in service delivery, best practice standards in human
resource management and methods of enhancing accountability to
legitimate humanitarian claimants. [It is of course easy to build up a
portfolio of cases pointing to]{.underline} venality, inefficiency and
[ineptitude within the humanitarian system]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, as is often said in legal circles,
[**[bad]{.underline}** **[cases do not necessarily make for good
laws]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [[Abolition of the health service as a
whole is not a rational and justifiable response to the identification
of bad practice in particular circumstances]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Evidence for and against needs to be weighed carefully and the principle
of proportionality reflected when reforming the system. Conclusion The
remarkable resilience of Henri Dunant\'s concepts of humanity,
impartiality, neutrality and independence are based very particularly
upon his recognition in 1859 at the Battle of Solferino that
humanitarian aid will only be politically possible and ethically
justifiable so long as it favours neither warring party with military
advantage. These humanitarian principles are as valid now as they were
in 1859; in essence the right of non-combatants to protection from
violence, inhumane or degrading treatment. The Geneva Conventions and
other human rights and humanitarian treaties do therefore confer
obligations upon humanitarian organisations and it is absolutely right
that the humanitarian system should be held accountable to these norms.
In this respect, Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red
Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief (1994) offers a powerful
normative framework to judge the performance of the humanitarian system.
In general, the humanitarian agencies are improving their performance in
terms of quality, and their willingness to be held accountable to these
principles and associated technical standards. This is well illustrated
by the phenomenon of over 100 humanitarian agencies co-operating on the
Sphere humanitarian standards project. However, growing evidence
suggests that the humanitarian system is doing badly as humanitarian
demand seems to be outstripping the supply of official and private
compassion. But [[when contrasted with the failures of an international
political culture that fails to get to grips with war-crime
impunity]{.mark}, [the illegal arms trade and those macro-economic
processes that sustain the iceberg of poverty and inequality that lies
below]{.mark}]{.underline} the surface of most [[violent
conflicts]{.underline},]{.mark} then the [[humanitarian system]{.mark}
and its underlying values sometimes [look like a warm, albeit
beleaguered, beacon of hope]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[This must not be
extinguished]{.underline}**]{.mark}. A [public engagement with the human
tragedies of poverty and violence **must be renewed**]{.underline}, [no
matter how distant these may seem geographically or
politically]{.underline}.

**Leaving the Horn alone ensures widespread conflict\-\--states are
complicit**

**Wolf 12** -- Tetra Tech ARD Project Manager (Lucas, "EAST AFRICA
REGIONAL CONFLICT AND INSTABILITY ASSESSMENT," Final Report)

[[Conflict and instability trends in]{.underline}]{.mark} East
Africa---encompassing [[the Horn]{.underline}]{.mark} of Africa, the
Great Lakes, and the traditional East Africa region (Kenya, Uganda, and
Tanzania)---[[continue to make it one of the most unstable regions in
the world]{.underline}.]{.mark}3 [The region's chronic instability
stands in sharp contrast to the notable successes in conflict management
across most of the rest of Africa]{.underline}. Conflicts in South
Sudan, southern Somalia, Darfur, and eastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC)---combined with heavily armed communal clashes in some other
parts of the region---wreak havoc on local, state, and regional
security. [Transborder [criminal networks seek refuge in remote and
weakly governed borderlands]{.mark}]{.underline}. While parts of the
region are relatively stable and peaceful today, [[significant portions
of East Africa remain unable to break free of a brutal and prolonged
history of armed conflicts,]{.mark} violent crime, extremism, communal
violence, political instability, displacement, human rights abuses, and
state failure. [The **inability** of central governments to protect
their citizens from this violence---in some cases,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[government complicity in the crises]{.underline}**]{.mark}---has
**[[eroded communities' trust in the state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most
of East Africa's zones of armed conflict and instability today are
concentrated near border areas and feature powerful crossborder drivers,
interests, and actors. Crossborder spillover is thus a major problem in
East Africa, and has the effect of tying the fates of relatively stable
countries to their troubled neighbors. At its worst, spillover has
produced new crises of armed violence that match or exceed the fatality
levels of the original conflict, as the case of the 1994 Rwandan
genocide and ensuing wars in eastern DRC illustrates. Under such
circumstances, regional governments can ill-afford to ignore violent
conflicts in neighboring countries, nor can they rest assured that
containment strategies will adequately shield them. [[Few of the
region's central governments have the **capacity** (or in some cases the
**political will**) to police and patrol their remote, expansive border
areas]{.underline}.]{.mark} As a result, [much of what passes for
transborder conflict management and prevention falls on the shoulders of
regional organizations, local communities, and local government
authorities]{.underline}, in partnership with often distant central
governments. [Their resilience and adaptability are critical factors in
determining whether and to what extent crossborder conflict and
instability issues are successfully managed]{.underline}.

**These factors impede community-led efforts**

**Wolf 12** -- Tetra Tech ARD Project Manager (Lucas, "EAST AFRICA
REGIONAL CONFLICT AND INSTABILITY ASSESSMENT," Final Report)

Even so, [[community efforts to manage crossborder violence and
instability have faced **significant problems**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
Kenya, the formalization of PDCs has allowed for the model to be
replicated across much of the country, but has an uneven record. Some
PDCs have been used as political platforms for aspiring politicians; in
the process, the PDCs have been politicized, and their neutrality
damaged. In southern Somalia, community-based governance is well
developed thanks to 21 years of state collapse, but in recent years has
had to contend with the violent and intimidating presence of Al-Shabaab.
Local civic leaders have been able to negotiate terms with Al-Shabaab,
but at great risk, and as a result have been constrained by the threat
of assassination from acting autonomously. In Ethiopia, the government's
recent restrictive laws on civil society (the Charities and Societies
Proclamation) has reduced formal roles for CSOs in peace building and
conflict management in border areas, though civil society
representatives are represented in LPCs. In some war-torn areas of East
Africa, CSOs in remote border areas are weak or in disarray. Capacity
and leadership quality are critical, and vary tremendously from place to
place. Finally, in some conflict areas of East Africa, [[local community
leadership is simply not committed to peace
building]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Years of clashes have hardened ethnic
animosities and deepened distrust]{.underline}; competing [[narratives
are jarringly at odds, and appear to offer only modest prospects for
negotiation and mediation]{.underline}.]{.mark} Our research encountered
this in the Turkana border area of Kenya and Ethiopia, where the Turkana
and Dassenesh communities are locked in spiraling violence over land and
the fisheries of the shrinking Lake Turkana. Border
[communities]{.underline} typically take on a broad portfolio of roles
in maintaining peace. At their best, they serve as eyes and ears for
early warning systems; create deterrence, by placing social pressure on
would-be criminals and armed militia; mobilize the community for both
conflict prevention and management; are a source of customary or
religious law within their group; and serve as diplomats in managing
tensions with neighboring groups. They also [face serious constraints,
and are]{.underline} especially [limited in effectiveness]{.underline}
when deprived of a strong partnership with local and national
governments. [[Some of the factors constraining community peace building
include ineffective or hostile local government in some locations, poor
communication systems]{.underline}]{.mark} with crossborder groups,
[[increasingly complex new conflict drivers and fatality levels which
can overwhelm customary systems of justice]{.underline}]{.mark} and
conflict management, [powerful spoilers, and organizational challenges
of keeping hybrid governance coalitions working together]{.underline}.

**The existence of habeas petitions promoting human rights proves that
an institution can be caught up in systems of whiteness while still
combatting violence**

scholar in the field of federal Indian law, international law,

Redefining the Terms of Indigenous Peoples\' Survival in the World",
Duke Law Journal, Vol. 4)

Not too long ago, it was fashionable for some legal [[academics]{.mark}
in this country to [assert that rights discourse]{.mark}---that is, talk
and thought about rights---[was]{.mark} actually [harmful to]{.mark} the
social movements of [peoples of color]{.mark}]{.underline} and other
oppressed groups.1 And as recent times have shown, legal
[[academics]{.mark} of color [can attract]{.mark} a great deal of
attention and the [sympathies of]{.mark} anonymous [white colleagues by
telling]{.mark} [us that the sufferings and stories of peoples of
color]{.mark} in this country [possess no unique capacity to transform
the law]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 [[These]{.mark} legal academic
[denials]{.mark} of the efficacy of rights discourse and storytelling
for the social movements of peoples of color now [seem disharmonious
with the larger transformations occurring in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why any legal academics would discount the
usefulness of such proven, liberating forms of discourse in the
particular society they serve from their positions of privilege is a
curious and contentious question. The disaggregated narratives of human
rights struggles on the nightly news apparently have not been sufficient
for some legal academics. They want documented accounts demonstrating
the efficacy of rights discourse and storytelling in the social
movements of outsider groups. Empirical evidence of the traditions,
histories, and lives of oppressed peoples actually transforming legal
thought and doctrine about rights could then be used to cure skeptics of
the critical race scholarly enterprise.3 \"See here,\" the still
unconverted in the faculty lounge can be told, \"this stuff works, if
applied and systematized correctly.\" Despite the attacks from
society\'s dominant groups in the legal academic spectrum---both the
left and right---the voices of legal scholars of color have sought to
keep faith with the struggles and aspirations of oppressed peoples
around the world. These emerging voices recognize that [[now is the time
to intensify the struggle for human rights on all fronts]{.mark}--- [to
heighten demands, engage in intense political rhetoric, and sharpen
critical thinking about all aspects of legal thought and
doctrine]{.mark}. The rapid emergence of [indigenous peoples]{.mark}\*
[human rights]{.mark}]{.underline} as a subject of major concern and
action in contemporary international law [[provides a unique
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} to witness the application of rights
discourse and storytelling in institutionalized, law-bound settings
around the world.4 By telling their own stories in recognized and
authoritative intcrnational human rights standard-setting bodies during
the past decade, indigenous peoples have sought to redefine the terms of
their right to survival under international law.5 Under present,
Western-dominated conceptions of international law, indigenous peoples
are regarded as subjects of the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of the
settler state regimes that invaded their territories and established
hegemony during prior colonial eras.6 At present, international law does
not contest unilateral assertions of state sovereignty that limit, or
completely deny the collective cultural rights of indigenous peoples.7
Contemporary international law also does not concern itself with
protecting indigenous peoples\' traditionally-occupied territories from
uncompensated state appropriation, even when indigenous territories are
secured through treaties with a state. According to contemporary
international discourse, such treaties should be treated as legal
nullities.8 Finally, modern international law refuses to recognize
indigenous peoples as \"peoples,\" entitled to rights of
self-determination as specified in United Nations and other major
international human rights legal instruments.9 Since the 1970s, in
international human rights forums around the world, [[indigenous
peoples]{.mark} [have contested the]{.mark} international [legal
system\'s]{.mark} continued [acquiescence to]{.mark} the assertions of
[exclusive]{.mark} [state sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} and
jurisdiction over the terms of their survival. Pushed to the brink of
extinction by state-sanctioned policies of genocide and ethnocide,
indigenous peoples have demanded heightened international concern and
legal protection for their continued survival.10 The emergence of
indigenous rights in contemporary international legal discourse is a
direct response to the consciousness-raising efforts of indigenous
peoples in international human rights forums. [[Specialized]{.mark}
international and regional bodies, non-governmental organizations
([NGOs]{.mark}), and advocacy groups [are]{.mark} now
**[devoting]{.mark}** greater **[attention to indigenous human
rights]{.mark}** concerns]{.underline}.\" By far the most important of
these specialized initiatives to emerge out of the indigenous human
rights movement is the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous
Populations (Working Group). The Working Group is composed of five
international legal experts drawn from the United Nations Sub-Commission
on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. The
Working Group was created by the Sub-Commission\'s parent body, the
United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1982 and given a
specific mandate to develop international legal standards for the
protection of indigenous peoples\' human rights.12

[[Does **peacekeeping work?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Janice Stein
(University of Toronto) and I had a lively exchange on this subject on
the CBC radio program "The House" last weekend. Have a listen. In the
interview, I said that [more than two dozen major peace operations have
been deployed over the past 25 years]{.underline} in countries emerging
from civil wars, and that [although some have been]{.underline} terrible
[failures]{.underline} (e.g., Rwanda 1994), [their overall record has
been]{.underline} reasonably [good at preventing]{.underline} a
[recurrence of fighting.]{.underline} Prof. [Stein was unconvinced. Some
studies]{.underline}, she said, "[show]{.underline} that [the majority
\[of peace operations\] are failures]{.underline} and that [there is a
return to violence after 5 to 7 years]{.underline}. So I think the
record is the reverse." So, which is it? Does peacekeeping generally
help to prevent a return to violence, or does it generally fail to do
so? The answer to this question matters -- quite a lot, actually. If
peacekeeping is ineffective and if outsiders can do little to help
post-conflict societies transition towards a more stable peace, as Prof.
Stein suggests, then Western policymakers and other leaders would be
foolish to consider contributing to, or even supporting, such efforts.
If, on the other hand, peacekeeping has a reasonably positive record, it
would seem foolish for the same policymakers not to support these
efforts. Prof. [[Stein is]{.underline}]{.mark} a fine scholar and fluent
analyst of international affairs, but she's [**[not correct]{.mark}**
about the peacekeeping record.]{.underline} Michael [Doyle]{.underline}
(Columbia University) [and]{.underline} Nicholas [Sambanis]{.underline}
(Yale University) [demonstrated]{.underline} in 2000 that the [[presence
of a large peacekeeping operation]{.mark} in a country emerging from
civil war **[significantly reduced]{.mark} the [chances of]{.mark} that
society [slipping back into violence]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} They reached
this conclusion by analyzing post-conflict countries that had, and had
not, received peace missions, and by holding other factors constant,
including the intensity of the preceding war, the type of conflict, etc.
[Their finding has been **replicated, modified, and reconfirmed many
times** ]{.mark}**in the ensuing decade-and-a-half** [and is]{.mark} now
[**widely accepted**]{.mark} among international security
scholars]{.underline}. One recent survey of this literature put it
simply: "there is considerable evidence that \[United Nations
peacekeeping operations\] are effective in maintaining peace." In fact,
most debates on this subject are now focusing not on whether
peacekeeping reduces the risk of renewed fighting, but on how much it
does so. Of course, [this does not mean]{.underline} that [every
peacekeeping mission]{.underline} has succeeded or [will succeed;
rather, it indicates]{.underline} that "[on average" peacekeeping works
to reduce the risk of renewed conflict. [It is a statistical
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- [and a **very strong
one**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** as other contributors to
this literature, including Paul Collier (University of Oxford) and Page
Fortna (Columbia University and contributor to this blog), have
demonstrated. [[This finding may seem counter-intuitive]{.mark} at
first, [given]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**lingering images of failed
peacekeeping**]{.mark} efforts]{.underline} in Rwanda and Somalia, for
example. [But]{.underline} [it begins to make sense if you
[consider]{.mark} how many countries have navigated the war-to-peace
transition with the assistance of international peacekeepers --
including [**El Salvador**, **Nicaragua**, **Namibia**, **Mozambique**,
**Sierra Leone**, **Cambodia**, **East Timor**, **Bosnia** and
**Kosovo**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps [[these]{.mark} cases [have
fallen from **public view**]{.mark} precisely [because they are **no
longer at war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Still [no return to massive
bloodshed in Bosnia" is very important news to]{.underline} the
[inhabitants]{.underline} of that country, [but don't count on seeing
this headline in tomorrow's paper]{.underline}. If it doesn't bleed, it
doesn't lead. Nevertheless, [the [**evidence is clear**: ***on
balance***, peacekeeping works]{.mark}]{.underline} reasonably
[well]{.underline} at [preventing conflicts from
reigniting.]{.underline} I've included a list of studies at the end of
this post in case you wish to read further, but I'll leave the last word
to Steven Pinker of Harvard University, who, in the video clip below,
sums up the findings of this scholarship more eloquently than I can. In
response to the question of whether peacekeeping works, Pinker says:
[[The answer from]{.mark} the [**statistical studies is**: **absolutely,
they work massively**.]{.mark} A country is much less likely to fall
back in civil war if they've got armed peacekeepers]{.underline}. And
[the better financed and armed]{.underline} the peacekeeping force, [the
more effective]{.underline} they are... The United Nations does a number
of things badly, but it does a number of things well, and one of them is
peacekeeping -- on average, not 100 percent of the time. [**The
[headlines would never tell you that. Only a statistical study
would]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**Here's another study.**

In this article, we argue that [[international actors]{.mark} can work
to **[reduce]{.mark}** the level of [violence]{.mark} in ongoing civil
wars]{.underline}. In particular, we argue that mediators can contribute
to a reduction in violence by facilitating negotiated settlements and by
creating lulls during which negotiations can occur. [We also expect
peacekeeping to reduce **civil war violence**]{.underline}, for reasons
similar to the arguments of Hultman, Kathman, and Shannon (2014,
hereafter HKS). Moreover, we argue that the mechanisms through which
mediation and peacekeeping can help attenuate violence are both
additive---the mediators help reduce violence in ways that peacekeeping
operations alone cannot and vice versa---and interactive---mediation and
peacekeeping reinforce one another and may even depend on one another.

[[We examine]{.mark} these expectations in an analysis of]{.underline}
**[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** intrastate
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} months [[in Africa from]{.mark} 19[89
to]{.mark} 20[08]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since mediated peace processes
and peacekeeping deployments often occur in close temporal proximity, it
is important to examine their distinct contributions to reductions in
armed violence within the same empirical framework. We find, consistent
with our expectations, that mediation leads to a dramatic decline in
battlefield casualties. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[find]{.underline}]{.mark}, consistent with HKS, [[that peacekeeping
**reduces** battlefield casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to
these independent effects, we find that mediation and peacekeeping have
a conditional effect wherein the presence of both leads to a greater
reduction in battlefield fatalities. We also find that this interaction
is driven primarily by mediation and peacekeeping occurring
simultaneously rather than by a sequencing in which mediation precedes
peacekeepers. These results illustrate that mediation and peacekeeping
can have important positive impacts on conflict beyond complete
termination.

**[! --- NATO Good --- AT: Interventions --- Libya]{.underline}**

**NATO's involvement in Libya prevented massacres.**

**Hamid 16** \[Shadi Hamid; senior fellow at the Project on US Relations
with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution's Center for Middle
East Policy; 4-5-2016; \"[Everyone says the Libya intervention was a
failure. **They're wrong**]{.underline}.\"; Vox;
https://www.vox.com/2016/4/5/11363288/libya-intervention-success; KL\]

Libya and the 2011 NATO intervention there have become synonymous with
failure, disaster, and the Middle East being a \"shit show\" (to use
President Obama's colorful descriptor). It has perhaps never been more
important to question this prevailing wisdom, because how we interpret
Libya affects how we interpret Syria and, importantly, how we assess
Obama's foreign policy legacy.

[Of course, Libya]{.underline}, as anyone can see, [is a
mess]{.underline}, [and Americans are reasonably asking if the
intervention was a mistake]{.underline}. [But just because it's
reasonable doesn't make it right]{.underline}.

[Most criticisms of the intervention]{.underline}, even with the benefit
of hindsight, **[fall short]{.underline}**. [It is certainly true that
the intervention didn't]{.underline} produce something resembling [a
stable democracy]{.underline}. [This, however, was never the
goal]{.underline}. [The goal was to **protect civilians** and **prevent
a massacre**]{.underline}.

[Critics **erroneously compare** Libya today to any number of **false
ideals**]{.underline}, [but this is not the correct way to
evaluate]{.underline} the [success or failure]{.underline} of the
intervention. [To do that, [we should compare Libya]{.mark} [today to
what]{.mark} Libya would have looked like [if we hadn't
intervened]{.mark}]{.underline}. By that standard, the Libya
intervention was successful: [[The country is **better off**]{.mark}
today than it would have been had the international community allowed
**dictator Muammar Qaddafi** to continue his **rampage**]{.underline}
[across the country]{.underline}.

[Critics]{.underline} further [assert that the intervention
caused]{.underline}, created, or somehow led to [civil war]{.underline}.
In fact, [the civil war had **already started** before the intervention
began]{.underline}. As for today's chaos, violence, and general
instability, these are more plausibly tied not to the original
intervention but to the international community's failures after
intervention.

[[The]{.mark} very fact that the [Libya]{.mark} intervention and its
[legacy]{.mark} have been either **[distorted]{.mark}** or misunderstood
[is]{.mark} itself [evidence of]{.mark} a]{.underline}
[**[warped]{.mark} foreign policy [discourse]{.mark}** in the US, [where
anything short of success]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [in this case, Libya
quickly becoming a stable]{.underline}, relatively democratic
[country]{.underline} --- [[is viewed as a failure]{.underline}]{.mark}.

NATO intervened to protect civilians, not to set up a democracy

As stated in the UN Security Council resolution authorizing force in
Libya, the goal of intervention was \"to protect civilians and civilian
populated areas under threat of attack.\" And this is what was achieved.

[In February 2011, [anti-Qaddafi demonstrations
spread]{.mark}]{.underline} across the country. [[The regime
responded]{.underline}]{.mark} to the nascent protest movement [[with
**lethal force**]{.mark}, [killing]{.mark} **more than [100]{.mark}**
[people in]{.mark} the first few [days]{.mark}]{.underline}, effectively
sparking an armed rebellion. The rebels quickly lost momentum, however.

I still remember how I felt in those last days and hours [as Qaddafi's
forces marched toward Benghazi]{.underline}. In a quite literal sense,
every moment mattered, and [the longer we waited, the greater the
cost]{.underline}.

It was frightening to watch. I didn't want to live in an America where
we would stand by silently as [a **[brutal
dictator]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[using that]{.mark} distinct
[language of]{.mark} **[genocidaires]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
[[announced]{.mark} rather clearly [his intentions to
**kill**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In one speech, [[Qaddafi called
protesters]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"**[[cockroaches]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" [[and vowed to cleanse
Libya]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[**[inch by inch]{.mark}**, house by house,
**[home by home]{.mark}**, alleyway by alleyway]{.underline}.\"

Already, [on the eve of intervention, the death toll was estimated at
somewhere between 1,000 and **2,000**]{.underline}. (This was when the
international community's tolerance for Arab Spring--related mass
killings was still fairly low.)

As Obama's advisers saw it, there were two options for military action:
a no-fly zone (which, on its own, wouldn't do much to stop Qaddafi's
tanks) or a broader resolution that would allow the US and its allies to
take further measures, including establishing what amounted to a
floating no-drive zone around rebel forces. The president went with the
latter option.

The NATO operation lasted about seven months, with an estimated death
toll of around 8,000, apparently most of them combatants on both sides
(although there is some lack of clarity on this, since the Libyan
government doesn't clearly define \"revolutionaries\" or \"rebel
supporters\"). A Human Rights Watch investigation found that at least 72
civilians were killed as a result of the NATO air campaign, definitively
contradicting speculative claims of mass casualties from the Qaddafi
regime.

Claims of \"mission creep\" have become commonplace, most forcefully
articulated by the Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Zenko may be right, but he asserts rather than explains why mission
creep is always a bad thing. It may be that in some circumstances, the
scope of a mission should be defined more broadly, rather than narrowly.

If anything, it was the Obama administration's insistence of minimizing
the mission --- including the absurd claim that it would take \"days,
not weeks\" --- that was the problem from the very start. Zenko and
others never make clear how civilians could have been protected as long
as Qaddafi was waging war on them.

[What Libya would look like today if NATO hadn't intervened]{.underline}

[It's helpful to engage in a bit of **counterfactual
history**]{.underline} here. As Niall Ferguson notes in his book Virtual
Alternatives, "[To understand how it actually was, we therefore need to
understand how it actually wasn't]{.underline}."

Applied to the Libyan context, this means that [we're not comparing
Libya, during or after the intervention, with some imagined ideal of
stable, functioning democracy]{.underline}. [Rather, we would compare it
with]{.underline} what we judge, to the best of our ability,
[[the]{.mark} **most likely [alternative]{.mark}** outcome would have
been [had the US not intervened]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Here's what we know: By March 19, 2011, when the NATO operation began,
the death toll in Libya had risen rapidly to more than 1,000 in a
relatively short amount of time, confirming Qaddafi's longstanding
reputation as someone who was willing to kill his countrymen (as well as
others) in large numbers if that's what his survival required.

[There was **no end in sight**]{.underline}. After early rebel gains,
Qaddafi had seized the advantage. Still, he was not in a position to
deal a decisive blow to the opposition. (Nowhere in the Arab Spring era
has one side in a military conflict been able to claim a clear victory,
even with massive advantages in manpower, equipment, and regional
backing.)

[Any Libyan who had opted to take up arms [was]{.mark} liable to
be]{.underline} captured, arrested, or [killed]{.underline} if Qaddafi
"won," [so the incentives to accept defeat were nonexistent, to say
nothing of the understandable desire to not live under the [rule of a
**brutal**]{.mark} and **maniacal [strongman]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The most likely outcome]{.underline}, then, [was
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} Syria-like [[situation of
**indefinite**]{.mark}, **[intensifying violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Even President Obama, who today seems unsure about the decision to
intervene, acknowledged in an August 2014 interview with Thomas Friedman
that "[had we not intervened]{.underline}, it's likely that Libya would
be Syria. ... And so [there would be **more death**, more disruption,
more destruction]{.underline}."

What caused the current Libyan civil war?

Critics charge that the NATO intervention was responsible for or somehow
caused Libya's current state of chaos and instability. For instance,
after leaving the Obama administration, Philip Gordon, the most senior
US official on the Middle East in 2013-\'15, wrote: \"In Iraq, the U.S.
intervened and occupied, and the result was a costly disaster. In Libya,
the U.S. intervened and did not occupy, and the result was a costly
disaster. In Syria, the U.S. neither intervened nor occupied, and the
result is a costly disaster.\"

The problem here is that US intervention did not, in fact, result in a
costly disaster, unless we are using the word \"result\" to simply
connote that one thing happened after a previous thing. [The NATO
operation ended in October 2011]{.underline}. [The current civil war in
Libya began in May 2014]{.underline} --- [a full **two and a half
years** later]{.underline}. The intervention and today's violence are of
course related, but this does not necessarily mean there is a causal
relationship.

[To argue that the current conflict in Libya is a result of the
intervention, one would basically need to assume that the outbreak of
civil war was **inevitable**, irrespective of anything that happened in
the intervening **30 months**]{.underline}.

**The alternative was [mass genocide]{.underline} and [hundreds of
thousands]{.underline} of deaths.**

necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline}\"; EUobserver;
https://euobserver.com/world/152742; KL\]

Since the Afghanistan debacle, more and more analysts have raised their
voices against interventions by the West. According to some, the West
should only intervene militarily when self-interest is at stake and if
there is no alternative.

For example, many believe that the intervention in Libya was a mistake.
That its late leader Muammar Gaddafi would still be in power would not
matter to our interest. In other words, they believe that doing nothing
is usually better than doing something.

Let me first zoom in on Libya. [Following Tunisia and Egypt, [Libyans
took to the streets]{.mark}]{.underline} for the first time on 17
February 2011 [[to demand the end of the Gaddafi]{.mark} regime, which
had been a **[reign of terror]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 1969.

That happened first in Benghazi, the second largest city in Libya, which
then had a population of about 630,000. In March 2011, [Gaddafi\'s army
marched]{.underline} with a huge force to Benghazi [to]{.underline}, as
the \"Brotherly Leader and Guide\" announced, [**nip all resistance** in
the bud]{.underline}, \"[from house to house]{.underline}, alley to
alley\".

[[No one doubted]{.mark} that]{.underline} tens of thousands, if not
**[[hundreds of thousands]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of people would be
killed]{.underline}]{.mark}. A genocide 10, maybe 50 times bigger than
Srebrenica was about to happen.

[[It was the **Libyans themselves**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially the
future prime minister Mahmoud Jibril, [[who]{.mark} **first
[convinced]{.mark}** the [Europe]{.mark}an Parliament]{.underline}, then
French president Nicolas Sarkozy [and]{.underline} finally
[US]{.underline} secretary of state Hillary Clinton [to try [to stop
this]{.mark} massacre]{.underline}.

When the planes took off from France to Libya on 17 March, the Libyan
army was literally already at the gates of Benghazi.

[[A]{.mark} **massive [massacre]{.mark}** [had been **avoided**]{.mark},
[thanks to]{.mark} the Libyan opposition and
**[Nato]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**The mistake of Libya was [not enough]{.underline} intervention.**

America was right to Intervene in Libya, and what went wrong after\";
Medium;
https://jameslate.medium.com/why-america-was-right-to-intervene-in-libya-d31f87202c18;
KL\]

[If the U.S. hadn't intervened, the result might have been
another]{.underline} Syria-like situation of a **[protracted civil
war]{.underline}**. I was in favor of intervening, but I also warned at
the time that the U.S. needed to seriously prepare for a post-Gaddafi
Libya, and that the only way to ward off chaos was to send an
international peacekeeping force.

[[The **Problem**]{.mark} [with Obama]{.mark}]{.underline} In Libya,
[[was]{.mark} that [he]{.mark} employed American airpower]{.underline}
to topple Muammar Gaddafi [but [refused]{.mark} to sanction any
**[follow-on peacekeeping]{.mark}**]{.underline} forces [[to help a
new]{.mark}, pro-Western [government establish]{.mark} its
[authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} The predictable result: a vacuum of
authority that allowed militias and terrorist groups to flourish. U.S.
Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three of his colleagues paid with
their lives for that failure.

The Obama administration's mission while "leading from behind" over the
skies of Libya was never regime change. "Of course, there is no question
that Libya and the world would be better off with Qaddafi out of power,"
Obama said in an address to the nation. "But broadening our military
mission to include regime change would be a mistake." In that address,
the president noted that regime change in Iraq was not worth the cost in
lives or dollars. That's perhaps why the administration was ill-prepared
for the crumbling of Gaddafi's regime.

**[[The Mistake]{.mark} of Libya [was not enough
Intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}**

With the Arabian Revolt sweeping the Middle East in early 2011, Libya's
turn came on February 17. Throwing off decades of fear, and not
bothering with peaceful demonstrations as Tunisia and Egypt had to free
themselves of tyranny, nor the Syrians who tried peaceful demonstrations
for six entire months, the Libyans went straight to armed rebellion, and
soon [the city of Benghazi had been pried from the regime's grip and
become the de facto capital of the **revolution**]{.underline}. [The
Libyans had **no confidence** in protests]{.underline} to alter the
regime of Muammar el-[[Qaddafi]{.underline}]{.mark}. They were right.
The demented Colonel [[responded with a **brutality**]{.mark} [that
included]{.mark} using]{.underline} [[**fighter jets**against civilian
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the violence escalated, on March 17 the
U.N. Security Council passed resolution 1973, which

Authorize\[d\] Member States ..., acting nationally or through regional
organizations or arrangements, ... to take all necessary measures ... to
protect civilians.

Celebrations erupted in Libya at the news that deliverance was coming.
For reasons unclear there was a 48-hour delay, which allowed Qaddafi's
forces to be right at the gates of Benghazi by the time the American
intervention came on March 19 in the form of Operation ODYSSEY DAWN.
Qaddafi's rudimentary air defences were disabled and a no-fly zone
instituted. President Obama then made the decision, on March 31, to hand
the operation to NATO. This was the infamous "leading from behind".
Still, it was enough to bring down the regime. In late August, Qaddafi
was driven from his capital, and on October 20, Qaddafi's escape from
his hometown of Sirte was cut off by French jets and he was pulled out
of a drainage ditch and given to the crowd. They were not pretty those
closing scenes in Sirte, but they were long overdue.

The Russians would protest that their abstention on the U.N. resolution
was never meant to encompass regime-change, and the West, including the
U.S. Defence Secretary and the British Chief of Defence, denied that
this had been the intention. How they proposed to protect civilians
without killing the despot giving the orders that endangered them was
never explained. On Oct. 31, NATO's Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR was
ended, and that was more or less it for Western involvement, except for
the victory lap of course.

In the elections that followed liberation in June 2012, the
tribalists/nationalists would carry the day; the Islamists were
trounced. But the problems had already begun. Between April and
September 2012 there had been "at least five ... attacks against foreign
interests in Benghazi," and this would culminate in the fiasco on Sept.
11, 2012, when the American ambassador and three other U.S. citizens
were killed by al-Qaeda jihadists at the Consulate in that city. There
were many democratic and pro-American people in Libya --- protesters had
expelled the Islamic militants who attacked the U.S. Consulate from
their base in Benghazi after the attack --- but a small group of violent
fanatics can impose themselves if nobody else has the power to resist
them. Lawlessness was allowed to overtake Libya, and the decent
government that had come to office by elections was unable to enforce
its writ. America had made one effort to send a training mission to
Libya to buttress the forces of law and order but it was withdrawn in
mid-2012 "until the security of U.S. personnel and equipment could be
guaranteed"!

2013 did not shape up any better. The parliament passed laws at
gun-point, a proposed NATO training mission went nowhere, and there were
numerous kidnappings, including the Prime Minister. The east of Libya
had always been fertile ground for the jihadists. Derna, for example,
had contributed "far and away" the most holy warriors on a per capita
basis to the jihad against constitutional government in Iraq. With no
State to keep this at bay, and collapsing order around Libya, notably
Mali, the jihadists converged on Libya for shelter and al-Qaeda and
other Salafi-jihadists' presence in the country became more pronounced.

Major cities in Libya, predominantly Tripoli in the west and Benghazi in
the east

Elections in June 2014 had again defeated the Islamists but this time
the zealots decided to take by force what they could not get by the
ballot, and on Saturday, the situation unravelled completely when
Tripoli fell to Islamic militants under the banner of Fajr Libya (Libyan
Dawn). The Islamists set ablaze Tripoli International Airport, further
destruction of the city was reported, and the remnants of the police and
army, as well as militiamen loyal to the government, were being
systematically rounded up by Dawn. In the east, fighting is ongoing
between the Islamists and the supposedly-nationalist militias of Khalifa
Haftar, a former General, a leftover of the old regime who has seemingly
modelled himself on Abdel Fattah as-Sisi, a putschist and autocrat who
claims he can keep the Islamists in check. Libya's Parliament calledfor
international intervention earlier this month and was rebuffed. This is
the harvest.

But this wasn't all. Regional dynamics soon intruded:

Twice in the last seven days, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have
secretly launched airstrikes against Islamist-allied militias battling
for control of Tripoli ... The United States, the officials said, was
caught by surprise: Egypt and the Emirates, both close allies and
military partners, acted without informing Washington, leaving the Obama
administration on the sidelines. Egyptian officials explicitly denied to
American diplomats that their military played any role in the operation
... In recent months, the officials said, teams of "special forces"
operating out of Egypt but possibly composed primarily of Emiratis had
also successfully destroyed an Islamist camp near ... Derna ...

Several officials said in recent days that United States diplomats were
fuming about the airstrikes, believing the intervention could further
inflame the Libyan conflict as the United Nations and Western powers are
seeking to broker a peaceful resolution.

Officials said the government of Qatar has already provided weapons and
support to the Islamist-aligned forces inside Libya, so the new strikes
represent a shift from a battle of proxies to direct involvement. ...

"In every arena --- in Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Libya, even what happened in
Egypt --- this regional polarization, with Saudi Arabia and the ...
U.A.E. on one side and Qatar and Turkey on the other, has proved to be a
gigantic impediment to international efforts to resolve any of these
crisis \[sic\]," said Michele Dunne, a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and a former Middle East specialist at
the State Department.

A snapshot but a very dense one: The region's actors, perhaps especially
America's allies, have taken to free-lancing because they have no
confidence that the President will actually do anything; Qatar is
playing as destructive a role as it can; the struggles within the Muslim
world are the major front in the region (Israel is not even on the radar
of these States); the Obama administration's failure to intervene
properly and stay to secure the aftermath has led to disaster in Libya,
as it has in Iraq; and while bad actors are making real military gains,
the administration worries that using force to stop them will only make
it worse and tries to bring about a political solution in situations
that have long-since passed the point of no return.

Credit where it is due: [The United States had come to the **rescue** of
Libya when **nobody else** would]{.underline} ([Russia and
China]{.underline}) or could (the Arab League). But the U.S. had not
secured the aftermath, the one lesson all sides of the argument should
surely have learned from Iraq.

It didn't have to be this way. Consider an alternative history of the
region over the last three years. If the intervention against Qaddafi
had come sooner, in the first two weeks rather than after four, and if
it had targeted him and his elite directly and unapologetically, the war
would not have dragged out for eight months; there would have been much
less destruction and the jihadists would have had much less time and
space to set themselves up. If Special Forces, military advisers, and
other help were made available to the elected government afterwards then
order could have been restored, in no small part because it wouldn't
have broken down so badly. If fifteen or twenty thousand troops could
have been left in Iraq it would have allowed a fighting chance of
keeping peace between the sects, stopped Iran using Iraq as a transit
point to support the Assad dictatorship, kept Syria's furies largely out
of Iraq, and ensured that the Islamic State didn't get a chance to
regenerate in Iraq.

If an early aerial intervention were mounted in Syria in late 2011 or
early (or even mid-) 2012 it would have stopped the Zarqawi'ites
metastasizing on Syrian soil, denying them the conditions they needed
--- including the complicity of the regime and Iran --- and ensured a
much better outcome by helping to power nationalists, who were
overwhelmingly powerful early in this rebellion, breaking Iran's power
in the Mediterranean, and not incidentally preventing a great deal of
killing and destruction. Project the worst you like for casualties from
a NATO intervention in Syria and it's not 220,000. (In Libya, 72
civilians were collateral damage in NATO's entire campaign, less than
one day's work from Assad, and estimates of the total casualties are
being revised down all the time.)

For those who worry that this is taking on too much, just remember: The
West is going to get dragged in anyway. It will be on terms much less
advantageous, the outcomes will be worse than they could have been with
earlier intervention, and many more people will die, but these
situations will eventually reach a point where they can no longer be
ignored whether, as in Iraq and Syria, it is the rise of transnational
terrorist groups or, as will soon be the case in Libya, the rise of
transnational terrorist groups and a destabilising flood of refugees
into Europe, some of whom will be agents of these terrorist groups. In
Iraq and Libya, it would have been much easier to simply stay on and
secure the gains the West had already achieved. As in so many other
cases, what to do about Syria has not been made easier by letting it
drag out.

The next question of the anti-interventionists tends to be on the "exit
strategy," but this is a fantasy on at least two counts. One is that it
sets up a standard of prescience on interventionists that
anti-interventionists never get held to. For example, Edward Miliband,
having organised the defeat of the proposal in the British Parliament
that said Bashar al-Assad should pay a military price for gassing
children, now bears partial responsibility for everybody who has been
killed in Syria by the regime since last August because he emboldened it
by sending the message that chemical weapons use was cost-free.

But somehow the costs of inaction never seem to register in the same
way. Second, an "exit strategy" can't be known until it's seen. [The
U.S. still has troops in **Germany**, **Japan**, **South Korea**,
**Bosnia**, and **Kosovo**]{.underline} --- [and so much the
better]{.underline}. Look how well they turned out as opposed to the
American South, Somalia, Haiti, and Iraq where American troops were
pulled out too soon. By being prepared to stay for as long as it takes,
there's every chance you won't have to stay so long. If it is understood
that you are determined to see it through, the local actors will make
their long-term arrangements with you. If, like Obama in Afghanistan,
you announce a commitment and simultaneously announce the end-date, the
local actors make their arrangements instead with internal and external
forces they know will be there forever.

In short, the lesson of Libya is not that the intervention in 2011 was a
mistake. It is the lesson once articulated by Representative Charles
Wilson of Texas, who was rather over-sold as having single-handedly
driven the Red Army out of Afghanistan in the excellent film Charlie
Wilson's War. "These things happened. They were glorious and they
changed the world," said the Congressman. "And then we fucked up the
endgame."

Did the United States Violate its Nuclear Agreements with Libya?

To Quote Wikipedia:

In 1968, Libya became signatory of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), ratified the treaty in 1975, and concluded a safeguards agreement
in 1980. The Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials were quoted
"Libya had bought nuclear components from various black market dealers",
and provided the various designs of centrifuges to U.S. officials and
gave the name of its suppliers."

So right there, you have Libya admitting to violating the NPT.

Recognizing that his country was vulnerable to a similar fate as Iraq
and wishing to have lifted the sanctions that had been in place since
the 1980s, Gaddafi announced his intention to destroy his WMD and to
allow inspectors to confirm this fact. The process began in December
2003 and was officially completed by February 2014.

"On 22 September 2011, near Sabha, Libya, toward the end of the Libyan
Civil War, anti-Gaddafi forces discovered two warehouses containing
thousands of blue barrels marked with tape reading "radioactive" and
plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same tape. The IAEA
stated, "We can confirm that there is yellowcake stored in drums at a
site near Sabha ... which Libya previously declared to the IAEA. ... The
IAEA has tentatively scheduled safeguards activities at this location
once the situation in the country stabilises.""

So maybe he didn't actually give up his WMD as promised?

At any rate, the US lifted its sanctions against Libya in 2004 as
promised. (U.S. Lifts Remaining Economic Sanctions Against Libya)

SEVEN years later, the Libyan people decided to overthrow the Gaddafi
regime. When he responded by indiscriminately bombing their cities, NATO
enacted various "no fly zones" in order to minimize the civilian
casualties. This air support from NATO allowed Libya rebel forces to
topple Gaddafi's regime and eventually kill him.

Conclusion:

[The failure of Western policy in Libya was not the decision to
intervene to prevent a massacre in Benghazi and to help the Libyans with
their **only viable defence** against Qaddafi, namely **toppling the
dictator**]{.underline}. The failure was in not committing what would
have been really quite limited resources mostly military and
intelligence trainers and advisers to stabilising the aftermath. Indeed
none other than President Obama appears to agree with this assessment.

"Had we not intervened, it's likely that Libya would be Syria," said the
President. His close adviser Ben Rhodes echoed this sentiment. So Obama
agrees that the intervention per se even with a messy outcome --- was
better than no intervention. [[In Libya]{.mark}, [**72** civilians were
killed]{.mark} **accidentally** [in NATO's entire campaign]{.mark},
[less than **one day's work** from Assad]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
estimates of the military casualties are being revised down all the
time. In Syria, 300,000 people and more are dead and the chaos has
opened the way to worse actors. (That Obama has elsewhere said the idea
that intervening earlier in Syria to support the moderates would have
resulted in a better outcome was "horseshit," can be safely put down the
political necessity of never admitting a mistake.)

On the other half of this argument that more needed to be done in the
aftermath Obama also agrees but says he "underestimated the need to come
in full force if you're going to do this." Obama ran for office against
the Iraq invasion in no small part highlighting the incompetence of the
Bush administration's reconstruction. The need for a post-war plan is
the most salient lesson of the Iraq experience. It seems unlikely this
came to Obama after 2011: the 2012 Election, where the President ran on
his record of extricating the U.S. from the Middle East, Iraq most
notably, serves as a much better explanation for why Obama would not
commit to Libya in a way that could be interpreted as "boots on the
ground".

Ultimately, the lesson of Libya is one that keeps being shown from
Afghanistan to Iraq to Bosnia: by refusing the small, early intervention
when allies would be easier to enlist, the U.S. ends up intervening at
much greater cost later, almost alone, and achieving a far less
desirable outcome.

The way we remember Libya suggests that the way we talk about America's
role in the world has changed, and not for the better. Americans are
probably more likely to consider the Libya intervention a failure
because the US was at the forefront of the NATO operation. So any
subsequent descent into conflict, presumably, says something about our
failure, which is something we'd rather not think about.

Outside of the foreign policy community, [politicians are usually
criticized for what they do abroad, rather than what they don't
do]{.underline}. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it,
"\[[Qaddafi]{.underline}\] [was not a threat to us]{.underline}
anywhere. [He was a threat to his own people, and that was about
it]{.underline}." [If the US had decided against intervention, Libya
would have]{.underline} likely [reverted to some noxious combination of
**dictatorship** and **insurgency**]{.underline}. [But we could have
**shirked responsibility**]{.underline} (a sort of inverse "pottery
barn" principle if you didn't break it, you don't have to fix it). We
could have claimed to have "done no harm," even though harm, of course,
would have been done.

[[It's easy]{.mark} for some [to suggest]{.mark} that Western
[interventionism is the problem]{.mark} here, [and the world would be
better off if the cries of]{.mark} the [civilians]{.mark} Gaddafi
slaughtered **[went ignored]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That's only an
argument that can be made from outside the Oval Office, but it is one
that has a broad political constituency. [To claim that Libya is a
"neo-con" failure]{.underline}, however, [is a **willful
misrepresentation**]{.underline} of neo-conservatism. [[Libya is a
disaster]{.mark} today as a result [not of]{.mark} Western [engagement
but **withdrawal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The worst lesson from the
Libyan debacle is: half-measures will almost always produce suboptimal
results.

There was a time when the United States seemed to have a perpetual bias
toward action. The instinct of leaders, more often than not, was to act
militarily even in relatively small conflicts that were remote from
American national security interests. Our country's tragic experience in
Iraq changed that. Inaction came to be seen as a virtue. And, to be
sure, inaction is sometimes virtuous. Libya, though, was not one of
those times.

**Libya was not an ad hoc, unilateral NATO invasion. The
[world]{.underline} called for action.**

With the Arabian Revolt sweeping the Middle East in early 2011, Libya's
turn came on February 17. Throwing off decades of fear, and not
bothering with peaceful demonstrations as Tunisia and Egypt had to free
themselves of tyranny, nor the Syrians who tried peaceful demonstrations
for six entire months, the Libyans went straight to armed rebellion, and
soon the city of Benghazi had been pried from the regime's grip and
become the de facto capital of the revolution. The Libyans had no
confidence in protests to alter the regime of Muammar el-Qaddafi. They
were right. The demented Colonel responded with a brutality that
included using fighter jetsagainst civilian areas. As the violence
escalated, on March 17 [the **U.N.** Security Council]{.underline}

Today is the 16th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, and Twitter is
alive with condemnations of the conflict --- countered by precious few
defenses. Yet I believed the Iraq War was just and proper in 2003, and I
still believe that today. When Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** condemned
the war during the 2015 primary campaign and [claimed]{.underline} that
[if Saddam was still in power we]{.underline} "[wouldn't have the
problems you have right now]{.underline}," I believed he was dead wrong.
As I argued then, from the moment Hussein took power until he was
deposed in 2003, [there were few greater **instruments of instability**
in the world than Saddam Hussein]{.underline}.

[Before he was allegedly]{.underline} "[contained]{.underline}"
[by]{.underline} constant, substantial [American military
deployments]{.underline}, [he invaded his neighbors, **gassed his
people**]{.underline}, [harbored and supported terrorists]{.underline},
[and was responsible for **not one but two**]{.underline} [of the
largest conventional military conflicts since World War II]{.underline}
--- [the **horrific** Iran--Iraq war and Operation Desert
Storm]{.underline}. Even after American containment efforts attempted to
lock into place and limit his malign reach, he was a prime supporter of
a deadly Palestinian suicide-bombing campaign that caused
proportionately more Israeli civilian casualties than American civilians
lost on 9/11, [he tried to **assassinate** an American
president]{.underline} --- George H. W. Bush --- and he routinely fired
on American pilots enforcing lawful no-fly zones. [He violated the Gulf
War cease-fire accords, interfered with weapons inspections, and hid
away **chemical weapons** by the thousands]{.underline}. [No, his WMD
program wasn't nearly as extensive]{.underline} as we thought, [but it
is **fiction** to believe his weapons were entirely gone]{.underline}.
Americans were injured by Saddam's chemicals during the war.

Moreover, it's easy to forget that [before]{.underline} Barack
[Obama's]{.underline} terrible [decision to withdraw]{.underline} in
2011, the Iraq War had been won. [Saddam was gone, the follow-on
insurgency had been **wiped-out**]{.underline} --- reduced to a few
hundred fighters scattered in a vast country --- and American and Iraqi
forces were masters of the battlefield. Joe Biden asserted that
Americans would look at Iraq as "one of the great achievements of this
administration." But [Obama withdrew **too soon**]{.underline}. He
squandered American gains, opened the door to unrestrained factionalism,
and left the fragile Iraqi nation vulnerable to renewed jihadist
assault.

And lest we think that non-intervention can't also carry a terrible
price, [we can't forget the Ba'athist **dictator** we left
alone]{.underline}, [Hafez al-Assad]{.underline}. [His nation was caught
up in]{.underline} the unrest and ferment of [the Arab
Spring]{.underline} --- a movement that began far from the Iraq War.
[His nation has since become a charnel house, and not only did it spark
a **refugee crisis**]{.underline} that has helped destabilize Europe,
[but it became the battleground where the remnants of al
Qaeda]{.underline} in Iraq [were reborn as ISIS,]{.underline} a
genocidal force that invaded a weakened Iraq from Syria, ignited yet
another phase of the Iraq War, and inspired a renewed wave of terror in
the Europe (and deadly attacks in the United States). [Non-intervention
does not]{.underline} always [bring peace, and the consequences can
include death on a **mass scale**]{.underline}.

While I believe [the war against Saddam represented the best of a series
of **bad options**]{.underline}, there is no question that our
intervention in Iraq was marred by two very costly mistakes. I've
already mentioned one --- Obama's premature withdrawal. The first
mistake belongs to George W. Bush and his commanders. It's by now quite
clear that we invaded with insufficient force to properly secure the
country and then compounded that error with early blunders after Saddam
was deposed. We not only failed to secure vast quantities of munitions,
we disbanded the Iraqi Army and then pursued seriously flawed
counterinsurgency tactics before righting the ship during the Surge.
Bush's mistakes made the war more costly. Obama's mistakes gave room for
the ISIS offensive and necessitated renewed American involvement in
Iraq. Both men eventually corrected their errors. Bush reinforced
American forces as his commanders changed tactics, and Obama put boots
back on the ground to help save Iraq from potential collapse.

More than 4,400 Americans died during Operation Iraqi Freedom, including
men I served with and loved like brothers. They died in a just cause
fighting enemies of this country --- a regime and an insurgency that in
different ways threatened vital American interests and actively sought
to kill Americans and our allies. [War is horrible]{.underline}, [and
the Iraq War is no exceptio]{.underline}n to that rule. Civilian
casualties were terrible and often intentionally inflicted by our
enemies to destabilize the country and inflame sectarian divisions.
[But]{.underline} I truly believe [the choice our nation faced was to
fight Saddam **then**]{.underline}, on our terms, **[or
later]{.underline}**, when he had recovered more of his nation's
strength and lethality. The United States is safer with him gone. It's
just a terrible shame that for a time we chose to throw away a victory
bought with the blood of brave men.

**Iraq's doing [way better]{.underline} now. The solution to incorrect
justifications is to conduct [careful analysis]{.underline}, not to
reject all action.**

As we consider further military action in Syria and elsewhere in the
Middle East, we cannot avoid assessing the Iraq War.

The Iraq War was controversial and polarizing. [Our sharply [divisive
debate]{.mark}]{.underline} about it [[can impair]{.mark} **[objective
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many label the Iraq War a
failure]{.underline}. **[They are wrong]{.underline}**.

The key question in assessing the Iraq War is what kind of Iraqi state
did the war produce? We have objective measures used to judge states
around the world to answer this question. What are the state's relations
with other states? Does it repress its population? Is it a dictatorship
or a democracy? What are its levels of prosperity, life expectancy and
infant mortality? [[By]{.mark} each of these [measures]{.mark}, [the
Iraq War was a **success**]{.mark} because the resulting Iraqi state is
**vastly better**]{.underline}.

**[Peace with other states]{.underline}**

[In 1980, Saddam [Hussein's Iraq attacked]{.mark}
**[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In 1990, it attacked
**[Kuwait]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In 1991, it attacked **[Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[Israel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Between
1993 and 2001, it attacked patrolling American aircraft. [[Since
the]{.underline}]{.mark} war and the [[overthrow]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Hussein in 2003, [[Iraq **has not attacked**]{.mark} another
state]{.underline}.

[No more systematic **military repression** of most of the
population]{.underline}

[[Hussein used Iraq's military to]{.mark} **violently** and
**[systematically repress]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Iraq's [Kurds and Shia
Arabs]{.mark}, even [using]{.mark} **[chemical weapons]{.mark}**
[against civilians]{.mark}]{.underline}. Kurds are about 16% of Iraq's
population and Shia Arabs are about 49%. [[The war
ended]{.underline}]{.mark} the systematic military [[repression
of]{.underline}]{.mark} this combined [[**65**% of Iraq's
population]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The freest system of government in the Arab world

[The war transformed Iraq from one of the world's most repressive states
into a state with the **freest system**]{.underline} of government in
the Arab world. The war began in 2003. [Since 2004, Iraq has had **seven
major elections**]{.underline}: the 2004 National Assembly Election; the
2005 Constitutional Referendum; the 2005, 2010 and 2014 Parliamentary
Elections; and the 2009 and 2013 Provincial Council elections. All have
been judged free and fair by international monitors. These seven
elections are more free and fair elections than the rest of the Arab
world has ever had. More than 11 million voted in both the 2010 and 2014
Parliamentary Elections. In 2014, 27 political parties won seats. No
other Arab state has been remotely as democratic, during this period or
over any other decade.

Higher income and life expectancy, and lower infant mortality

The other important objective measures used to assess states around the
world show that life has improved for Iraqi citizens. More Iraqis are
alive today than before the war.

World Bank data show that in 2002, the last year before the war, Iraq's
population was 24.94 million. In 2015, it was 36.42 million.

[[Iraqis are **living longer**]{.underline}]{.mark}. World Bank data
show that [in 2002, average life expectancy in Iraq was 68.94
years]{.underline}. [By 2015, it was 69.59 years]{.underline}. The data
show similar increases in life expectancy for both men and women.

[[**Infant mortality** has declined]{.mark} in Iraq]{.underline}. World
Bank data show that [in 2002, the infant mortality rate per 1,000 births
was 34.6]{.underline}. [By 2015, it was 26.5]{.underline}.

[[Iraqis are]{.mark} much [more]{.mark}
**[prosperous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. CIA World Factbook data show that
[in 2002, per capita GDP, measured in]{.underline} purchasing power
parity ([PPP]{.underline}) terms, [was \$2,400]{.underline}. [By
2013]{.underline}, the last year of this PPP data series, [it was
\$7,100]{.underline}. (Tradingeconomics.com data show a modest 3.4%
decline since 2013.)

[[None of this excuses the intel]{.mark}ligence [failure about]{.mark}
**[w]{.mark}**eapons of **[m]{.mark}**ass
**[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline}. [None of this suggests
that]{.underline} the [[we should]{.mark} not [use]{.mark} the **most
[careful analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [before deciding whether
to]{.underline} risk significant amounts of blood and treasure and
[invade or take other militarily action]{.underline}. None of this
suggests that Iraq is an easy place to live. Iraq's political and civic
institutions need to take big steps to reach Western standards.
Relations between Shia Arabs, Sunni Arabs and Kurds need significant
improvement. Iraq must defeat the remaining Islamic State forces in the
country and prevent other groups from committing similar violence.
Iranian influence in Iraq is undesirable and unhelpful.

[[Decisions]{.mark} concerning military action in the Middle East [are
**difficult** and **complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In making these
decisions, we should recognize that by important objective measures, the
Iraq War was a success -- a victory for America that resulted in a much
better Iraq.

**[! --- NATO Good --- AT: Interventions --- Afghanistan]{.underline}**

**NATO wasn't eager to intervene; the UN got them involved.**

An additional concern arose over the precedent invoking Article V could
set if U.S. authorities subsequently determined that the attack had
originated from within the U.S. homeland and not from abroad. The Bush
administration feared that the United States could then be asked to
intervene against domestic terrorist attacks in NATO treaty states in
the future. The Canadian chief of defense, who by happenstance found
himself in the room when NATO ambassadors began debating whether or not
to invoke Article V on Sept. 12, recalls the Americans "wanting to be
absolutely sure that it was an attack from outside the U.S.\[,\]" and
not a domestic terrorist act like the Oklahoma City bombing, before NATO
authorized any follow-on action. After confirming that the attacks
originated outside the United States, [it]{.underline} then
[took]{.underline} "**[substantial work]{.underline}**" on the part of
U.S. Ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns [to convince]{.underline} other
Bush administration [officials that having the NATO alliance formally
invoke the mutual defense clause was important]{.underline}.
Consequently, it was not until Oct. 4, 2001, that the North Atlantic
Council formally invoked Article V, paving the way for NATO allies to
send Airborne Early Warning and Control Force aircraft (AWACs) to patrol
U.S. skies and offer other assistance, such as intelligence sharing, to
Washington.

Although some NATO [allies]{.underline}, including Canada, Britain and
Germany, [chose]{.underline} early on [to contribute]{.underline}
special operations forces (SOF) and, later, other military assets to the
U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, which
lasted from 2001 to 2014), they did so **[independent]{.underline}** [of
NATO]{.underline} headquarters and command structures.

[Nor did NATO play any part in the creation of the International
Security Assistance Force]{.underline}, despite subsequently going on to
lead it for more than a decade. When the security assistance force was
announced at the Bonn Conference in December 2001, [it was done so under
the auspices of the **U.N**. Security Council, not the
alliance]{.underline}. [U.N. Security Council Resolution]{.underline}
1386 officially [mandated ISAF to]{.underline} "[assist the Afghan
Interim Authority]{.underline} in the maintenance of security in Kabul
and its surrounding areas." Responsibility for overseeing the original
5,000-person multinational force for the first six months was assigned
to the United Kingdom. Thereafter, ISAF's command rotated to a new lead
nation every six months, first to Turkey (July 2002-January 2003) and
then Germany (January 2003-August 2003).

By fall 2002, however, [it was becoming increasingly]{.underline} clear
[to nations contributing]{.underline} forces [to ISAF that the security
force would benefit from having NATO's military
headquarters]{.underline} in Mons, Belgium, [assume
responsibility]{.underline} for the force generation process needed to
sustain the Kabul-based operation. The difficulties ISAF's lead
countries experienced sourcing personnel to sustain the Kabul force,
coupled with the Pentagon's waning attention toward Afghanistan as it
prepared to invade Iraq in spring 2003, led Washington and its NATO
allies to conclude that the time had come for the alliance to take
charge of ISAF. Accordingly, on Aug. 11, 2003, NATO assumed command of
ISAF, marking the alliance's official entree into Afghanistan.

Yet while NATO would remain in charge of ISAF until the security force
was eventually stood down at the end of 2014, [ISAF remained a
NATO-led]{.underline} ([as opposed to a purely NATO]{.underline})
[force]{.underline}, [owing to the large number of **non-NATO**
countries]{.underline}---including Australia, Georgia, Jordan and the
Republic of Korea, each operating under its own rules of
engagement---that contributed personnel to the mission. Following the
conclusion of ISAF's operations in Afghanistan in December 2014, NATO
stood up a new mission, Resolute Support, focused on building Afghan
National Security Force (ANSF) sustainability. But, like its
predecessor, Resolute Support was a NATO-led mission, comprising both
NATO allies as well as non-NATO countries, and not an Article V

The end of a war is a time to reflect. So is a milestone anniversary
like the 20th anniversary of Sept. 11. Now, in September 2021, the two
are bound up together---the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, not
coincidentally, taking place in close proximity to the milestone
anniversary.

For Lawfare, the two events are also intimately tied to the history of
the site itself. Lawfare surely wouldn't exist but for the Sept. 11
attacks and the war in Afghanistan. The early years of the site were far
more concerned with issues arising out of that conflict than they were
with cybersecurity, disinformation, authoritarian populism and the other
issues that predominate on the site these days.

It is probably not possible to over-reflect on the withdrawal and the
anniversary. But [it is possible to draw the wrong
conclusions]{.underline} from reflections on what went wrong in the
Afghanistan war---which ended, as it began, with the Taliban in control
of the country. And with Afghanistan today facially seeming like
Afghanistan as it was on Sept. 11, it is possible to reflect one's way
to the conclusions that the invasion of Afghanistan was a mistake, that
it accomplished nothing and that Americans died in vain. It is possible
to conclude that any gains were ephemeral, that only the civilian
casualties and the policy blunders had lasting consequences, that 20
years of keeping the Taliban at bay was worth nothing and that the
destruction of al-Qaeda's base of operations was all an exercise in
squandered blood and treasure.

A great many sober, serious people have embraced these gloomy
conclusions---in some cases selectively, in many cases as a morose,
defeatist package. [The instinct to evaluate the war in binary terms is
understandable. People tend to think of wars as won or
lost]{.underline}. And watching the chaotic evacuation from Kabul, it
certainly didn't look like a win. It didn't even look like a stalemate.
It looked like a rout.

The final scorecard looks bad too. The vicious gambler played by George
C. Scott scoffs at the young pool shark played by Paul Newman in the
movie "The Hustler," for suggesting he had been way ahead in a game
against the world's best player before losing it all. "This game isn\'t
like football. Nobody pays you for yardage," the gambler says. "When you
hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your
money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way." By this
standard, certainly, the Taliban bested us. U.S. forces smashed them for
years, but at the end of the game, they have Afghanistan---and the
government the United States supported evaporated just like Paul
Newman's early lead.

Yet there is more to be said on behalf of America's two-decade-long
effort in Afghanistan than these crude analyses allow. [We certainly
don't mean to suggest that the war was a complete success. It was
not]{.underline}. Many Americans lost their lives fighting there (and
far more Afghans died), and the United States spent trillions in a vain
effort to build the Afghan state. [Yet]{.underline} here it's not just
the end point that matters but the nature of the curve that led to that
endpoint. And there's a great deal of area under the curve of the
Afghanistan war, area one shouldn't throw away lightly.

[The truth is that the war actually accomplished a **good
deal**]{.underline}---even if its most ambitious objectives remained
ever-elusive. [Far from a mistake, the invasion of Afghanistan to topple
the first Taliban regime was a **necessity**]{.underline} in the
post-Sept. 11 environment. Indeed, it's hard to imagine a successful
counterterrorism campaign in the years that followed Sept. 11 without
it. It played a decisive role in dismantling what had become a major and
persistent threat to American lives. [It provided for a long period of
imperfect but **nonmurderous**]{.underline} [government for many
Afghans, particularly **urban**, **minority** and **female
Afghans**]{.underline}. And it helped to facilitate a long period in
which successful foreign-based terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland
simply did not happen.

Whether one regards the war ultimately as a success or a failure, it is
important to tally its costs and benefits accurately. As people
currently seem to be tallying only its costs, we offer this post to
remind people of the complexity of assessing the Afghanistan war.

The Afghanistan Sanctuary

With two decades of water under the bridge, people often treat the Sept.
11 attacks as a bolt out of the blue to which the country responded by
reorganizing and militarizing its entire foreign policy and domestic
politics. [There's some truth in this story, but lost in it is just how
active and menacing al-Qaeda had become]{.underline} in the years
leading up to Sept. 11. Jihadists with ties to Afghanistan had bombed
the World Trade Center in 1993, killing six people and injuring over
1,000. [In 1996, al-Qaeda moved to Afghanistan and, in 1998, attacked
two U.S. embassies in East Africa---**killing hundreds** and wounding
thousands]{.underline}. [Two years later, it pulled off a bombing of a
U.S. warship]{.underline}, the USS Cole. Sept. 11 was really a
culmination of a mounting and increasingly deadly terrorism campaign
that no reasonable government would have continued to tolerate.

[It was a campaign run chiefly from Afghanistan, and it was possible
because the Taliban allowed al-Qaeda a haven]{.underline} from which it
could build a mini-army and launch attack after attack on its enemies.

So while the 20-year military intervention in Afghanistan may have been
a mistake, it was important, indeed essential, that the United States
remove the Taliban from power in 2001 and destroy al-Qaeda bases in
Afghanistan and Pakistan in the years that followed.

Indeed, Afghanistan became an important base for al-Qaeda well before
Sept. 11, and high-profile terrorist attacks were only one element of
the danger posed as a result. As long as al-Qaeda enjoyed a base in
Afghanistan, it could convene planning sessions and generate new plots:
The United States was always playing defense.

To get a sense of how important Afghanistan, and nearby facilities in
Pakistan, were to al-Qaeda, and the many facets that the Afghanistan
base played in al-Qaeda's overall operations and successes, it's useful
to examine the Sept. 11 plot in more detail:

Plotting began in earnest in late 1998 or early 1999, more than two
years before the attack occurred. The plot's mastermind, Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed, met with al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan to
pitch his novel idea for an attack. He received approval, and, crucially
from his point of view, gained the money and recruits that bin Laden had
available. These leaders and others enjoyed a sanctuary in Afghanistan
to oversee the operation with little interference. From there, they
could confer with one another, communicate with operatives, and
otherwise organize a broad movement even as they launched individual
attacks.

The cell leader, Mohammed Atta, had originally sought to fight in
Chechnya, and he ended up going to Afghanistan to train, along with
three friends who also went on to play important roles in the plot. Once
he arrived in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda leaders spotted Atta's leadership
abilities, discipline and fluency in English, redirecting him to the
Sept. 11 operation. As Atta's experience suggests, in Afghanistan
al-Qaeda was able to screen and vet would-be members, choosing the most
committed and skilled to join its own ranks while enabling others to
become more capable.

Indoctrination and control were important parts of what made the camps
so dangerous. Al-Qaeda was able to knit together a disparate array of
groups and causes---anti-Israel, anti-Egypt, anti-Russia, pro-Taliban
and so on---and make them a more unified movement. This was a tremendous
achievement for a movement that often fought (and would fight) more
within its ranks than against outsiders. In addition, it could take
committed activists like Atta and redirect them against the leadership's
preferred targets.

Al-Qaeda leaders later selected other plot members, the so-called
muscle, primarily from Saudi volunteers who had come to Afghanistan to
join the jihad.

The hijackers were not alone: Other jihadists, between 10,000 and
20,000, according to CIA estimates, received a wide array of training in
Afghanistan. Most volunteers learned basic weapons skills and had a
boot-camp-like experience to weed out the uncommitted, enabling them to
become more effective insurgents in various struggles around the Muslim
world. These al-Qaeda recruits would also help the Taliban in its
campaign to conquer all of Afghanistan. Indeed, during the invasion
after Sept. 11, U.S. soldiers found that the Arab jihadists, not the
Taliban, were the most ferocious and skilled fighters. A select few went
to camps that offered more advanced training, such as
counterintelligence, bomb-making and other skills useful for terrorism.
The muscle hijackers, for example, received the basic training to
determine their fitness and dedication and then received more advanced
training on how to hijack airplanes, disarm air marshals and use
explosives.

The training camps and Afghan experience proved instrumental for
insurgencies around the Muslim world. Figures like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
who later founded al-Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner of ISIS, went to
Afghanistan in the late 1990s and ran a training camp there.

Taken together, these factors made the pre-Sept. 11 haven in Afghanistan
devastatingly dangerous. Al-Qaeda could knit together a divided and
far-flung movement, train operatives to a lethal degree of proficiency,
and plan elaborate operations with little interference.

The Taliban sheltered al-Qaeda. Although the Taliban did not approve of
al-Qaeda's terrorism operations against the West, it did not stop them
either. Nor would the Taliban surrender bin Laden or other terrorists,
doubting the veracity of U.S. charges and being unwilling to lose face
with Taliban members and supporters by handing over to the infidels a
man they considered a good Muslim. Even today, Taliban officials deny
bin Laden's responsibility for Sept. 11.

The U.S. invasion quickly toppled the Taliban and proved devastating for
al-Qaeda. Some of those captured included leaders or others in the
movement who revealed ongoing plots, such as a plot to conduct multiple
terrorist attacks in Israel that was well along in its planning. The
movement lost its archipelago of training camps and with it the ability
to provide a wide array of training to thousands of recruits. Nor could
it indoctrinate as effectively, although advances in information
technology would pose new challenges. The movement also lost much of its
cadre fighting the U.S. invasion. Its leaders who survived found
themselves under constant pressure. Finally, the apparent overthrow of
the Taliban, which many jihadists deemed the one true Islamic
government, made many jihadists question the wisdom of al-Qaeda's
strategy.

Post-Sept. 11 Operations

Despite these many advances, al-Qaeda's terrorism threat didn't end with
the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 and the establishment of a new
government in Afghanistan. Key leaders, including bin Laden, dispersed
to Pakistan, and from there, they directed numerous operations against
the West and in the broader Middle East. Many of these involved
individuals who were recruited and trained before Sept. 11, but the
plans and operations continued in its aftermath with direction from
Pakistan. Notable attacks and plots included the 2002 Bali bombing and
2004 Madrid and 2005 London transportation bombings, which killed 202,
193 and 52 people, respectively. Bin Laden financed the Bali bombing,
and terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman noted in 2007 that "almost all major
incidents" in Europe had ties to al-Qaeda, with key operatives being
trained or based in Pakistan. In 2006, security officials disrupted a
plan to smuggle liquid explosives aboard airplanes flying from Europe to
the United States and Canada and detonate them midair, which would have
killed around 1,500 people according to prosecutors---a plot that also
had many of its origins in Pakistan.

Although the Pakistani government arrested many important al-Qaeda
leaders, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Afghanistan proved an
important base for the U.S. in going after the al-Qaeda haven in remote
parts of Pakistan, removing senior figures that Pakistan could not, or
would not, take out. The United States conducted numerous strikes on
al-Qaeda in the remote Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along
Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. According to analyses from the New
America Foundation, the first drone strike in Pakistan was conducted in
2004, and the dozens that occurred during the Bush administration would
grow to hundreds under President Obama, peaking in 2010 before declining
rapidly as the decade went on. The United States killed almost 100
leaders, as well as numerous lower-level cadre.

Many of these strikes were launched from bases in Afghanistan. To do
persistent surveillance and regular strikes, as was being done a decade
ago, bases in Afghanistan close to the FATA proved essential. In
addition, the most famous counterterrorism operation in U.S. history,
the killing of bin Laden, also depended on access to Afghanistan, the
base from which operatives launched their cross-border operation.

Over time, the strikes hollowed out al-Qaeda. As New America's David
Sterman contends, "\[T\]hese drone strikes have knocked out the ability
of Al Qaeda to plot from Pakistan." In addition to the death of
experienced commanders, if its leaders communicated in real time by
phone or by using the internet, they risked being located and killed.
Forced into hiding, the core was no longer able to orchestrate attacks
in the West. And although the drone strikes caused significant civilian
casualties, an analysis by Aqil Shah found that---contrary to common
mythology---they did not increase terrorist recruitment.

In other words, Afghanistan was essential to al-Qaeda in the years
before Sept. 11, and depriving al-Qaeda of the use of it was,
consequently, a post-Sept. 11 necessity. Less well understood,
Afghanistan became an important base of operations for ongoing U.S.
counterterrorism activity in the decades that followed, particularly in
the critical period in which U.S. forces were able to reduce the
once-menacing organization to a husk of itself. These are both major
successes of the Afghanistan operation. Few people imagined in the
period immediately after Sept. 11 that the United States would go two
decades without a second major homeland attack emanating from abroad.
That accomplishment simply cannot be separated from the decision to go
into Afghanistan and stay there a good long while. Whether it can be
sustained in the absence of U.S. forces on the ground there remains to
be seen.

The Edifice of American Counterterrorism

There's a legal aspect to this point as well: The entire legal edifice
of post-Sept. 11 U.S. counterterrorism policy was bound up with the war
in Afghanistan. That is, because the enemy was in Afghanistan, U.S.
administrations needed a legal framework that allowed U.S. forces to
operate in Afghanistan. Because suspects were not reachable by
traditional law enforcement means, the Bush, Obama and Trump
administrations required an operating framework that engaged military
authorities. That framework was the war in Afghanistan. And it's a bit
difficult to imagine, even in retrospect, what that framework might have
looked like without the war.

It is, to be sure, perverse to suggest that the Afghanistan war was
necessary so that the United States could have the 2001 Authorization
for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) and the rules and authorities that
flowed from it. Laws authorize wars, after all, not the other way
around. It is also not quite accurate. The AUMF did not, after all,
require the invasion of Afghanistan; it merely authorized it. The
statute's broad operative language, which does not mention Afghanistan
and operated worldwide, could have supported---and did, in fact,
support---other military activity, or it could have supported no
military activity at all, as some AUMFs historically have done. Yet it
is safe to say that the AUMF, passed in the immediate wake of Sept. 11
with policymakers eyeing the Afghan sanctuary, presumed that the coming
military action would take place in Afghanistan. It seems unlikely it
would have been passed had the Bush administration not envisioned an
attack on that country imminently on its passage.

So try to imagine, for a moment, that the Bush administration had not
headed in that direction---as so many analysts, with the hindsight of
two decades, now think would have been wiser. What would the combined
strategic and legal framework for counterterrorism have looked like?

One possibility is that it might have looked very much as it did.
Congress might have passed an AUMF like the one it did, in fact, pass;
it just would have been used more sparingly, less ambitiously---for the
occasional spree of air strikes, or special operations forces raids.
American forces still would have the statutory authority to do all the
things they did that were so effective in counterterrorism. They just
would have done them without a long-term presence in Afghanistan. But
this scenario raises a significant obstacle to the lethal force and
detention aspects of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism operations. Without
the bona fide armed conflict in Afghanistan and elsewhere, the American
invocation of law of armed conflict authorities would have depended (as
they now, in fact, depend) solely on the claim that episodic violent
engagements between the United States and al-Qaeda suffice to create a
real armed conflict. That has always been a hotly disputed claim, even
in the U.S. court system. So the no-invasion scenario would have made it
significantly harder, in practice, to legally justify detention,
military commissions and possibly even air strikes.

But there's another possibility too. The rejection of "forever war" in
Afghanistan is not, after all, an argument for more limited forever
wars. It is an argument against protracted military commitments at all.
If we project that Congress and the Bush administration in 2001 shared
that skepticism, so in vogue today, we are left with the probability
that there would have been no reason for them to pass a broad AUMF in
the first place. If America was not going to invade Afghanistan to deal
with the entrenched al-Qaeda presence there, it probably wouldn't have
bothered to deal with lesser presences such as jihadists in Somalia,
Yemen or other countries. It therefore would have needed the legal
architecture policymakers put in place---on either the military or
covert sides of the ledger.

So one possibility when analysts retrospectively reject the war in
Afghanistan is that they are actually proposing to throw out a large
portion of the legal edifice of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism policy.
That has implications well beyond Afghanistan itself. Under the AUMF,
remember, the United States conducted drone strikes in Yemen, crushed
ISIS, and killed hundreds of al-Qaeda operatives in Pakistan. It
detained operatives around the world. It's fair to ask those who
casually now assert that the war was a mistake: Is the rejection of the
war in Afghanistan a rejection of that entire military approach to
counterterrorism, or is it merely a rejection of that approach coupled
with an invasion and long-term presence in Afghanistan? The answer to
this question is surely different from analyst to analyst. But those who
mean the former should answer the question of what combined
strategic-legal approach they imagine the Bush administration should
have adopted in the war's place. And those who mean the latter would do
well to specify what kind of conflict they imagine having taken place in
the absence of the underlying war in Afghanistan.

We are not suggesting there are no possible answers to these questions.
One might imagine a more purely law-enforcement-based post-Sept. 11
response with limited uses of force under, say, a narrower AUMF. One
could also imagine a legal approach similar to the one the U.S. took,
only used less aggressively---or with a briefer stay in Afghanistan.
Moreover, as is true today, alternatives to basing and access in
Afghanistan did exist. The United States has launched drone attacks from
bases in Pakistan in the past, but as relations soured the United States
was expelled from these bases. As the United States left Kabul, it
launched a drone strike from the United Arab Emirates against the ISIS
branch in Afghanistan.

But these questions do require answers. It will not do to pocket the
gains of the Afghanistan war as though they were given and tally only
the costs. Giving up the war means giving up the gains as well.

And those gains were not all military, and they are not all counted in
enemy fighters captured or killed. It has become an empty talking point
to mention that [millions of Afghan girls attended school after the
Taliban's ouster, and thousands of women went on to university and to
jobs outside the home, that religious minorities like the Shiite Hazara
population enjoyed **greater rights**, and that soccer stadiums were not
used for public executions]{.underline}. It is certainly true that human
rights gains in Afghanistan, however real, were not the purpose of the
mission---and that they cannot ultimately be the metric by which the
mission gets evaluated. Yet if one is counting the yardage of gains and
loss, these human rights improvements are not negligible either. [Such
collateral improvements to the human rights and lives of **millions of
people**]{.underline} [are no more to be ignored than]{.underline} the
[collateral damage]{.underline} to individuals in errant military
operations. [It is **simply a fact** that]{.underline} over 20 years,
[the United States]{.underline} made itself safer by
[improv]{.underline}ing [life for millions of Afghans]{.underline}.

becomes necessary. 137

I mean that [[what **IR is**]{.mark} **or is not** [is not]{.mark}
**nearly [as important]{.mark}** [as what it
**achieves**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So the question should not be whether
IR is scientific, but rather, how scientific does it need to be to get
the job done? To this, there are many answers, but I suggest a line of
reasoning: the scientific method in the most general sense is useful in
helping to explain how and why, all else equal, causal processes work.
Put differently, [[if we want to know]{.mark} **how and [wh]{.mark}y**
some [states **go to war**]{.mark}]{.underline} and others do not, [[it
would be]{.mark} **more [useful]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[in the sense

analyze]{.mark} **historical [cases]{.mark}
systematically**]{.underline} than it would be to consult with a shaman
or use a crystal ball to obtain an answer. This is not say that there is
not an important role for textual interpretation in the process of
studying war and other international phenomena. Indeed, I elsewhere
argue that interpretation of historical texts is crucial to making valid
claims about wars.47 But the main point here is that interpretation is a
means toward an end, namely, the process of coping with the world via
human experience. Toward that end, interpretation is necessary and
useful, but it is not the end itself.

A second point is that there is clearly a pragmatic and justifiable need
for certain types of quantitative methods, namely, statistics, though
not necessarily formal models, in some segments of IR. Taking a simple
example for illustrative purposes, if one wished to study the effect of
speed limits on motor vehicle fatalities, the use of aggregate data
statistically analyzed would be far superior to standing on the corner
waiting for an accident to observe or reading several diary accounts of
individual accidents. The key point here, however, is not that
statistical methods are inherently better, or more "rigorous" than any
other type of method. Rather, [[the use of]{.mark} **statistically
analyzed [data]{.mark}** to find answers to problems]{.underline} of
highway fatalities [[creates **knowledge** that]{.underline}]{.mark} if
properly applied, [**would [alleviate]{.mark}** ["concrete]{.mark}
**human [woes]{.mark},"** which is to say it would help to save lives.
[That is **pragmatic**]{.mark} **political
[science]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

48 What Is a Problem?

Many political scientists believe in the idea of having a "problem
orientation" for the field. For example, Atul Kohli asserts that there
is a strong consensus among leading experts "that comparative politics
is very much a problem-driven field of study." "What motivates the best
comparative politics research are puzzles of real-world significance,"
writes Kohli, in "The Role of Theory in Comparative Politics: A
Symposium."49 Similarly, Ian Shapiro, responding to the question of what
would be a better alternative than RCT asks the question: "What is the
phenomenon to be explained?... The formulation of alternative
explanations, in other words, should be a problem-driven activity."50
This is clearly consistent with Deweyan pragmatism; in fact, it is
inherently pragmatist. "A Deweyan pragmatic approach to political
inquiry," writes Maurice Meilleur, "would transform political science
from a discipline, based on a set of methods, into a profession, based
on a set of problems."51 But what, more specifically, is a "problem
orientation?" First, it is clear that Kohli and his colleagues mean an
empirically driven problem orientation. That is, the study of [[politics
should be driven by **empirical**, **not theoretical**]{.mark}, or
**methodological [problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Careful not to push
this point too far, a Deweyan pragmatist would suggest that theorization
is an important activity, but it must not lose its link to problems of
human experience, which is to say empirical problems. However, Kohli and
others advocating an empirically driven problem orientation have little
to say about how to identify and value problems. After all, there is a
limitless supply of political problems only a fraction of which can be
studied.

In response, I would argue that some problems are more significant to
the detection and response to human suffering and thus more deserving of
study, than others. This is itself a tricky ethical problem, for who is
to say what is or is not a "real problem?" One reader of this manuscript
suggested that "What is really going on here, when one scratches the
analytical surface, is not that IR theorists aren\'t discussing
problems; it\'s that they are discussing problems that the author does
not feel are worthy of attention. But why should we accept that the
author\'s "problems" are more important or privileged? Why does the
author get to decide what a "real" problem is?" This is a good question
but it is a misreading of the argument. Nowhere does Dewey or this
author imply that any individual could or should decide or dictate which
problems matter and which do not. To the contrary, the question of "who
decides" is a public deliberation problem, a subject Dewey addressed
exhaustively in his classic The Public and Its Problems.52 According to
Dewey, problems are the direct outcome of a public\'s determination of
its common good. A full analysis of how this works, or in some cases,
fails to work in practice is beyond the scope of this article. But it is
important to note that there is no argument here for the privileging of
one private individual\'s notion of what constitutions "real problem"
versus that of another. That is for the public to decide.

Human Woe and Issues That Matter

The final point to be made about reconstruction stems directly from the
previous discussion: some problems matter more than others with regard
to the alleviation of concrete human suffering. Which issues matter the
most in our world? Ultimately, per Dewey\'s political philosophy touched
on above, that is for the public to decide. Assuming that there ever
could be a "common good," we can hypothesize that [[people might
**choose** to **focus on**]{.mark} issues]{.underline} that affect them
daily, issues [such as **climate change**, **poverty**]{.underline},
health care, education, [**racism**, and **sexism**]{.underline}, as
well as **[[war]{.mark} and peace]{.underline}**, all [[issues that are
of]{.mark} **grave [importance]{.mark}** [to
**humanity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. IR, especially in its American form,
with its disproportionate emphasis on global security and great power
war, has given scant attention to too many other issues, and when
attention is given to the "lesser" topics, they are relegated to
sub-sub-specializations within the discipline, "Gender and IR," for
instance. More **[[problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
standpoint of pragmatism, [[the **approach**]{.mark}**-driven

[with which **paradigm** has scored]{.mark} **more [points]{.mark}** [in

**DeBoer '16** \[Fredrik; March 15th; Ph.D. from Purdue

I could be wrong about the short-term dangers, and the stakes are
incredibly high. But in the end we're left with the same old question:
[[what tactics]{.underline}]{.mark} will [**actually [work]{.mark}** [to
secure a **better world?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

In a sharp, sober piece about the meaning of left-wing political
violence in the 1970s, Tim Barker writes "If you can't acknowledge
radical violence, radicals are reduced to mere victims of repression,
rather than political actors who made definite tactical choices under
given political circumstances." The problem, as Barker goes on to imply,
is those tactical choices: [[in]{.mark} **today's
[America]{.mark}**]{.underline} they will essentially
[[never]{.underline}]{.mark} break on the side of [**armed
[opposition]{.mark}** [against **the state**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
government knows everything about you, I'm sorry to say, your movements
and your associations and the books you read and the things you buy and
what you're saying to the people you communicate with. That's simply on
the level of information before we even get to the state's incredible
capacity to inflict violence.

Look, the world has changed. The relative military capacity of regular
people compared to establishment governments has changed, especially in
fully developed, technology-enabled countries like the United States.
The Czar had his armies, yes, but the Czar's armies depended on manpower
above and beyond everything else. The fighting was still mostly
different groups of people with rifles shooting at each other.
[[If]{.mark} tomorrow [you]{.mark} could [**rally** as many]{.mark}
people [as the **Bolsheviks**]{.mark}]{.underline} had at their
revolutionary peak, [[you're still]{.mark} left [in a world of
**F-15s**, **drones**, and]{.mark} **cluster
[bombs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And that's to say nothing of the fact
that establishment governments in the developed world can rely on the
numbing agents of capitalist luxuries and the American dream to damper
revolutionary enthusiasm even among the many millions who have been
marginalized and impoverished. [[This]{.mark} just [isn't **1950s
Cuba**]{.mark}]{.underline}, guys. It's just not. In a very real way,
[modern [tech]{.mark}nology **effectively [lowers]{.mark}** the [odds of
**armed**]{.mark} **political [revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a
country like the United States [[to **zero**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
so much the worse for us.

[[This **isn't fatalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It doesn't mean there's
no hope. [It means that [there is **little alt**]{.mark}**ernative**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}organization, to changing minds
through **[committed [political action]{.mark}]{.underline}** and using
the available nonviolent means to create change: a concert of grassroots
organizing, labor tactics, and partisan politics. Those things aren't
exactly likely to work, either, but they're a hell of a lot more
plausible than us dweebs taking the Pentagon. Bernie Sanders isn't
really a socialist, but he's a social democrat that moves the
conversation to the left, and if people are dedicated and committed to
organizing, the local, state, and national candidates he inspires will
move it further to the left still. You got any better suggestions?

Listen, commie nerds. My people. I love you guys. I really do. And I
want to build a better world. Not incrementally, either, but with the
kind of sweeping and transformative change that is required to fix a
world of such deep injustice. But [[seriously: **none of us**
are]{.mark} ever [going to take]{.mark} to **the
[barricades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And it's a good thing, too, because
we'd probably find a way to shoot in the wrong direction. I can't
dribble a basketball without falling down. American socialism is largely
made up of bookish dreamers. I love those people but they're not for
fighting. And even if you have a particular talent for combat, you're
looking at fighting the combined forces of [Google, Goldman Sachs, and
the defense industry]{.underline}. Violence is hard. Soldiering is hard.
[[In an era of]{.mark} **the [NSA]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **military
[robots]{.mark}**[, it's]{.mark}]{.underline} really, [**really
[hard]{.mark}**[. "Should we condone]{.mark} **revolutionary
[violence?"]{.mark}** [is **dorm**]{.mark} **room**[, pass-the-bong
**conversation**]{.mark} **fodder**]{.underline}, of precisely the moral
and intellectual weight of "should we torture a guy if we know there's a
bomb and we know he knows where it is and we know we can stop it if we
do?" It's built on absurd hypotheticals, propped up by the power of
anxious machismo, and [[undertaken to no]{.mark} **practical [political
end]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's understandable. I get it, I really do.
But it's got nothing to do with us. The only way forward is the grubby,
unsexy work of building coalitions and asking people to climb on board.

[**Any [violent insurgency]{.mark}** [against the]{.mark} American
Corporate [State is sure to **fail**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and will
**only**]{.mark} serve to [enhance]{.mark} the **state\'s

both cell based (Weathermen Underground, Black Panthers, Aryan Nations
etc.) and leaderless (Earth Liberation Front, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, etc.) is that they are attempting to attack the
system [using the same tactics [the]{.mark} American Corporate [State
has]{.mark} **already [mastered]{.mark}**[: terror and
**psy**]{.mark}**chological [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**[. The]{.mark}
American Corporate [State]{.mark}]{.underline} attained primacy through
the effective application of terror and psychological operations.
Therefore, it [[has]{.mark} **far [more]{.mark}** [skill]{.mark} and
experience in the use of these tactics [than **any upstart**
could]{.mark} **ever [hope]{.mark}** [to attain. This makes the]{.mark}
American Corporate [State **impervious** to]{.mark} traditional
**[insurgency]{.mark} tactics**.]{.underline}

\- Political Activism and the ACS Counterinsurgency Apparatus

[[The]{.mark} American Corporate [State employs]{.mark} a **full-time
[counterinsurgency]{.mark}** [infrastructure with resources]{.mark} that
are [**unimaginable** to]{.mark} most would be
[insurgents]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quite simply, [**violent
[insurgents]{.mark}** [have **no idea**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of just
[how **powerful** the foe]{.mark} actually [is.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Violent insurgents typically start out as peaceful, idealistic,
political activists. Whether or not political activists know it, even
with very mundane levels of political activity, they are engaging in low
intensity conflict with the ACS.

The U.S. military classifies political activism as "low intensity
conflict." The scale of warfare (in terms of intensity) begins with
individuals distributing anti-government handbills and public gatherings
with anti-government/anti-corporate themes. In the middle of the
conflict intensity scale are what the military refers to as Operations
Other than War; an example would be the situation the U.S. is facing in
Iraq. At the upper right hand side of the graph is global thermonuclear
war. What is important to remember is that the military is concerned
with ALL points along this scale because they represent different types
of threats to the ACS.

Making distinctions between civilian law enforcement and military
forces, and foreign and domestic intelligence services is no longer
necessary. After September 11, 2001, [**[all]{.mark} national security
[assets]{.mark}** [would be brought to bear against **any**]{.mark}
**U.S. insurgency [movement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, the
U.S. military established NORTHCOM which designated the U.S. as an
active military operational area. [[Crimes]{.underline}]{.mark}
involving the loss of corporate profits [[will]{.mark} increasingly [be
treated as]{.mark} **acts of [terrorism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} could
[garner]{.mark} anything from a local law enforcement response to
activation of regular **[military forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Most of what is commonly referred to as "political activism" is viewed
by the corporate state\'s counterinsurgency apparatus as a useful and
necessary component of political control.

Letters-to-the-editor\...

Calls-to-elected-representatives\...

Waving banners\...

"Third" party political activities\...

Taking beatings, rubber bullets and tear gas from riot police in free
speech zones\...

Political activism amounts to an utterly useless waste of time, in terms
of tangible power, which is all the ACS understands. Political activism
is a cruel guise that is sold to people who are dissatisfied, but who
have no concept of the nature of tangible power. Counterinsurgency teams
routinely monitor these activities, attend the meetings, join the groups
and take on leadership roles in the organizations.

It\'s only a matter of time before some individuals determine that
political activism is a honeypot that accomplishes nothing and wastes
their time. The corporate state knows that some small percentage of the
peaceful, idealistic, political activists will eventually figure out the
game. At this point, the clued-in activists will probably do one of two
things; drop out or move to escalate the struggle in other ways.

If the clued-in activist drops his or her political activities, the ACS
wins.

But what if the clued-in activist refuses to give up the struggle?
Feeling powerless, desperation could set in and these individuals might
become increasingly radicalized. [[Because]{.mark} the corporate
state\'s counterinsurgency [operatives]{.mark} have [**infiltrated**
most]{.mark} **political [activism]{.mark}** [groups]{.mark}, the
**radicalized [members]{.mark}** [will be]{.mark} **easily

KL\]

THE COUNTERFACTUAL: A COMPLETE U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM EUROPE

[The **counterfactual scenario** examined in this article]{.underline},
the one favored by restraint scholars, [is that the United States
officially exits from NATO and fully withdraws]{.underline} its forces
and military units from Europe, including the roughly 65,000 active-duty
personnel under the U.S. European Command, 2,000 reservists, 16,350
Department of Defense civilian personnel, and around 930 personnel
assigned to NATO's Command Structure. The United States also would no
longer continue its rotational presence of air, land, and sea forces
throughout Europe as part of the European Deterrence Initiative (which
includes a U.S. armored brigade combat team and a combat aviation
brigade).33 In addition, the United States would remove all its
European-based nuclear capabilities.

Although it is difficult to envision a full U.S. pullback from Europe in
the short term, it is hardly implausible in the longer term in light of
both domestic and international dynamics. Structural trends in the
international system--- most notably, the rise of China relative to the
United States and the growing strategic centrality of the Asia-Pacific
region---have caused the United States to downgrade the importance of
Europe in its grand strategy.34 Moreover, the United States pursued an
isolationist grand strategy for most of its history; leaving Europe
would simply be a return to its traditional foreign policy baseline
regarding the region. And significantly, there is every indication that
Trump tapped into, rather than created, the political momentum for
curtailing the United States' security presence overseas. Prior to Trump
becoming president, U.S. public opinion in favor of the United States
disengaging from the world had already increased substantially.35
Reflecting these public attitudes, in the early 2010s, a number of
Republican fiscal hawks and liberal Democrats ramped up their calls for
eliminating the U.S. presence in Europe.36 Likewise, according to a 2011
poll, 65 percent of the U.S. public favored scaling back U.S. military
commitments to reduce the country's debt.37

A U.S. decision to actively withdraw from Europe is not the only means
by which this outcome could occur; it could also unfold passively with
Europe and [the United States]{.underline} [drift]{.underline}ing
further [apart over **many years**, eventually reaching a point where
NATO has been **hollowed out**]{.underline} [and exists essentially in
name only]{.underline}. In fact, because of rising doubts about the
long-term credibility and robustness of the U.S. commitment, many
prominent European policymakers and security analysts have concluded
that Europe should rely less on the transatlantic partnership and
bolster its capacity for autonomous action.38 As then President of the
European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker stated in 2016, "If Europe does
not take care of its own security, nobody else will do it for us."39
[Yet, as we show]{.underline} in the next two sections, two
**[overarching constraints]{.underline}** jointly [limit the capacity of
Europeans to achieve strategic autonomy]{.underline}: Europe's strategic
cacophony and profound capability shortfalls that will take a long time
to close.

Europe's Strategic Cacophony

The first two decades after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the
collapse of the Soviet Union constituted an era of strategic exception,
characterized by the absence of a major conventional security threat.
During this period in which European states lacked any semblance of a
unifying threat, wide discrepancies emerged in their national threat
assessments. The threat perceptions of European defense policymakers
shifted away from conventional state threats to nonconventional ones
such as terrorism, instability in the Mediterranean area, migration, the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and failed states.40

Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014 shattered the
long-held assumption that the European territorial status quo would not
be upset via the use of military force. Yet, far from bringing Europe
together, Russia's assertiveness only further deepened Europeans'
profound divergences of threat perceptions, with growing disagreements
among Europeans about how to prioritize Russia versus other
challenges.41

Below we provide a bottom-line assessment and systematic coding of
national threat perceptions across twenty-nine European countries. We
include all countries that are members of the EU or NATO, or both,
except for Turkey and seven countries that have GDPs smaller than \$25
billion: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Iceland,
Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, and Montenegro. We identify where the
threat assessment of each country falls across five categories: (1)
Russia is unimportant or not a threat; (2) Russia is a threat, but other
threats are more significant; (3) Russia and other threats have roughly
equal significance; (4) Russia is the highest threat, but other threats
also are significant; and (5) Russia is the dominant threat by far.

To produce these codings, we adopted a nested approach. First, we coded
the threat evaluations of these countries made by eighteen experts who
contributed to a recent comprehensive examination of European defense
policies.42 To double-check our codings, we consulted all eighteen
authors to ensure that our understanding of each country corresponded
with theirs.43 Second, we looked at all available government reports
that provide a national assessment of the regional threat environment
and prioritize among different threats. In particular, we examined the
national security/defense/military strategies, the intelligence threat
assessments, the analyses of particular threats (e.g., cyberthreats and
terrorism), and regional/geographic analyses of all twenty-nine European
states in our study. In total, we examined eighty-seven official
documents and reports. (Online appendix A provides a full list of these
sources; they are referenced in the footnotes by document number as
indicated in this appendix.)44

![Table Description automatically
generated](media/image5.png){width="2.694057305336833in"
height="1.526816491688539in"}

For most states, the combination of these first two sources provided
enough information to reliably code national threat assessments. But for
others, they were insufficient because official threat assessments were
somewhat ambiguous. For these countries, a third step was thus to
interview senior foreign policy and defense officials to obtain
additional information and gain further clarity into the national threat
assessment.45 We conclude that Europe is characterized by strategic
cacophony (see table 1). Whereas some states rank terrorism and
instability in the Mediterranean region at the top of their threat
assessments---with little, if any, threat perception vis-à-vis
Russia---others identify Russia as their overarching security concern,
while largely ignoring the diffuse threats on Europe's southern shores.
Between these two extremes, different countries and groups of countries
exhibit varying perceptions of their core security challenges. Overall,
the continent is marked by profoundly divergent threat assessments and
ensuing strategic priorities.

The varied threat perceptions of European states have been shaped by a
complex mix of history, politics, and geography, as well as by changes
in the regional strategic environment. Details on our country codings
are discussed below, according to category of threat prioritization.

RUSSIA IS UNINMPORTANT OR NOT A THREAT

Most smaller powers in Western and Southern Europe prioritize as their
main sources of concern transnational terrorism, WMD proliferation, and
instability across the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) and the
resulting flows of migrants (see table 1).46 By contrast, ever since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, which was perceived as the overarching
conventional and nuclear threat during the Cold War, Russia has little,
if any, significance in their national threat assessments.47 Indeed,
some of these countries, such as Italy or Spain, have long advocated for
sustained engagement with Moscow.48

Likewise, two countries that do not share the same level of anxiety held
by most Central and Eastern European countries vis-à-vis Russia are
Hungary and Bulgaria. Considering the threat of conventional war to be
minimal, and given their strong ties with Moscow, they instead
prioritize terrorism, migration flows, WMD proliferation, and
cyberattacks.49

RUSSIA IS A THREAT, BUT OTHER THREATS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT

Other countries also prioritize transnational terrorism, regional
turmoil around Europe and the MENA, cyberattacks, and illegal migration,
but display higher threat perceptions of Russia than do states in the
first category (see table 1). They perceive Russia as a threat, but
nonetheless see other threats as relatively higher sources of concern.50

Croatia's threat assessment, for instance, focuses largely on challenges
such as terrorism, regional instability, migration, and the
proliferation of WMD.51 Still, in a veiled yet clear reference to
Russia's influence in the Western Balkans, Croatian policymakers put
greater emphasis than the first group of countries on threats such as
"non-conventional, asymmetric, and cyber actions" that are "planned,
permanent and systematic activities supported by state bodies."52

France is the only major power in this group. Its threat perceptions
revolve, foremost, around transnational terrorism and regional
instability in Europe's southern periphery. French policymakers consider
jihadist terrorism as "the most immediate" threat,53 especially in light
of the steep rise in the number of terrorist attacks on French soil
since the mid-2010s.54 France is also concerned with the proliferation
of conventional and WMD-related technology,55 as well as with regional
instability in Northern Africa and the Middle East.56 The French
government puts particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, where, partly
because of its postcolonial history, France retains "a direct security
and economic interest" in the stability of the region.57 Accordingly,
although France has displayed growing concerns vis-à-vis Russia's
assertiveness after the Ukrainian crisis,58 other threats remain more
significant.

RUSSIA AND OTHER THREATS HAVE ROUGHLY EQUAL SIGNIFICANCE

The United Kingdom and Germany---together with less powerful Western
European states (Belgium and the Netherlands) and Denmark---consider
Russia and other security challenges to be equivalent threats (see table
1).

British policymakers include both Russia and terrorism in the UK's "Tier
One" category of risks (in terms of probability and impact).59 In light
of Russia's increasingly assertive behavior, they assess that the "risks
from statebased threats have both grown and diversified,"60 which is why
the UK "cannot rule out the possibility that \[Moscow\] may feel tempted
to act aggressively against NATO Allies."61 According to a UK former
senior defense official, the main areas of concerns vis-à-vis Moscow are
(1) Russia's military modernization, including the development and
deployment of weapon systems that can threaten the UK's NATO allies; (2)
Russia's gray-zone activities (e.g., subversion, use of proxies,
cyberattacks, use of military-grade nerve agents for targeted killings);
and (3) Moscow's activities outside Europe, such as in parts of Africa,
but, most notably, in the Middle East.62

Yet, at the same time, the UK sees transnational terrorism as an equally
substantial threat. British policymakers have perceived a rising threat
from terrorism since at least the 2005 London bombings and the
subsequent wave of terrorist attacks that swept across Europe and the UK
in the 2010s.63 In their eyes, "ISIL \[the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant\], Al Qa'ida, and affiliates remain committed to attacking UK and
Western targets" and continue to be "the most direct and immediate
threat" to the UK's "domestic security."64 In 2015, the British
government therefore decided to increase its counterterrorism spending
by 30 percent, including £2 billion of new investment in the
capabilities of UK special forces.65

Germany, too, considers terrorism and Russia to be threats of roughly
equal significance. German policymakers view terrorist attacks as "the
most immediate challenge" to their country's domestic security.66 In
2018, Germany's minister of interior stated that the security situation
concerning terrorism continued to be "very threatening."67 For Germany,
transnational terrorism is tied closely to regional stability in the
MENA and to the existence of failing states in which terrorist
organizations can thrive.68 Accordingly, it seeks to bolster cooperation
with partners in Africa and the Middle East to train their security
forces so as "to create a bulwark against international terrorism."69

At the same time, Germany sees Russia as "openly calling the European
peace order into question with its willingness to use force to advance
its own interests and to unilaterally redraw borders guaranteed under
international law, as it has done in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine."70
According to the ministry of defense, "this has far-reaching
implications for security in Europe and thus for the security of
Germany."71 A comparison of Germany's 2006 White Paper and of the
subsequent strategic documents (i.e., the 2011 Defense Policy Guidelines
and the 2016 White Paper) highlights the enhanced focus of the German
armed forces on territorial defense since the Russia-Georgia war and
Moscow's landgrab in Crimea.72

Interviews with current and former German officials reveal that the
foreign affairs, interior, and defense ministries have different threat
assessments. Whereas the first two consider terrorism to be Germany's
main security challenge, the latter prioritizes Russia as the main
threat.73 Across the German government, terrorism and Russia ultimately
emerge as being roughly equally significant threats.

Smaller Western European powers such as the Netherlands and Belgium
similarly consider Russia and other threats to be largely equivalent.74
Likewise, in Northern Europe, Danish policymakers rank terrorism and
regional instability in the MENA---which can provide fertile ground for
terrorists--- relatively higher than do their Nordic neighbors in their
threat assessments.75 At the same time, Russia is seen as posing "a
significant security challenge,"76 and its military buildup and
increased military exercises in the region, as well as its use of
gray-zone operations, are considered "a clear challenge" to Denmark.77
The Danish government thus sees Russia, terrorism, and regional
instability in the MENA as equally signiªcant threats.

RUSSIA IS THE HIGHEST THREAT; OTHER THREATS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT

Several Northern and Eastern European states have displayed mounting
threat perceptions of Russia---which they see as their major
threat---especially since the Russo-Georgian War and, increasingly, the
Ukrainian crisis (see table 1). Yet, they continue to share security
concerns vis-à-vis terrorism, regional instability in the MENA, and
illegal migration.

In Northern Europe, Norway and Sweden emphasize both the "long belt of
instability" to the south of Europe and terrorism as signiªcant national
security concerns.78 Yet, most notably since the 2010s, Russia has
returned to the top of their national security concerns. In particular,
they highlight the development of Russia's anti-access/area-denial
(A2/AD) capabilities, its numerous military exercises in Northern
Europe, and its activities in the Arctic as amplifying the risk of an
accident or a crisis resulting in unintended escalation to war.79 The
Norwegian government, for example, considers that "Russia's overall
military capacity is the most signiªcant security challenge for Norway
and NATO."80

Likewise, in Central and Eastern Europe, although the Czech Republic,
Romania, and Slovakia also emphasize other security challenges (e.g.,
instability in the Southern Mediterranean and terrorism), their threat
assessments prioritize Russia's assertiveness.81 While refraining from
ofªcially labeling Russia a threat, the Romanian government argues that
Russia's naval buildup--- and the ensuing "destabilization of the
security situation in the Black Sea Extended Region"---"represent the
most important factor of military risk against national security."82

RUSSIA IS THE DOMINANT THREAT BY FAR

The Baltic states, Finland, and Poland exhibit the highest threat
perceptions of Russia in Europe. The former Soviet-controlled states in
the Baltic region (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) prioritize
Russia's conventional and grayzone military threats as their core
national security concern.83 Likewise, given Finland's geographical
proximity to Russia and their shared border, policy makers in Helsinki
have viewed Russia as their dominant national security threat throughout
the post--Cold War period.84 Finland considers that the "use or threat
of military force against Finland cannot be excluded."85

Given its history of recurrent invasion by foreign powers, Poland has
also consistently put Russia at the center of its security concerns
since the end of the Cold War.86 Moscow's "aggressive policy"---through
which it aims to "destabilize the internal order of other states and to
question their territorial integrity"---is seen as "a threat mainly for
Poland and other countries in the region."87

European Defense Capacity Shortfall

European national assessments thus diverge profoundly regarding the
prioritization among different threats. Significantly, Europe's
strategic cacophony greatly exacerbates a second overarching constraint
on Europe achieving strategic autonomy: [severe military capacity
gaps]{.underline} that [cannot be closed anytime soon]{.underline}.
Since the end of the Cold War, [Europe's defense capacity has markedly
decreased]{.underline}.88 Operationally, the 2011 European military
action in Libya revealed a severe shortage of key enablers for offensive
military operations: the United States had to provide critical
capabilities that the Europeans otherwise lacked, such as air-to-air
refueling; suppression of enemy air defenses; and intelligence, target
acquisition, and reconnaissance.89 Indeed, [a recent **systematic
study**]{.underline} by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies (IISS) and the German Council on Foreign Relations [found that,
because their capability shortfalls are **so significant**]{.underline},
[Europeans would struggle to autonomously undertake operations even at
the **low end**]{.underline} of [the spectrum of conflict]{.underline}
(such as peace enforcement missions).90 In this section, we focus on
Europeans' capacity for conventional warfare because it is indispensable
for defense and deterrence vis-à-vis Russia and because this allows us
to directly address the argument of restraint scholars who maintain that
the Europeans could autonomously balance Russia with ease. We identify
four major challenges that are likely to hinder the capacity of
Europeans to develop an autonomous conventional defense capacity.

LACK OF WEAPON SYSTEMS FOR CONVENTIONAL DETERRENCE AND DEFENSE

During the Cold War, Europeans invested heavily in the kind of
conventional capabilities required for conventional deterrence and
defense. But [after the Cold War, European defense spending
**plummeted**]{.underline}, and a great proportion of these limited
resources were directed toward out-of-area operations.91 As a result,
[Europeans are lacking in even the **most basic**
conventional]{.underline} deterrence and [defense
capabilities]{.underline}. [A key reason]{.underline} for this situation
[is Europe's strategic cacophony]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} five
economically [largest European countries]{.underline}---the UK, France,
Germany, Spain, and Italy---[are all]{.underline} located [in Western or
Southern Europe, which]{.underline} collectively [have]{.underline}
greatly [de-emphasized]{.underline} the [territorial
defense]{.underline} mission since the end of the Cold War. In contrast,
states in [Central and Northern Europe]{.underline} have tended to focus
relatively more on territorial defense, especially after Russia's 2014
invasion of Crimea; yet, these parts of Europe [contain only small to
medium-sized countries]{.underline}.92 Until now, there has been no
long-term examination of the year-to-year shift across all of Europe of
the kinds of core capabilities needed for conventional deterrence and
defense. To address this gap, [we systematically gathered
**data**]{.underline} from the IISS Military Balance [for the 1990--2020
period]{.underline} on three core military systems for conventional
warfare: main battle tanks (MBTs), armored personnel carriers (APCs),
and artillery. To be sure, conventional warfare requires more than
simply land capabilities. Yet, Russia's A2/AD capacity is aimed at
eroding, or nullifying, NATO's local control of its airspace, thus
compelling NATO forces, in the case of confiict, to operate in an
environment of land warfare with contested air support.93 In this
context, land resistance---and thus

land capabilities---become key, which is why we focus on these three
specific systems (they constitute a sample of the needed land warfare
capabilities). The data for MBTs of Europe's major powers are displayed
in ªgure 1.94 (Online appendix C shows the data on MBTs of medium and
smaller European countries as well as the data for APCs and artillery
for all European countries.)

[These data underscore the **marked decline**]{.underline} [of European
conventional warfare capabilities in the past three
decades]{.underline}. From 1990 to 2020, [the combined
European]{.underline} total number of MBTs plunged by 85 percent; APCs
fell by 64 percent; and [artillery declined by **56
percent**]{.underline}. As Sven Biscop concludes, "[Europe's capability
shortfalls are such that it can neither meet its NATO
obligations]{.underline} for territorial defense, [nor achieve
**strategic autonomy**]{.underline} with regard to the protection of
Europe."95

In reality, [the situation is **even worse** than these data indicate,
because most European militaries have **significant readiness
deficiencies**]{.underline}. For example, an analysis by the German
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces concluded in 2018 that
the "readiness of the Bundeswehr's major weapons systems is dramatically
low in many areas,"96 noting that only 39 percent of Germany's Leopard 2
battle tanks were available for use given a lack of spare parts; the
operability of only a quarter of its PUMA infantry combat vehicles; the
nonavailability of any of its six submarines; and the ability of less
than half of its Eurofighters and Tornado combat aircraft to fly.97
Significantly, [Europe's readiness problems]{.underline}, such as the
obsolescence of its MBTs, [are projected to become even **more
challenging**]{.underline} [in the decades ahead]{.underline}.98

THE COMPLEXITY OF EMPLOYING MODERN WEAPONS SYSTEMS

As dramatic as these weapons shortfalls are, European defense
spending---if allocated properly---could eventually secure the needed
systems. Yet, [not only is the efficient allocation of resources a major
challenge because of Europe's strategic cacophony]{.underline} (as
detailed below), [but securing the needed weapons systems would only be
the first step]{.underline}.

[The effective employment of **modern weapons** systems is]{.underline}
far more **[challenging]{.underline}** than in past eras for a variety
of reasons. [A key consideration is the immense premium put on command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (**[C4ISR]{.underline}**).
[C4ISR]{.underline}---often referred to as [the]{.underline} "**[nervous
system]{.underline}**" [of modern militaries]{.underline}---[is crucial
for gathering]{.underline} information about the combatants, for
effectively [processing]{.underline} that information, and for
[disseminating and using]{.underline} that [**information** to develop
and implement complex plans]{.underline}.99 NATO's 2011 mission in Libya
shows the heavy reliance of Europeans on the United States' C4ISR
capacity. [Europeans would]{.underline} therefore [need to develop their
own C4ISR capacity to be able to autonomously balance
Russia]{.underline}, which would not be an easy undertaking given that
Russia is no Libya. They [would need **large amounts** of new C4ISR
systems]{.underline} (e.g., reconnaissance and communication
**[satellites]{.underline}**; [early warning]{.underline} and control
**[aircraft]{.underline}**; [**sensor** systems]{.underline}; [air,
naval, and land command and control **platforms**]{.underline}), the
most complex of [which have very long development times]{.underline}.
Notably, the already significant difficulty of Europeans assembling the
needed systems would be made even more acute if the UK's exit from the
EU ends up meaning that British capabilities also need to be replaced:
at present, the UK detains, among other capabilities, 53 percent of the
EU's combat intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance heavy unmanned
aerial vehicles (CISR UAVs), 42 percent of airborne early warning and
control aircraft, and 38 percent of electronicintelligence aircraft.100

In addition, [European countries lack]{.underline} the kind of
**[specialized personnel]{.underline}** needed to operate modern weapons
systems effectively. [Redressing this weakness would be a significant
undertaking, as they have reduced their number of military personnel
**drastically**]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War. As figure 2
shows, [the size of]{.underline} the total active
[militaries]{.underline} of the large European powers [declined by **57
percent**]{.underline} during the 1990--2020 period.101 Furthermore,
[beyond the difficulty of securing the financial resources]{.underline}
to pay the needed personnel, [recruiting sufficient specialized
personnel would be a major challenge]{.underline}, as demonstrated by
the difficulties faced by many European militaries in attracting
personnel for skilled positions.102 Notably, a recent study has shown
that the employment of advanced weaponry calls for highly skilled and
highly trained military personnel, which are now more difficult to
recruit and retain in the military.103 Obtaining specialized military
personnel to operate modern weaponry is only the beginning; they must
also be trained to effectively use modern weapons, which is extremely
challenging and time consuming, partially because these weapons need to
be used as part of a cohesive package that places a premium not just on
information gathering, but also on coordination and delegation.104 [It
has taken U.S. military personnel]{.underline} an extraordinarily long
time to develop the skills required for effectively using today's
weapons systems: as Posen stresses, the United States' "development of
new weapons and tactics

![Chart, bar chart Description automatically

depends on **[decades]{.underline}** [of expensively accumulated
technological and tactical experience]{.underline}."105 [It would likely
take Europeans **even longer** to develop the needed skills, **given
differences** across countries regarding operational cultures, levels of
ambition, languages, and so on]{.underline}.106 Finally, the effective
use of modern weaponry in the European theater depends on European
forces being able to move quickly and securely over large distances
within Europe. Yet, as a UK parliamentary report puts it, "NATO has
difficulty moving large forces" across Europe.107 In recent years, the
Europeans have sought to bolster military mobility through a variety of
initiatives dispersed across different institutions (within both the EU
and NATO).108 Yet, the movement and training of military personnel and
assets in Europe remain severely hampered by a combination of capability
shortfalls, legal/procedural hurdles, and infrastructural deficiencies
that will not be easy to resolve.109

THE DIFFICULTY OF INSTITUTIONALIZED MILITARY COOPERATION

An additional challenge is institutional. Europe's strategic cacophony
has prevented Europeans from developing an autonomous,
military-planning, command and control (C2) structure.110 Indeed, a
report by the European Parliamentary Research Service explains that one
of the greatest challenges of European defense is "the lack of
integration of the military structures of the Member States."111
Although an effective and autonomous European defense would require the
creation of a permanent planning and C2 infrastructure, the question of
developing an autonomous Operational Headquarters (OHQ) has proven
highly divisive.112 An OHQ was never established because of conflicting
national interests and priorities among Europeans, in particular France,
Germany and the UK. Whereas Paris has long supported the establishment
of a military OHQ to bolster the EU's strategic and operational planning
structures and its contingency planning and C2 capacity, London has
strongly resisted, seeing it as a duplication of NATO's assets. Germany
has stood somewhat in between, though closer to the UK, favoring a focus
on civilian-military planning and C2, not least to avoid duplicating
structures already existing at NATO.113 As a result, the EU remains
entirely dependent on NATO or national assets for the planning and
conduct of major executive operations, for which it has no autonomous
military structures.114

If the United States were to pull back from Europe, it remains to be
seen whether the Europeans could rely on a "Europeanized" NATO, in which
the integrated structures would stay in place but without the United
States.115 Military planning and C2 require a clear chain of command.
When NATO was created, Europeans agreed to be under U.S. military
command, rather than attempting the far more difficult task of agreeing
to be under the command of another European country or group of European
states. More generally, as the hegemonic power in NATO, the United
States has facilitated institutionalized cooperation among Europeans and
helped partly contain Europe's strategic cacophony.116 For decades, a
U.S.-led NATO has been the overarching shaper of national defense
policies and military transformation in Europe, helping overcome
coordination and collective-action problems.117 In light of Europe's
deep-seated strategic divisions, a U.S. disengagement would amplify
these coordination and collective action problems (assuming NATO
survived) and would further hinder institutionalized, intra-European
defense cooperation at all levels: strategies and doctrines; training;
operational learning; interoperability; and joint capability
development. Likewise, without the United States, the persistent and
profound divergence of threat perceptions and strategic priorities among
Europeans is likely to impede their capacity to agree on shared C2
structures for conducting operations, except for the lowest end of the
spectrum of conºict (e.g., peace support operations).118

As a result of strategic cacophony, the EU has, in fact, struggled
mightily to create even the most minimal C2 structure. As Luis Simón
underscores, "It has taken nearly 20 years of allegedly significant
steps for the European Union to establish a 'Military Planning and
Conduct Capability' composed of up to 25 staffers, devoted to assisting
with the planning and conduct of so-called non-executive (i.e., training
and assistance) missions," with an advisory role only.119 Ultimately,
given Europe's deep-seated divergences, there is no basis for optimism
that Europeans will be able to agree being under the permanent command
of another European country for deterrence and defense or to
consistently undertake effective institutionalized military cooperation
without the enabling role played by the United States within NATO.

THE FRAGMENTATION OF EUROPE'S DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE

If Europeans want to be strategically autonomous, they will have to
produce the defense systems they need without being reliant on the
United States. The entrenched fragmentation of Europe' defense
industrial base, however, would make this a daunting task.

On the demand side, European states have consistently privileged
domestically procured defense equipment over European arms cooperation.
According to data from the European Defense Agency, from 2006 to 2015,
collaborative defense procurement in Europe accounted for less than one
quarter of total procurement.120 For example, a mere 7 percent of the
European surface vessels currently in use have been built through
European armament cooperation.121 As for fighter aircraft---where the
economic incentives for Europeanwide collaboration are especially
powerful given the immense cost and complexity of these systems---there
has been relatively limited defense cooperation: less than a third (32.6
percent) of combat aircraft used by EU militaries come from European
collaborative production.122 Similarly, European states spend more than
80 percent of their military research-and-development budgets within
national borders.123

On the supply side, these compartmentalized national markets for weapons
systems have resulted in a fragmented and noncompetitive European
defense and technological industrial base (EDTIB) characterized by
duplication, inefficiencies, endemic overcapacity, and a lack of
economies of scale.124 In 2017, 178 different weapons systems were in
use in the EU, compared to 30 in the United States.125 As a result, the
components that sustain the industrial capacity to deliver high-end to
low-end capabilities are scattered across Europe.126 This is a
significant problem given that today's scale requirements are massive
for many weapons systems, which also explains why Europe remains highly
dependent on the import of key components and weapons systems from the
United States.127

Europe has recognized the need for stronger defense production
coordination for a long time, and the mechanisms for fostering
European-wide collaboration in weapons production have been a topic of
discussion for the past several decades. On the demand side, this
coordination would require a uniform European procurement policy, with
common requirements and with defense industrial cooperation among EU
countries being prioritized over national procurement.128 And on the
supply side, this would require an integrated defense and technological
industrial base (e.g., with one or two major European prime contractors
per sector) capable of sustaining military innovation and the
development, production, and maintenance of arms at reasonable cost.

Yet, efforts to formulate the kinds of policies that would foster
Europeanwide defense collaboration have been feeble. As Matthew Uttley
explains, initiatives taken over the years to rationalize and bolster
the EDTIB have had a "limited impact," because governments see a strong
national DTIB as a necessary prerequisite for national political
sovereignty and, as a result, "national protectionist practices" remain
"the dominant driving force in E.U. defense procurement."129 A report by
the European Parliament conªrms that a key reason for this lack of
collaboration is Europe's strategic cacophony, speciªcally, "the current
fragmentation of the defense market in terms of demand, regulations,
standards and supply."130

Assessing the Counterargument: Can Europeans Balance Russia?

Together, Europe's strategic cacophony and its defense capacity
shortfalls feed and reinforce each other. For one thing, many of the
needed steps to make up for Europe's defense capacity shortfalls will
require prolonged cooperation; Europeans would thus need to overcome
their entrenched strategic cacophony not just for a short time, but over
a very long period. Moreover, because diverging interests hamper defense
industrial cooperation among Europeans, this---coupled with major
capability shortfalls---deepens their technological dependency on the
United States, further reinforcing the challenges to addressing Europe's
capability shortfalls.

Restraint scholars arguing for a U.S. pullout would undoubtedly respond
that, even if Europe is currently split by strategic divisions and has
severe defense capacity shortfalls, a U.S. withdrawal would result in
heightened European threat perceptions of Russia and thereby lead
Europeans to bolster their defense investments---thus prompting them to
come together to balance Russia (through a balancing coalition or
through the EU, or both). For restraint scholars, it is the U.S.
presence in Europe that affords Europeans the luxury of low threat
perceptions of Russia and thereby drives them to underinvest in defense.
Below, we assess the validity and robustness of this counterargument.

EUROPEAN THREAT PERCEPTIONS AFTER A U.S. WITHDRAWAL

We now evaluate how European threat perceptions would likely evolve if
the United States were to pull back, focusing first on Europe's three
major powers (France, the UK, and Germany) and then on its medium and
lesser powers.

Given its geographical location, colonial past, and continued engagement
in Africa, France tends to look south rather than east for the defense
of its core strategic interests.131 Furthermore, France's strategic
outlook remains shaped partly by its Cold War, Gaullist foreign policy
legacy, which was based on the willingness to carve out a "third way"
between the Soviet-led and the U.S.-led blocs through some form of
accommodation with Moscow while maintaining an independent nuclear force
and a French area of influence in Africa.132

The UK, as an offshore seapower, has since the early Cold War concluded
that the only way to deter the Soviet Union (and later Russia) is to use
the United States as a counterweight.133 Accordingly, the "special
relationship" with the United States, both bilaterally and through NATO,
has been the center of gravity of the UK's defense policy---as
illustrated by its heavy reliance on U.S. military technology.134
Indeed, NATO has been the main vehicle through which Britain has sought
to entrench U.S. power in Europe and deter external threats.135

Likewise, Germany, because of its history and location in the heart of
the European continent, has strategic priorities different from those of
France. The defeat and subsequent occupation of Germany in World War II,
including by the Soviet Union, was followed by the division of the
country in two, with one side under Soviet influence---thus making
Germany the geostrategic epicenter of the Cold War. After its
reunification and the end of the Cold War, as well as its self-imposed
stringent parliamentary constraints on the use of military force,
Germany has opted for a combination of economic and political
integration with the EU and military reliance on NATO, with the United
States as the ultimate guarantor for its security and the stability of
the continent.136

Idiosyncratic historical legacies, geography, and distinctive local
security environments have thus profoundly shaped the threat assessments
of the three major European powers. To be sure, these differences
existed during the Cold War, too, but they were muted by the
overwhelming, common Soviet threat.137 By contrast, in light of the
diversification of the post--Cold War threat environment, if the United
States withdrew from the continent, the threat perceptions of these
major powers would be unlikely to converge around Russia.138

In such a scenario, the UK and Germany would be prone to exhibit
heightened threat perceptions vis-à-vis Russia. Given their historical
reliance upon NATO as their ultimate security guarantee, if the United
States were to remove its conventional and nuclear forces, the
credibility of NATO's deterrent vis-à-vis Russia would founder in the
eyes of British and German policymakers. As a result, there is every
reason to expect they would raise the significance of Russia and of
territorial defense in their defense planning. At the same time, they
would still have to reckon with other significant threats (e.g.,
transnational terrorism and regional stability in the MENA).

By contrast, France's threat assessment would most likely remain
unchanged if the United States withdrew. Although France might view
Russia with greater concern, it would continue to prioritize terrorism
and, crucially, threats on Europe's southern periphery (i.e., regional
instability in the greater Mediterranean area, in general, and in
Africa, in particular). As a senior current French defense official put
it in an interview, "If the United States withdrew, the risk represented
by Russia would ostensibly be greater but, at the same time, it would be
greater only if France considered that the threat posed by Russia to the
Baltic states, Poland, etc. constitutes a threat to our vital interests,
which is far from sure." This is because threats to Europe's southern
periphery, such as "the destabilization of Africa or the Middle East are
considered to be a much higher priority than Russia. . . . Our vital
interests are not threatened by Russia."139

In sum, in the case of a complete U.S. pullback from the continent,
London and Berlin would likely move rightward into the second column
from the right in table 1 (Russia is a higher threat, but other threats
are also significant), while France would not shift from its current
position. Given their differing threat prioritizations, the United
Kingdom, Germany, and France would be very unlikely to reach agreement
on a common position vis-à-vis Russia. Germany and the UK might lean
more toward balancing and expand bilateral defense cooperation to that
end. However, unlike countries that view Russia as the dominant threat
by far (i.e., the Baltic states and Poland), they would face important
trade-offs in their allocation of resources---between territorial
defense and power projection capabilities, between Europe's eastern and
southern periphery, and so on---given that they would continue to
grapple with other signiªcant threats. For its part, because France
would likely continue to prioritize threats on Europe's southern
periphery, it would be unlikely to provide a substantial (if any)
contribution to a balancing coalition. In fact, it might opt for
accommodation with Russia to develop a sphere of inºuence in Western/
Southern Europe or, potentially, even see some strategic advantages to
bandwagoning with Russia.

This predicament would be further compounded by fundamental divergences
in threat perceptions among Europe's medium and small powers. Except for
lesser powers in Northern and Eastern Europe (i.e., the Baltic states
and Poland), which would consistently see Russia as their overriding
threat, the other medium and small European states would likely display
profoundly different reactions to a U.S. pullback, depending on their
geographic location, history, and strategic priorities. While some
countries would undoubtedly perceive a higher threat from Russia and
thus revise their threat assessments (moving one column to the right in
table 1), others would likely maintain their existing threat
hierarchization given the equivalent or higher priority they as sign to
other threats or regions, or both. In fact, there is every indication
that most medium and small European countries that currently perceive
threats other than Russia to be more signiªcant or dominant would be
highly unlikely to revise their threat assessment. Several of these
countries might even become neutral or bandwagon with Moscow. It is
therefore extremely implausible that all European states would move
Russia up in their ranking of threats. And even if they did, the
cacophony of threat perception would remain, with only a few lesser
powers in Northern and Eastern Europe perceiving Russia as their
dominant threat.

Restraint scholars might reply that the above discussion is excessively
pessimistic about the chances for European defense coordination because
it neglects the role the EU can play in bringing Europe together in the
security realm if the United States leaves.140 The EU is not an
effective institutional platform for overcoming Europe's strategic
divergence, however. There are many reasons for this, with the most
notable being that the EU is a kaleidoscope of countries with diverging
interests that operates on the basis of consensus in the ªeld of foreign
and defense policy---thus making the Common Security and Defense Policy
a "structurally limited undertaking."141 If the United States were to
pull back, rather than work to overcome European divisions, the EU would
be prone to inaction because of such divisions. Thus, only an effective
institutional structure could probably overcome, or at least mitigate,
Europe's divisions, but strategic cacophony would prevent the EU from
being enabled to perform this function.

HOW EASILY CAN EUROPEANS BALANCE RUSSIA'S MILITARY STRENGTH?

A complete U.S. withdrawal would thus not mitigate Europe's strategic
cacophony and could exacerbate it. Restraint scholars might argue,
however, that, even if threat perceptions did not converge across
Europe, balancing Russia would not require much effort because it is so
weak. Yet, Russia is a much tougher adversary to match than restraint
scholars now assess it to be--- both in the conventional and the nuclear
realms.

CONVENTIONAL DEFENSE AND DETERRENCE. As Michael Kofman and Richard
Connolly convincingly argue, "Russian military expenditure is
considerably higher" than commonly estimated.142 Of key importance, they
stress, is that Russia gets a lot for what it spends on its military: it
pays its soldiers a pittance in rubles, and, even more important, it
buys its weapons from its own defense contractors in rubles, not
dollars. Moreover, the Russian government has squeezed profits in the
defense sector, making the weapons it buys artificially cheap. Notably,
Russia's unusually high capacity to produce advanced weaponry using
domestic resources is a legacy of the Soviet Union's massive level of
defense production during the Cold War. Ultimately, Kofman and Connolly
maintain that, because Russia's rubles can purchase so much military
power so cheaply, it is inappropriate to use market exchange-based
estimates of its military spending. Based upon purchasing power parity
exchange rates, "Russia's effective military expenditure actually ranged
between \$150 billion and \$180 billion annually" (from 2015 to 2019),
and "taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure,
Russia may well come in at around \$200 billion."143 Given this
understanding, [Russian military spending]{.underline} likely
[**exceeds** the combined levels of defense expenditures of the **three
major** European powers]{.underline} (France, Germany, and the UK).

[High levels of military spending have]{.underline}, in turn, [spurred
**significant modernization** and **expansion** of Russia's military
forces]{.underline}, particularly in the 2010s.144 The Russian
Federation is the descendent state of the Soviet Union, which created a
formidable military industrial base with a huge cadre of highly trained
personnel, providing a strong foundation for Russia's current military
infrastructure. Although the Russian armed forces still display
important weaknesses in areas such as surface shipbuilding, in the past
decade Moscow has substantially "modernized its armed forces through a
massive introduction of new and modernized weapons and infrastructure,
accompanied by radical structural changes in the military organization,
evolving modes of operation and a sharply increased number, scale and
complexity of military training and exercise."145 Of particular note,
from 2015 to 2019, Russia's army increased in size by almost 25
percent.146 (In online appendix D, we measure the military capabilities
of Russia and four potential European balancing coalitions regarding two
overall indicators of military personnel \[total active and total
reserves\] and three core weapon systems for conventional warfare \[main
battle tanks, artillery, and armored personnel carriers\]. Across all
five of these measures, the data show that Russia possesses a very
substantial military superiority as compared to all four potential
European balancing coalitions.)

Additionally, Russia possesses substantial C4ISR capabilities for
employing weapons systems in a coordinated manner and for managing
military operations. These capabilities are the combined result of
legacy Soviet systems and of the Kremlin's ongoing military
modernization effort.147 Especially in the past decade, Russia has
developed a more modular, flexible force structure with an emphasis on
joint forces through a large-scale military modernization.148

Military satellites are a useful indicator for understanding why
Europeans would have difficulty building up the necessary C4ISR
infrastructure for balancing Russia. For one, military satellites are
critical, because they enable the rest of the C4ISR architecture to
operate effectively by facilitating the flow of informational inputs.
Specifically, military satellites are crucial for communications,
navigation, early warning, attack assessment, and surveillance and
reconnaissance---and thus are key for pooling and employing military
power. Other C4ISR systems, such as ISR UAVs and airborne early warning
and control systems constitute more specific components of a C4ISR
architecture that play particular roles therein. Furthermore, whereas
full comparison data are available for military satellites, existing
databases do not list other C4ISR capabilities systematically. The
profound gap between Russia and European countries in military
satellites is shown in table 2.

To be sure, notwithstanding such quantitative preponderance in military
satellites, one challenge faced by the Russian military in past decades
has been the integration of highly interoperable systems for
network-centric warfare.149 Yet, Russia has placed such systems
(referred to as the Reconnaissance Strike Complex in Russian strategic
parlance) at the "epicenter" of its military modernization in the 2010s,
investing massively in C4ISR integration and electronic warfare and in
modernizing infrastructure, while boosting and streamlining command and
control, among other features.150

The net result is that, as stressed by a 2019 RAND report, the Kremlin
has

![Graphical user interface, text Description automatically
generated](media/image8.png){width="6.38012467191601in"
height="3.3230850831146106in"}

implemented "a modern, whole-of-government C4ISR infrastructure that
will enable Russia to pursue its vision of net-centric or 'non-contact
warfare'"; these "advances in long-range strike, Russia's command and
control and information gathering systems are fundamental in their
ability to compete directly with the West and dominate regional
adversaries"151---an assessment shared by other studies.152
Significantly, the Russian military tried and tested its C4ISR
capabilities during the Syrian conflict.153

The experience of European states during the 2011 Libyan conflict showed
that they lack the technological infrastructure and personnel to
autonomously use weapons systems in a coordinated manner: they would
need to replace the United States' C4ISR systems that they currently
rely on; hire and train the personnel to operate them; and develop a
permanent, effective command structure to conduct effective joint
military operations in wartime. Likewise, in stark contrast to Russia's
unity of command, Europeans display an "enormous variation" in their
C4ISR capacities, with "both technological and operational gaps within
Europe."154 In sum, Europe exhibits a cacophony of C4ISR capabilities.

A final and related consideration that restraint scholars do not
sufficiently recognize is that Russia gains efficiencies---when compared
to Europe--- because it is a single actor, rather than a collective
patchwork of countries. By contrast, as a 2018 European Parliament
report concludes, "It is precisely because European defense is
fragmented by the decisions of 27 political and military chiefs of
staff, duplicates the same research, the same programs and the same
capabilities and has no chain of command that it is, collectively,
inefªcient."155 The report notes further that "increasing the level of
spending without ªrst addressing the coherence between the different
national defense systems would only increase the amount of wastage."156
Exactly how much efªciency is lost would depend on how many European
countries would need to act together to balance Russia; but even two
actors working together would result in less efªcacy and effectiveness
as compared to a single, unitary actor of comparable size.157 If the
United States pulled back, a single, centralized Russian actor would
confront a group of potential European balancers with diverging threat
perceptions that would face coordination challenges likely to hamper
their capacity to devise a common strategy, to share the burdens of
their defense investments, to rationalize Europe's highly fragmented
defense industrial base, to build integrated C2 structures, and to
sustain the development and deployment of a C4ISR capacity. As a report
of the French Senate states, "Compared to other European countries,
Russia enjoys a considerable but not quantifiable advantage: unity of
command. The Russian army has one commanding authority, one hierarchy,
one language, and one equipment range. Obviously, at the operational
level, these are very important assets."158

NUCLEAR DETERRENCE. As a legacy of the Cold War, [Russia maintains a
**formidable arsenal** of approximately **6,400** nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, [which **vastly overshadows** the combined
arsenals of France and the UK]{.underline} ([290 and 195 nuclear
weapons, respectively]{.underline}).159 [In addition to Russia's
numerical preponderance, it matters greatly that this force is wielded
by a **single actor**]{.underline}, not a collective one. In contrast,
strategic divergences and technological constraints are highly likely to
hamper the emergence of a European nuclear deterrent either through the
Europeanization of the French and/or British nuclear deterrents and/or
through a German nuclear deterrent.

As Ulrich Kühn and Tristan Volpe explain, Germany would have to surmount
major technical, political, and security obstacles before acquiring a
nuclear deterrent.160 Not only would it face the domestic and
international pressures fueled by reviving fears of German hegemony, but
it would have "to either repurpose its nuclear energy infrastructure for
weapons production or sprint to the bomb from new military
facilities,"161 a prospect made even more unlikely given that Germany
plans to shut down its entire nuclear fleet by 2022.162 Accordingly,
"Germany does not have the required wherewithal for even a rudimentary
program."163

In turn, the Europeanization of nuclear sharing (or Euro-deterrent)
based on the nuclear capabilities of France and/or the United Kingdom
independent of the United States would also "face high hurdles and
immense costs that might well prove prohibitive."164 French nuclear
experts note that there is "near-zero appetite in France for
transferring its nuclear assets to Europe."165 Likewise, Barbara Kunz
observes that analysts across Europe agree that the Europeanization of
the French bomb, however defined, is "unlikely and hardly feasible."166

The prospects of a Franco-British nuclear deterrent are even less
likely. For one, it is highly improbable that French or British
policymakers would be willing to sacriªce London or Paris for Tallinn or
Riga. Second, the UK has left the EU, so France and the UK would have to
overcome their previously discussed divergent strategic priorities to
create an integrated Franco-British military structure for nuclear
planning outside the EU. Finally, the heavy dependence of the UK's
nuclear deterrent on U.S. technology and on cooperation with the United
States would further complicate such an endeavor.

Ultimately, the notion forwarded by restraint scholars that European
countries can easily and quickly balance Russia is ungrounded. Balancing
Russia would be extremely difficult, and such a buildup would
necessarily take a very long time. Our interviews with European
policymakers reveal that they clearly understand this problem. A former
UK ministry of defense official stresses that the "temporal factor would
be quite long. . . . These sort of capabilities take a long time to
develop."167 Likewise, as a former German official bluntly explains,
"The whole defense and capability requirements would be so extreme that
the upgrade that would be needed to fill the gap if the U.S. completely
withdrew is totally off limits for the foreseeable future."168

Conclusion

Europe is characterized by profound, continent-wide divergences across
national defense policies, particularly threat perceptions, as well as
by a fundamental defense capacity shortfall that cannot be closed
anytime soon because of a series of overlapping challenges. Given the
combination of strategic cacophony and capacity gaps, which are mutually
reinforcing, Europeans are currently not in a position to autonomously
mount a credible deterrent and defense against Russia. [This situation
would likely continue for a **very long time**]{.underline}, even if
there were a complete U.S. withdrawal from the continent, and [all the
more so in the event of a **partial** U.S. withdrawal]{.underline}, a
much more likely counterfactual. If a U.S. pullback were to occur, it
would leave Europe increasingly vulnerable to Russian aggression and
meddling, allowing Russia to exploit Europe's centrifugal dynamics to
augment its influence. [A U.S. withdrawal would]{.underline} also likely
make institutionalized intra-European defense cooperation appreciably
harder. Accordingly, [a U.S. pullback would have **grave
consequences**]{.underline} [for **peace** and **stability** on the
continent]{.underline}.

These findings have major implications for both sides of the Atlantic.
In Europe, [scholars and policymakers need to be
**realistic**]{.underline}. The strong desire for strategic autonomy is
justified and understandable, but [it is **necessary** to **discern**
between **distant hopes** and **present realities**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, the barriers to strategic autonomy are so substantial that
the achievement of this goal would require a long-term, sustained and
coordinated effort. Sound European defense policymaking needs to reflect
this: [working under an unrealistic assumption]{.underline} that
Europeans can quickly achieve strategic autonomy [is both
**unwarranted** and **unwise**]{.underline}. [Pursuing unrealistic goals
can, in fact, undermine the achievement of realistic ones]{.underline}.
Instead, [European policymakers should focus on a **manageable**,
**affordable**]{.underline} [set of initiatives for **augmenting**
military capacity in the short term that the United States would see as
valuable]{.underline}---[and thus would help
**consolidate**]{.underline} [the transatlantic
alliance]{.underline}---but that would nevertheless also prove useful if
the United States does someday pull back. Such an approach could
gradually and cumulatively create the foundations for greater
commonality and cooperation in the future and, over time, help mitigate
the centrifugal dynamics at play in Europe. In the United States,
restraint scholars---virtually all of whom are selfdescribed
realists---also need to be realistic. Far from portraying the world as
it is, their assessment of Europe is guided by an unfounded optimism
that Europeans can easily balance Russia if the United States pulled
out. Currently, Europe is presented by restraint scholars as the "easy"
case for a U.S. withdrawal, with Asia being the "hard" case.169 Although
China is rising fast and already has much more latent power than
[Russia]{.underline}, the latter [is a]{.underline}
[great]{.underline}er [threat]{.underline} to the United States'
European allies than the former [based on]{.underline} the other three
components of the balance of threat: [geographic location, offensive
military capabilities, and aggressive intentions]{.underline}.170 The
assessment of restraint scholars that pulling back from Europe is an
easy call ultimately rests on a wholly unsubstantiated assumption: that
an effective European balancing coalition would emerge quickly if the
United States pulled back. What our analysis shows is that Europeans
would for a very long time be unable to effectively confront Russia on
their own if the United States were to withdraw, and thus if America
does want stability in Europe, it should retain a presence on the
continent.

While I follow a relational and primarily historical and interpretive
approach, [I]{.underline} do [depart from]{.underline} many [other
adherents of relationalism]{.underline} in two significant ways.4 [The
first involves the assumption of]{.underline} an ethical or normative
content [to]{.underline} what Milja Kurki calls the "[relational
cosmology]{.underline}" of the "relational revolution" (Chapter 3, this
volume). [Kurki believes an ethical impulse is]{.underline} "[baked
in]{.underline}to" a relational worldview. There are a number of
examples of this in contemporary theory inside and outside of IR. [Two
variants]{.underline} are those [follow]{.underline}ing [Judith
Butler]{.underline} and her debt to [Emmanuel Levinas and Hannah
Arendt]{.underline}, who account for violence as an abrogation of
relations and a possibility of nonviolence in relations themselves.
Here, violence is in some sense the ignoring of a fundamental
relationality among human beings that would, if recognized, create an
understanding mutuality opposed to violence. From these accounts,
consciousness-raising about the fact of relationality is a solution to
global violence just as "realizing" and "experiencing" relationality
makes us open or indebted to "the other," to use Levinas' terms. The
second variant focuses more on the natural environment and violence
against nonhuman others. [From this perspective on relationality,
environmental destruction and extreme cruelty toward nonhuman animals
is]{.underline}, like the Levinasian/Arendtian account, [the result of a
loss of relationality]{.underline} often attributed to modernist
accounts of mind/body and nature/culture dualisms, or, more generally,
of anthropocentrism. Like normative relationalism, the environmental
strand believes that an awareness of this fact, or a cultivation of an
ethos of interdependence beyond the human species, will reduce violence
and possibly may make planetary life more sustainable. It is not unusual
to take as evidence of this position the confluence of environmental
protections by indigenous peoples with relational cosmologies.

[Both variants **conflate** the **methodological insights** of
relationalism with a relational **worldview**]{.underline}. [One is
empirical while the other is **aspirational**]{.underline}. [The
risk]{.underline}, I believe, [in this conflation is a confusion of
expectations and a **false sense**]{.underline} [that one has solved
more philosophical questions **than are possible**]{.underline} [to
solve]{.underline}. It is enough to have an account of the world that
integrates ideational and material forces into a single substance and
ontology. [We ought not expect that this]{.underline}, in addition,
[restores the world to some **perfect order**]{.underline}, [or that
striving for a more universal notion of the good escapes somehow the
**deep problems**]{.underline} [of competing interests]{.underline},
relativism, or incommensurable worldviews. [Too often the appeal to
relationalism's debt to]{.underline} science or fundamental, ancient
[ontologies is used to **depoliticize** its normative
commitments]{.underline}. However, the ambivalent relationship between
relationalism's cosmological and scientific origin stories ought to
demand the inverse. Rather than seeing relationality as an ethical exit
from particularity and the divisions in politics, it ought to insist
upon both as the beginning of inquiry.

While an ethics can be built within a relational ontology, it does not
necessarily follow from the ontological insights. After all, [seals and
great white sharks are **deeply relational**]{.underline} [and aware of
each other, and yet could not easily arrive at a common sense of the
good]{.underline}. [If any interspecies consensus could be reached
between predator and prey, it would be **minimal**]{.underline} (maybe a
consensus value on saving the ocean, for instance) [and not as a **mere
result** of their relationality, which is mostly characterized by
**teeth** and **blood**]{.underline}. [Could such a relationship be at
least free of violence]{.underline}? [Even that seems
**far-fetched**]{.underline} given the findings of animal behaviorists
that predators enjoy their hunt; killing for fun has been observed in
orcas, dolphins, and cats.

In fact, [rather than say that relationality and violence are
opposed]{.underline}, I believe that [the **opposite** claim can and
should be made]{.underline}. [If everything is relational]{.underline}
--- [from our cells to our consciousness]{.underline} --- [then
certainly **violence is relational** too]{.underline}. To go a step
further, violence --- a thoroughly human concept --- only distinguishes
itself from force or change because of the particular relationships of
attention and intimacy which make cruelty possible. What makes an
earthquake tragic --- that is, unavoidable and indebted to no
misanthropy or purposive end --- is precisely what makes an act of war
violent. Malice, sadism, cruelty, cultivated indifference --- all of
these extra characteristics are what change the ecological and political
relations of actions such that they are violent as opposed to something
else.

[This volume challenges us to stretch our imagination and rethink the
world of international relations]{.underline}. It engages modern
substantialist, Weberian approaches to social science [with new
**postmodern**, **relationalist** or **quantum** approaches and
concludes that **substantialist** views which emphasize the
**individual** are **outdated**]{.underline}. 1 [This conclusion is
**premature**]{.underline}. [Stretching our imagination is **one
thing**; tearing it up is **another**]{.underline}. As we proceed, we
need a clear picture of what we are stretching and potentially tearing
up; it could be the reasoning individual and the human capacity to
imagine itself.

This chapter offers a full-throated (albeit limited) exposition and
defense of the Enlightenment/Weberian worldview that underlines modern
social science. [The **Enlightenment worldview**]{.underline} [gave form
to the aspiration for **individual freedom**]{.underline} [and
**choice**]{.underline}. [It rescued humanity from the **stultifying
clutches** of **mysticism**]{.underline} (Nature) [and
**religion**]{.underline} (the Divine). [It dethroned **philosopher
kings** and **papal elites**]{.underline} [and empowered **ordinary**,
individual human beings, equipped with **reason**, spirit]{.underline}
(emotion, faith), [and **education**]{.underline}, [to create,
**assess**,]{.underline} **[debate]{.underline}**, [and pass
judgment]{.underline} on alternative worldviews. Natural science
exploded under Isaac Newton's vision of an orderly universe fixed in
time and space following predictable laws. And social science spawned a
virtual cornucopia of modern worldviews, both individualistic and
authoritarian. Liberalism (John Locke), capitalism (Adam Smith),
humanism (Max Weber), communism (Karl Marx), and fascism (Friedrick
Nietzsche), among others, competed (and fought) to organize and direct
social and scientific life. 2 In the West, through struggle, humanist
and capitalist worldviews prevailed, fueling material progress, the
spread of republican institutions, and gnawing anguish about minorities
left behind.

Now, [postmodern worldviews]{.underline} of relationalism and
hyper-humanism (unity of human beings and nature) challenge
Enlightenment worldviews. They [**reject** the individualistic ontology
of human affairs in favor of a wholistic]{.underline} or cosmological
[one]{.underline}. Milja Kurki writes: "The relational perspective
explored here suggests that the sciences -- natural and social -- are
undergoing a 'relational revolution,' moving from Cartesian, Newtonian,
and empiricist ways of knowing toward more relational ontologies and
epistemologies in line with not only quantum science and relativity
theory but also with ecological thought and decolonization of the
sciences." 3 Relationalist views envision a world of intense and
entangled relationships deeply embedded in historical and cosmological
context, in which substantialist things such as individuals and
institutions do not exist or exist only in emergent form when they are
investigated. In this holistic and processual universe, individual human
beings have no location (position), no alternative (choice), and no
escape (only one observed universe). The relationalist worldview draws
from quantum science, in which reality is not fixed in time or space but
appears simultaneously and unpredictably in multiple places and
dissolves the distinction between the observer (individual) and the
observed (universe).

These different worldviews not only reflect different ontologies, they
prescribe different world politics. As Kurki infers, [the relationalist
turn entails a **political agenda**]{.underline} -- [a broadside assault
on western **rationality**]{.underline} (reason),
**[individuality]{.underline}** (freedom), capitalism (growth), and
colonialism (control/hierarchy). [4 In place of Enlightenment goals,
relationalism advocates]{.underline} a future agenda of environmentalism
that prioritizes climate change, [**hyper-humanism** that
**relinquishes** human control of nature,]{.underline} [and
egalitarianism that **flattens** material and moral
differences]{.underline}. [Much more is **at stake** than abstract
intellectual discourse]{.underline}. [The relationalist turn may
**imperil** the **very notion** of free, reasoning
individuals]{.underline} capable of self-conscious thought and choice in
human affairs.

This chapter insists that [individual human beings remain at the
**epicenter** of social science inquiry]{.underline}. Quantum science
does not mandate an epochal transformation of worldviews from
rationality and individualism to relationality and cosmology. 5
[Modeling the social sciences after the natural sciences is, in fact, a
**cardinal mistake**]{.underline}. Relationalists highlight that mistake
when they argue that Enlightenment science under Newton hijacked the
social sciences and created a disenchanted modernity of atoms
(individuals) and laws (causality) devoid of spirit and meaning. Now
they make the same mistake by modeling the postmodern world after
quantum science. But the Newtonian world was never just a billiard ball
world of fixed entities, time and space. It was inspired and limited by
Christian beliefs that the divine did not roll dice (a predictable
world) and human beings were made equally worthy in the image of the
divine. And the quantum worldview today is not just a mathematical model
of entanglement and uncertainty; it is also a social vision to reimagine
the political world as harmonious, contingent, and relationally or
group-based (identity politics, multiculturalism, etc.), rather than as
competitive, progressive, and individually based (markets, individual
human rights, etc.).

[The Enlightenment produced good and evil]{.underline}. This chapter
does not claim otherwise. [The Enlightenment's crown jewel]{.underline},
however, [was the **emancipation**, for better and worse, of the
individual human being as a reasoning, responsible, and rights-seeking
agent in society]{.underline}. [On balance]{.underline},
[this]{.underline} secular, [individually driven humanist worldview was
**progressive**, materially and socially. Despite all of its wars and
warts, the Enlightenment era superintended **unparalleled expansion** of
**material prosperity**]{.underline}, **[human longevity]{.underline}**,
**[public education]{.underline}**, **[political freedom]{.underline}**
(yes, more democracies than ever before), [and **global
equality**]{.underline} (yes, [half of the world's population is now
**middle class**]{.underline}). 6 [Any post-Enlightenment worldview that
challenges the individualist ontology of the Enlightenment has a **high
bar** to meet]{.underline}.

The chapter proceeds in four parts. The first part explores the
relationship between the individual and the whole, the timeworn
conundrum of agency and structure. It contends that the individual
remains primary over structure in several principal ways: as a source of
endless diversity, a repository for the capability of reason, a portal
of entry for human conversation, and the only species thus far that
practices science and is capable of representing and studying itself.
Individuals are not autonomous, but they have space in their embedded
situation for choice and change. The main issue between this chapter and
others in this volume is how much space they have and where that space
resides. Relationalist accounts tend to discount agency at the
individual level, Weberian accounts at the structural level. We risk a
lot by disregarding either.

The second and third parts address the content and juxtaposition of
competing worldviews. How do we compare and test them? This part holds
fast to the notion of a universal capability of individual human beings
to reason and a universal method of science to test alternative
propositions (worldviews) by experiment against an outside physical and
social world. To be sure, the content of reason and science is parochial
and differs by culture. In some worldviews, rational and individualistic
factors play the larger role, in others nonrational (e.g., emotion,
intuition) and holistic factors. 7 If these multiple worldviews are
incommensurable, however, we have no way to evaluate and test them.
Worldviews become religious not scientific undertakings, adopted by
faith not reason. On the other hand, if we retain science as a common
method (mathematics, experimentation), we can compare and evaluate
worldviews across different cultures. In this section I assume that all
worldviews incorporate two elements: content, or their relative emphasis
on rational vs. nonrational factors; and scale, or their relative
emphasis on individualistic vs. structural levels of analysis. 8

The fourth part addresses the ethics of different worldviews. Worldviews
have consequences -- some horrific, such as the Holocaust. Who or what
is accountable for these outcomes? If Weberian worldviews have moral
shortcomings -- and they do -- relationalist worldviews do as well.
Calling for openness and multiple worldviews (modernities),
relationalist views are at times quite dogmatic. They pass judgment on
worldviews as "right" or "wrong" not as "false" or "not false," and
speak of the pursuit of "truth" against which, they claim, resistance is
futile. 9 They downplay individual agency and emphasize entangled
relationships, conjuring up a "totalizing" worldview that marginalizes
individual rights and privacy. They blur distinctions between science
and religion and argue that worldviews "are inescapably normative." 10
Yet, curiously, relationalists say little about the substance of
relationalist norms. They pass over the question of how a relationalist
world, in which all possibilities are welcomed, defends itself against
the barbarity of an Adolf Hitler or a Joseph Stalin; they infer that
other religions (Hinduism, Buddhism) are more in tune with nature than
Christianity; they refrain from spirited criticism of worldviews that
discriminate against women (Saudi Arabia, India) or Muslims (China); and
[they blame America and the Enlightenment for elevating European
worldviews and marginalizing others]{.underline}. [Weberian worldviews,
by contrast, with their **individualistic** and **disaggregated**
ontology, accommodate alternative worldviews as long as these worldviews
submit to **objective falsification**]{.underline} [and do not claim
that their world is the only world which cannot be tested or
resisted]{.underline}. 11

6.3 Worldviews and Science

To do this, however, we need standards. [The Enlightenment gave us the
standard of science as a **universal method**]{.underline}:
**[mathematics]{.underline}**, **[experimental practice]{.underline}**.
[That method depends upon the assumption of a **real**
"**objective**]{.underline}" [world]{.underline} even if we can never
know that world. We ask and test how that world works, based on the
values we hold (e.g., world is predictable or uncertain), and the real
world pushes back against our experimental inquiries and tells us which
worldviews are consistent with it and which are not. Notice science as
method tells us only which worldviews are not false (i.e., not
inconsistent with reality); it never tells us which worldviews are true
(i.e., the actual reality).

This is a crucial point, at least for me. Truth lies not in the
universal method of science but in the multiple values that inform
science as method. Newton's Christian views led him to expect and
practice a "predictable" science; Weber's human-centric views led him to
anticipate a "progressive" science; the values held by Weber's critics
led them to expect a "disenchanted" science; Hitler's fascist and
Stalin's communist worldviews led them to promote "racist" and "pseudo"
sciences (Mengele and Lysenko). Relationalists value conjunctive
relationality (not individuals) and pursue a science of local not
universal knowledge. Values inform all worldviews, but science as method
tells us which worldviews fare best against an assumed objective world.

Strong [relationalists reject science as a universal method of testing
against an objective reality]{.underline}. [They talk about]{.underline}
"[different sciences]{.underline}" 55 [and argue that]{.underline}
"[science]{.underline} ... [is not defined by a 'method']{.underline}."
56 Quoting Roberto Unger and Lee Smolin, Kurki concludes: "There is no
scientific method, science is fundamentally defined as a collection of
ethical communities." 57 Here [we come very close to worldviews as pure
values]{.underline} (ethical communities) [with methods being
**anything**]{.underline} -- [scientific, **magical**,
**religious**]{.underline} -- [that values dictate]{.underline}. Each
community defines its own value and methods, and presumably the "real"
world accommodates them all because there is no common method to
determine which worldviews are not consistent with an assumed "real"
(i.e., objective) world.

There are three layers of uncertainty involved in this issue of
scientific objectivity (universality). Newtonian science studies the
natural (nonhuman) world: objects such as planets and particles which
cannot change their characteristics and which scientists neither like
nor dislike. Laws are fixed and cannot be affected by the scientist. The
human observer is also situated outside and independent of the natural
world. In Newtonian science, the observer can be mostly objective even
though scientists still operate in an intersubjective, ethical (social)
community (for Newton, the Church of England) that defines what is or is
not to be investigated and expected.

Weberian science studies not only the natural but also the social world
in which human beings are involved and can change their minds. Laws are
no longer fixed, and the observer, though still distinct, studies things
it likes and dislikes, such as churches, trade unions, markets,
political parties, etc. While Weberian scientists assume they can strip
their social preferences from their scientific pursuits, they are human,
not superhuman, and can succeed only up to a point. Objectivity is more
elusive. 58

Quantum science adds a third level of uncertainty. 59 It assumes that
the human observer is not only studying itself but is now inextricably
entangled with the world it is studying. The observer, the observed, and
the background exist only together (there is no separate individual,
observation, or background), and emerge only when a particular question
(measurement) is asked (made). Observation triggers or collapses the
entangled quantum world and reveals the only world we can know. There is
no world behind the observed one. Objectivity, in short, is now out of
the question. The world depends entirely on the questions the observer
asks.

[Relationalism]{.underline} in general pushes us toward this quantum
level of uncertainty. But a strong relationalism [goes beyond quantum
scien]{.underline}ce in two ways: [it]{.underline} drastically reduces
(if not **[eliminates]{.underline}**) [the role of the
observer]{.underline} (the individual investigator), [and it gives up
the universal method of experimental science in favor of a
**localized**]{.underline} [and **diluted** method of]{.underline}
"**[trial and error]{.underline}**." 60 [Quantum science does
neither]{.underline}. [In the case of the observer, it **elevates**, not
eliminates, the significance of the observer]{.underline} (individual).
Through the act of measuring, the observer now literally "creates"
("gives meaning to") the world we observe, which is the only world we
can know. 61 As Steven Weinberg muses, "Man may indeed be the measure of
all things." 62 [That seems to **reinforce** the Weberian worldview that
individuals are a significant location of agency]{.underline}. But in
quantum physics the observer now has no way to test observations against
an objective world because there is no objective world. The universal
scientific method is no longer available, and we have to settle for a
localized form of experimentation based on trial and error, yielding
results which cannot be generalized. That point seems to reinforce the
relationalist worldview.

But wait a minute. Some Newtonian (classical) physicists still contest
the quantum proposition that there is no objective world. They argue
that wave collapse is going on all the time objectively in a real but
unknown world behind the observed world. They seek evidence of such
"objective" wave collapse, independent of "subjective" measurement. 63
Interestingly, in these efforts, [Newtonian and quantum scientists use
the **same methods** of **science**, **mathematics** and
**experiments**]{.underline}, but derive very different content from
those methods. [Neither]{.underline}, however, [has given up on the idea
of science as a **universal method**]{.underline}. [Quantum science may
still prevail, but if it does it won't prevail forever, any more than
Newtonian science did]{.underline}. Science advances from one falsified
theory to another "not yet" falsified theory, not from false to true (at
which point science ends). 64 And, since scientists tell us that we know
only about 4 percent of the universe as we see it, the real world that
we don't see is likely to remain elusive for a very long time to come.
Scientists therefore should not speak about "the reality" let alone "the
truth" of their findings, only about a method that tells them which
findings are not false or not yet false.

[In the meantime, quantum science raises some **harrowing ethical
issues**]{.underline} [when applied to the human world]{.underline}:
[the potential of unhinged human observers playing the **role of
creator**]{.underline}, [and the **absence** of any common moral
standard by which to hold varying worldviews
**accountable**]{.underline}.

#### Absent analyzing the decisions of [individual leaders]{.underline} and treating them [culpable]{.underline}, genocide becomes [inevitable]{.underline}.

6.4 Worldviews and Ethics

Having downsized if not eliminated the role of the reasoning individual
in shaping worldviews, and having adopted a quantum view that the world
we see is the only one there is, [relationalism]{.underline} in this
volume [has]{.underline} surprisingly [little to say about **ethical**
and **moral** responsibility]{.underline}, either individual or
collective. This neglect follows from relationalist logic. [Because the
world is holistic and incorporates all possibilities, there is little or
**no choice**, and hence little or **no responsibility**. We have
removed practically all degrees of human freedom to **act** and
**change** the world]{.underline}. [What's left are different
**values**]{.underline} [or **religions**]{.underline} [and related
methods of science]{.underline} which are compatible but not
commensurable, harmonious but not integral, and equivalent but not
competitive. Katzenstein writes:

> both science and religion are variegated practices of different ways
> of knowing ... Both inquire into the possibility that the world might
> be different than it appears. Both are instances of us living in
> multiple realities and thus are examples of the profound human
> capacity of meaning-making ... Religious and scientific practices are
> rooted in the world of play. 65

Play is an interesting term, implying a game or imaginary reality. In
that game, however, what are the rules, and who makes them? Maybe no
rules are needed. Science and religion are drawing closer together: "the
border between quantum mechanics and religion is porous." 66 Religious
values and scientific methods do not collide, they resonate. Multiple
beliefs and realities cut or "smear" into one another like quantum
waves. They blend, harmonize.

Such a harmonious concatenation of multiple worldviews expresses an
aspiration that we all share. If relationalism is nothing more than an
appeal for curiosity, openness, and tolerance, it is welcomed. But [what
if multiple worldviews do not harmonize]{.underline}? [What if some
worldviews condone **slavery**, deny individual **human rights**,
justify **genocide**]{.underline}, discriminate against women (Islam in
Saudi Arabia) or minorities (Uighurs in China), wage holy war against
the infidel, and so on? [In the **flattened ontology** that
relationalists advocate]{.underline}, are all worldviews "true" or
"moral"?

[The issue here is not whether human beings are entangled but what the
**content** of that entanglement is]{.underline}. The content of
entanglement is what Haas and I try to get at with the concept of
"ideological distance," whether worldviews are converging or diverging.
67 [According to relationalists, the quantum social world is
**cooperative**; ideological distance is always at or **near
zero**]{.underline}. [Conversely, the Weberian world is
**conflictual**]{.underline}; [ideological distance is always positive
and sometimes large]{.underline}. As Alexander Wendt explains:

Whether social life is atomistic or entangled, however, does not tell us
much about outcomes. The master--slave relationship is entangled but not
cooperative. The relationship between liberal states in the democratic
peace is separate but not conflictual. No conflict in either case may
mean no freedom to challenge slavery or democracy, and therefore no
moral accountability -- a totalitarian entanglement for which no one is
responsible and which, apparently, no one can change.

Over time, of course, the content of social entanglement does change.
Outright slavery is no longer acceptable. Communism, at least in the
Soviet form, is gone. How does such change occur, and who is responsible
for the original conflict and its eventual outcome? Katzenstein writes:
"Divergent worldviews do not get resolved by appeals to logic and
evidence but through individual experiences and social processes." 69
So, how do "individual experience" and "social processes" accomplish
this resolution? [If **logic** and **evidence** are ruled out, what are
the means of resolution]{.underline} -- [**emotion**, **habit**,
**intuition**, etc]{.underline}.? [Are these means peaceful or
violent]{.underline}? [Practically everyone agrees that Nazism had to be
defeated by **rationalist instruments**]{.underline} (Grove might say
assemblages) of power; Nazi ideology could not be blended or
accommodated by relationalist effects of norms.

The relationalist worldview lacks any ethical standard for evaluating or
resolving divergencies in the content of alternative worldviews.
[Everything is local and specific even though the world itself is
holistic and entangled]{.underline}. [And all events are uncertain even
though the quantum model itself is certain and can't be
challenged]{.underline}. [The combination of the **loss of
objectivity**]{.underline} ([no real world behind the observed
one]{.underline}) [and the **multiplicity** of **incommensurable** but
**equivalent worldviews**]{.underline} [leaves almost everything **up
for grabs**]{.underline}. [A flattened ontology leads to a flattened
ethical landscape as well]{.underline}.

Kurki seeks a relational ethic of response-ability: an ability to
respond sensitively, openly, and thoughtfully to human and nonhuman
relationships. 70 It is an appealing insight. But in a world in which
there are no things (individuals) or backgrounds (objective world),
where exactly is this responsibility located, and what is its substance?
[**Grove**, for example, sees violence as relational but not easily
overcome by consciousness-raising]{.underline}. 71 [You can become aware
of relations, he points out, without coming to a sense of the common
good]{.underline}. Kurki ponders the same point about knowledge:
[science]{.underline} "[is part of becoming]{.underline} ... [what this
means is that we do not have clear criteria for good or bad
knowledge]{.underline}." 72 The substance of ethics or knowledge, what
is good and what is bad, is hard to pin down. Even harder to pin down is
the location of ethical responsibility. [In Grove's
examination]{.underline} of presidential powers and nuclear weapons, [he
admits that]{.underline} the president is ultimately unaware of who or
what is in control." 73 And [if no one is in control, no one has
responsibility]{.underline}.

Responsibility is not merely the "ability to respond." It's the ability
to respond "by someone or something" in a "substantive" way toward some
moral "end." Weber distinguished between an "ethic of responsibility,"
which Kurki's formulation might capture, and an "ethic of ultimate
ends," which Kurki does not consider. 74 Perhaps this is because an
ethic of ultimate ends requires more than a relationship; it requires a
direction, an arrow, not simply a flat surface or "fold."

As noted earlier, Grove suggests that "the scale of the investigator ...
radically alters what appears as a part and what appears as a whole." If
that's the case, the individual investigator, the individual, is back at
the heart of a quantum-based social science model. 75 The Weberian
commitment to the individual human being as the source of meaning and
morality in a multiscalar world remains indispensable. That does not
rule out agency at other levels. Relationalist factors are multiple,
real, and often confining. But, to a meaningful extent, they form out of
the interpretations and interactions of reasoning individuals, they
change because of individual initiatives, and they dissolve because
individuals leave and join other relationships. The only "authenticated"
actors beyond the individual in a Weberian worldview, therefore, are
those groups, institutions, classes, etc., that are chosen or affirmed
voluntarily by the consent of individual human beings acting in a
setting where they have a meaningful degree of choice. Holistic
worldviews diminish that degree of choice and consent, however
well-meaning they may be by embracing all possibilities.

[The Weberian view **judges** and **chooses**]{.underline}. That is
neither easy nor pleasant. No one wants to be accused of being
judgmental. But we all do it. 76 Indeed, how does one avoid it? The
[Holocaust was a **monstrous act of evil**]{.underline}. How do we
understand it in a world that blends religion and science? As Barnett
(Chapter 5) shows, [the Holocaust poses a wrenching question of
existence, not just a **vague smearing**]{.underline} [of relationships
and]{.underline} "[response-ability]{.underline}" [to **change** or
**becoming**]{.underline}. [If such a question can be answered only in a
**specific situation**]{.underline} (when the quantum wave function
collapses), [then we have **abandoned** both **our humanity** and our
influence on world affairs]{.underline}.

Am I forcing everyone into a Weberian worldview? 77 Possibly, but I am
not saying that the Weberian view is the only view. I am saying that I
can find a location in the Weberian universe to host an alternative
point of view (and do so when I compare the worldviews in this volume;
see earlier in this chapter); I cannot find such a location in a
relationalist universe. At the beginning, this project postulated a
revolution in natural and social science thought rejecting Enlightenment
and Newtonian worldviews. In later stages, Katzenstein emphasized
complementarities among Newtonian and Post-Newtonian worldviews. 78 By
complementarity, however, Katzenstein forces the Newtonian view into the
relationalist universe where "[the determinist or probability-inflected
Newtonian world]{.underline} can be thought of as a special case that
[reveals itself when the quantum world of infinite possibilities and
radical uncertainty **collapses**]{.underline}." 79 **[Bottom
line]{.underline}**? [There is **no location** in the relationist world
for dissent]{.underline}. Alternatives either fit into the quantum world
or are patently false.

Moreover, understanding another worldview does not mean accepting it or
making it equivalent. Would the world be better off today if the
Reformation and Enlightenment had not occurred, or if the Haitian lwa
not the Weberian worldview had dominated world politics after 1600? 80
Best, you say, if neither dominated? OK, but spell out the global
consequences of the Haitian worldview or the specific parameters of
equal coexistence which makes all worldviews (fascism, communism)
acceptable and worth learning from. Unless we specify "what" we learn
from "which" worldview, we are simply treating worldviews like
souvenirs, collecting and trivializing them. Worse, we are opening the
floodgates to any worldview with no standard for judging good and bad.
Maybe the relationalist turn pops open an irresistible, new window of a
more harmonious world that we have missed because of the atomistic and
competitive frame of western modernism. But maybe it doesn't. And if it
doesn't, not only material progress but individual freedom is at stake.

Which leads to a final question: where do relationalist cosmologies
place the divine? What lies behind the Big Bang? Relationalists are
eager to unify the human and natural worlds and see a growing
commonality between science and religion. The obstacle to unifying the
human and natural worlds, however, is an understanding of consciousness
which humans have and nonhumans do not. And the obstacle to uniting the
scientific and religious (supranatural) worlds is an understanding of
the soul, the human capacity to imagine the divine. 81 Separating these
three worlds -- nature, humanity, and the divine -- has led to abuse:
humanity masquerading as gods (the Church before the Enlightenment) or
humanity "lifted up" to control nature (the critics' view of the
Enlightenment). But uniting them may lead to even worse abuse. What
stands in the way of a science that poses as a religion or a nature that
restrains prosperity? 82 [By **blurring** the distinction between
religion and science, nature and humanity, relationalism weakens
Enlightenment institutions]{.underline} that separate state and church,
markets and feudalism. [It enables potentially powerful **new gods** of
**unchallenged expertise** and science to take the stage]{.underline}
([because]{.underline}, remember, [there is **no objective**
universe]{.underline}). [We could wind up again in a pre-Enlightenment
world wherein scientists and their authoritarian enablers usurp the
power of privilege to **suppress** the rights of reasoning individuals.
Resistance would be anti-science and futile]{.underline}, as it was
anti-God and heresy in pre-Enlightenment times. As Timothy Byrnes
writes, "[if a relational cosmology is grounded in faith or in the
pursuit of what is 'really real,' then the unknown itself is the basis
of Truth and the human propensity to resistance is ultimately
futile]{.underline}." 83 [And if the unknown is truth and cannot be
resisted, the Dark Ages may be upon us once agai]{.underline}n.

6.5 Conclusion

[I come back to]{.underline} the need, therefore, to [maintain a
Weberian worldview, whatever the debate in physics]{.underline}, if only
to retain a "critical" perspective on the totalizing tendencies of the
relationalist school of thought. As Mike Barnett concludes, "[Without
worldviews we would not know how to go on, and would be lost in the
wilds until a charismatic leader arrived to provide
guidance]{.underline}." 84 In the barren "wilds" of relationalism (the
jungle), that charismatic leader would probably be a totalizing
ideology, one admitting of no alternatives -- radical Islam under the
Caliphate, Medieval Christianity under the Inquisition, totalitarian
atheism under fascism and communism, or scientific elitism under a
relationalist banner that substitutes expertise for politics and human
choice. The Weberian worldview is still a necessary defense against that
sort of evil.
