6.2 The Means of Influence for Small States Within NATO

The important strategic location of Denmark and Norway in the Cold War
context helped them to set conditions on their membership. Restrictions
on membership were a special measure considering the tense international
situation and the fact that it was not employed by the other Allies (at
least to the same degree). Denmark was in the key position as a \"cork\"
to the Baltic Sea and because it possessed Greenland. The \"Greenland
card\" was skillfully played by the Danish decision-makers to increase
their negotiation position vis-à-vis the US. In the late 1950s, the
Danish decision- makers often emphasized that the US air bases in
Greenland must be taken into ac- count when making an overall assessment
of Denmark\'s contribution to NATO, which was seen as a veiled threat by
the US decision-makers.

Norway was obviously important to NATO due to its border with the Soviet
Union, and as a key to controlling the sea lines of communication over
the Atlantic. Early in the Cold War the Norwegian negotiation position
vis-à-vis the US was also improved because it was considered that the
Norwegians had an influence on Denmark and Iceland.\" When the Soviet
military build-up in the Kola region increased in the 1970s, Norway\'s
location became even more important.

Later on, the Danish and Norwegian nuclear restrictions were accepted by
the other Allies because the non-nuclear status of these countries had
come to be regarded by the other Allies as an accepted part of the
equilibrium in Northern Europe, and more generally of the European
order.?

It has been interpreted in Denmark that its important strategic location
and possession of Greenland allowed it more freedom in defense spending;
Denmark had a \" discount\" on defense spending thanks to Greenland.\"
At the 1978 Summit in Washington, the Allies decided that they would
increase their defense budgets by 3% of net growth yearly. Denmark
submitted a formal reservation to this decision, provoking accusations
of freeloading by the other Allies (especially the US).

[A country\'s use of its **important strategic location** to increase
its **bargaining power** is]{.underline} a means [identified
in]{.underline} the classical variant of [Realism]{.underline} (see
1.3): [the **bargaining power** of **small allies** in a bipolar world
increases when they **control resources** needed by the
superpowers]{.underline}. There is an interesting paradox related to the
ability of small states to set conditions on their membership. They had
more influence when they joined in a Realist context (i.e. during the
early Cold War). After all, it is assumed in Realism that the influence
of small states is marginal.\'

In the post-Cold War environment[, small NATO members hav]{.underline}e
also [played the \"**strategic card**\".]{.underline} While still an
aspirant state, some Hungarian officials gave the impression that
allowing NATO bases in Hungary would be an important contribution which
would allow the country to postpone purchases of new systems and army
re- forms.\" In order to improve their membership prospects, the
Southern European NATO candidates (Bulgaria and Romania) have appealed
to their important location and to their assistance to NATO during the
Kosovo crisis. Romania and Bulgaria have assisted the US also in the
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and offered bases to be used
in a possible attack against Iraq.\" [**Bulgaria** and **Romania** seem
to have benefited from playing the **strategic card**: they are **very
likely** to receive a membership invitation at the Prague Summit, even
though they have problems in fulfilling NATO\'s political
criteria.]{.underline} \'2

Since NATO is an Alliance of democracies, [**Liberal means of
influence** have also proved effective. One of them is appealing to
**domestic pressures** and **constraints**]{.underline} (see 1.3).
Denmark and Norway played the Cold War. [To counter the constant
criticism of its low defense spending, Denmark replied that additional
spending would nurture anti-NATO and neutralistic attitudes in the
country]{.underline}.\' According to the Norwegian decision-makers,
Norway was entitled to have the special restrictions on its membership
because it was a \"special case\" = not only was it located next to the
eastern superpower but public opinion in the country was critical. 14

[The domestic card was also played by]{.underline} the [Scandinavian
Allies]{.underline} in NATO\'s internal discussions on Greek and Turkish
membership in the early 1950s - though without success. The [Danish
Prime Minister argued that the majority of Danes supported NATO as a
**political alliance**, not as a **military alliance**]{.underline} -
the membership of Greece and Turkey would strengthen the latter view and
thereby endanger the ratification of the enlargement in the Danish
Folketing.\' When campaigning for NATO and EU membership, the leaders of
Central and Eastern European countries appealed to domestic pressures -
to the frustration of their citizens if the reforms and sacrifices did
not bring results.

[An example of skillful argumentation is an appeal to NATO\'s
fundamental values as an **alliance of democracies**]{.underline}.
[Appealing to the values underpinning NATO is a typical Liberal means of
influence used both during and after the Cold War by **several small
Allies**]{.underline}. In the Cold War era, it was used by Denmark and
Norway when opposing Greek and Turkish membership. The Scandinavian
Allies stressed NATO\'s character as an organization of democracies and
pointed out that Greece and Turkey were not like- minded states.

When campaigning for NATO membership, [the Czech Republic and Hungary
appealed to the fundamental values of the Euro-Atlantic liberal
community and presented themselves as a **natural part** of that
community]{.underline}. To some extent, [the leaders of the US and
Germany]{.underline} - the key players in the first post-Cold War
enlargement round [were **responsive** to these arguments]{.underline}.
16

[The Danes]{.underline} have [promoted the inclusion of the Baltic
states in NATO by]{.underline}, for instance, [referring to NATO as a
value community of democracies and by stressing every democracy\'s right
to join NATO]{.underline}. The logic of this argument perpetuates the
enlargement process; NATO\'s door cannot be closed as long as there are
democratic countries outside. Frank Schimmelfennig has noted that the
public commitment to the moral aspects of enlargement in the first round
makes it difficult for the supporters of the first round not to support
further enlargement - even though their motivation for the first
enlargement round might have been selfish.\'

[Another example of skillful argumentation]{.underline} in Denmark\'s
support of the Baltic states\' membership aspirations [is to stress a
merit-based approach to the selection of new members]{.underline}. This
is an efficient means, since merits are the best justification for
Baltic membership. The Balkan candidates can refer to the importance of
their location to NATO\'s operations in the Balkans and to the aid they
gave NATO in the Kosovo conflict. Denmark has been vocal in keeping up
the official NATO position that all interested European democracies
should have the same opportunities to join NATO regardless of their
history or geography.\" The Danes were active in the establishment of
the MAP process, which gives NATO a means to evaluate the candidate
countries\' progress.

A [relevant means of influence is activism and the proposing of
**initiatives**]{.underline}. The activism of small states in the Cold
War NATO was limited by the fact that they needed NATO for security
protection, and possible efforts for activism were conducted in other
international organizations. Moreover, NATO\'s agenda was much more
limited than it is now. Still, [there are examples of **small-state
activism** in **NATO** even during the Cold War. For example, in the
1960s, Denmark and Norway took an active part in NATO discussions and
managed to have their voice heard in drafting the Harmel
report.]{.underline}

Particularly since the Cold War, [activism is required from any small
country which wants to have influence within NATO.]{.underline} In
contrast to the Cold War circumstances, the control of an important
resource needed by leading NATO members is not enough. A good example of
post-Cold War activism in NATO is Denmark, especially its efforts to
promote Baltic membership. [Danish activism has taken place at different
levels: bilateral relations, the framework of the PP program, and
internal NATO discussions.]{.underline}

Means of influence deriving from NATO\'s decision-making system are
capable representatives in different NATO councils, securing high NATO
posts for a citizen of one\'s own country and skillful
coalition-building. Since [representatives of small member
states]{.underline} seldom present an initiative without prior
consultation, an [ability to align with like-minded states and persuade
those opposing is of **great importance**]{.underline}. Coalitions are
not only built among different member states, but [coalition-building
can take place at the level of representatives of governmental sub-units
of different countries. These \"transgovernmental\" coalitions aim at
**influencing public opinion** in the **leading country** of the
**Alliance**.\"]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Normal Means -- Yes Consensus

#### Normal means is [consensus]{.underline} -- [every]{.underline} decision at [all]{.underline} levels is [required]{.underline} to use it

The treaty does not specify how the Alliance should make decisions,
except for Article 10 which states that "unanimous agreement" is
required to invite new members into the NATO Alliance.3 Beyond this
clear directive on decision-making, the rest of [[NATO's decision-making
process was left]{.underline}]{.mark} by the founders of the Alliance
[[to determine]{.mark} for [themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[While]{.mark} decision-making through [**consensus** is nothing
new]{.mark} within alliances]{.underline} and organizations, [[its
**sole use** in determining **all**]{.mark} **[decisions]{.mark}** at
**all levels** of an organization [is **unique**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Numerous [other international organizations]{.underline}, such as the
United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund, [utilize]{.underline} the
**[consensus]{.underline}** principle [as part of]{.underline} their
**[decision-making]{.underline}** process, [but none of them use it as
their **sole** process.]{.underline}4 Despite a growing Alliance where
reaching consensus will become harder and harder, keeping NATO's current
"consensus rule" is paramount for the Alliance to maintain its
legitimacy and influence throughout the ever-changing global security
environment. As described on the NATO website, "[[**All NATO decisions**
are]{.mark} made [by consensus]{.mark}, after discussion and
consultation among]{.underline} member [countries]{.underline}. [A
decision reached by [consensus is]{.mark} an agreement [reached by
**common consent**]{.mark}, a decision that is **accepted** by each
member country ... \[an\] expression of the **c[ollective will]{.mark}**
[of **all**]{.mark} the sovereign states that are [members]{.mark} of
the Alliance. [This]{.mark} principle [is applied at **every**]{.mark}
**committee [level]{.mark}** and demonstrates clearly that NATO
decisions are **collective decisions** made by its member countries ...
The **[consensus]{.mark}** principle **[applies throughout
NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}."5 [[Three times]{.mark} in its history
[NATO has undergone a]{.mark} thorough [review of its]{.mark} committee
[organization and]{.mark}]{.underline} structure. The first took place
in 1990 following the end of the Cold War, again in 2002 following the
9/11 terror attacks, and the most recent review was in June 2010. [[**In
all three** instances, the Alliance **retained**]{.mark} the principle
of **[consensus]{.mark} decision-making**, [applying it within
**every**]{.mark} **committee and working [group]{.mark}** [at **all
levels**]{.mark} of NATO.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- NATO Channels -- Yes Consensus

#### The plan's use of [formal channels]{.underline} to make a [decision]{.underline} must be [unanimous]{.underline} -- their ev is about individual [subgroups]{.underline} conducting [independent]{.underline} "NATO operations"

NATO\'s Structure

Headquartered in Brussels, [[NATO is a **consensus-based** alliance in
which decisions **must** be **unanimous**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[However]{.underline}, **[[individual]{.mark} states]{.underline}** [or
**[subgroups]{.mark}** of allies [can **initiate action outside
NATO**]{.mark}'s auspices]{.underline}. For instance, [the United
States, France, and the United Kingdom began policing]{.underline} a
UN-sanctioned no-fly zone in [Libya in early 2011 and]{.underline},
within days, **[[transfer]{.mark}red [command]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
the operation [[to]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[once]{.underline} Turkey's [concerns had been allayed]{.underline}.
[Member states are [not required to participate in every **NATO
operation**]{.mark}]{.underline}; Germany and Poland declined to
contribute directly to the campaign in Libya.

[NATO\'s Secretary-General]{.underline} George Robertson [invoked the
\"**silence procedure**]{.underline}\" last Thursday, setting 0900 GMT
Monday as the deadline. **[[If no member]{.mark} state [breaks the
silence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[NATO would regard it as]{.mark} a
**[consensus]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the issue [and would immediately
set out making military plans]{.underline} in this respect.

[The [move of France and Belgium was]{.mark}]{.underline} widely
regarded as [[a **clear indication** of]{.mark} the deepening
**[divide]{.mark}**]{.underline} among NATO member states on the Iraq
issue.

[The \"silence procedure\" is one of the often-used
prerogatives]{.underline} of the secretary-general, [who will decide on
the length of the silence based on the nature of the issue under
