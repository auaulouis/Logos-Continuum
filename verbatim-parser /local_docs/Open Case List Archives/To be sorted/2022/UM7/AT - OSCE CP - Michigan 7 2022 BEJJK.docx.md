# AFF -- OSCE CP 

### 2AC -- Perm do the CP 

#### All NATO member's are in the OSCE -- the counterplan engages with their individual member states that is obviously a way the plan could be done

[The membership of NATO, the EU and the OSCE **overlap to a large
degree** (figures A and B). Moreover, this membership overlap has
increased, especially after NATO's and the EU's eastern expansions,
driving increased interaction, but also causing several
interorganizational problems.]{.underline}

NATO, with a total of 30 member states, and the EU, consisting of 27,
share 21 member states (figure C). The member states that are only a
member of the EU and not of NATO are five neutral EU states (Austria,
Finland, Ireland, Malta and Sweden) as well as Cyprus. The member states
that are only a member of NATO and not of the EU are six European states
(Albania, Iceland, North Macedonia, Norway, Turkey and the UK), as well
as the two North American members: Canada and the USA.

[As for the OSCE, all the EU states and **all NATO states also
participate in the OSCE**]{.underline}. Thus, of its total of 57 member
states, the OSCE shares 27 with the EU and 30 with NATO, leaving a total
of 23 states as participants in the OSCE alone (figure D).

### 2AC -- INB -- No Moldova Impact 

#### No Moldova impact -- Russia won't invade they have already sustained heavy losses

**Parker 22** \[Claire Parker, 04-26-2022, "What is Transnistria, and
will Russia advance toward Moldova?, The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/22/ukraine-moldova-transnistria-russia/\]\\\\pairie

[How likely is a Russian advance toward the region?]{.underline}

[**Not very**, analysts say.]{.underline}

Russia has reoriented its military efforts on gaining control of the
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, after attempts to seize Kyiv, the
capital, and broader swaths of Ukraine failed. [The Russian military has
**sustained heavy losses** during its two-month assault and significant
battlefield reversals that surprised many observers and exposed its
weaknesses.]{.underline}

"The conversation about Transnistria is a complete canard," said Michael
Kofman, a Russia expert at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis
organization in Arlington, Va. ["The Russian military has **no capacity
for this kind of offensive**. It's very likely that they will be a spent
force after the offensive in Donbas."]{.underline}

Kofman said the statement from Minnekaev, the Russian commander, that
Moscow intended to take control of southern Ukraine wasn't new. "They
literally tried this in phase one," he said.

Russian attempts to advance beyond the southern Ukrainian city of
Mykolaiv made little headway, leaving southwestern Ukraine under Kyiv's
control.

Moldova's foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, said at an event hosted by the
German Marshall Fund in Washington this week that [the situation in
Transnistria is "more or less calm" and that Moldova had not seen signs
of any unusual military activity there.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- INB -- Not Key 

#### OSCE not key to Moldova conflict prevention -- past empirics prove 

**Khorolskaya 22** \[Maria Khorolskaya, 01-01-2022, "OSCE's Involvement
in Conflict Resolution Across the Post-Soviet Space, moderndiplomacy,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/01/01/osces-involvement-in-conflict-resolution-across-the-post-soviet-space/\]\\\\pairie

[The OSCE participated in the settlement of the Transnistrian conflict
**once its most acute phase** had been **overcome.**]{.underline} In
particular, the organisation was puzzled by the signing of a ceasefire
agreement and the establishment of the Joint Control Commission (JCC),
consisting of representatives of the armed forces of Moldova, Russia and
the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. According to its mandate, the
mission should assist in laying the groundwork for dialogue between
Chisinau and Tiraspol, collecting information about the situation in the
region, providing consultations, and encouraging negotiations on the
conclusion of an agreement on the status of the PMR and the withdrawal
of foreign troops. Late in 1999, the mandate of the OSCE mission was
expanded with the additional task of "ensuring transparency of the
removal and destruction of Russian ammunition and armaments".

The participation of the OSCE mission in the settlement of the crisis is
ensured both through observers and through involvement in the
negotiation process. The OSCE, along with Russia and Ukraine, is a
guarantor of the 5+2 format. Over 28 years, the mission has helped to
resolve a number of issues, including the opening of traffic on the
bridge across the Dnieper River near the village of Gura Bîcului,
providing Moldovan farmers with access to plots in the Dubăsari District
of Transnistria, recognition of documents and license plates, etc.
[However, one **cannot speak of a substantial intermediary contribution
by the OSCE** to the conflict resolution process. Progress in this
process can only be achieved by changing the policies of the leading
actors. Thus, the proposals of the mission representatives on possible
ways out of the crisis **did not find support** in Chisinau and
Tiraspol]{.underline} (1993 Report No. 13 by T. Williams, Head of
Mission, proposing a special status for Transdniestria) \[4\].

### 2AC -- INB -- OSCE Fails

#### It fails -- every country has an effective veto power which makes punishing aggressors impossible 

**Garibov 16** \[Azad Garibov, 05-11-2016, "Why the OSCE Keeps Failing
to Make Peace in Nagorno-Karabakh, The National Interest,
[https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-osce-keeps-failing-make-peace-nagorno-karabakh-16161\]\\\\pairie](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-osce-keeps-failing-make-peace-nagorno-karabakh-16161%5d\\pairie)

Above all, it should be noted that the OSCE is an intergovernmental
organization with no supranational powers. [This intergovernmentalism
means that any OSCE activity in any member country, and any mission
deployed on behalf of the organization, is subject to unanimous approval
from all member states, and particularly the country to which the
activity or mission pertains. Thus, every country in the organization
has an **effective veto power** on any decision]{.underline}. In 1996
the OSCE was unable to include the famous "three principles" (the
territorial integrity of both countries, self-determination for
Nagorno-Karabakh in the form of the highest degree of self-rule within
Azerbaijan, and guaranteed security for Nagorno-Karabakh and its whole
population) in the Lisbon declaration due to Armenia's objection,
despite winning the support of 53 out of 54 member states. [This
**essential systemic weakness** constrains the OSCE's effectiveness in
many cases, including in conflict areas when there is need **to punish
aggressors** and protect victims.]{.underline}

In considering shortcomings peculiar to Minsk Group itself, the biggest
problem is that it tries not to hurt anyone. The Minsk Group tries to
seem neutral, and this near-obsession with neutrality does not allow it
to be fair and impartial. It is claimed that openly naming Armenia as an
aggressor country and calling for the fulfillment of U.N. Security
Council resolutions---which entails unconditional withdrawal of forces
from Nagorno-Karabakh---might discredit the OSCE Minsk group in the eyes
of Armenian side. However, it does not mean that OSCE can play this game
of neutrality over justice forever. The Minsk Group's co-chairs avoid
making clear-cut statements about their positions on Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict. They avoid bringing up the fact of occupation; they make
general and vague statements at best, or indeed make contradictory
declarations depending on whether they are in Baku or Yerevan. In so
doing, they claim that they are addressing the resolution of the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, when there is need for a firm
position, the co-chairs state that Armenia and Azerbaijan should find a
solution themselves since it is their problem, and that the Minsk Group
will support any decision they make. This attitude and the visible
failure of shuttle diplomacy has resulted in such widespread distrust in
OSCE Minsk Group's activity that the Azerbaijani media has begun to
re­fer to the co-chairs' visits to the region as "tourist excursions."

[The **lack of interest** and consequent **lack of commitment** on the
part of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chair countries to the resolution
process is another visible setback]{.underline}. The co-chairs seem to
be dealing much more with "conflict management"---trying to reduce the
tensions between parties via occasional visits to re­gion---than with a
"conflict resolution mechanism". The Minsk group has monopolized the
resolution process of the conflict, but lacks the needed commitment to
push the process forward. This lack of commitment is also seen in the
form of the low level of involvement by co-chair countries in the
resolution process. The involvement of more mid- or high-level diplomats
and politicians might prove effective in accelerating the peace process.
Talks that carry high-level international commitment---such as the 2001
Key West negotiations, which involved the US president George
Bush---might be a necessary change, given that this low-profile shuttle
diplomacy seems to be failing. History shows that when major powers are
interested and committed, they are able to facilitate effective
negotiations to find a solution to the complex conflicts similar to
Nagorno-Karabakh. To give comparable examples, during the bloody
dissolution of Yugoslavia, the U.S. commitment and appointment of a
special representative was key in hammering out the 1995 Dayton
Agreement, while French president Jacques Chirac's personal involvement
played the same role in reaching the 1999 Rambouillet Accords.

Moreover, if in the beginning OSCE involvement as a mediator was
intended to represent impartial international involvement, [today the
OSCE Minsk Group's approach is a troika-based approach rather than a
genuine and inclusive OSCE approach. The OSCE seems to have **little
influence over the Minsk Group**; three chair states are in a full
control of the process.]{.underline} On top of that, the three members
of troika have their own divergent positions on the peace process, which
further hampers the prospect of successful negotiations. Russia has
frequently sought to dominate the process, while the United States
increased its attention when its stakes rose in the South Caucasus.
Moreover, the domestic considerations of these three countries also play
a certain role in their approach to the peace process and conflict
parties. The three co-chair countries are home to the largest,
wealthiest and best-organized Armenian diasporas. For instance, at the
beginning of the 1990s, the Armenian lobby managed to block U.S.
financial support to Azerbaijan under the "Free­dom Support Act" (FSA)
program; in addition, the US ambassadorial nominee to Azerbaijan in 2010
was blocked by influential senators representing U.S. states with
powerful Armenian communities. It should also be noted that Moscow is
Yerevan's closest strategic ally, and Armenia is frequently claimed to
have de facto protectorate-metropolis relations with Russia.

#### OSCE structurally fails -- deep internal divisions and political crises can't be resolved by the counterplan

**Günther 22** \[Mirco Günther, 02-15-2022, "We have an institution to
ensure peace in Europe," \<\<Mirco heads the FES Regional Office in
Asia\>\>, IPS,
[https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/foreign-and-security-policy/we-have-an-institution-to-ensure-peace-in-europe-5716/\]\\\\pairie](https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/foreign-and-security-policy/we-have-an-institution-to-ensure-peace-in-europe-5716/%5d\\pairie)

[The OSCE is mired in **permanent crisis, verging on paralysis.**
Because of the OSCE's **deep internal divisions and the prevailing
consensus rule,** however, far-reaching decisions are rather the
exception. When they do happen, OSCE decisions carry considerable
normative weight -- as with the establishment of the OSCE monitoring
mission at the onset of the Ukraine crisis in 2014.]{.underline} Sadly,
such diplomatic success stories are rare. The OSCE is mired in permanent
crisis, verging on paralysis. The Swedish chairmanship in 2021 ended
with few substantive achievements. The OSCE-hosted Human Dimension
Implementation Meeting, Europe's largest human rights conference, was
blocked by Russia. Election monitoring missions are regularly disputed.
Agreements are reached only with great difficulty, if at all, even on
largely operational matters, such as the annual budget or the agenda for
the annual security conference. In 2020, the Organization stared into
the abyss when, in an unprecedented leadership crisis, its four most
important posts lay vacant for several months, including that of
secretary general. What is the OSCE? All these challenges stem from
fundamental differences concerning the OSCE's core purpose. Western
states emphasise the Organization's uniquely comprehensive approach to
security, encompassing political-military, economic, environmental, and
human rights issues, which emerged from Helsinki. A number of eastern
participating countries have strong reservations about its human rights
agenda. If the OSCE were to be founded today, it is almost inconceivable
that an agreement could be reached on its very principles, including the
Paris Charter for Europe's post-Cold War order. Over the years, there
have been more than one attempt to bring about meaningful reforms, but
to little avail. It seems unlikely that future OSCE chairs will have
more success: Poland this year, followed by North Macedonia, Estonia (to
be confirmed) and Finland. The price of peace Many actors bear
responsibility for the OSCE's sorry state. [Moscow, for example, has
repeatedly weakened OSCE mandates and operational capabilities, while at
the same time lamenting the Organization's lacking relevance. Countries
like Armenia and Azerbaijan often **obstruct even** the **simplest
decisions on procedural matters**, following a logic of national
rivalry.]{.underline} Various host countries have limited the mandates
of OSCE field operations, although it needs to be recognised that this
is their sovereign right. Western countries, too, have sold the OSCE
short, preferring other organisations or bilateral formats. Moreover,
many states continue to prioritise austerity policies and fail to give
the Organization the financial resources it needs. The presence of
unarmed international observers along the contact line in Eastern
Ukraine has made a significant difference. At the same time, there is
rarely any other organisation in the world that offers security at a
more reasonable price. Its regular annual budget of around €138 million
is modest by international standards. The Ukraine observation mission
has a separate budget of around €100 million. In 2020, the OSCE had more
than 3,500 staff from 51 countries in 20 locations. Its achievements are
considerable, as the Ukraine conflict highlights. A key role in Ukraine
The presence of unarmed international observers along the contact line
in Eastern Ukraine has made a significant difference, albeit often far
away from public awareness. Local Ukrainians have worked side by side
with Americans, Russians, and Europeans. According to a report by the
observers, between July 2019 and October 2021 the OSCE mediated more
than 3,000 local ceasefires. Repair works on critical water and
electricity infrastructure have given millions of civilians access to
fundamental services. In publicly available daily reports, the OSCE
documents compliance (and any non-compliance) with the 2015 Minsk
Protocol and is an indispensable neutral voice on the ground. With this
in mind, it is greatly worrying that some participating states have
decided to pull out their observers fearing further escalation. There
are a number of reasons why the OSCE's important work does not receive
broader attention. For one thing, its observers are often subjected to
obstructions. They are denied access to the relevant regions and sites,
their freedom of movement is restricted, and OSCE unmanned aerial drones
are interfered with or shot down. The Organization registered a total of
93,902 ceasefire violations in 2021, which exceeds its capacity to
broker ceasefires many times. Moreover, given the current geopolitical
dynamics and fast-paced high-level diplomacy on the world stage, the
often cumbersome de-escalation work in the very conflict zone tends to
get less attention. A future platform for European security In light of
all this, what role can the OSCE play in pursuit of a future European
security order? As in any organisation, this ultimately comes down to
the political will of the participating states. [A number of OSCE key
actors currently exhibit a **lack of such will**. As things stand, the
most obvious approach -- namely not to re-invent the wheel but to dust
off the organisation and reinvigorate it -- is therefore hardly an
option.]{.underline} In the long run, however, we will need a joint
platform for European security. [The crisis of the OSCE is not of
operational or technical nature, but deeply political]{.underline}.
Needless to say that this is profoundly regrettable, given its unique
wealth of experience in early warning and conflict prevention, as well
as crisis management and resolution, and its tried-and-tested toolbox of
confidence-building measures -- among them the mechanism about 'unusual
military activities' under the OSCE Vienna Document Ukraine is using to
seek clarification from Russia.

### 2AC -- INB -- OSCE Fails -- Ukraine

#### OSCE is a complete failure -- an OSCE state has invading Ukraine proves 

**Bloed 22** \[Arie Bloed, 02-25-2022, "Is this the death of the OSCE
Decalogue?", Security and Human Rights Monitor,
https://www.shrmonitor.org/is-this-the-death-of-the-osce-decalogue/\]\\\\pairie

[At the same time it also means that an organization like the OSCE has
**failed in all respects** to ensure the fulfillment of its key
function, i.e. ensuring a stable environment in the OSCE area through
its cooperative and comprehensive security approac]{.underline}h. In
particular in the post-Cold War period the OSCE became an impressive
'community of values' and 'community of responsibility'. At the Astana
Summit, just 11 years ago, there was even talk of a joint vision of a
Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian security. By adhering to a constantly
developing number of basic norms and values in the OSCE region, the
East-West divide turned into a region with largely common norms and
values, not only in the area of peace and security, but also in the
areas of the human and the economic and environmental dimensions.

What is more, OSCE participating states did not only aim at the
development of a highly sophisticated system of norms and rules, but
also at a system that aimed at providing each other support, whenever
countries were considered to be in need of help. [This 'joint
responsibility' for the fulfilment of the basic norms and standards,
based on the idea of "indivisible security" has been fatally affected in
the case of the Russian military attack against Ukraine since a key
**OSCE state refused to comply** with the most fundamental rules which
it had helped create itself.]{.underline}

[The 'community of responsibility', however, is also **largely ignored
by the other OSCE** states, which of course are competing with each
other in condemning the Russian actions in words, but at the same time
refusing to provide meaningful help to the Ukrainian government and
people by only imposing non-military sanctions. Furthermore, there were
few serious attempts within the OSCE during the past few months and
years to move beyond **stubborn public diplomacy** to real negotiations
on resolving the crisis in and around Ukraine.]{.underline} Also this
behavior has made the community of responsibility as a core element of
the OSCE philosophy of promoting peace and security in the Eurasian area
void of a substantial meaning. If a partner such as Ukraine which is
overrun by a much more powerful army by another OSCE state and then is
largely left on its own, the philosophy of a 'family of nations' has
been totally undermined.

The Russian occupation of the Crimea in 2014 was already a clear sign
that the Russian Federation was acting in violation of the most
fundamental principles of international law, but at least it still made
an effort to show that it felt obliged to take these principles
seriously, for instance through the organization of a (fraudulent)
referendum about Crimea joining the Russian territory as an act of
'self-determination'. In the case of the war against Ukraine the Russian
authorities are going further by not even making a serious effort
anymore to reconcile their military acts with the 'law book'.

Instead it is playing now by the old-fashioned, 19th-century book of
power politics and geographical expansionism to ensure its 'national
security', no longer hindered by legal niceties such as principles of
non-aggression, inviolability of borders or non-interference in internal
affairs -- principles that were already enshrined in the UN Charter to
save future generations from the scourge of war.

The result is that the European continent (and the world) has been
thrown back into a political nightmare where the carefully developed
checks and balances in the volatile international security system have
been discarded and where the world has been thrown back in a security
jungle where power politics has taken over from basic principles and
norms. The damage caused by this unilateral Russian action goes way
beyond the bilateral Russian-Ukrainian relation and is dangerously
undermining the whole system which has given Europe a longer period of
peace than ever before.

[Although the OSCE has achieved a lot over the past decades, in
particular also in the most challenging environments, the open Russian
aggression against a neighbouring country is the most serious crisis
which the OSCE has faced in its existence. As a matter of fact, the
basis on which the organization has been functioning has been largely
taken away.]{.underline}

#### OSCE is has structural problems their failure in Ukraine proves 

**Semeniy 22** \[Oleksiy Semeniy, June 2022, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE WAR IN
UKRAINE FOR THE OSCE,"\<\<Dr Semeniy is a Direct of Institute for Global

[Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is a vital test for the
OSCE]{.underline}. For many years the OSCE has been seen as failing to
prevent or de-escalate (not to even mention sustainably settle)
conflicts in Europe. It now needs to be united and deliver feasible
results to remain a useful element of European security. However, its
activity in Ukraine from 2014 until 24 February 2022 was also partially
successful in organizational terms. It is worthy of astonishment how
swiftly the OSCE succeeded in reorienting its country office and
launched its special monitoring mission (SMM) in Ukraine in 2014. For
those eight years the SMM was mostly an effective tool for many
de-escalatory efforts and a number of successful solutions were
implemented to tackle problems on the line of contact. But these
successes were not enough and were underpinned by a lack of political
backing in Vienna, due to growing political drifts and conflicts among
some participating States, as well as a number of problems with
efficiency at the Secretariat level. [This assessment does not deny the
efforts undertaken by OSCE institutions or the Secretariat, but mainly
refers to the tempo and quality of reactions to **negative developments
in and around Ukraine**. The quite destructive role of a number of OSCE
participating States that wanted to **block some productive
initiatives** also needs to be recognized. Many of the problems relate
to the lack of adequate institutional capacity of the OSCE, because
participating States for many years could not agree on necessary
reforms, tolerating possible **inefficiencies** of the OSCE in critical
situations. Therefore, Ukraine doubts that the OSCE can help settle the
war and conflict with Russia]{.underline}. This negative attitude is
less visible by people or organizations who have co-operated with the
OSCE in different formats or been confronted with its activities -- they
have had possibilities to see the concrete impact of OSCE activities[.
However, the OSCE has not sufficiently promoted its results (even if
moderate) and their practical value to key stakeholders inside Ukraine,
especially to wider Ukrainian society.]{.underline} On the other hand
Ukrainian authorities and society have expected much more clarity (i.e.
on stating the facts and identifying the perpetrators without using
general diplomatic phrases) and prompt reaction from OSCE
representatives (either in the SMM or the office in Kyiv) to the
violations from the Russian side (including its puppets in Donetsk and
Luhansk). It may be these expectations were too high for OSCE staff
because of the Organization's general policy to be viewed as a neutral
and impartial actor (in order to keep Russia on board), but this also
damaged the Organization's image.
