### SC Thumps -- AI/Cyber/Disinformation

#### The SC commits member states to addressing cyber, AI and disinformation

The discussion at the summit about a larger, stronger NATO is playing
out against the backdrop of a [new strategic-concept]{.underline}
document for the alliance --- a vision for its [trajectory for the next
decade]{.underline}. As recently as a year ago, that document was poised
to [focus more broadly on China, climate change and
cybersecurity]{.underline} --- important priorities to be sure, yet
superseded by events on the ground that create an opportunity for the
alliance to concentrate on its core mission of safeguarding freedom and
security in Europe by political and military means. The updated strategy
also rightly **[addresses newer forms of warfare, from cyber and
artificial intelligence to disinformation]{.underline}**. The changes to
NATO will help [European member states focus their attention on the
security threats the continent faces]{.underline}, and it should also
underscore that all members should pay their fair share. For years,
American presidents have leaned on Europe to spend more on its own
defense. NATO nations have a target of spending 2 percent of their
G.D.P. on defense. Yet few nations meet that moderate threshold, which
leads to the widespread sense that Americans have been subsidizing
European defense and freeing those governments to spend more money on
things like generous welfare benefits. Donald Trump, mercurial statesman
though he was, wasn't wrong to chide NATO partners for not carrying
their share of the defense burden.

#### That triggers their perception links but doesn't solve the aff -- the SC is symbolic not operational

[How Much Does the Strategic Concept Actually Matter? Politically, the
Strategic Concept and the unity it represents are very important.
However, militarily and operationally, it is less
significant]{.underline}. The [2010 Strategic Concept had been moribund
since at least 2014]{.underline}, following Russia's annexation of
Crimea, [but of course NATO has still been operating
effectively]{.underline} since. While a lot of effort has gone into
building consensus for Madrid, [in many ways the hard work starts now.
**There is a coherence issue.**]{.underline} The [Strategic
Concept]{.underline}, as NATO's strategy, [comes after the two main
plans]{.underline} -- [SACEUR's Concept]{.underline} for the Deterrence
and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area [and the future]{.underline} NATO
Warfighting [Capstone]{.underline} Concept -- [have already
matured]{.underline}. There was tacit acknowledgement at the Madrid
summit that many underlying operational plans would have to be revised.
However, with NATO's strategy transforming, [mere tweaks to plans do not
seem sufficient, and their core assumptions should be
revisited.]{.underline} For NATO's Warfighting Capstone Concept -- how
it fights in the future -- it is imperative that analysis of Russia's
military performance in Ukraine now becomes the backbone for its
development. Moreover, despite the collective might of [NATO, it cannot
do everything]{.underline}, and the commitment at the 2015 Warsaw summit
to a '360-degree approach' to security -- both thematically and
geographically -- risks overstretch. In a hardening world, the Alliance
must take the opportunity to go back to its roots and seek support from
other actors, such as the EU. It is still expected that a NATO--EU joint
declaration will materialise before the end of the year.

### SC Thumps -- Rapid Reaction Force

#### The DA is n/u -- SC with NATO is at a record high -- rapid reaction force increased eightfold 

**Stratfor 6/30**

Stratfor Worldview, "Placing NATO's New Strategic Concept in
Context,"Jun 30, 2022
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/placing-nato-s-new-strategic-concept-context

The updated Strategic Concept was announced during the June 29-30 NATO
summit in Madrid. The Madrid summit was the first held since the
alliance's March 24 extraordinary meeting to coordinate a response to
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. In response to these changing
priorities and threat perceptions, [NATO]{.underline} also [announced
changes in its force posture, including the expansion of its rapid
reaction force and new U.S. deployments on Russia's borders. NATO plans
to increase the size of its rapid reaction force nearly
eightfold]{.underline} by next year, [from 40,000 to 300,000
troops]{.underline}, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[in particular, plans
to significantly expand its military presence in Europe]{.underline}**.
On June 29, President Joe **[Biden]{.underline}** announced Washington
**[will establish a permanent headquarters in Poland]{.underline}** for
the U.S. 5th Army Corps, **[send 5,000]{.underline}** additional
**[troops to Romania, and increase rotational deployments in the Baltic
states]{.underline}** (namely, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will also send two additional
squadrons of F-35]{.underline} fighter [aircraft to the
U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom, station additional air
defense systems at bases in Italy and Germany, and increase the number
of naval destroyers in Rota, Spain, from four to six. NATO's so-called
Response Force includes land, sea and air assets that are designed to be
deployed quickly and wherever necessary in the event of an attack. The
force numbered just 13,000 troops prior to Russia's initial aggression
against Ukraine in 2014. Despite identifying Russia as a "direct
threat," NATO declined even stronger action to deter and defend against
Moscow. The updated Strategic Concept describes Russia as "the most
significant and direct threat" to security and stability in the entire
Euro-Atlantic area, as Moscow seeks to "establish spheres of influence
and direct control through coercion, subversion, aggression and
annexation," using "conventional, cyber and hybrid means against NATO
and \[NATO's\] partners." The only other "direct threat" identified in
the document is terrorism. This harsh language represents a fundamental
reversal from the document's previous iteration in 2010, when NATO said
it sought "a true strategic partnership" with Russia and would "act
accordingly, with the expectation of reciprocity from Russia." The
updated Strategic Concept also removes any mention of the 1998
Russia-NATO Founding Act governing relations between the alliance and
Russia, which the 2010 version reaffirmed. But in the 2022 document,
NATO says it is willing to "keep open channels of communication with
Moscow to manage and mitigate risks, prevent escalation and increase
transparency," which indicates a desire to maintain the spirit of and
compliance with the 24-year-old pact. The new NATO troops that will soon
be deployed to Poland and the Baltic states will also continue to rotate
throughout the alliance's Eastern European members to avoid running
afoul of the Founding Act, in which NATO pledged not to permanently
station combat troops on the Russian border. On June 29, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of Defense Celeste Wallander said the U.S. 5th Army Corps'
permanent stationing in Poland will be staffed by headquarters
officials, not combat troops, and would thus not violate the U.S.
understanding of the NATO-Russia Founding Act. Officials in countries
such as France and Germany have said the Founding Act should be
preserved, while some, particularly in Eastern Europe and the United
States, had called for the alliance to consider formally disavowing or
suspending the agreement to remove restraints on NATO force posture. But
**[the new strategy will]{.underline}** still [**fuel Russia's concerns
about NATO's expansion and prompt Moscow to increase its military
presence in the Baltic region**. NATO\'s impending troop
movements]{.underline} do not contradict the alliance's stated desire to
maintain the possibility of dialogue with Moscow. They do, however,
[contradict Russia's desire for a decreased NATO presence on its
periphery, which Moscow expressed prior to invading Ukraine]{.underline}
in February. Increased NATO forces in Poland and the Baltic states ---
not to mention [Sweden and Finland's impending admission]{.underline} to
the alliance --- [will]{.underline} thus still [push Russia to increase
its nuclear and nuclear-capable weapons systems in the Baltic area and
eventually base many more conventional forces there as well. The 2022
Strategic Concept]{.underline} also [reaffirms]{.underline} the decision
of the 2008 Bucharest Summit [that]{.underline} said [Ukraine and
Georgia will one day be NATO members]{.underline}, adding that
"decisions on membership are taken by NATO allies and no third party has
a say in this process" in a clear jab at Russia. While
[this]{.underline} does not portend any concrete or imminent action
regarding Georgia and Ukraine's membership aspirations, it
[will]{.underline} still [increase tensions with Russia]{.underline},
which could use the reaffirmation of the policy to help justify an
escalation of the war in Ukraine and/or destabilization measures in
Georgia or Moldova. China's first-ever mention as a strategic
"challenge" also reflects NATO's new concerns with Beijing's growing
influence in Asia. The 2010 Strategic Concept did not once mention China
nor the Indo-Pacific region, but the 2022 document devotes significant
space to China, whose "stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge
NATO interests, security and values", and says "the Indo-Pacific is
important for NATO, given that developments in that region can directly
affect Euro-Atlantic security." This represents a long-awaited change of
tone toward China. The alliance's statement in the 2022 document that it
will "strengthen cooperation with new and existing partners in the
Indo-Pacific to tackle cross-regional challenges and shared security
interests" will likely raise eyebrows in Beijing. However, the updated
Strategic Concept also makes clear that it "remains open to constructive
engagement to build reciprocal transparency" with China. [The 2022
Strategic Concept highlights]{.underline} new
[cybersecurity,]{.underline} climate change, authoritarian governance
and other non-military threats as well. Climate change was mentioned
only once in the 2010 Strategic Concept. But in the 2022 version, it is
mentioned 11 times, including the ambitious statement that NATO should
"become the leading international organization when it comes to
understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security."
Additional attention is also given to cyberattacks. The alliance
reaffirmed its longstanding policy that a "single or cumulative set of
malicious cyber activities; or hostile operations to, from, or within
space" could prompt NATO to trigger its Article 5 mutual defense clause
--- another measure directed first and foremost toward Russia and China
and intended to deter cyberattacks causing physical damage, as otherwise
the alliance would be skeptical of triggering Article 5 because of a
cyberattack. Finally, the 2022 Strategic Concept on several occasions
notes the challenge to the alliance's interests and values posed by
advancing authoritarianism --- a threat not acknowledged directly in
2010.

### AT SC Solves Deterrence 

#### The concept doesn't overwhelm ongoing failure to solidify an effective deterrent posture

Hans Petter **Midttun, 6-30**-2022, \"NATO's Strategic Concept-2022:
names Russia as threat, deletes key commitment to act on this threat,\"

https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/06/30/natos-strategic-concept-2022-names-russia-as-threat-deletes-key-commitment-to-act-on-this-threat//DG

When [NATO is]{.underline} no longer willing to employ military power to
"escalate to de-escalate," it might be [failing as a military
alliance]{.underline}. It is reflected in the **[new strategic
concept]{.underline}** as it [steps away from its commitment to "stop
ongoing conflicts]{.underline} where they affect Alliance security";in
its [failure to act on Russian violations of international
law]{.underline} since 2008; in its [failure to respond to the Hybrid
War]{.underline} Russia has conducted against NATO and EU members since
2014; and not least, in its failure to respond resolutely to the ongoing
attempt to subjugate Ukraine through the use of both military and
non-military force. **[NATO fails to counter the Russian "fait accompli"
strategy]{.underline}**, using the threat of nuclear escalation as a
means to secure freedom to use military force as an integrated part of
its increasingly more aggressive foreign policy. [As a result, Russia is
openly threatening Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and
Norway]{.underline}. And the [Alliance takes another step
backward.]{.underline} Today, Lithuania and Kaliningrad. Tomorrow,
Norway and Svalbard. NATO has, however, recognized that the
Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace. That's a hugely important first step
towards acknowledging the Russian strategic messaging of being at war.

plans to be able to mobilize as many as 300,000 troops within 30 days.

that is the heart of what is new. "**[It's a work in

forces, [which can be linked to defense plans]{.underline}."

### AT SC Solves -- Disinformation

#### Doesn't solve a coherent response\-\--[declarations]{.underline} are different from [action]{.underline}

At the same time, the [West has yet to prepare a coherent]{.underline},
comprehensive and [coordinated response to Russian
disinformation]{.underline}. It is **[up to nations to fully utilise
NATO's potential]{.underline}**. A [response practice has been
developed]{.underline} and seen partial success within some states and
Euro-Atlantic institutions, but it [has not yet been translated into a
real common policy]{.underline} or strategy. At national levels,
**[political declarations and agreed action plans are still not fully
implemented]{.underline}** in too many instances. Western [states
approach disinformation in varied ways]{.underline} due to differences
in history, regional security, wealth, education, media quality,
political and legal culture and -- most importantly -- the cu[rrent
state of their relations with Russia.]{.underline} As a rule, some
[states prefer bilateral approaches]{.underline} that safeguard national
prerogatives. This may change now following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine.

### Squo Solves -- AI/Biotech

**"Defense Innovation Accelerator" for the North Atlantic reserves 1
billion for tech innovation -- US contributing unprecedented access**

**Harper 6/30**

Jon, Managing Editor of DefenseScoop, "New \$1B NATO innovation fund
will back wide range of emerging tech" JUN 30, 2022

https://www.fedscoop.com/new-1-billion-nato-innovation-fund-will-back-wide-range-of-emerging-technology/

[NATO leaders on Thursday officially launched a \$1 billion innovation
fund that will invest in companies working on a slew of dual-use
technologies with great military potential]{.underline}. Billed as [the
world's first "multi-sovereign" venture capital fund]{.underline}
involving 22 nations, it is [intended to make long-term investments in
startups and other entities developing emerging
technologies]{.underline} that the alliance is interested in [including
artificial intelligence]{.underline}, autonomy, big-data processing,
quantum-enabled technologies, [biotechnology]{.underline} and human
enhancement; novel materials; energy; [propulsion and space. "This fund
is unique,"]{.underline} NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg
said]{.underline} during a signing ceremony at a summit in Madrid where
alliance leaders inked a letter of commitment pledging to support the
initiative. "With a 15-year timeframe, the NATO Innovation Fund will
help bring to life those nascent technologies that have the power to
transform our security in the decades to come, strengthening the
Alliance's innovation ecosystem and bolstering the security of our one
billion citizens." The summit was attended by President Biden, his
alliance counterparts and other world leaders. [Together
with]{.underline} the new Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic ([DIANA), the fund will help the alliance "harness the best new
technology for transatlantic security," Stoltenberg said]{.underline} at
a press conference Wednesday. The DIANA initiative will provide
innovators access to facilities that they can tap into, including more
than 60 test centers across Europe and North America. [DIANA "will
support NATO's efforts to boost interoperability and ensure that every
Ally has access to cutting-edge technological solutions for military
needs]{.underline}," according to a White House fact sheet released
Wednesday. [The United States will contribute to that initiative by
facilitating access to U.S. test centers and other technology
"accelerator sites" in the "extensive and diverse U.S. innovation
sector]{.underline}," according to the White House. During [the
summit]{.underline}, NATO also unveiled a new Strategic Concept that
[emphasized the need to adopt emerging technologies to improve the
alliance's defense capabilities]{.underline}.

Cybersecurity Steps Below those top lines, [cybersecurity
concerns]{.underline} and steps are [woven throughout the new
declaration]{.underline}. "We are [confronted by cyber, space, and
hybrid and other asymmetric threats]{.underline}, and by the malicious
use of emerging and disruptive technologies," NATO said. "We face
systemic competition from those, including the People's Republic of
China, who challenge our interests, security, and values and seek to
undermine the rules-based international order." Among the [cybersecurity
topics in the new strategy document are: Bolstering Ukraine's cyber
defenses]{.underline} and resilience, and supporting the modernization
of its defense sector to strengthen interoperability with NATO; Taking a
"[360-degree]{.underline} [approach across]{.underline} the land, air,
maritime, cyber, and space domains, and **[against all threats and
challenges]{.underline}**"; [Boosting "our resilience to cyber and
hybrid threats and strengthening our interoperability]{.underline}";
Building out and exercising "a virtual rapid response cyber capability
to respond to significant malicious cyber activities"; Strengthening
cyber defenses through "enhanced civil-military cooperation" and
expanding partnerships with industry.A fact sheet issued by the White
House on June 29 said that the alliance's new strategic concept "will
ensure NATO continues to develop appropriate tools and collective
responses to transnational threats such as cyber attacks" and climate
change. "As an operational domain for NATO, [cyber will also be a key
component of NATO's strengthened deterrence]{.underline} and defense
posture," the White House said. Speaking of the NATO plan to **[rapid
response cyber capabilities, the U.S. "will offer robust national
capabilities as part of this support network]{.underline}**," the White
House said. Defense Innovation On the innovation front, **[NATO said it
will establish the new Defense Innovation Accelerator and launch a
multinational Innovation Fund "to bring together governments, the
private sector, and academia to bolster our technological
edge]{.underline}**." The only specific project mentioned for those
initiatives is endorsement of a strategy "which will ensure the seamless
delivery of the next generation Airborne Warning & Control System
(AWACS) and related capabilities." According to the White House
statement, the [Innovation Accelerator "will support NATO's efforts to
boost interoperability]{.underline} and ensure that every Ally has
access to cutting-edge technological solutions for military needs." "The
U.S. will contribute by [facilitating access to U.S. entities, such as
test centers and accelerator sites]{.underline}, drawn from across the
extensive and diverse U.S. innovation sector," the White House said.
