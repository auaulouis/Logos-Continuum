[[A massive bill]{.underline}]{.mark} **[to bolster U.S.
innovation]{.underline}** [[took a]{.mark} **[big
step]{.mark}**]{.underline} [toward becoming]{.underline}
[law]{.underline} this week [[after a]{.underline}]{.mark} [[bipartisan
coalition]{.underline}]{.mark} of senators
[[defeated]{.underline}]{.mark} [[an attempt to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[strip]{.underline} [away]{.underline}]{.mark} [most]{.underline} of
its [research [components]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
[latest]{.underline} version of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act
([USICA]{.underline}) also [includes new language requiring]{.underline}
the National Science Foundation ([NSF]{.underline}) [and]{.underline}
the Department of Energy ([DOE**) to allocate their research dollars
more evenly across the country.**]{.underline}

**[[The 64-to-34 vote]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Tuesday represents a
major victory for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D--NY) and
President Joe [Biden]{.underline}, who **[has repeatedly urged Congress
to pass legislation that would respond to]{.underline}** [China's
growing investments]{.underline} in many emerging technologies. But it
[wouldn't have been]{.underline} [possible without the **[support of 16
Republicans]{.mark}**]{.underline}, who bucked their leadership to back
changes that would benefit universities in their states.

The impetus for USICA was a 2020 proposal by Schumer to authorize
spending \$100 billion over 5 years on a new technology directorate at
NSF that would help commercialize the basic research it funds. Over time
other research agencies were added to the mix, notably tens of billions
in additional spending authority for DOE's Office of Science and a
smaller boost for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
Legislators also attached a \$52 billion subsidy for the semiconductor
industry---real money, as opposed to the authorized spending levels for
the science agencies---as well as numerous trade and security
provisions.

The Senate passed USICA in June 2021, with the support of 19
Republicans. In February, a bill with similar goals, called America
COMPETES, passed the House of Representatives, although only a single
Republican supported it. That triggered negotiations between the two
bodies to reconcile their differences.

Lawmakers were close to reaching a final agreement last month when the
Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell (KY), ordered his team to stop
talking with Democrats. McConnell saw the halt as a bargaining chip in
his ongoing opposition to several of the Biden administration's
priorities, although many Republicans also objected to the
spending---upward of \$250 billion---authorized in the bill. McConnell
later gave his consent for Schumer to move ahead with legislation
dealing only with the semiconductor industry, dubbed the CHIPS Act.

Schumer didn't want to abandon the bill's array of research provisions,
which included a 5-year doubling of NSF's budget and a \$20 billion
investment in the new directorate as well as a \$10 billion network of
regional technology hubs funded by the Department of Commerce. But he
needed at least a dozen Republicans on his side to prevent McConnell
from using a filibuster to block the larger package, called CHIPS-plus,
from coming to a vote. He got them thanks to the work of his Republican
co-sponsor, Senator Todd Young (IN).

One [big selling point]{.underline} [for the Republicans]{.underline}
[was the bill's]{.underline} [provisions]{.underline} **[requiring
greater geographic]{.underline}**, racial, and institutional
**[distribution of research dollars]{.underline}** by NSF and DOE's
science office. The goal remains, but the language has been changed from
what the Senate passed last year to address concerns by many researchers
that it was too prescriptive.

The earlier version of USICA would have earmarked 20% of NSF's entire
\$8.5 billion budget, and 20% of the \$7.5 billion budget of the DOE
science office, to the agencies' Established Program to Stimulate
Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The program, which doles out its own
grants to help states build research capacity, serves 28 jurisdictions
(25 states; Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands)
that receive minimal federal research funding.

Proponents said the [additional funding]{.underline} [would **level the
playing field for resource-strapped institutions**]{.underline}. But
many universities not in EPSCoR states fought that provision, saying it
would unfairly prevent them from competing and distort NSF's overall
research portfolio by mandating a nearly 10-fold increase in EPSCoR's
budget, now \$215 million. (DOE runs a \$25-million-a-year EPSCoR
program.)

The new language in CHIPS-plus retains a quota but revises how the money
will be allocated. Instead of giving it to EPSCoR itself, which doles
out its own grants to help states build research capacity, NSF and DOE
were ordered to bump up how much money flows to institutions in those
states through their regular process of making competitive awards.

"[These]{.underline} [revisions will minimize the
administrative]{.underline} [impact]{.underline} [on
implementation]{.underline} ... and maximize the impact of the policy
change [where it counts, on the actual research]{.underline}," says
Senator Roger Wicker (R--MS), who crafted the initial provisions.

NSF would be required to raise its allocation of research dollars to
institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions from the current level of roughly
13% to 20% by 2029. A similar 20% goal, to be met by 2025, would apply
for all types of NSF scholarships and training programs. DOE science
programs would need to allocate at least 10% of their budget to
institutions in EPSCoR states.

The bill's language recognizes that those targets may be a stretch. Both
agencies are told to do so "to the maximum degree possible," and if NSF
falls short, the director must explain why and offer a plan to close the
gap.

CHIPS-plus includes other provisions to authorize spending hundreds of
millions of dollars each year for new programs aimed at building the
research capacity of institutions now receiving relatively little
federal funding. That list includes historically Black colleges and
universities and those that serve large numbers of underrepresented
students, as well as predominantly white institutions that rank outside
the top 100 recipients of federal research dollars.

Those provisions remain unchanged from what was in USICA and COMPETES,
although the House bill explicitly avoided quotas out of concern that it
would distort NSF's much-admired system of making competitively awarded
grants.

Senator Maria [Cantwell]{.underline} (D--WA), [who led the
Senate]{.underline} contingent [negotiating]{.underline} the terms of
the compromise legislation, [defends the importance of greater
geographic distribution. "]{.underline}You don't want there to be holes
in our research enterprise," she told Science the day after the vote.
"You never know where that next big thing, or the next Bill Gates, is
going to come from. So, the key is to build capacity across the
country."

Her negotiating counterpart in the House, Representative Eddie [Bernice
Johnson]{.underline} (D--TX), [acknowledges]{.underline} [that the
latest version of USICA doesn't]{.underline} [include some things House
Democrats wanted in the bill. "**[Compromises had to be
made]{.mark}**]{.underline}," says Johnson, who is retiring this year
after serving for 32 years. "Not everyone is going to get all that they
originally wanted---including me. But I hope all my colleagues will come
together ... and get this legislation enacted into law."

[Tuesday's]{.underline} [vote]{.underline} was not actually on the new
language. Rather, it **[was a test vote]{.underline}** [on
whether]{.underline} [the]{.underline} CHIPS-plus [package]{.underline}
**[had enough support to move forward]{.underline}**. A bill
incorporating the actual text could move to the Senate floor as early as
next week. [If approved, it would then go to the House for an up-or-down
vote.]{.underline}

[House Democrats think they have the votes to pass it and send it to
[Biden]{.mark}, who **[has repeatedly urged]{.mark}** **[Congress to act
quickly]{.mark}** on what he has called the Bipartisan Innovation
Act.]{.underline}

#### At worst, scaled down-version passes.

vote, No Publication,

[The measure]{.underline}, [known]{.underline} [as the CHIPS
Act]{.underline} of 2022, [contains]{.underline} \$**[39
billion]{.underline}** in financial aid to "build, expand, or modernize
domestic facilities and equipment for semiconductor fabrication,
assembly, testing, advanced packaging or research and development." [Of
that figure]{.underline}, \$[6 billion]{.underline} [can be used for
loan guarantees]{.underline} or direct loans.

**[[The bill cleared a major]{.mark} [procedural
hurdle]{.mark}]{.underline}** on Tuesday night, advancing comfortably in
a 64-34 vote. 

[An additional \$11 billion]{.underline} [will be devoted to the
Commerce Department]{.underline} [for advanced research]{.underline}
[and development programs,]{.underline} \$[2 billion will go to
the]{.underline} [Pentagon for workforce applications]{.underline} and
national defense programs, \$500 million will be utilized by the State
Department to "support international information and communications
technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities," and
\$200 million will be used for a domestic workforce and education fund.

The measure also includes certain "safeguards," including language which
says that federal funds cannot be used for stock buybacks, nor can they
be used to "build advanced semiconductor production facilities in
countries that present a national security concern," including China.

The Senate passed its \$250 billion U.S. Innovation and Competition Act,
or USICA, in June 2021 by a 68-32 vote. The bill includes \$52 billion
to incentivize more companies to build factories in the U.S. In
February, the House approved its own version, called the America
Competes Act --- a \$350 billion plan. That legislation passed largely
on party lines. Both bills aim to make the U.S. more competitive against
China and strengthen domestic supply chains by investing in the chip
industry. 

[[Senate and House lawmakers]{.mark} [have]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[been
negotiating]{.mark} [toward compromise
legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as their bills differ on how to
improve research and development, whether to expedite visas for skilled
foreign citizens, and how to protect U.S. research from foreign
interference. 

The Biden administration and other key lawmakers signaled that they
would support a scaled-down version of the measure that just bolsters
semiconductor manufacturing, with the preference to approve that more
urgently and move other parts of the bill later.

"There are several parts of the broader legislation that are important,
and I am committed to doing whatever it takes to get them over the
finish line in this Congress," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo wrote in
a statement. "But chips funding is the only part of this bill that we
have to pass right now to avoid facing devastating consequences."

After Tuesday\'s vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,
filed a bipartisan amendment which would include tens of billions of
dollars in funding for the Commerce Department, the National Science
Foundation and other agencies.

Schumer, one of the bill\'s biggest backers, said Tuesday that he
expects many of the provisions left out of the scaled-down bill will be
brought up again at a later date.

\"There are lots of things Republicans and Democrats want in the
eventual bill that will not be in this bill, even if science is
included,\" he said, adding that **[[there will be a \"bipartisan
desire\" to get a deal done.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Should the bill pass the Senate, the House is expected to take up the
measure and send it to President Joe Biden\'s desk.

In a [letter to her Democratic colleagues
Wednesday](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/72022), House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., hailed Tuesday's vote as "important progress" on the
measure, which she called "a bold, bipartisan package that will lower
costs for families here at home while reigniting American
competitiveness on the world stage."

Pelosi said that [passing the bill is an "**[economic
necessity]{.mark}** to lower costs for consumers]{.underline}"
[[and]{.mark} "[a **national security imperative**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[as we seek to reduce our dependence on foreign
manufacturers."]{.underline}

"The Chips Act for America is a major victory for American families and
the American economy," Pelosi wrote. "As the Senate undergoes its
legislative process, we are optimistic that the House will be able to
take this bill up as early as next week."

Biden administration officials had recently sounded the alarm about the
long-stalled legislation, urging that if it did not pass quickly, there
would be dire ramifications for national security and the economy ---
including risking the loss of a number of planned multi-billion dollar
domestic investments.

Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger said last week he might delay development of
a \$20 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Ohio if Congress
does not soon approve billions of dollars in subsidies for his industry.

In an interview with Washington Post Live last week, Gelsinger said he
will "make a decision to delay our project in Ohio if" a chip subsidy
bill "doesn't pass." 

\"**[There are real‑time consequences if this doesn\'t
pass]{.underline}**,\" he said.

Similarly, Commerce Secretary Raimondo told CNBC last month that
Taiwan-based semiconductor company GlobalWafers might not follow through
on its plans to build a factory in Sherman, Texas, if Congress doesn't
approve the incentives for chip production.

"This investment that they're making is contingent upon Congress
passing" the funding, she said. "The CEO told me that herself."

Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO of Micron, a computer memory and data
storage company, told Fox News on Monday the public funding is needed to
level the playing field with countries whose governments have invested
heavily in semiconductor manufacturing for more than 20 years. 

The U.S. share of the worldwide chip manufacturing market has declined
from 37% in 1990 to 12% today, according to the Semiconductor Industry
Association.

"We need to get it (the legislation) across the finish line for jobs,
for the resilient domestic supply chain here in the U.S. and, of course,
at the same time, (for) economic security, but also national security,"
Mehrotra said.

In an interview with Spectrum News last week, Cecilia Rouse, chair of
the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said the bills are very
important in increasing the United States' economic capacity. 

"They go to helping us make our economy more productive, which helps us
address challenges such as Russia\'s war against Ukraine, challenges
such inflation," she said. "It helps us address those policies and face
those those challenges and maintain economic health going forward as
well. So [we call on Congress to do the right thing."]{.underline}
