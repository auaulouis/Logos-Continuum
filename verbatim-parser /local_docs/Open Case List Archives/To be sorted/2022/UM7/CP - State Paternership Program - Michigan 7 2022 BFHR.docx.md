The [**[National Guard]{.mark}** **[S]{.mark}**tate
**[P]{.mark}**artnership **[P]{.mark}**rogram]{.underline} (SPP)
[[involves]{.mark} [establishing]{.mark} a [partnership between]{.mark}
a [State N]{.mark}ational [G]{.mark}uard [and]{.mark} other [national
armed]{.mark} [forces]{.mark} of a sovereign country]{.underline}.
[Initially conceived as **military-to-military** engagement
activities]{.underline}, several of these [relationships]{.underline}
have [develope]{.underline}d [further and]{.underline}, nowadays
[include **civilian-to-civilian** initiatives]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark}
a **[security assistance provider]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [it
[conducts]{.mark} [activities]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} in so
doing [[influences]{.mark} the [perceptions]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[behavior]{.mark} of **[regional]{.mark} [security
actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Due to the specific nature of the [U.S.
National Guard]{.underline}, the [**[SPP]{.mark} initiatives** have been
[used as]{.mark} **[dual assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
[**[national]{.mark}** [and **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}6. [In addition
to laying the foundation of goodwill]{.underline}, [trust]{.underline},
[access and influence]{.underline}, [they **[pave]{.mark} the
[way]{.mark}** [for allied]{.mark}/allied]{.underline} --
[allied/partners [interactions]{.mark}]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
go beyond a simple relationship to [help **[increase]{.mark}** a
[partner's ability]{.mark} [to **accomplish**]{.mark} a
particular]{.underline} task or [[mission]{.underline}]{.mark}7.

Basic to the issue are the answers to the question "when", and "how"
military assistance is to be made available; especially since the number
of recipients has steadily increased over the last 20 years, and this
trend is likely to continue, in view of the number of States scheduled
to be involved in the growing concept of "Air/Sea Battle in Asia
-Pacific", and of the future challenges in Africa and in Central Asia.
This unceasing expansion of potential recipients has introduced dynamism
into the framework upon which military assistance rests, making it most
difficult to establish any set formula, even in general principles.

When military assistance was first launched as an integral component of
national foreign policy, such aid was almost exclusively directed
against potential or real threats to Europe, Africa or other areas of
national -- sometimes collective -- strategic interests. [With the
development of crises in **several parts** of the
**world**]{.underline}, provisions from an/the [American perspective
were made through]{.underline} several [security assistance programs
like the **[SPP]{.mark}**]{.underline}, PfP and other NATO Partnerships,
[which]{.underline} has [not only **[broadened]{.mark}** the
**geographic [scope]{.mark}** [of military aid]{.mark} but also
[introduced]{.mark} a **[complex system]{.mark}** [of **governing
principles**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in order to meet]{.underline} the
[designed objectives of]{.underline} the [expanded policy]{.underline}.

Looking at military considerations, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark}
apparently [**[ample reasons]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **positively
[consider]{.mark}** the connection]{.underline}
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tate [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}artnership
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}rogram / [[NATO]{.mark}
[Partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Europe, the [basic principles
determining employment of [military assistance]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Europe [have been]{.underline}, first, [that they serve to
[improve]{.mark}]{.underline} its relative
[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[political]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
economic [strength]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [[keeping]{.mark} at a
**[maximum]{.mark}** its [ability to]{.mark} [contribute to **collective
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [and to
[protect]{.mark}]{.underline}/shelter the European
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} area [from current and future
threats]{.underline}. In accordance with these political objectives,
[[military aid]{.mark} is provided to]{.underline} European
[allies]{.underline} and partners [to [assist NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}
full [members]{.underline} -- and aspiring countries -- [[with]{.mark}
the **[modernization]{.mark}** and **maintenance** [of]{.mark} their
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[taking into account]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[latest]{.mark} concepts of [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[to
obtain]{.mark} the [greatest]{.mark} possible contribution to **[common
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} from non-member countries. These
[objectives [reflect]{.mark} the **[permanent]{.mark}
[improvement]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [military stature]{.mark}
of]{.underline} most [allies]{.underline} and partners, since the
[inception of the [NATO partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline} and national
programs which have [[enabled]{.mark} a [shift in emphasis]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} individual [country defence]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} continental and [[global defence]{.mark} of
allies' interests]{.underline}.

At present [Europe remains the **only area** where military assistance
is **integrated** with joint]{.underline}, [regional defence
planning]{.underline}. This is because the individual problem of
internal security in Europe being of a relatively minor nature, emphasis
was placed on maintaining joint military "forces in being" capable of
deterring outside aggression. Areas of interests of the Alliance such as
Africa, the Near East, and Asia-Pacific face somewhat akin situations to
each other but, at the same time, immensely different from those in
Europe. In addition to creating new partnerships with key countries on
these continents, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [and allied strategies may **foresee** the
**protection** of **common interests** **worldwide** known
as]{.underline} "[securing access to the global commons]{.underline}"
[by resorting to]{.underline} "[newly]{.underline}" [trained and
equipped]{.underline} European [armed forces]{.underline}. Therefore,
the latter may be deployed "out of European area" since the Alliance has
increased its geographic scopes and the range of missions because of the
globalization of threats and risks that could undermine transatlantic
security; the former could be at stake several thousand kilometers away
from home.

Nordic/Baltic countries, from security beneficiaries to troops providers
in multinational operations

The earliest programs of military assistance were grounded in the
principle of relieving to the greatest possible extent any rearmament
burden on the restructuring of European economies in the early 1990s.
Within less than a decade new developments on the international scene
caused a major shift. The 1990s and 2000s marked an epochal change in
the overall influences of world geography on both European and North
American official circles, including generational change alongst
political leaders. Besides these geopolitical influences, [programs
of]{.underline} national or [**multilateral security assistance**
program such as the SPP]{.underline} or the PfP [and their coincidence
over]{.underline} economic [relationships could be an **established
policy** put in place by major leading countries]{.underline}. Like the
Marshall Plan in the late 1940s, NATO/ U.S. Security assistance systems
of the early 1990s implied that economic aid for Central/ Eastern
European countries -- like in other areas closely associated with the
Allies -- could be used for military production. In the first place,
there was the necessity of alleviating the more severe effect of
rearmament on the newly achieved levels of economic activity and
standards of living in the countries politically connected with NATO
members; and although defence support would, to a degree, serve this
function, there was no suggestion that U.S. and allied largesse should
relieve the beneficiaries of all sacrifices. Moreover, an agreement was
implicitly reached as to how the burden of participation in
multinational operations. The period since 1990 has seen increasing
attention paid to multinational military forces.

Their increasing number of mission types continually requires more and
more contributing forces. Operating in multinational forces is nothing
new for the armed forces at NATO's disposal. Experiences inter alia in
the former Yugoslavia, the Mediterranean, the Arabian Gulf, and the
Indian Ocean have demonstrated the substantial strategic advantages to
be gained through coalition and alliance operations. [The National Guard
[SPP]{.mark}s]{.underline} and the PfP [activities]{.underline} have
[made it possible for partnering nations to contribute for NATO-led or
ad hoc military operations]{.underline}. Regarded as an integral device
to the U.S combatant commands' theatre engagement plans, their
[[activities]{.mark} have pursued and [achieved]{.mark} several defence
and military goals]{.underline}, such as: [[Assuring]{.mark} **[dominant
coalitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [Achieving and [enhancing]{.mark}
**[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}; Contributing to the [execution of
**stated policy**]{.underline}; [[Gaining]{.mark} **[regional
access]{.mark}** and access to **decision makers**]{.underline};
[[Building]{.mark} [**relationships** and]{.mark}
**[military]{.mark}-[to]{.mark}-[military]{.mark}
[contacts]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[Acquiring]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[right]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}** for allies]{.underline} and
friends; [[Developing]{.mark} a **broad portfolio** of **coalition
[military capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[Capitalizing on]{.mark}
[rapid]{.mark}]{.underline} [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
[[developments]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[Preventing]{.mark}
[prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[of]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}nologies** and **weapons**]{.underline} into the wrong
hands; [Aligning **goals** and **resources**]{.underline} to carry out
the job efficiently; Using a performance-based management system to make
resource decisions.

But, although they take the form of peacekeeping, peace-support, or/and
humanitarian operations, there is evidence to suggest that subtle
differences in the organizational and national cultures of the countries
that contribute personnel to missions can have an impact on the overall
operational effectiveness of the multinational force. There is thus a
requirement to consider and integrate the intercultural issues and
factors that surround and influence multinational military
collaboration, particularly at the strategic and operational level of
command.

[Because the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} their [Allies share common security interests and
common values and face common challenges]{.underline} (threats, risks),
[they rely on other **partnering nations**]{.underline}. All major NATO
nations' strategies recognize and emphasize the importance of
multinational operations; each country reaffirms its will to act with
others when it can, giving priority to "regional" or "ideological"
allies and friends. Multinational operations are often analyzed as a
compromise between military capability and political constraints,
usually include a wide spectrum of missions; the intensity ranges from
war to long-term tasks with a civilian nature in which the military
apparatus plays a minor but necessary role. Multilateral actions of war
are the extreme circumstance for conducting operations whose goal is to
quickly achieve the multinational collective objectives with as little
cost as possible. Peacetime engagement activities involving the military
help to shape the security strategic environment by sharing experience
in early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management, post-conflict
rehabilitation, promotion of human rights, and strengthening democratic
reforms. Although they are theoretically based on individual State
requests and needs, bilateral military relations with "neutral" States
and the [[S]{.mark}tate [P]{.mark}artnership
[P]{.mark}rogram]{.underline} / PfP seek means to [[achieve]{.mark}
**rationalization**]{.underline}, **[standardization]{.underline}**,
[and **[interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline} that will [significantly
enhance the probability of operational success in multinational
missions]{.underline}. For commanders as for political actors, the key
is to build relationships, trust, cooperation, and cohesion at all
military levels, while overcoming language and cultural barriers and
relevantly applying common procedures or norms.

These [accomplishments display U.S. commitment in relevant security
areas]{.underline}, and are [designed to [lend **credibility**]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} its [alliances]{.mark} by enhancing regional
stability]{.underline} and providing a crisis response capability
[[while **promoting**]{.mark} [**U.S. influence** and
**access**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Four significant paths have been
followed by the SPP/PfP since the beginning of the 21st century. Several
countries from Central and Eastern Europe have become members of NATO,
correlatively the number of SPP/ PfP participating countries. NATO has
also multiplied several instruments (Individual Partnership Program;
Planning and Review Process; Operational Capabilities Concept) which
deepen this program by allowing partners to adapt their participation
through additional opportunities based upon their national objectives
and capacities and perspective (Individual Partnership Action Plan ;
Annual National Program; Membership Action Plan). A third dimension of
NATO partnership is directly linked to the allied military presence in
Afghanistan. At tactical and operational levels, the [[SPP]{.mark}
innovative activities]{.underline} combined with PfP low-tech and
low-cost solutions [appears to be a [way]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to avoid]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}nological [shortfalls]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} to bypass
incapability to **[integrate]{.mark}** their **[cutting edge]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nologies** with]{.underline} most of [NATO]{.underline} and
non- NATO partners. The second aspect here is the growing strategic
importance of the Caucasus and Central Asia that come out as the
existence of PfP countries/SPP participants in the region and the
perspective of the future Afghan participation in NATO partnership
initiatives. Finally, the PfP is increasingly used to build cooperative
relationships with countries in the region by regionalizing the
treatment of security and stabilization missions.

Integrity, and a former economic fellow, May 2004, accessed on 7-2-2022,
International Studies Perspectives, Vol. 5, No. 2, "The Growing Role of
States in U.S. Foreign Policy: The Case of the State Partnership
Program", <https://www.jstor.org/stable/44218880?seq=1>, HBisevac)

As the preceding case illustrates, [[states can play]{.mark} a
**[significant role]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} implementing [U.S.
fo]{.mark}reign [pol]{.mark}icy]{.underline}. The [National
Guard's]{.underline} [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tate
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}artnership [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}rogram has
[[give]{.mark}n [states]{.mark} a **[critical role]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
U.S. [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} programs. The networks of
opportunity created by the number of SPP funding sources and potential
programs have allowed entrepreneurial state actors to shape a unique
course for each partnership. Some [innovative state coordinators
have]{.underline}, on their own initiative, [tapped other
funds]{.underline}, [such as **cooperative threat reduction** programs
or **environmental** programs]{.underline} to further the reach of their
state partnership. The participating [state National Guards are
**[uniquely positioned]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this respect---[they
are [connected to]{.mark} both the **[state]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[fed]{.mark}eral** [governments]{.mark} through]{.underline} their
[**dual mission** and contain vast experience including
military]{.underline} [duties]{.underline}, support to civilians,
[and]{.underline} regular [civilian]{.underline} jobs. [This
[gives]{.mark} an enterprising [state]{.mark} a [chance to]{.mark}
[make]{.mark} a **[significant impact]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the
content of [U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. The meaning attached to
that policy is created, in part, by the actions undertaken in the name
of that policy. [Through their implementation of the SPP]{.underline},
[states have **shaped**]{.underline} the meaning of [U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline} of engaging the former communist states of Eastern
Europe and NATO enlargement. This is not to say that all National Guards
and Partnerships are equally forward-leaning, but some can be, and in a
way not directed or anticipated by the federal government.

Early criticisms that military engagement programs lacked direction
(Ulrich, 1999) have receded as programs such as the SPP evolve into more
sophisticated enterprise. Recent analyses of the SPP have revealed that
all of the program's "stakeholders," including the governors, the
National Guard, the U.S. Defense Department, and the partner countries,
are enamored with the program's success."° With ten years of experience,
the National Guard has developed a "life cycle" approach to each state
partnership. Early in the life of the partnership, mil-mil exchanges
dominate. After a certain point, however, the marginal utility of
additional military familiarization exchanges declines, and mil-civ and
civ---civ exchanges rise to take their place. As the partnerships mature
and are dominated by the civilian exchanges, state governments take an
even greater role in initiating and implementing international
relationships.

An implementation perspective on the analysis of foreign policy makes
this insight possible. [Analyses of foreign policy that rely solely on a
decision-making perspective miss the **important role** that states are
playing]{.underline} in U.S. foreign and national security policy.
[While most of the primary decisions are still made by the
president]{.underline}, his administration, and Congress,
[[states]{.mark} are [gaining]{.mark} an **[ever-increasing
role]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} [implementing]{.mark} those
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The SPP is but one example. Guard units
are also taking a greater role in peacekeeping activities in the
Balkans, and may do so in a postwar Iraq. The intense focus on homeland
security is yet another policy area where states will implement most
policy decisions. The guard has already been active in domestic security
operations, flying combat air patrols and providing airport security,
and several studies and senators have advocated an even larger role for
the guard in homeland security (Miller, 2002). Emergency response and
law enforcement are still state and local responsibilities, and these
areas are the new front lines in homeland security and the war on
terrorism. The states, which perform these duties, have a vital say in
how they will be done. As independent and entrepreneurial implementers,
the states are carving out a larger role in shaping the environment in
which federal decision makers act.

Policy decisions are important, but many of those decisions lack meaning
unless they create content and action. In the long run, **[[policy
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the practice of what states and
countries do with each other---[[produces]{.mark} the
**[substance]{.mark}** [that give]{.mark} [rules]{.mark} and identities
their [meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is this [meaning]{.mark}
that]{.underline} ultimately [[forms]{.mark} the
**[environment]{.mark}** to [which future]{.mark} [decision]{.mark}
[makers **respond**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is here that the federal
government's monopoly in international affairs begins to erode and it is
here that states are finding an ever-growing role in U.S. foreign
policy.

#### That creates [scope]{.underline} for states to mitigate [warming]{.underline}.

D. Climate Policy

[[Mitigating climate]{.mark} change [is]{.mark} a challenge [for **all
levels**]{.mark} of government \-- international, national, state, and
local]{.underline}. As Glennon and Sloane note, some
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} and cities [have [embraced]{.mark} climate
change mitigation measures]{.underline} (pp. 62-63). [[In doing]{.mark}
so, states have]{.underline} often [[coordinated]{.underline}]{.mark}
with each other and [with **[foreign]{.mark} counterparts**]{.underline}
in both practical and \[\*2149\] expressivist ways (pp. 62-63).
California\'s efforts are exceptionally notable. [State [legislation
requires **sweeping**]{.mark} emissions [reductions]{.mark}; California
and Quebec]{.underline} have [sought to integrate]{.underline} their
[cap-and-trade]{.underline} programs; and California has spearheaded a
coalition of state and local governments around the world who have
committed to climate policy. California even sent a large and
high-profile delegation to the United Nations conference on climate
change in Paris in 2015.

The issue of climate policy is a rebuttal to all three of the \"myths\"
identified by Glennon and Sloane. It is self-evidently a matter of both
domestic and foreign affairs; states and local governments are acting in
this space; and some states and local governments are doing so in
progressive ways. [The [actions]{.mark} of state]{.underline} and local
[governments in this space [invite **constitutional inquiry**]{.mark}.
Can California]{.underline} constitutionally regulate carbon emissions,
[enter into a]{.underline} highly formalized [agreement
with]{.underline} Quebec and softer agreements with [other subnational
governments, and send]{.underline} delegations [to
international]{.underline} negotiating [conferences?]{.underline}

Yet focusing exclusively on these questions would lead to a highly
incomplete sense of the legal scope of California\'s power to act. For
although Glennon and Sloane do not mention it, California is acting
amidst a welter of federal laws, regulations, and other executive branch
actions applicable to climate change. In 2007, in a lawsuit brought by
liberal states against the EPA, the Supreme Court held that the federal
Clean Air Act applies to greenhouse gas emissions. This Act explicitly
delegates authority to California to pursue stronger emissions
\[\*2150\] measures for new motor vehicles than are undertaken at the
federal level and in general involves states in the Act\'s enforcement
through cooperative federalism.

[[During]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark}
Administration, [state]{.underline} and local government
[[efforts]{.mark} to reduce
**g**]{.underline}reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse **[g]{.underline}**as
[emissions [were]{.mark} not only **[congruent]{.mark}** with
the]{.underline} aims of the **[C]{.underline}**lean
**[A]{.underline}**ir **[A]{.underline}**ct (as interpreted to apply to
greenhouse gases), [but also with the]{.underline} goals of the
[executive branch]{.underline}. The EPA during the Obama Administration
applauded and sought to facilitate state and local efforts. Its leading
rule on climate change mitigation measures, known as the Clean Power
Plan, explicitly gave states substantial autonomy in crafting their own
approaches, although this rule is currently facing a court challenge
brought by states that oppose federal efforts to regulate emissions. The
Obama White House expressed approval of the transnational coalitions
that California and other state and local governments have joined in
seeking to address climate change.

[All [this]{.mark}]{.underline} positive reinforcement
[will]{.underline} presumably diminish or [[disappear
under]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
Administration. The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} Administration
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} even [try to **[roll back]{.mark}** climate
change [mitigation]{.mark} efforts by progressive states]{.underline}
and cities, [in addition to]{.underline} undermining or
[reversing]{.underline} Obama era regulations and [international
commitments. [If]{.mark} it does [so]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [the
legal [questions]{.mark}]{.underline} that such efforts would raise
probably have fairly \[\*2151\] little to do with the constitutional
issues posed by traditional foreign affairs federalism. Instead, they
[would [center on]{.mark}]{.underline} administrative law \-- around the
interpretation of the Clean Air Act and [the]{.underline} laws and
[[**norms** that **govern**]{.mark} **regulatory
[practice]{.mark}**]{.underline} \-- as they had already come to do by
the end of the George W. Bush Administration.

\* \* \*

These four illustrations are far from unique. [Sometimes
state]{.underline} and local government [[activity]{.underline}]{.mark}
in relation to foreign affairs [occurs against a backdrop of federal
inaction]{.underline}, as is the case with the incorporation of
unratified human rights treaties into the municipal law of progressive
cities. [But **interaction** [is]{.mark} far more common]{.underline},
sometimes cooperative and [[sometimes full of
**contestation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The executive branch approves of
and provides some support for states and cities seeking to promote
tourism or encourage exports abroad. The federal government collaborates
with states in determining U.S. international negotiating positions with
respect to insurance. In private international law, the federal
government has shown strong interest in using state law rather than
federal law to implement certain treaties. And all levels of government
deal with security \-- both traditional and cyber \-- and interact with
each other over it. To understand what is going on, we must focus on the
political branches as much as (or even more than) the courts. And we
must think not just in terms of constitutional law, but also in terms of
international law, administrative law, and state law.

\[\*2152\] III. COOPERATIVE AND UNCOOPERATIVE FEDERALISM IN THE CONTEXT
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

As foreign affairs federalism becomes increasingly interactive, how much
will it resemble cooperative and uncooperative federalism in the
domestic context? At the very least, scholarship on cooperative and
uncooperative federalism as a domestic matter, especially work focused
on the political branches, provides a valuable starting point for
understanding foreign affairs federalism today. This [scholarship offers
insights into]{.underline} how the federal government can incentivize
state and local governments to help advance federal interests,
[how]{.underline} these **[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}** and local
[government[**s** can]{.mark}]{.underline} in turn
[**[influence]{.mark}** and **resist** federal
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and how Congress and the executive branch
can each use state and local action to build power at the expense of the
other branch. [These]{.underline} broad [themes manifest themselves
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[foreign affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
context as well. Yet the foreign affairs context brings some additional
complexities because of its ties to international law and global
governance and because it comes with stronger presidential powers. [This
leads to]{.underline} certain [differences between cooperative and
**uncooperative federalism** in]{.underline} the realm of [foreign
affairs]{.underline}, in terms of both how practice proceeds and of what
doctrine should be.

A. Structural Implications

The interactions between the federal government and state and local
governments in relation to foreign affairs mean that federal policy
shapes state and local policy. By providing assistance, financial and
otherwise, to the sister-cities program, the federal government makes it
easier for cities to participate. By signaling its support for state
\"Buy American\" laws, Congress encourages them \-- and the Department
of Transportation incentivizes them even further by refusing to
participate in contracts governed by state \"Buy American\" laws that
are less strict than the federal ones. In the context of immigration and
climate change, the federal government incentivizes (and sometimes comes
close to forcing) state and local action in support of federal policy.
All of these [examples]{.underline} in the foreign affairs context
[reflect an \"increasing concentration of power at
Washington]{.underline} in the instigation and supervision of local
policies,\" just as cooperative federalism arrangements do in the
domestic context.

In work focused on the domestic context, Heather Gerken shows that [the
interactive nature of modern federalism]{.underline} also [provides
state]{.underline} and local [governments with ways to **influence
federal policy**. State and local actors exercise \"the power . . . of
the servant,\" which offers the]{.underline} \[\*2153\] [chance \"not
just to complain about national policy, but to help **set it**.\" In
shaping federal policy]{.underline}, these actors are not simply
employing the traditional tools of process federalism; rather, it is
their role in administering federal policy that gives them a say in the
shape that this implementation will take. Yet the scope of this role
also limits what they can do: \"power dynamics are fluid; minority rule
is contingent, limited, and subject to reversal by the national
majority.\" In related work, Gerken and Jessica Bulman-Pozen elaborate
on the ways in which [[state]{.underline}]{.mark} and local [governments
can engage in **\"uncooperative federalism,\"** including by
**resisting** federal policies that they are charged with
enforcing]{.underline}.

Building on the core insight that [state]{.underline} and local
[governments [can]{.mark}]{.underline} help [**[shape]{.mark} federal
[policy]{.mark}** through their roles in implementing federal
law]{.underline}, Bulman-Pozen further shows that [these
[interactions]{.mark} can **[affect]{.mark} the [distribution]{.mark} of
power**]{.underline} between Congress and the executive branch. In a
pair of articles, she describes the ways in which state and local
activities can strengthen the powers of one branch against the other.
The more that Congress invites or effectively requires state and local
participation in the administration of a federal statutory regime, the
more these actors can serve as checks on the executive branch\'s power
to implement this regime. On the flip side, such shared roles in
implementing previously enacted statutory schemes can empower the
executive branch and subnational executive actors to work together in
ways that crowd out the current Congress.

\[\*2154\] Similar dynamics can occur with respect to foreign affairs
federalism. Indeed, some of the examples that Gerken and Bulman-Pozen
focus on are issues that have transnational implications. [[With]{.mark}
regard to **[climate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example, they show how
[[states]{.mark} have used the power of the servant to try to
**[shape]{.mark} federal [policy]{.mark}**[, including]{.mark} efforts
by conservative states [to **push back**]{.mark} against [the
**federal**]{.mark} **regulatory [scheme]{.mark}** and by progressive
states to make it stronger]{.underline}. Bulman-Pozen also uses climate
as an example of how \"federal and state executives negotiate without
Congress\" once a broad statutory scheme is in place. Some payoffs for
the foreign affairs context here are simply derivative: [[the
more]{.mark} that [state]{.mark}]{.underline} and local [[governments
enhance]{.underline}]{.mark} or reduce [federal [efforts to
mitigate]{.mark} climate change, then [the more]{.mark}]{.underline} or
less [the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[does]{.mark} with respect [to
**address**]{.mark}**ing [this]{.mark} global
[problem]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But other implications relate
specifically to how the United States engages internationally.
Continuing with the climate context, the extent to which President Obama
could make commitments on behalf of the United States during the
negotiations for the 2015 Paris Agreement was largely limited by the
scope of the Clean Air Act, since he had no realistic chance of getting
new congressional legislation that would advance his goals with respect
to climate. But since California and other progressive state and local
actors were doing more than what the Clean Air Act required, President
Obama could take this into account in setting the target to which the
United States was committing with respect to climate change mitigation.
President Obama\'s option set was thus enhanced by state and local
action in the climate context.

[The threat of sea-level rising from global warming is well known, but

[While]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [extinction

#### SPP expansion [hedges losses]{.underline} in U.S soft power.

Power is a relative term, especially when referring to the amount of
control and influence a nation wields in the global community. In
analyzing nations' sources of power, American political scientist Joseph
Nye popularized the concepts of hard power, or "the ability to use
carrots and sticks of economic and military might to make others follow
your will," and soft power, an influence which "co-opts \[nations\]
rather than coerces them."\[1\] Whereas nations mainly derive hard power
from military forces, Nye asserts [a nation's soft power stems
from]{.underline} "[its culture]{.underline} (in places where it is
attractive to others), its [political values]{.underline} (when it lives
up to them at home and abroad), [and its foreign policies]{.underline}
(when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."\[2\]
Soft power grows through cultural diffusion, which often occurs more
rapidly thanks to globalization, but there are also institutions which
directly contribute to soft power projection. The United States
Department of State (DoS) and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) are chief among these institutions cultivating
American soft power through initiatives and foreign presence.

Investment into these soft power tools has been under tight scrutiny as
U.S. policy shifts toward hard power. A common theme in executive budget
proposals between 2017 and 2019 involved funding cuts between 23 and 32
percent for diplomacy and international aid.\[3\] Although Congress
countered these proposals, albeit narrowly by one vote in the Senate in
2018, these proposals mark a clear shift in power priorities rendering
the budget for soft power tools volatile and unpredictable.\[4\] As
policymakers consider significant budget cuts in traditional soft power
tools, however, other countries are investing resources toward soft
power projection. China's national strategy, for instance, now includes
the political jargon wenhua ruan shili (cultural soft power) and plans
for cultural influence to permeate.

In the midst of budget cut proposals and foreign competition in the
sphere of soft power, the [[government]{.mark} [must]{.mark} continually
[explore]{.mark} avenues to improve efficacy]{.underline}. One means is
to recognize that while there are distinct, traditional tools to project
soft power and hard power, roles, responsibilities, and effects can
overlap. Joseph Nye noted, "Sometimes the same [[power]{.mark}
resource[s]{.mark} can [affect]{.mark} the entire spectrum of
[behavior]{.mark} from **coercion** to
**attraction**]{.underline}."\[5\] The [National Guard's]{.underline}
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate **[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**artnership
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**rogram (SPP) is one [such [power
resource]{.mark} [that]{.mark} can [have]{.mark} this **[strategic
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[a traditional hard [power]{.mark}
entity [with **great capacity** to project **soft power**]{.mark}
abroad]{.underline}. Established in 1993, the SPP involves partnerships
between individual states and sovereign nations whereby states' National
Guard units conduct engagements with partner nations' security forces,
emergency response personnel, and other organizations. In standing up
new partnerships, the U.S. sought to optimize efficiency and
partner-building capacity by establishing partnerships on factors such
as parity in ethnic composition or disparities in state National Guard
unit strengths and partner nation (PN) security force weaknesses. In a
perennial shaping operation, the SPP yields strategic dividends by
fostering trust, shared values, and interoperability with partners in
ways that support U.S. policy objectives.

The [**[longevity]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [SPP]{.mark} partnerships and
the civilian occupations of]{.underline} ~~Guardsmen~~
\[[soldiers]{.underline}\] [[foster conditions to **shape**]{.mark}
**[conditions]{.mark} [abroad]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but partnerships
do not yet fully exploit this capacity to project soft power. As
American leaders consider budget cuts to diplomacy, [[leaders should
explore]{.mark} the feasibility of leveraging the [S]{.mark}tate
[P]{.mark}artnership [P]{.mark}rogram [to **hedge losses** in **soft
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Investing in the preparation of personnel
coordinating SPP events by training them in the partner nation's
language and providing education on soft power and interagency
collaboration can enhance SPP efficacy. Consulting with and including
diplomatic considerations in planning and assessments may also enable NG
units to project influence. States can further capitalize on
opportunities to project soft power through the National Guard's State
Partnership Program by training key SPP personnel in foreign language
and soft power considerations and by taking a hybrid approach to gap
analysis.

Key Players Require Language Training and Familiarization with Soft
Power Considerations

Despite the strategic role and expansive scope of partnerships, program
responsibility funnels down to a small group of individuals. Funding for
a typical state partnership supports one SPP bilateral affairs officer
(BAO) assigned to the U.S. Embassy in the partner nation, one SPP state
coordinator located within the state, and five to seven events
annually.\[6\] Partnerships lacking a full-time BAO have a traditional
combatant commander's activities (TCA) coordinator on six-month
temporary duty assignment or a state coordinator who travels to the
partner nation to coordinate events.\[7\] Partner nation
representatives, security cooperation personnel, or other military or
civilian leaders propose events or activities, often based on a partner
nation's requests to help build capabilities by providing expertise.
Leaders including, but not limited to, the relevant service section
chief (e.g., Army Section Chief), BAO or TCA Coordinator, Senior Defense
Attaché, and State Coordinator discuss proposed events and activities to
ensure they nest with long-term strategic plans for the partner nation
and region. The BAO further develops this plan and, in collaboration
with other security cooperation leaders, proposes the plan to state and
COCOM leaders for approval. Hence, the SPP model invests a significant
amount of influence into one or two individuals---the BAO or TCA
coordinator and/or the state coordinator---making them single points of
success or failure for a partnership.

The level of training provided to the BAO or TCA coordinator and the
state coordinator have significant second- and third-order effects on
the outcome of partnerships. BAOs, TCA coordinators, and [[state]{.mark}
coordinator[s]{.mark} should also [have]{.mark} a [strong grasp
on]{.mark} diplomacy and [soft power]{.mark}]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} relevant government agencies and [the role of
the [SPP]{.mark} in [project]{.mark}ing [this]{.mark} type of
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historical lessons learned note,
however, the need to "educat\[e\] BAOs that \[...\] building capacity"
in sectors such as health through medical engagements "[can provide
access]{.underline}, [influence]{.underline}, [and soft
power]{.underline}."\[8\] (Penn 2012). To properly train personnel on
such facets of security cooperation, the Security Cooperation Management
State Partnership Course, managed by the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency's Defense Institute of Security Cooperation Studies (DISCS),
includes a one-hour introduction to USAID and a three-hour block of
instruction on SPP operations that addresses DoS and civilian programs
enhancing SPP planning and PN interaction.\[9\] Such training helps to
reduce knowledge gaps among State Coordinators, but BAOs and TCA
coordinators do not attend this course. This lack of training is
detrimental to partnerships heavily reliant on TCA coordinators,
especially in SOUTHCOM where TCA coordinators outnumber BAOs.

Remarks in after action reviews and lessons learned raise other concerns
about BAO knowledge gaps, especially with regard to foreign language
proficiency. Generally, units identify Officers who are already
proficient in the PN's official language or push to provide a new BAO
with rudimentary training or foreign immersion. Occasionally, however,
BAOs or TCAs report without proficiency in the language. The fact that
these billets are not language-coded billets perpetuates this issue, as
the billets do not necessitate language proficiency, despite the
bilateral nature of that office and the inherent benefits of speaking
that language. Not only would language training help new BAOs or TCAs
develop rapport with PN officials, but these personnel would better be
equipped to analyze DOTMLPF and identify gaps and opportunities as they
read PN military doctrine and other publications, such as PN Officers'
professional military education reports on their nation's readiness and
capability gaps.

States Should Adopt a Hybrid Approach to Partner Nation Gap Analysis

States conduct gap analysis at the commencement of a new partnership and
periodically (e.g., every five years) thereafter. This process involves
key stakeholders or an analysis team assessing a Partner Nation's
current capabilities in a series of focus areas (e.g., human resources,
security forces, training, logistics and maintenance, etc.), describing
the desired state in each area, and identifying gaps between the present
and desired states. This analysis informs SPP planners and facilitates
planning for effective SPP activities. Regularly conducting this process
helps to steer partnerships by objectively evaluating efficacy of
engagements through measured progress in these focus areas.

Despite the common practice of performing gap analysis for partnerships,
there is a limited amount of doctrine or tactics, techniques, and
procedures shared among units regarding this process. The Army's Center
for Lessons Learned published a bulletin on SPP best practices, which
provides general guidance on SPP functions and objectives, but does not
discuss the concept of gap analysis or the mission analysis process
behind planning SPP activities. Without doctrine, a handbook outlining
best practices or providing templates, or a dialogue on lessons learned,
gap analysis products vary significantly in scope, focus, and detail by
partnership, as does the efficacy of partnership activities. Increased
interagency collaboration can help to remedy this deficiency and
optimize partnership gap analysis.

Similarly, dialogue between National Guard units and other government
agencies is rare. Instead, gap analysis usually involves key
stakeholders and staff from the National Guard unit with limited to no
consultation with agencies such as USAID or the DoS.\[10\] National
Guard units can enhance gap analysis by utilizing USAID and DoS reports
and historical data as inputs to their partnership analysis. States
should also institutionalize a formal gap analysis similar to USAID,
which typically involves stakeholders and assessment teams conducting
desktop research and team discussions, a gap assessment workshop, field
visits, focus group discussions, analysis and report writing, and a
validation workshop yielding comprehensive analysis products.
Incorporating USAID and DoS will approach the measure of interagency
collaboration outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 23, which calls
for "the establishment of a common, collaborative and effective approach
to the planning \[of\] successful security sector assistance
activities."\[11\] Such collaboration will also help to resolve
incomplete gap analysis mentioned in after action reviews and lessons
learned regarding SPP activities, such as failing to explore possible
soft power engagements as key stakeholders do not recognize the
potential payoff of such events.\[12\] Similarly, historical partnership
assessment products list operational capacity and capability among
evaluation variables, but scoring criteria is vague and subjective.

A recent initial partner gap analysis conducted by the Nevada National
Guard for its new partnership with Fiji reveals the utility of taking a
hybrid approach. Leaders referenced USAID and DoS assessments of Fiji as
inputs and included diplomatic considerations among their key
indicators.\[13\] This approach deviated from the traditional list of
indicators directly relating to war fighting functions or staff sectors
(e.g., human resources, security forces, logistics, information systems,
etc.), typical of a SPP partnership gap analysis. The Nevada National
Guard Gap Analysis Team assessed these areas, yielding several potential
high-payoff engagements. This innovative approach cultivated informed
discussion and fostered interagency collaboration in coordinating
whole-of-government efforts behind SPP objectives.

The Nevada National Guard's best practice of making interagency
collaboration a fundamental facet of gap analysis should be transformed
to doctrine; this should be the norm, rather than the exception. These
tactics, techniques, and procedures, such as using key indicators like
medical care and emergency response, ensure planners consider soft power
projection in determining the most meaningful SPP activities to pursue.
Considering these soft power sectors also enables the National Guard to
leverage units and individual ~~Guardsmen~~ \[soldiers\] with unique
skillsets. Institutionalizing a hybrid approach to gap analysis by
incorporating soft power variables and considerations can help planners
identify new opportunities to network with DoS, USAID, and partner
nation organizations.

Conclusion

As countries dedicate more resources toward diplomacy, [budgets for U.S.
traditional soft power tools seem uncertain]{.underline}. The [National
Guard's]{.underline} [S]{.underline}tate [P]{.underline}artnership
[P]{.underline}rogram is one [means whereby the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can hedge against]{.underline} potential [losses
in influence]{.underline} threatened by budget cuts. While [[SPP]{.mark}
activities have **[influenced]{.mark}** **[p]{.mark}**artner
**[n]{.mark}**ation**[s]{.mark}** and **[strengthened]{.mark}** their
[**ties** to]{.mark} [the U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}., this
[[program]{.mark} is [capable of projecting]{.mark} more **[soft
power]{.mark}** by [ensuring]{.mark} key SPP [personnel satisfy]{.mark}
training [requirements]{.mark} [and]{.mark} by refining planning and
[assessments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Training BAOs or TCA coordinators and
[[SPP]{.mark} state coordinators]{.underline} on soft power and exposing
them to organizations [engaged in diplomacy will [**foster inclusion**
of **soft power**]{.mark} considerations in state partnership
planning]{.underline}. Strong language proficiency among these key
players will help them to build rapport with partner nation counterparts
and develop meaningful SPP activities addressing partner nation concerns
raised in their own reports and studies. States should also strive to
incorporate soft power considerations into partnership activity planning
and assessments. Formal gap analysis involving interagency collaboration
can help to identify opportunities to influence partner nations through
engagements promoting American soft power. These changes will better
enable leaders to leverage the National Guard State Partnership Program
as a tool to project soft power.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [has multiple **competing

**economic impacts**]{.underline}, long-ignored **[racial
fissures]{.underline}**, [and a growing tenuous relationship
with]{.underline} truth, **[reality]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
[**trust** among the populace]{.underline}, just to name a few.
President Joseph [Biden]{.underline} also [has the challenge of
representing the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [on
the **foreign stage**]{.underline}. In that capacity, [he is charged
with crafting a **[new foreign policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[one that
champions a **[balance]{.mark}** of [hard and **soft
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [tailored for]{.underline} the most
efficient use of resources and [the **most effective
results**]{.underline}.

He is off to a good start; in his interim national security guidance
released in early March, President Biden acknowledges the role of soft
power resources in building and maintaining U.S. strength, even if he
doesn't call the concept out by name. He posits,

Achieving these goals rests on a core strategic proposition: The United
States must renew its enduring advantages so that we can meet today's
challenges from a position of strength. We will build back better our
economic foundations; reclaim our place in international institutions;
lift up our values at home and speak out to defend them around the
world; modernize our military capabilities, while leading first with
diplomacy; and revitalize America's unmatched network of alliances and
partnerships.

[[Focusing on **econ**]{.mark}**omic strength**]{.underline},
**[[alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [**[institutions]{.mark}** and
**[exporting]{.mark} American [values]{.mark}** and ideals]{.underline}
are good starts [to [restor]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [American [soft
power]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}---[a **critical component** of
American **leadership**]{.underline}. In fact, the post-WWII world
order, and, more recently, the post-Cold War international system with
the United States emerging at the sole superpower, was only possible
through U.S. soft power. [Historically]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has
[[maintained]{.mark} its]{.underline} [power and [influence]{.mark}
abroad]{.underline}, in part, [[due to]{.mark} its
**[appeal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This appeal [must be
**restored**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This is not a call for a post-Trump 180, the path away from soft power
and towards a hard power-dominant foreign policy is decades-long. True
reinvigoration is going to require not only a criticism of the past four
years, but also deep introspection on President Biden's own contribution
to the trend as a senator and vice president. In other words, building a
smart power approach to foreign policy is going to take more than simply
rejoining a few international accords or hosting some impressive state
dinners. Frankly, it's going to take more time than this administration
has, even with the possibility of a second term. But if we take Biden at
his promise to serve as a transitional leader, we can certainly start
rebuilding the foundation of a foreign policy approach that will serve
generations of Americans and citizens abroad for decades.

This starts with rebuilding relationships. Based on Biden's picks for
high-level positions, it appears that he understands the power of
relationships, choosing long-term confidants and establishment experts.
Biden values trust and interpersonal history---and this approach must be
applied to international relations.

President Biden campaigned on his personal relationships with key
international leaders, which is critical, but the administration must
also craft relationships with populations and other non-state actors.
While the new administration understands the potential threat from
non-state actions, it would be well-advised to also consider the
potential opportunities in non-state groups and craft a national
security strategy that acknowledges the growing power and role of such
groups. For example, this strategy must include a prioritization of
immigration and refugee programs, such as the Special Immigration Visa
Program. While the Trump administration infamously decreased the levels
of immigrants admitted under this program, the United States has
arguably never fulfilled its responsibilities to the men and women who
have assisted missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not only should the
Biden administration reintroduce the Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)
Program, but it also should offer a permanent fix to the Afghan program
as well as create a new program to reward our allies in the Syrian
conflict. Such programs would establish the United States as a leader in
refugee rights and protections. The success of future conflicts will be
heavily reliant on the ability to gain and maintain the trust of
civilian populaces. Without interpreters, translators, and other
host-nation citizens, the success of U.S. missions abroad would and will
continue to be threatened. More than that, failing to uphold promises to
allies abroad threatens American legitimacy and standing in the
international community.

In the new world order described by the administration, these wicked
**[[international problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** "[respect no
borders]{.underline} or walls, [and [must]{.mark} be [met]{.mark} with
**[collective action]{.mark}**]{.underline}." While the COVID-19
pandemic has made the increasingly global nature of the international
order abundantly clear, biological **[[disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**
isn't the first challenge to transcend borders.
Counter**[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the threat of
**[[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[economic
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **climate**]{.mark} **change**
all present **challenges** not to a single state]{.underline} or region,
[but to an **entire international structure**]{.underline}. These
[[problems]{.mark} can **[only]{.mark}** be [addressed with **global
solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In 2015, a study in the Journal of Mathematical Biology pointed out that

increasing in Greenland and Alaska. Meanwhile, the added weight of the
new seawater starts to bend the Earth's crust. "That will give you a
massive increase in volcanic activity. It'll activate faults to create
earthquakes, submarine landslides, tsunamis, the whole lot," explained
the director of University College London's Hazard Centre. Such a
landslide happened in Scandinavia about eight thousand years ago, as the
last Ice Age retreated and a Kentucky-size section of Norway's
continental shelf gave way, "plummeting down to the abyssal plain and
creating a series of titanic waves that roared forth with a vengeance,"
**[[wiping all]{.underline}]{.mark}** signs of
**[[life]{.underline}]{.mark}** from coastal Norway to Greenland and
"drowning the Wales-sized landmass that once connected Britain to the

COMPOUNDING SYSTEM SHOCKS

The [Arab Spring exemplified [a]{.mark} new]{.underline} type of
security [[threat from]{.underline}]{.mark} global
[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}: one arising [[not]{.mark} from [a
**single**]{.mark}]{.underline} natural [[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark},
limited in time and space, [[but]{.mark} from a **[compound
series]{.mark}** of events, **[spreading quickly]{.mark}** across the
planet]{.underline}. Such events---call them **[[climate shock
waves]{.underline}]{.mark}**---are far more threatening than the dangers
discussed earlier in this book, as they [have the capacity to
[destabilize **numerous states** simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline}
rather than just one at a time. Moreover, they can also imperil the
world-spanning trade and logistical systems upon which the international
economic order---and American prosperity---rests. These systems, such as
the grain markets so affected by the Russian heat wave of 2010, are
essential for the well-being of almost every country on Earth, yet are
highly vulnerable to global climate shocks. Other [critical networks,
such as]{.underline} the worldwide flow of [**[energy]{.mark}**
and]{.underline} the global **[public [health]{.mark}]{.underline}**
system, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} equally [**[at risk]{.mark}** to
**shocks**]{.underline} of this sort. [When]{.underline} such [systems
fail]{.underline}, vital commodities become scarce and
**[chaos]{.underline}** may [**ensue**---posing a severe risk to
**fragile states**]{.underline} and a potential threat to U.S. national
security. Accordingly, climate shock waves represent an even higher
level of danger than the other warming-related perils we have examined
up to this point.

The risks to national and international stability from climate shock
waves have been a concern of America's military and intelligence
communities for some time. In its initial 2008 National Intelligence
Assessment on the security threats posed by climate change, the National
Intelligence Council underscored America's reliance on reliable global
networks. The United States, it pointed out, "depends on a
smooth-functioning international system ensuring the flow of trade and
market access to critical raw materials such as oil and gas, and
security for its allies and partners." Climate change could imperil all
of that, it noted, resulting in the downfall of friendly states, a loss
of access to vital materials, and disruptions to "the global economy
more broadly."18

Following the Arab Spring, the U.S. Intelligence Community sought to
acquire a more sophisticated understanding of the role that climate
change might play in triggering such far-reaching calamities. To this
end, the IC commissioned the National Research Council of the American
Academy of Sciences to conduct a study of warming's socioeconomic
consequences, which was published in 2013 as Climate and Social Stress:
Implications for Security Analysis. The NRC study examined a number of
scenarios already discussed in earlier chapters of this book, including
humanitarian disasters, resource scarcities, and state collapse. But it
also included a section on "global system shocks," continent-spanning
crises triggered by some combination of climate change and "globally
integrated systems other than the climate itself." As world temperatures
rise and global supply networks become more interdependent, the report
noted, "there are numerous ways in which climate events could create
shocks to integrated global social, economic, health, or technological
systems and thus have effects far removed geographically from where the
events occur."19

Because we have become so dependent on these global supply networks, the
NRC's analysts concluded, a major climate event that disrupts or damages
a significant component of them can inflict immediate and substantial
pain. Many nations rely on those systems for deliveries of food, energy,
and other vital commodities; [when shortages of]{.underline} such [goods
arise]{.underline}, their [prices **soar**]{.underline} and all those
with limited means begin to suffer. If governments fail to address these
challenges in a timely and equitable manner, unrest and [**conflict**
can **erupt** in multiple countries at once]{.underline}. Such
[[upheavals]{.mark} can]{.underline} also [[produce]{.mark} follow-on
effects, including **[mass migrations]{.mark}** and
**pandemics**]{.underline}, that undermine yet other countries.
[[States]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [already vulnerable to
dissolution can **[fail]{.mark} one after another**]{.underline}.20

The authors of the NRC report were particularly struck by the degree to
which climate change is combining with globalization to increase the
risk of upheaval. Not only are extreme climate events occurring more
frequently, they noted, but [warming's effects are]{.underline} being
[amplified by]{.underline} our [reliance on international]{.underline}
trading [networks]{.underline} for essential goods and services---in
particular, the globe-spanning matrix of pipelines, rail lines, and
shipping lanes used to transport food and energy supplies. These
networks are relatively robust under ordinary conditions, but can be
severely disrupted by extreme climate-related events, as with hurricane
damage to refineries, pipelines, and oil terminals.21 To make matters
worse, severe climate events are occurring more frequently in
"clusters," magnifying the shock to the system---much as when the 2010
heat wave in Russia coincided with severe flooding in Pakistan and
drought in China.22

Global supply chains' vulnerability to severe climate effects is
especially evident in the case of food. The crops that account for a
large share of the world's caloric intake---wheat, maize (corn), rice,
soy beans, and a few others---require copious amounts of water to
achieve maximum yield, along with temperatures that remain within a
certain range. Always unpredictable in the best of times, these benign
growing conditions will prove increasingly uncommon as severe heat
waves, prolonged droughts, and catastrophic floods become the norm.
Under these circumstances, shortages of one staple or another are likely
to occur on a recurring basis.23 On top of this, the number of
grain-producing nations capable of generating a surplus for export is
rather small, while the number of countries dependent on those few
exporters for their essential food requirements is large. A clustering
of extreme weather events that reduces or eliminates exports from just
two or three of the major exporters would thus have a powerful effect on
the global market, squeezing supplies for all importers and sending
prices skyward.24

The disruptiveness of such price increases is amplified by the social
and economic difficulties in a number of the countries dependent on food
imports. In water-stressed areas of the developing world, many poor
farmers---no longer able to secure an adequate livelihood from their
increasingly barren fields as temperatures rise and rainfall
diminishes---are migrating to the cities in search of alternative
options, and must scramble to acquire food there. This trend, the NRC
pointed out, can only increase these countries' vulnerability to global
food-supply problems, creating larger urban populations that are
particularly sensitive to food prices. With more displaced
agriculturalists moving to the cities, it stated, "the dependence of
low-income populations on imported food supplies provided by global
markets may increase their vulnerability to climatic or economic events
in other parts of the world that sharply increase the prices of the
foods they have come to depend upon."25

This combination of circumstances, IC analysts believe, can only lead to
more Arab Spring--like upheavals in the future---a risk given close
scrutiny in the National Intelligence Council's 2015 report, Global Food
Security. Although humans are theoretically capable of producing enough
foodstuffs to meet the basic caloric requirements of everyone on the
planet, that report indicated, [large segments]{.underline} of the
global population [are vulnerable to [**food shortages** and]{.mark}
sudden **price spikes**]{.underline} of the sort witnessed in 2010--11
because of unreliable distribution systems, flawed government policies,
and relentless poverty.26 "We judge that the overall risk of food
insecurity in many countries of strategic importance to the United
States will increase," the NIC report concluded. "In some countries,
declining food security will almost certainly contribute to social
disruptions or large-scale political instability or conflict."27

This concern---that growing world food insecurity and
[**[climate]{.mark}-driven [price spikes]{.mark}** will [generate
**widespread**]{.mark} **instability and
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}---continues to permeate U.S. strategic
calculations. It is evident, for example, in the "worldwide threat
assessment" delivered each year to Congress by the director of national
intelligence on behalf of the IC as a whole. In his February 2018
presentation, the current director, Daniel R. Coats, stated that
"extreme weather events in a warmer world have the potential for greater
impacts and can compound with other drivers to raise the risk of
humanitarian disasters \[and\] conflict," with "food shortages" and
"price shocks" playing major contributing roles.28

ENERGY SHOCK WAVES

Warming's threat to global food distribution networks has, in general,
constituted the primary focus of U.S. military and intelligence analysts
concerned about climate shock waves. However, they have also sounded the
alarm about the potential for other highly disruptive events: breakdowns
in global energy systems, outbreaks of global pandemics, and new,
destabilizing mass migrations. As with a collapse of global food-supply
chains, these climate shocks would involve extreme climate events that
arise in one or more parts of the world and provoke havoc in many
others, ultimately endangering American national security and prompting
U.S. military action of some sort.

After global food supplies, American security analysts have worried most
about warming's capacity to disrupt the world's vital energy systems. As
with food supplies, today's world is highly reliant on global commerce
for many essential fuels, especially oil and natural gas. While a
handful of countries are largely self-sufficient in one or both of those
fuels, most industrial powers---including Japan, the United States, and
the EU countries---depend on imports for at least some of their energy
needs. In 2018, for example, Japan relied on imports for nearly 100
percent of its petroleum requirements, the EU countries for 89 percent,
and the United States for 25 percent. These import dependencies are
expected to persist well into the future, with the developing nations of
Asia assuming an ever-increasing share of global energy demand. China
now relies on imported petroleum for 65 percent of its requirements and
India for 82 percent; by 2040, their import dependence is projected to
climb to 80 and 91 percent, respectively.29

It is true, of course, that some countries are working very hard to
reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas, so
as to diminish their contributions to global warming. Japan, for
example, has reduced its oil consumption from a peak of 4.7 million
barrels per day in 2012 to 3.9 million battels in 2018. Most European
countries have also experienced a decline, with consumption by the
European Union as a whole dropping from 14.8 million barrels per day in
2008 to 13.3 million barrels in 2018.30 Some analysts believe,
therefore, that the global demand for petroleum will gradually subside.
But in many parts of the world, especially Asia, Africa, and the Middle
East, oil consumption is projected to continue growing, especially as
more people enter the middle class and purchase cars, trucks, and
motorcycles; these surges in demand are expected to outweigh declines
elsewhere, ensuring continuing increases in global oil consumption. The
worldwide demand for natural gas is also expected to climb, as countries
around the world work to phase out older coal-powered electrical plants.
As a result of all this, the trade in oil and gas is likely to remain a
critical feature of international commerce for decades to come.

To transport oil, coal, natural gas, and electricity from one end of the
world to another, energy-exporting and -consuming nations have
constructed a vast matrix of railroads, pipelines, transmission lines,
and maritime shipping routes. On any given day, a large share of the
world's energy supply is being transported via one of these vital
conduits. According to BP, on an average day in 2018, some seventy-one
million barrels of crude petroleum and refined fuels---approximately 75
percent of daily world output---were being shipped from one country to
another; for natural gas, the share of world output in transit was about
24 percent.31 In many cases, the pipelines and tankers used in carrying
these supplies pass through or near areas of recurring conflict, such as
the Middle East and North Africa; most of the time, moreover, they
travel across areas vulnerable to storms, wildfires, flooding, and other
climate-related disasters.

American security analysts have long been concerned about disruptions in
the global flow of energy arising from war and political interference.
Those concerns were given particular urgency in the 1970s following two
crippling "oil shocks" generated by political turbulence in the Middle
East---the first, occurring in 1973--74, when Arab members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) imposed an
embargo on exports to the United States in retaliation for its support
of Israel in the October War of 1973; the second in 1979--80, following
the Islamic Revolution in Iran. In response to those two oil shocks, the
United States charged its military with taking ever greater
responsibility for ensuring the safety of oil deliveries from the
Persian Gulf.32 Following the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
President Jimmy Carter proclaimed that any hostile effort to impede
those deliveries "will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests
of the United States of America," and, as such, "will be repelled by any
means necessary, including military force."33

To enforce that edict---quickly dubbed the "Carter Doctrine"---the
Department of Defense established the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force
and assigned it responsibility for protecting Persian Gulf oil exports;
that force later served as the nucleus of the U.S. Central Command. When
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and appeared to be poised for an attack on
Saudi Arabia, President George H. W. Bush invoked the Carter Doctrine to
justify the deployment of American forces to the Gulf and the onset of
what became Operation Desert Storm.34 Although the United States no
longer relies on Persian Gulf oil for a large share of its energy
needs---as a result of advances in extraction technology, this country
now obtains an ever-greater proportion of its energy needs from domestic
shale formations---U.S. leaders continue to worry about the safety of
the global oil flow, given its critical importance to the world economy.
In particular, they worry about threats being made by Iranian leaders to
block oil traffic through the Gulf in case of a U.S. attack on Iranian
nuclear facilities; to counter any such move, Centcom has long deployed
a powerful array of ships and planes in the region.35

But while American strategists continue to think about the threats to
oil flow posed by terrorism and hostile powers, they are becoming
increasingly concerned about dangers to the global web of energy systems
arising from the effects of climate change. A great deal of the world's
energy is transported via extended pipelines, shipping lanes, and
transmission lines that are naturally at risk from such climate-related
perils as severe flooding, turbulent seas, and major wildfires. This
danger is compounded by the fact that, in search of ready access to
maritime shipping channels, a very substantial proportion of the world's
oil and natural gas infrastructure is situated in coastal areas, which
in many cases are highly vulnerable to hurricanes and storm surges. As
global warming advances, therefore, international energy trade will
become increasingly susceptible to severe climate shocks.36

With the world increasingly dependent on these extended, highly
vulnerable energy-supply networks, the NRC concluded in its 2013 report,
future climate shocks could produce instant shortages and price hikes
around the world, much as with the food-price shock waves it had
studied.37 In support of this assessment, the report pointed to a series
of powerful hurricanes that struck America's Gulf Coast in the early
years of the twenty-first century: Katrina and Rita in 2005, followed by
Gustav and Ike in 2008. These storms damaged or destroyed many offshore
rigs and disrupted operations at refineries and distribution facilities,
sharply reducing U.S. oil and gas output and causing a spike in global
prices.38 Sea-level rise, the NRC noted, will amplify the disruptive
consequences of future storms and hurricanes, as many power
plants---both nuclear and coal-fired---are located in low-lying coastal
areas; when storms occur, these plants are at risk of flooding, causing
systemic damage and power outages. This occurred, for example, in the
New York metropolitan region following Superstorm Sandy in 2012: several
of the region's power plants, including all of its nuclear stations,
were either damaged or experienced temporary shutdowns due to high winds
and flooding.39

The NRC further noted that climate change may disrupt the global energy
supply system in other ways. Prolonged droughts and heat waves can
reduce the amount of water available to hydropower facilities and
water-cooled thermoelectric power plants, cutting into the electricity
delivered to international grids.40 A disruption of just this sort
occurred during a European heat wave in 2003 that was blamed for the
deaths of over thirty-four thousand people. As river levels dropped in
France---Europe's leading exporter of electricity---the government was
forced to shut down several nuclear reactors for lack of adequate
cooling water. This, in turn, resulted in a 50 percent decline in
France's power exports, producing electricity shortages throughout the
region.41

Major disruptions to the global energy system have occurred before, and
no doubt will occur again in the future for a variety of reasons,
including those cited above. Given the multiplicity of international
networks available for energy delivery, the world economy can probably
absorb several such disruptions happening sequentially, as they have in
the past. What worried the authors of the NRC report, however, is the
possibility that advancing climate change will result in several major
disruptions occurring simultaneously, severely testing the ability of
global supply networks to cope. Such a scenario, they warned, could
produce significant energy shortages around the world and a rapid spike
in prices. This, in turn, could result in an economic recession and
political unrest. As happened with the 2010--11 spike in food prices,
"an oil-price shock could increase instability, particularly in a
situation that is already politically sensitive."42

Initially, such an outcome would prove most disruptive in developing
countries that are highly dependent on energy imports and can ill afford
a sudden spike in prices. But climate-related supply interruptions could
also generate havoc in advanced nations that rely heavily on imports, as
well as in energy-exporting states that depend on foreign sales to
finance government operations. Any significant disruption in Persian
Gulf oil exports, for example, will punish oil-producing countries as
well as their overseas clients. As warming advances and global supply
chains prove more unreliable, major energy-consuming nations may adopt a
more nationalistic and militaristic stance toward energy, thereby
generating yet additional international tensions. This could also lead
to conflict among the major powers---a topic to be addressed in the next
chapter.

GLOBAL PANDEMICS

In addition to their concern about global food-price and energy-price
shocks, American strategists worry about another potential
climate-instigated shock wave: [the rapid spread of lethal]{.underline}
infectious [diseases across the globe, causing]{.underline} widespread
[illness in multiple locations and]{.underline}, in so doing, [adding
to]{.underline} the pressures [on already overstressed
societies]{.underline}. Deadly pandemics have, of course, long bedeviled
human society, going back to the outbreaks of plague that periodically
decimated European populations. Modern medicine has helped reduce the
risk of such calamities, but now climate change is threatening to
overwhelm those gains. [Rising world temperatures]{.underline},
increased precipitation, and higher levels of humidity all [facilitate
the spread of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes]{.underline} and other
[insects]{.underline}. Mosquitoes need pools of water to breed, and the
hotter and wetter it is, the faster they can reproduce. As global
warming widens the geographic extent of hot, moist breeding areas, the
range of many virus-bearing mosquitoes will grow as well.43

Malaria, one of the deadliest diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, is
already thought to be spreading from the tropics to temperate zones as a
consequence of climate change.44 Other ["vector-borne"
diseases]{.underline}, such as the Zika virus and dengue fever, are also
expected to [spread into new areas as global warming
advances]{.underline}.45 "Increased temperatures and more frequent and
intense precipitation events can create conditions that favor the
movement of vector-borne diseases into new geographic regions," the U.S.
Global Change Research Program noted in its Fourth National Climate
Assessment.46 Adding to the danger of future pandemics is the looming
breakdown of public health systems in many poor and conflict-ravaged
countries. Epidemics that can effectively be controlled by medical
authorities in well-functioning societies are likely to gain momentum
when health systems collapse---an outcome that will prove increasingly
likely as more and more states are impacted by climate shock waves.47

Globalization is also contributing to the risk of global pandemics, by
facilitating air and sea travel from one corner of the world to another.
"Outbreaks occurring in other countries can impact U.S. populations and
military personnel living abroad and can sometimes affect the United
States," the Fourth Assessment warned.48 Unless a quarantine is imposed
when a potential epidemic is first detected, visitors to a country with
mosquito-borne diseases may become infected and return to their home
country before any symptoms have appeared, potentially creating new
centers of infection. In this manner, the effects of climate change
could combine with international transportation networks to ignite a
global health shock wave, akin to the food and energy shock waves
described above.

As suggested by analysts at the National Research Council, climate
effects and globalization are combining to increase the risk of global
health shocks. "Weather and climate changes," they noted, "have the
potential of interaction with other factors to alter both the geographic
range and the intensity of transmission of a number of infectious
diseases, thereby creating the potential for pandemics."49 If these
pandemics arise in or spread to developing nations with inadequate
public health systems, they can lead to widespread panic and civic
unrest, prompting terrified citizens to seek refuge in other
countries---possibly carrying the pathogens with them and so igniting
fresh outbreaks of contagion. Once this occurs, it is but a short step
to a global humanitarian crisis, which could easily result in the
involvement of the American military due to its unique ability to deploy
on short notice to virtually any location on the planet and provide
emergency services.50

All this was given dramatic immediacy by the West African Ebola epidemic
of 2014--16, which ravaged Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and
affected several other countries, claiming an estimated 11,300 lives. An
often fatal viral disease, Ebola is thought to be transmitted to humans
from bats and other wild animals, usually in situations where humans
live in close proximity to such creatures and rely on them as a
supplemental source of food, as is true in some poor, rural areas of
Africa.51 The 2014--16 Ebola outbreak, the most severe of its kind,
first arose in Guinea and then quickly spread to neighboring Liberia and
Sierra Leone when panicked citizens---some carrying the
infection---moved from one country to another across poorly marked
borders in search of safety from the outbreak. Local public health
systems, poorly staffed and poorly equipped to begin with, quickly
became overwhelmed as medical workers themselves came down with the
disease. By some estimates, one in ten of Ebola fatalities during the
early stages of the epidemic were among nurses, doctors, medical
students, and other clinical staff.52

The Ebola epidemic also threatened to spread to other parts of the world
as foreign health workers returned to their home countries after
volunteering in one of the affected West African states and as panicked
citizens of those countries traveled elsewhere in the hope of avoiding
infection. Indeed, several Ebola cases were identified in Europe and the
United States under exactly such circumstances, prompting fears of a
global pandemic and accompanying social disorder. As an indication of
what might occur, fighting broke out in Monrovia, the capital of
Liberia, when police tried to cordon off the heavily infected
neighborhood of West Point and panicked residents fought back.53 For
American security officials, it had all the earmarks of a potential
international crisis.

In a remarkable expression of these fears, President Obama explicitly
warned of Ebola's threat to global security, announcing a major U.S.
effort to combat the disease:

In West Africa, Ebola is now an epidemic of the likes that we have not
seen before. It's spiraling out of control. It is getting worse. It's
spreading faster and exponentially. Today, thousands of people in West
Africa are infected. That number could rapidly grow to tens of
thousands. And if the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking
at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound political and
economic and security implications for all of us. So this is an epidemic
that is not just a threat to regional security---it's a potential threat
to global security if these countries break down, if their economies
break down, if people panic. That has profound effects on all of us,
even if we are not directly contracting the disease.

With stakes this high, combating the Ebola outbreak was declared a
"national security priority," and every relevant arm of government would
be mobilized to prevent its spread.54

To manage this effort and conduct its most urgent missions, Obama turned
to the U.S. Africa Command. Africom, he announced in September 2014,
would establish a "military command center in Liberia to support
civilian efforts across the region," with General Darryl Williams,
commander of Africom's U.S. Army contingent, overseeing the operation.
This was an unusual arrangement, as the Department of Defense had never
before conducted what it termed "a disease-driven foreign humanitarian
assistance mission."55 However, given the magnitude of the peril and the
lack of any other institution capable of taking on such a Herculean
task, Obama placed this responsibility on the U.S. military. "Our
Department of Defense is better at that, our Armed Services are better
at that, than any organization on Earth," he declared.56

At Obama's behest, Africom undertook a massive logistical effort in West
Africa, establishing emergency hospitals and clinics in each of the
three most heavily affected countries and providing support services for
a bevy of doctors and other health workers flown in from the United
States and other countries. At least three thousand U.S. military
personnel participated in this extraordinary effort, dubbed Operation
United Assistance. Although not directly involved in the medical
treatment of patients---that task was performed solely by civilian
personnel---these troops played a vital role in fighting Ebola by
providing essential logistical support to the doctors and nurses on the
front lines of treatment.57

For many observers, the Ebola epidemic of 2014--16 represents a preview
of what can be expected in the future as global warming advances,
certain infectious diseases extend their range, and vulnerable states
prove unable to cope with the multiple challenges of extreme weather,
resource scarcity, and inadequate public institutions. This peril was
highlighted again in early 2019, as a fresh outbreak of Ebola occurred
in parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where inadequate
government institutions and ethnic strife impeded efforts by the
international community to provide emergency care. And, as the NRC
points out, the danger will only increase as temperatures continue their
rise and extreme events cluster together more frequently, undermining
the ability of the international community to provide emergency relief
and assistance. Should a pandemic occur at a time when international
supply systems for medications are already impaired by climate change,
the consequences would be dire.58

MASS MIGRATION EVENTS

Whenever U.S. security analysts have considered the risks of climate
change, a perpetual concern has been that [[**extreme events**
and]{.mark} prolonged **[droughts]{.mark}** could [trigger]{.mark} a
[massive]{.mark} flight of]{.underline} desperate [people seeking refuge
in other locales, provoking **[chaos]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
hostility wherever they travel. This anxiety was evident in some of the
analysts' earliest public statements on the national security
implications of warming, and it has remained a major theme to the
present day. In its initial 2007 report on climate change, for example,
the CNA Corporation warned that severe climate effects "can fuel
migrations in less developed countries, and these migrations can lead to
international political conflict."59 Defense Secretary Hagel sounded a
similar note in his 2014 address to the Conference of the Defense
Ministers of the Americas. "Drought and crop failures can leave millions
of people without any lifeline, and trigger waves of mass migration," he
declared.60

In talking about the risk of mass migrations, U.S. security analysts are
typically discussing long-term pressures---such as prolonged drought and
coastal erosion---that deprive people of their livelihoods and force
them to move elsewhere in search of jobs and income. "When water or food
supplies shift or when conditions otherwise deteriorate (as from sea
level rise, for example), people will likely move to find more favorable
conditions," the CNA explained.61 The ongoing relocation of impoverished
farmers from scorched inland areas to urban centers, for instance, fits
this pattern. But American analysts also worry about sudden-onset
climate events that would spark rapid, large-scale movements of people
from one country to another, setting off a political firestorm. Such
destabilizing events, which could become more frequent as global warming
advances, are akin to the other types of climate shock waves discussed
in this chapter.

[A **migratory shock wave**]{.underline} of this type [could be ignited
by various]{.underline} kinds of [climate events, such as a cluster of
**severe hurricanes** or **crop failures**]{.underline}. If, under these
circumstances, local governments prove unable to provide adequate
emergency assistance or collapse entirely, vast numbers of people may
simultaneously choose to move to adjacent (or even distant) countries in
search of refuge and a new start in life. Some environmentalists are
predicting that the numbers of such **["climate
refugees,"]{.underline}** as they have sometimes been termed, [could
reach into the **hundreds of millions**]{.underline} as global warming
advances; others have cautioned against such predictions, saying the
evidence for them is still inconclusive. Whatever the exact numbers, the
arrival of large groups of outsiders---many, if not most, in need of
substantial assistance---is bound to generate unease and, in all
likelihood, hostility in the destination countries. The fact that the
newcomers often differ in their race and religion from the natives only
adds to the risk of antagonism.62

A foretaste of what this might look like was provided by the migratory
surges from North Africa and the Middle East into southern Europe
following the Arab Spring of 2011, as desperate residents of
battleground countries such as Libya and Syria sought to escape the
fighting and accompanying decline in economic conditions. The situation
in Libya was particularly fraught for migrant workers from the Sahel
region and sub-Saharan Africa, who made up as much as 10 percent of
Libya's population prior to the revolt against Gadhafi. Those workers
(mostly young men) had already fled their own countries because of
drought, desertification, and joblessness, seeking low-level positions
in various state-backed enterprises in Libya under the old regime. After
Gadhafi's removal, they lost their jobs and faced intense hostility from
native Libyans, who viewed them as interlopers and Gadhafi loyalists.
Reluctant to return to their own impoverished countries, huge numbers of
these migrant workers sought to move farther north, fleeing in rickety
ships across the Mediterranean to Europe---where, if they survived the
journey, they usually encountered fresh animosity.63

An even greater number of people sought to flee the fighting and abysmal
living conditions in Syria. Beginning in 2012, and reaching a flood tide
in 2015, vast multitudes of desperate Syrians sought to reach the
relative security of Europe, mostly by traveling by raft from
southwestern Turkey to Lesbos and other Greek islands in the Aegean Sea;
from there they sought passage to wealthier European countries farther
north, especially Germany, Austria, and Norway. Although welcomed at
first by sympathetic Europeans (most notably German chancellor Angela
Merkel), the Syrian refugees started arriving in such massive numbers
that many residents of the receiving nations turned hostile, embracing
measures such as fencing off their borders and using armed police to
repel the migrants---steps taken by Hungary in 2015 as hundreds of
thousands of refugees moved north from Greece.64 With anti-refugee
sentiment growing throughout the region, European officials were forced
to adopt ever more stringent means to stem the flow, including
mobilizing NATO's naval fleets to patrol waters of the Aegean Sea and
assist the Greek coast guard in blocking migrant vessels from Turkey.65

When examining the causes of the massive migrant flood that overwhelmed
Europe in 2015, most analysts have concluded that the principal driving
forces were the ongoing violence in Syria and the lack of meaningful
economic opportunities both there and in transit countries such as
Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Nevertheless, some analysts believe that
climate change had a contributing role in sparking the migratory shock
wave, largely by causing a severe drought in 2007--10 that decimated
Syrian agriculture and drove impoverished farmers into overcrowded urban
centers, where they helped launch the anti-Assad rebellion.66 "Syria's
drought has destroyed crops, killed livestock and displaced as many as
1.5 million Syrian farmers," observed John Wendle in Scientific
American. "In the process, it touched off the social turmoil that burst
into civil war," impelling millions of people to flee.67 Other analysts
discount the role of climate change in provoking the Syrian civil war
and resulting migratory impulse, insisting on the primarily political
nature of the conflict.68 But even if warming's role was relatively
modest in this case, the events of 2012--15 provide an indication of
what we might expect from future migratory shock waves as temperatures
rise, farming becomes untenable in vast areas of the planet, and masses
of people move about in search of new ways to survive.

While Europe---given its proximity to climate-sensitive areas of Africa
and the Middle East---is expected to prove the principal objective of
many of these migratory surges, North America is also considered a
likely destination for future mass migrations. The CNA Corporation, for
example, has suggested that the greatest climate-related threat to
American security---other than its direct impacts on the U.S. homeland
itself---would arise from the migratory implications of climate
disasters occurring in nearby countries, especially in Central America
and the Caribbean. As warming advances, it noted, severe climate events
will afflict many of these areas, destroying entire habitats and
impelling millions of people to head north in search of refuge and
employment opportunities.69

General John F. Kelly, while serving as commander of the U.S. Southern
Command, spoke of such occurrences as "mass migration events," and
emphasized the importance of taking steps to prevent future climate
refugees from entering the United States. With that goal in mind, he
told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2014, "We regularly exercise
our rapid response capabilities in a variety of scenarios, including
responding to a natural disaster \[and a\] mass migration event."70 In
one such exercise, Southcom revealed, Kelly's staff established a Joint
Task Force-Migrant Operations (JTF-MIGOPS) at Naval Station Guantánamo
Bay to oversee a mock crisis-response mission. According to Rear Admiral
Jon G. Matheson, deputy Joint Task Force commander of JTF-MIGOPS in
2013, this allowed Southcom to "flesh-out some of the processes and
resources we would need if a mass migration were to occur."71

Southcom conducted another iteration of these exercises two years later,
with Fort Sam Houston, Texas, serving as the host of a reconstituted
JTF-MIGOPS. The 2015 exercise, a Pentagon reporter noted, "anticipated
the mass migration of people from multiple Caribbean islands after a
series of hurricanes devastate the area." With this in mind, "the goal
of the exercise scenario was to effectively interdict and repatriate the
migrants at sea who were attempting to enter the United States." In
other words, the military services are practicing to do whatever might
be needed to prevent large numbers of disaster-driven refugees from
gaining access to U.S. territory.72 As participants in the exercise
explained, this means stopping migrant-laden ships at sea and
transporting the migrants to the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo, where
they would be detained in giant tent camps until they can be ferried
back to their home country.73

Whether originating in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, or the
Caribbean, mass migration events are destined to become more common in
the years ahead as global warming takes an ever greater toll on the
livelihoods and living conditions of people in highly exposed areas. As
the European [migrant crisis]{.underline} of 2015 demonstrates,
moreover, such events are likely to prove highly disruptive and to
[trigger **military**-type responses]{.underline}. The construction of
fortified border walls and fences is one expression of this, as are the
preparations being undertaken by Southcom to house vast numbers of
detained migrants at Guantánamo Bay. Wherever and whenever such events
occur, the outcome is almost certain to prove wrenching and violent.

WHEN SYSTEMS COLLAPSE

For American military and intelligence analysts, the implications of all
this are hard to escape: [as global warming advances, **[one]{.mark}
climate [shock after another]{.mark}** will [**ricochet across the
planet**, leaving **chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline} and misery [in their
wake. Try to [picture]{.mark} a **[food]{.mark}-price [crisis]{.mark}**
occurring [at]{.mark} more or less [the **same time** as a]{.mark}
**major [pandemic]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a **[mass migration]{.mark}**
event: the resulting chaos, distress, and contention are almost
unimaginable. The most likely consequence of]{.underline} such [[a
**multi-shock calamity** would be]{.mark} the **failure of fragile
states** and resulting **[anarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline}---with the
failures occurring not one at a time, as in some less fearsome
scenarios, but one right after another, as during the Arab Spring. But
it will not be just fragile states in the developing world that will
suffer from the impacts of these shocks, but all nations, as the
**[[global networks]{.underline}]{.mark}** on which we all rely for
essential goods and services begin to **[[break
down]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The potential for systemic collapse of this sort was given close
attention by the Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in
November 2018. Like the NRC study before it, the Fourth Assessment
highlights the world's growing reliance on global networks and the ways
these systems have become inextricably linked---and so have become
vulnerable to unexpected shocks. "A long history of research on complex
systems," it noted, "has shown that systems that depend on one another
are subject to new and often complex behaviors.... These behaviors, in
turn, raise the prospect of unanticipated, and potentially catastrophic
risks. For example, [[failures]{.underline}]{.mark} can
**[[cascade]{.underline}]{.mark}** from one system to another." Climate
change, it observed, is likely to provide exactly the sort of external
jolt that could trigger such a cascade of failures, [[sowing
**havoc**]{.mark} **across the planet**]{.underline}.74

#### Independently, CO2 causes [ocean acidification]{.underline}\-\--extinction

Brian **Merchant 15**, Senior Editor at Motherboard at VICE Media, Inc.,
Appeared on CNN, MSNBC, BBC World News, and NPR, Vice, 4/9/2015,
http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-last-time-our-oceans-got-this-acidic-it-drove-earths-greatest-extinction

[The biggest]{.underline} **[extinction]{.underline}** [event in
planetary history]{.underline} [was driven by]{.underline} the rapid
[acidification of our oceans]{.underline}, [[a **new
study**]{.underline} [concludes]{.underline}]{.mark}. So much carbon was
released into the atmosphere, and the oceans absorbed so much of it so
quickly, that marine life simply died off, from the bottom of the food
chain up. That doesn't bode well for the present, given the disturbingly
similar rate that our seas are acidifying right now. Parts of the
Pacific, for instance, are already so acidic that sea snails' shells
begin dissolving as soon as they're born. The biggest die-off in
history, the Permian Extinction event, aka the Great Dying, extinguished
[over [90 percent of]{.mark} the planet\'s
[species]{.mark}]{.underline}---and 96 percent of marine species. A lot
of theories have been put forward about why and how, exactly, the vast
majority of Earth life [[went **belly up**]{.mark} 252 million years
ago]{.underline}, but the new study, published in Science, offers some
compelling evidence **[[acidification]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[was]{.mark} a **[key]{.mark}** driver]{.underline}. A team led by
University of Edinburgh researchers collected rocks in the United Arab
Emirates that were on the seafloor hundreds of millions of years ago,
and used the boron isotopes found within to model the changing levels of
acidification in our prehistoric oceans. Through this "combined
geochemical, geological, and modeling approach," the scientists say,
they were able to accurately model the series of "perturbations" that
unfolded in the era. They now believe that a series of gigantic volcanic
eruptions in the Siberian Trap spewed a great fountain of carbon into
the atmosphere over a period of tens of thousands of years. This was the
first phase of the extinction event, in which terrestrial life began to
die out. The study explains that the second phase of the event happened
much more quickly. "During the second extinction pulse, however, a rapid
and large injection of carbon caused an abrupt acidification event that
drove the preferential loss of heavily calcified marine biota,\" the
authors write. [So does this]{.underline} study [mean we should
be]{.underline} especially [worried]{.underline} about the phenomenon
taking hold today[?]{.underline} \"**[Yes]{.underline}**,\" said
[Dr]{.underline}. Rachel [Wood]{.underline}, [a professor of carbonate
geoscience at the University of Edinburgh and one of the paper\'s
authors]{.underline}. \"We are concerned about modern ocean
acidification,\" she told me in an email. \"Although the amount of
carbon added to the atmosphere that triggered the mass extinction was
probably greater than today\'s fossil fuel reserves, [[the
**rate**]{.mark} at which]{.underline} the [[carbon was released]{.mark}
[was]{.mark} at a rate [similar to]{.mark} modern [emissions]{.mark}.\"
In other words]{.underline}, the Siberian Traps probably spewed out more
carbon in total, but [we\'re spewing out just as fast]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline} [that\'s]{.underline}
**[[overwhelming]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[planetary
[equilibrium]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"[This fast rate of
release]{.underline} was a critical factor [driv]{.underline}ing [ocean
acidification]{.underline},\" Wood said. Why? \"The rate of release is
critical because the [[oceans absorb]{.mark} a lot of the
[carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline} (CO2) [from the
atmosphere]{.underline}, [around 30 percent]{.underline} of the carbon
dioxide **[released by humans]{.underline}**,\" Wood said. \"[To achieve
chemical equilibrium]{.underline}, [some of this CO2 reacts with the
water to form]{.underline} [carbonic acid]{.underline}.
[Some]{.underline} of these molecules react with a water molecule to
[give a bicarbonate ion]{.underline} [and a hydronium ion]{.underline},
thus [increasing]{.underline} [ocean]{.underline}
[\'acidity\']{.underline} ([H+ ion concentration]{.underline}).\"
[Marine animals]{.underline} whose [skeletons]{.underline} are
[comprised of calcium carbonate]{.underline}---[and that's a
lot]{.underline} of them (think [snails]{.underline},
[coral]{.underline}), which form **[a crucial part]{.underline}** [of
the food chain]{.underline}---[dissolved]{.underline} [or couldn't
form]{.underline} in the first place. And [that]{.underline} is what's
[happening today]{.underline}. \"Between 1751 and 1994, surface ocean pH
is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14,
representing an increase of almost 30 percent in H+ ion concentration in
the world\'s oceans,\" Wood said. That\'s [a major uptick
in]{.underline} [ocean acidity]{.underline} [in a relatively short
amount of time]{.underline}, and [it\'s happening because]{.underline}
**[humans]{.underline}** have **[burned fossil fuels]{.underline}** like
coal, oil, and gas [with]{.underline} **[reckless abandon]{.underline}**
since the Industrial Revolution. [[That\'s fueling]{.underline}]{.mark}
[climate change]{.underline}, of course, as well as its less-discussed,
[but]{.underline} potentially **[equally
[cataclysmic]{.mark}]{.underline}** sibling, **[ocean
[acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}**. \"Scientists have long suspected
that an ocean acidification event occurred during the greatest mass
extinction of all time, but direct evidence has been lacking until now,"
study coordinator Dr. Matthew Clarkson said in a statement. "This is a
worrying finding, considering that we can already see an increase in
ocean acidity today that is the result of human carbon emissions.\"
[Much of [marine life is]{.mark}]{.underline} already **[[in grave
danger]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from acidification]{.underline}.
[It\'s]{.underline} contributing to the **[[bleaching]{.mark} of
[coral]{.mark} reefs]{.underline}** around the world, [and]{.underline},
as mentioned before, it\'s **[[killing]{.mark} sea
[snails]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Pacific. [[If it worsens,
**acidification**]{.underline}]{.mark} could **[[threaten]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** whole of the [marine]{.underline}
[biosphere]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, obviously, the
[land-dwelling creatures]{.underline} that depend on it too. In 2013,
marine scientists released a \"State of the Oceans\" report that found
that the rate of current acidification was "unprecedented." They noted
that the seas were acidifying faster than any point in the last 300
million years. That study didn't take into account the new data, of
course, but that's the timeline we're dealing with: [The last time the
oceans were so acidic]{.underline} [was in the midst of]{.underline} the
greatest **[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the history of the
world.

I. The Character of the Mess

Defining the character of the current mess is the easy part. Briefly:

- [The last century's **technological revolutions**]{.underline} have
  [made our world more **globally interconnected** than
  ever]{.underline}.

- Power (along with access to power) has become more democratized and
  diffuse in some ways, but more concentrated in other ways.

- For most individuals around the globe, [day-to-day life is **far less
  dangerous**]{.underline} and brutal [than in previous eras; for the
  **species as a whole**]{.underline}, however, [the [risk of]{.mark}
  **future global [catastrophe]{.mark}** has
  [increased]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- The continuously accelerating rate of technological and social change
  makes it increasingly difficult to predict the geopolitical future.

Nothing is particularly original about these observations; they're
repeated in some fashion in every major national strategic document
produced over the last decade. They probably teach this stuff to
kindergarteners now. Indeed, we've heard it all so often that it's
tempting to dismiss such claims as meaningless platitudes: Been there;
theorized that. Can we get please get back to foreign-policy business as
usual?

No, we can't. Not if we want our children and grandchildren to live
decent lives. If we care about the future at all, we need to do more
than prattle on at cocktail parties about globalization,
interconnectedness, complexity, danger, and uncertainty. We need to feel
these seismic changes in our bones.

So bear with me. Let's try to breathe some life into the clichés.

I've written about these issues before (here and here), and at risk of
being both a narcissist and a broken record, I'll quote myself:

> [The world has grown more complex]{.underline}. Believe it. The world
> now contains more people living in more states than ever before, and
> we're all more interconnected. A hundred years ago, the world
> population was about 1.8 billion, there were roughly 60 sovereign
> states in the world, the automobile was still a rarity, and there were
> no commercial passenger flights and no transcontinental telephone

> billion people take 93,000 commercial flights a day from 9,000
> airports, drive 1 billion cars, and carry 7 billion mobile
> phones around with them.

In numerous ways, [[life has gotten]{.mark} **substantially
[better]{.mark}** in this]{.underline} more crowded and [interconnected
era. **Seventy years ago**, global [war killed]{.mark} **scores of
[millions]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark} **interstate
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} has [[declined]{.mark} sharply since
the end of World War II, and the creation of the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [ushered in]{.underline} a far more egalitarian
and [democratic]{.underline} form of **[international
governance]{.underline}** than existed in any previous era. Today,
[militarily powerful states are **far less free** than in the pre-U.N.
era to use **overt force**]{.underline} to accomplish their aims, [and
the world now has numerous transna**tional courts** and
dispute-resolution bodies that collectively offer]{.underline} states [a
viable alternative to the use of force. [The modern]{.mark}
international [order]{.mark} is **no global utopia**, but it sure
[beats]{.mark} **colonial domination** and **[world
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the 50 years that followed World War II, medical and agricultural
[[advances brought]{.mark} **unprecedented health** and
**[prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline} to most parts of the globe. More
recently, the [communications]{.underline} revolution has
[enabled]{.underline} exciting new forms of nongovernmental
**[cross-border [alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}** to emerge,
[empowering]{.underline}, for instance, [global **human
[rights]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} environmental
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline}. In just the last two decades, the
near-universal penetration of mobile phones has had a powerful leveling
effect: All over the globe, people at every age and income level can use
these tiny but powerful computers to learn foreign languages, solve
complex mathematical problems, create and share videos, watch the news,
move money around, or communicate with far-flung friends.

All [this has had a **dark side**]{.underline}, of course. [As access to
knowledge has been democratized, so]{.underline} too [has access to the
**tools of violence** and destruction, and greater]{.underline} global
[[interconnectedness enables **disease**]{.mark}, **pollution**, [and
**conflict** to spread]{.mark} quickly and **easily beyond
borders**]{.underline}. A hundred years ago, no single individual or
nonstate actor could do more than cause localized mayhem; today,
[[we]{.mark} have to [worry about]{.mark} massive
**[bio]{.mark}engineered [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} created by tiny
terrorist cells [[and]{.mark} globally **devastating
[cyberattacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} devised by malevolent teen hackers.

Even as many forms of power have grown more democratized and diffuse,
other forms of power have grown more concentrated. A very small number
of states control and consume a disproportionate share of the world's
resources, and a very small number of individuals control most of the
world's wealth. (According to a 2014 Oxfam report, the 85 richest
individuals on Earth are worth more than the globe's 3.5 billion poorest
people).

Indeed, [from a **species-survival** perspective, the world has grown
**vastly more dangerous**]{.underline} over the last century. Individual
humans live longer than ever before, but [a small number of
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} now [possess the unprecedented ability to
**[destroy]{.mark}**]{.underline} large chunks of **[[the human
race]{.underline}]{.mark}** and possibly the Earth itself --- [all in a
matter of]{.underline} days or even [hours]{.underline}. What's more,
[[though]{.mark} the near-term threat of **interstate [nuclear
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} has greatly [diminished
since]{.underline} the end of [the Cold War, nuclear material and
know-how are]{.underline} now both [less controlled]{.underline} and
less controllable.

Amid all these changes, our world has also grown far more uncertain. We
possess more information than ever before and vastly greater processing
power, but the accelerating pace of global change has far exceeded our
collective ability to understand it, much less manage it. This makes it
increasingly difficult to make predictions or calculate risks. As
I've written previously:

This, then, is the character of world messiness in this first quarter of
the 21st century. So on to the next question: Where, in all this
messiness, does the United States find itself?

II\. The United States in the Mess: Goodbye, Lake Wobegon?

For Americans, [the **good news** is]{.underline} that [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[remains]{.mark} an **extraordinarily [powerful]{.mark}**
nation]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
"the most powerful military in history,"]{.underline} Obama declared in
a recent speech. Measured by sheer destructive capacity, he is surely
right. The United States spends more on its military than China, Russia,
Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and
India combined. [The U.S. military can get to more places, faster, with
more]{.underline} lethal and [effective weapons, than any military on
Earth]{.underline}.

The United States also manages to gobble up a disproportionate share of
the world's wealth and resources. By the year 2000, wrote Betsy Taylor
and Dave Tilford, the United States, with "less than 5 percent of the
world's population," was using "one-third of the world's paper, a
quarter of the world's oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the
aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper." In 2010, Americans possessed 39
percent of the planet's wealth.

The bad news for Americans? [U.S. power and global influence have been
**declining**]{.underline}. In part, this is [because
various]{.underline} once-[weak states have been growing stronger,
and]{.underline} in part, it's because [**no state** can be]{.underline}
as [autonomous]{.underline} today as it might have been in the past. The
United States' geographical position long helped protect it from
external interference, while its strong military and economy enabled it
to dominate or control numerous less powerful states. But
[globalization]{.underline} has [reduced every state's autonomy,
creating **collective challenges** --- from climate change
to]{.underline} the regulation of [capital --- that no state can fully
address]{.underline} on its own.

U.S. power and [global influence]{.underline} have also [declined in
**absolute terms**]{.underline}, as America's own political and economic
health has been called into question. The United States now has greater
income inequality than almost every other state in the developed world
--- and most states in the developing world. American life expectancy
ranks well below that of other industrialized democracies, and the same
is true for infant mortality and elementary school enrollment.
Meanwhile, the United States has the world's highest per
capita incarceration rate, and on international health and
quality-of-life metrics, the United States has been losing ground for
several decades. [This **domestic decline**]{.underline} jeopardizes the
country's continued ability to innovate and prosper; it also [makes
American]{.underline} values and the American political and economic
[systems less appealing to others]{.underline}.

Worse, the political system that Americans rely on for reform and repair
seems itself to be broken; the federal government shutdown in 2013
offered the world a striking illustration of U.S. political dysfunction.
Add to this the divisive national security policies of George W. Bush's
administration --- many of which were continued or expanded by the Obama
administration --- and it's no surprise that the United States has
recently become less admired and less emulated around the globe,
reducing American "soft power."

No matter how you slice it, it comes to the same thing: Compared with 30
years ago, the United States today has a greatly reduced ability to
control its own destiny or the destiny of other states. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [still has unprecedented power
to destroy]{.underline} (Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden both
discovered this, to their detriment). [But the country's capacity for
destruction is **not equaled** by its capacity to **shape the behavior**
of other states]{.underline} or their populations, [and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has **less and less ability**
to insulate itself from the world's woes]{.underline}.

Unfortunately, American political leaders share a bipartisan inclination
to deny these realities. Mostly, they succumb to the Lake Wobegon
effect: "Declinism" and "declinist" have entered the American political
vocabulary, but only as purely pejorative terms.

This is both stupid and dangerous. How can we adapt our global strategy
to compensate for the ways in which U.S. power has been declining if we
refuse to admit that decline?

[Continued U.S. decline is]{.underline} certainly **[not
inevitable]{.underline}**, and some argue that the United States is in
fact poised for an economic and political resurgence. There is no way to
know for sure --- but it's worth recalling that, historically, every
significant empire has eventually declined. Are we prepared to bet that
the United States will prove an exception?

There is also no way to know for sure what form continued or eventual
U.S. decline will take. We don't know whether it will be fast or slow;
we don't know whether the American Empire is in for a hard landing or a
soft one. Will the United States crash, like the former Soviet Union? Or
will a slow decline in power leave the country an intact and influential
nation, like the United Kingdom? Will America's future be more like
Canada's present, or more like Brazil's?

III\. Behind the Veil of Ignorance: Uncertainty as Lodestone

We don't know what America's future will look like, and we can make
fewer and fewer geopolitical predictions with confidence. The world has
changed too much and too fast for us to accurately assess the
probabilities of many types of future events. Perhaps this is why it's
so tempting for Americans to stay in Lake Wobegon, with eyes closed and
fingers crossed. Uncertainty is frightening.

But paradoxically, this very [uncertainty should be a **lodestone**,
pointing realists]{.underline} and idealists alike [toward a sensible,
forward-looking **global strategy**]{.underline}. In fact, radical
uncertainty can be a powerful tool for strategic planning.

That may seem oxymoronic, but consider one of the 20th century's most
influential thought experiments: In his 1971 book, A Theory of Justice,
philosopher John Rawls famously sought to use a hypothetical situation
involving extreme uncertainty to derive optimal principles of justice.

Imagine, said Rawls, rational, free, and equal humans seeking to devise
a set of principles to undergird the structure of human society. Imagine
further that they must reason from behind what Rawls dubbed a "veil of
ignorance," which hides from them their own future status or attributes.
Behind the veil of ignorance, wrote Rawls, people still possess general
knowledge of economics, science, and so forth, and they can draw on this
knowledge to assist them in designing a future society. Their ignorance
is limited to their own future role in the society they are designing:
"no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status,
nor does any one know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets
and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like."

If we were collectively designing social structures and rules, but could
not know our own individual future positions in that social structure,
what structures and rules would we come up with? Applying a version
of decision theory, Rawls concluded that in the face of such radical
uncertainty, rational, free, and equal beings behind the veil of
ignorance would be drawn toward a "maximin" (or "minimax") rule of
decision, in which they would seek to minimize their losses in a
worst-case scenario. Since those behind the veil of ignorance don't know
whether they'll be among the haves or among the have-nots in the society
they are designing, they should seek to build a society in which they
each will be least badly off --- even the luck of the draw leads them to
start with the fewest advantages.

Rawls posited that such a rule of decision should lead those behind the
veil of ignorance to support two core principles: the first relating to
liberty ("each person \[should\] have an equal right to the most
extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others"),
and the second relating to social and economic goods. (Social goods
should be distributed equally, unless an unequal distribution would
serve the common good and be "to the greatest benefit of the least
advantaged," while "offices and positions \[should remain\] open to all
under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.")

This is in some ways intuitive: On a national level, it is the reason
Americans across the political spectrum continue to express
substantial support for the maintenance of unemployment benefits, Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and so on. Any one of us might someday
face a job loss or illness; nearly all of us will eventually face old
age. We know we might someday need those benefits ourselves. In the face
of uncertainty about the future, we all recognize the value of
insurance, savings, and at least some minimal social safety net.

In the international arena, the same is true.

[This has **obvious implications** for global strategy]{.underline}.
Empires, like individuals, can sink into poverty, illness, or simple old
age --- and in an era of uncertainty, empires, like individuals, would
do well to hedge against the possibility of future misfortune.

Indeed, two decades after the publication of A Theory of Justice, Rawls
sought to apply a form of this thought experiment to derive the core
principles that he believed would characterize a just global order. His
arguments are complex, and I can't do justice to them here --- but
fortunately, unlike Rawls, I am not interested in coming up with
abstract principles of global justice. My less lofty agenda is limited
to arguing that a crude version of Rawls's thought experiment can help
us delineate the contours of a sensible U.S. global strategy --- a
"maximin" strategy that is well-suited to protecting the interests of
the United States and its people, both in today's messy world and in a
wide range of future messes.

Here's my thought experiment.

Imagine a crude version of Rawls's veil of ignorance, with only the
United States behind it. This veil of ignorance doesn't require us to
disavow what we know of history (America's or the world's), nor does it
require us to disavow what we know of recent trends, present global
realities, U.S. values, or our current conception of the good. It only
hides our future from us: Behind this veil of ignorance, we don't know
whether energy, food, water, and other vital resources will be scarcer
or more plentiful in the decades to come; we don't know whether global
power will be more or less centralized; we don't know whether new
technologies and new forms of social organization will make existing
technologies and institutions obsolete.

Most of all, we don't know whether, in the decades to come, the United
States will be rich or poor, weak or strong, respected or hated. For
that matter, we don't know whether the United States --- or even the
form of political organization we call the nation-state --- will exist
at all a century or two from now. In the face of such radical
uncertainty, what kind of grand strategy should a rational United States
adopt?

Of course, this shouldn't really be called a "thought experiment" at
all: The United States already operates behind a veil of ignorance, if
we could only bring ourselves to admit it. We know the past; we have a
reasonable understanding of recent trends; we know that the world is
messy and dangerous; we know that the potential for rapid and
potentially catastrophic change is real; and we know that our ability to
predict future changes and quantify various risks is profoundly limited.

This knowledge is profoundly unsettling. Thus, we try our best to know
and not know, at the same time: We speak glibly of complexity,
accelerating change, danger, and uncertainty, but then fall back into
the comfortable assumption that continued U.S. global dominance is a
given and that catastrophic change is unlikely to occur. As long as we
remain willfully ignorant of the veil of ignorance that hangs over us,
we can avoid asking hard questions and making harder choices.

But this is shortsighted and dangerous. [[Empires]{.mark} that **refuse
to accept reality** tend to **rapidly decline**. A clear-eyed acceptance
of uncertainty]{.underline} and risk [is the **surest route** to a more
secure future]{.underline}. Instead of blinding us or paralyzing us, the
[uncertainty]{.underline} of our future [should motivate]{.underline} us
to engage in more responsible [strategic planning]{.underline}.

If [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates can manage to be as
rational as Rawls's hypothetical decision-makers, it should adopt a
similar maximin rule of decision: It [[should prefer]{.mark}
**international [rules]{.mark}** [and institutions that will **maximize
America**]{.mark}**'s odds** of thriving]{.underline}, even [in a
worst-case future scenario]{.underline}. In fact, we should wish for
international rules and institutions that will be kindest to the
individuals living in what is now the United States and their
descendants, even if the United States should someday cease to exist
entirely.

Could happen, folks. Look around you. Do you see the Roman Empire, or
the Aztec Empire, or the Ottoman Empire?

IV\. From Messiness to Strategy: A Preliminary Sketch

[This has **urgent implications** for]{.underline} U.S. [strategic
planning]{.underline}. Precisely [because U.S. global power
may]{.underline} very well [continue to decline, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should use]{.underline} the very considerable
military, political, cultural, and economic [power]{.underline} it still
has [to foster the **international order**]{.underline} most [likely to
benefit the country if it]{.underline} someday [loses that
power]{.underline}.

[The ultimate objective of [U.S.]{.mark} grand [strategy should]{.mark}
be]{.underline} the [[creat]{.mark}ion of [an **equitable**]{.mark} and
**peaceful** international [order with]{.mark} an **[effective]{.mark}
system** of **global [governance]{.mark}** --- one]{.underline} that is
[**[built upon]{.mark} respect** for **[human]{.mark} dignity**, **human
[rights]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} the **[rule of law]{.mark}**, with
robust mechanisms [for resolving]{.mark}]{.underline} thorny
**[collective [problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

We should seek this not because it's the "morally right" thing for the
United States to do, but because a maximin decision rule should lead us
to conclude that this will offer the United States and its population
the best chance of continuing to thrive, even in the event of a radical
future decline in U.S. wealth and power.

But, one might argue, the United States already tries to promote such a
global order --- right?

Sure it does --- but only inconsistently, and generally as something of
an afterthought. We pour money into our military and intelligence
communities, but starve our diplomats and development agencies. We
fixate on the threat du jour, often exaggerating it and allowing it to
distort our foreign policy in self-destructive ways (cf. Iraq War),
while viewing matters such as United Nations reform or reform of global
economic institutions or environmental protection rules as tedious and
of low priority. [If we take seriously the many **potential dangers**
lurking in the]{.underline} unknowable [future]{.underline}, however,
[fostering a **stronger**, **fairer**, and **more effective** system of
[**international governance** would become]{.mark}]{.underline} a matter
of urgent national self-interest and [[our **highest**]{.mark}
**strategic [priority]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- something that should
be reflected both in our policies and in our budgetary decisions.

[An effective **global governance system** would need to be built upon
the recognition that states remain the primary mode of]{.underline}
political and social [organization in the international
sphere]{.underline}, but also upon the recognition that new forms of
social organization continue to evolve and may ultimately displace at
least some states. [An effective]{.underline} and dynamic [international
system will]{.underline} need to [develop innovative ways to
bring]{.underline} such new [actors]{.underline} and organizations
[**within the ambit** of international law]{.underline} and
institutions, both [as responsible]{.underline} creators of law and
[institutions]{.underline} and as responsible subjects.

#### That soft power is key to effective leadership and reinvigorating multilateral alliances 

**Jervis, 9**

(Professor of international politics at Columbia University. (Robert,
Unipolarity: A Structural Perspective, World Politics Volume 61, Number
1, January 2009)

[To say that the system is unipolar is not to argue that the unipole can
get everything it wants or that it has no need for others. [American
power]{.mark}]{.underline} is very great, but it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[subject to]{.underline}]{.mark} two
familiar [[limitations]{.underline}]{.mark}: it is harder to build than
to destroy, and [success usually depends on others'
decisions]{.underline}. This is particularly true of the current system
because of what the U.S. wants. If Hitler had won World War II, he might
have been able to maintain his system for some period of time with
little cooperation from others because "all" he wanted was to establish
the supremacy of the Aryan race. [The U.S. wants not only to prevent the
rise of a peer competitor but also to stamp out terrorism, maintain an
open international economic system, spread democracy throughout the
world, and establish a high degree of cooperation among
countries]{.underline} that remain juridically equal. Even in the
military arena, [[the U.S. cannot act]{.mark} completely [alone]{.mark}.
Bases and overflight rights are always needed, and support from
allies]{.underline}, especially Great Britain, [is important to validate
military action]{.underline} in the eyes of the American public. [When
one matches American forces]{.underline}, not against those of an
adversary but against the tasks at hand, [they often fall short. Against
terrorism, force is ineffective without excellent
intelligence]{.underline}. Given the international nature of the threat
and the difficulties of gaining information about it, [[international
cooperation is the **only route to success**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
maintenance of international prosperity also requires joint
efforts]{.underline}, even leaving aside the danger that other countries
could trigger a run on the dollar by cashing in their holdings. Despite
its lack of political unity, Europe is in many respects an economic
unit, and one with a greater gdp than that of the U.S. Especially
[because of the]{.underline} growing [Chinese economy, economic power is
spread around the world much more equally than is military power, and
the open economic system could easily disintegrate despite continued
unipolarity]{.underline}. In parallel, [on a whole host of problems such
as aids, poverty, and international crime (even leaving aside climate
change), [the unipole can lead]{.mark}]{.underline} and exert pressure
[[but **cannot dictate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Joint actions may be
necessary to apply sanctions to]{.underline} various
[unpleasant]{.underline} and recalcitrant [regimes; proliferation can be
stopped only if all the major states]{.underline} (and many minor ones)
[work]{.underline} to this end; [unipolarity did not automatically
enable the U.S. to maintain the coalition against Iraq after the first
Gulf War; close ties within the West are needed to reduce the ability of
China, Russia, and other states to play one Western country off against
the others]{.underline}. But in comparison with the cold war era, [there
are fewer incentives today for allies to cooperate with the U.S. During
the earlier period]{.underline} unity and [[close
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [permitted military
efficiencies but]{.underline}, more importantly, [[gave **credibility**
to the American nuclear umbrella]{.mark} that protected the
allies]{.underline}. Serious splits were dangerous because they entailed
the risk that the Soviet Union would be emboldened. This reason for
avoiding squabbles disappeared along with the USSR, and the point is
likely to generalize to other unipolar systems if they involve a
decrease of threats that call for maintaining good relations with the
superpower. This does not mean that even in this particular unipolar
system the superpower is like Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians. In
some areas opposition can be self-defeating. Thus for any country to
undermine American leadership of the international economy would be to
put its own economy at risk, even if the U.S. did not retaliate, and for
a country to sell a large proportion of its dollar holding would be to
depress the value of the dollar, thereby diminishing the worth of the
country's remaining stock of this currency. Furthermore, [cooperation
often follows strong and essentially unilateral action]{.underline}.
Without the war in Iraq it is not likely that we would have seen the
degree of cooperation that the U.S. obtained from Europe in combating
the Iranian nuclear program and from Japan and the PRC in containing
North Korea. [Nevertheless, [many of the American goals depend on
**persuading** others, not **coercing** them]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although incentives and even force are not irrelevant to spreading
democracy and the free market, [at bottom this requires people to
embrace a set of institutions and values. Building the world that the
U.S. seeks is a political, social, and even psychological task for which
[unilateral measures are likely to be unsuited]{.mark}]{.underline} and
for which American military and economic strength can at best play a
supporting role. [[Success requires that others share the American
vision and believe that its leadership is benign]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Multilateralism is an impact filter -- great power sharing checks escalation of conflict

**Pouliot, 11**

Professor of Political Science at McGill University (Vincent,
"Multilateralism as an End in Itself", International Studies
Perspectives (2011) 12, 18--26)

Because it rests on open, nondiscriminatory debate, and the routine
exchange of viewpoints, the multilateral procedure introduces three key
advantages that are gained, regardless of the specific policies adopted,
and tend to diffuse across all participants. Contrary to the standard
viewpoint, according to which a rational preference or functional
imperative lead to multilateral cooperation, here it is the systematic
practice [of [multilateralism]{.mark} that [creates the drive to
cooperate]{.mark}. At the theoretical level, the premise is that it is
not only what people think that explains what they do, but also what
they do that determines what they think (Pouliot 2010). Everyday
multilateralism is a self-fulfilling practice for at least three
reasons. First, the joint practice of multilateralism creates mutually
recognizable [\[and\] patterns of action ]{.mark}]{.underline}among
global actors. This process owes to the fact that practices structure
social interaction (Adler and Pouliot forthcoming).2 Because they are
meaningful, organized, and repeated, practices generally convey a degree
of mutual intelligibility that allows people to develop social relations
over time. In the field of international security, for example, the
practice of deterrence is premised on a limited number of gestures,
signals, and linguistic devices that are meant, as Schelling (1966:113)
put it, to [''getting the right signal across.'' The same goes with the
practice of multilateralism, which rests on a set of political and
social patterns that establish the boundaries of action in a mutually
intelligible fashion. These structuring effects, in turn, allow for the
development of common frameworks for appraising global
events.]{.underline} Multilateral dialog serves not only to find joint
solutions; it also makes it possible for various actors to zoom in on
the definition of the issue at hand---a particularly important step on
the global stage. The point is certainly not that the multilateral
procedure leads everybody to agree on everything---that would be as
impossible as counterproductive. Theoretically speaking, there is room
for skepticism that multilateralism may ever allow communicative
rationality at the global level (see Risse 2000; Diez and Steans 2005).
With such a diverse and uneven playing field, one can doubt that
discursive engagement, in and of itself, can lead to common lifeworlds.
Instead, what the practice of multilateralism fosters is the emergence
of a shared framework of interaction---for example, a common linguistic
repertoire---that allows global actors to make sense of world politics
in mutually recognizable ways. Of course, [[they may not agree
on]{.mark} the specific [actions]{.mark} to be taken, [but]{.mark} at
least [they can build on an established pattern of political interaction
to deal with the problem]{.mark} at hand---sometimes even before it
emerges in acute form.]{.underline} In today's pluralistic world, that
would already be a considerable achievement. In that sense,
multilateralism may well be a constitutive practice of what Lu (2009)
calls ''political friendship among peoples.'' The axiomatic practice of
principled and inclusive dialog is quite apparent in the way she
describes this social structure: ''While
[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially over the distribution of
goods and burdens, [[will]{.mark} inevitably arise, under conditions of
political friendship among peoples, they will [be negotiated
within]{.mark} a global background context of norms and [institutions
based on]{.mark} mutual recognition, equity in the distribution of
burdens and benefits of global [cooperation, and
power-sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} in the institutions of global
governance rather than domination by any group'' (2009:54--55). In a
world where multilateralism becomes an end in itself, this ideal pattern
emerges out of the structuring effects of axiomatic practice: take the
case of NATO, for instance, which has recently had to manage, through
the multilateral practice, fairly strong internal dissent (Pouliot
2006). While clashing views and interests will never go away in our
particularly diverse world, as pessimists are quick to emphasize (for
example, Dahl 1999), the management of discord is certainly made easier
by shared patterns of dialog based on mutually recognizable frameworks.
Second, the [[multilateral procedure]{.mark} typically [ensures]{.mark}
a remarkable level of [moderation in]{.mark} the [global
policies]{.mark} adopted. In fact, a quick historical tour d'horizon
suggests that [actors engaged in multilateralism tend to avoid radical
solutions]{.mark} in]{.underline} their joint decision making. Of
course, the very process of uniting disparate voices helps explain why
multilateralism tends to produce median consensus. This is not to say
that the multilateral practice inevitably leads to lowest common
denominators. To repeat, because it entails complex and often
painstaking debate before any actions are taken, [[the multilateral
procedure forces]{.mark} involved [actors to devise]{.mark} and
potentially share [similar analytical lenses]{.mark}]{.underline} that,
in hindsight, make the policies adopted seem inherently, and seemingly
''naturally,'' moderate. This is because the debate about what a given
policy means takes place before its implementation, which makes for a
much smoother ride when decisions hit the ground. This joint
interpretive work, which constitutes a crucial aspect of
multilateralism, creates outcomes that are generally perceived as
inherently reasonable. Participation brings inherent benefits to
politics, as Bachrach (1975) argued in the context of democratic theory.
Going after the conventional liberal view according to which actors
enter politics with an already fixed set of preferences, Bachrach
observes that most of the time people define their interests in the very
process of participation. The argument is not that interests formed in
the course of social interaction are in any sense more altruistic. It
rather is that the nature and process of political practices, in this
case [[multilateralism, matter a great deal in shaping participants'
preferences]{.mark} (Wendt 1999). In this sense, not only does the
multilateral practice have structuring effects on global governance, but
it is also constitutive of what actors say, want, and do (Adler and
Pouliot forthcoming). Third and related, multilateralism lends
legitimacy to the policies that it generates by virtue of the
debate]{.underline} that the process necessarily entails. There is no
need here to explain at length how deliberative processes that are
inclusive of all stakeholders tend to produce outcomes that are
generally considered more socially and politically acceptable. In the
long run, the large [ownership also leads to more efficient
implementation, because actors feel invested in the enactment of
solutions on the ground.]{.underline} Even episodes of political
failure, such as the lack of UN reaction to the Rwandan genocide, can
generate useful lessons when re-appropriated multilaterally---think of
the Responsibility to Protect, for instance.3 From this outlook, there
is no contradiction between efficiency and the axiomatic practice of
multilateralism, quite the contrary. The more multilateralism becomes
the normal or self-evident practice of global governance, the more
benefits it yields for the many stakeholders of global governance. In
fact, multilateralism as an end in and of itself could generate even
more diffuse reciprocity than Ruggie had originally envisioned. Not only
do its distributional consequences tend to even out[,
[multilateralism]{.mark} as a global governance routine also [creates
self-reinforcing dynamics and new focal points for strategic
interaction]{.mark}. The axiomatic practice of]{.underline}
multilateralism helps define problems in commensurable ways and craft
moderate solutions with wide-ranging ownership---three processual
benefits that further strengthen the impetus for multilateral dialog.

Fellow at the New America Foundation

I\'ve written about these issues before (here and here), and at risk of
being both a narcissist and a broken record, I\'ll quote myself: The
world has grown more complex. Believe it. The world now contains more
people living in more states than ever before, and we\'re all more
interconnected. A hundred years ago, the world population was about 1.8
billion, there were roughly 60 sovereign states in the world, the
automobile was still a rarity, and there were no commercial passenger
flights and no transcontinental telephone service. Fifty years ago,
global population had climbed to more than 3 billion and there were 115
U.N. member states, but air travel was still for the wealthy and the
personal computer still lay two decades in the future. Today? We\'ve got
7 billion people living in 192 U.N. member states and a handful of other
territories. These 7 billion people take 93,000 commercial flights a day
from 9,000 airports, drive 1 billion cars, and carry 7 billion mobile
phones around with them. In numerous ways, life has gotten substantially
better in this more crowded and interconnected era. [Seventy years ago,
global war killed]{.underline} scores of [millions]{.underline}, but
[interstate [conflict has declined **sharply**]{.mark} since the end of
World War II, and]{.underline} [the creation of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations [[ushered in]{.mark} a]{.underline}
far [more [egalitarian]{.mark}]{.underline} and democratic [form of
international [governance]{.mark} than existed in any previous
era.]{.underline} Today, [militarily powerful [states are]{.mark} far
[less free]{.mark} than in the pre-U.N. era [to use]{.mark} overt
[force]{.mark}]{.underline} to accomplish their aims, and the world now
has numerous transnational courts and dispute-resolution bodies that
collectively offer states a viable alternative to the use of force.
[[The modern]{.mark} international [order is no]{.mark} global [utopia,
but it]{.mark} sure [beats]{.mark}]{.underline} colonial domination and
**[[world wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the 50 years that followed
World War II, medical and agricultural advances brought unprecedented
health and prosperity to most parts of the globe. More recently, the
communications revolution has enabled exciting new forms of
nongovernmental cross-border alliances to emerge, empowering, for
instance, global human rights and environmental movements. In just the
last two decades, the near-universal penetration of mobile phones has
had a powerful leveling effect: All over the globe, people at every age
and income level can use these tiny but powerful computers to learn
foreign languages, solve complex mathematical problems, create and share
videos, watch the news, move money around, or communicate with far-flung
friends. [All this has had a dark side]{.underline}, of course. As
access to knowledge has been democratized, so too has access to the
tools of violence and destruction, and [[greater **global
interconnectedness** enables]{.mark} disease, pollution, and [conflict
to]{.mark} **[spread quickly]{.mark}** and easily **[beyond
borders]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A hundred years ago, no single
individual or nonstate actor could do more than cause localized mayhem;
today, we have to worry about massive bioengineered threats created by
tiny terrorist cells and globally devastating cyberattacks devised by
malevolent teen hackers. Even as many forms of power have grown more
democratized and diffuse, other forms of power have grown more
concentrated. A very small number of states control and consume a
disproportionate share of the world\'s resources, and a very small
number of individuals control most of the world\'s wealth. (According to
a 2014 Oxfam report, the 85 richest individuals on Earth are worth more
than the globe\'s 3.5 billion poorest people). Indeed, [[**from a
species-survival perspective**, the world has grown]{.mark} **vastly
more [dangerous]{.mark} over the last century**]{.underline}. Individual
humans live longer than ever before, but [a small number of
[states]{.mark} now [possess the]{.mark} unprecedented [ability to
destroy]{.mark} large chunks of [**the human race** and]{.mark} possibly
the **[Earth itself]{.mark}**]{.underline} \-- all [in]{.underline} [a
matter of]{.underline} days or even [hours]{.underline}. What\'s more,
though the near-term threat of interstate nuclear conflict has greatly
diminished since the end of the Cold War, nuclear material and know-how
are now both less controlled and less controllable. Amid all these
changes, [our world has also grown far more uncertain]{.underline}. We
possess more information than ever before and vastly greater processing
power, but the accelerating pace of global change has far exceeded our
collective ability to understand it, much less manage it. This makes it
increasingly difficult to make predictions or calculate risks. As I\'ve
written previously: [We literally have no points of comparison for
understanding the scale and scope of the risks faced by humanity
today.]{.underline} Compared to the long, slow sweep of human history,
the events of the last century have taken place in the blink of an eye.
This should \... give us pause when we\'re tempted to conclude that
today\'s trends are likely to continue. Rising life expectancy? That\'s
great, but if climate change has consequences as nasty as some predict,
a century of rising life expectancy could turn out to be a mere blip on
the charts. A steep decline in interstate conflicts? Fantastic, but less
than 70 years of human history isn\'t much to go on\.... That\'s why
[[one can\'t dismiss]{.mark} the risk of [catastrophic events \[such
as]{.mark} disastrous climate change or [**nuclear conflict**\]
as]{.mark} \"high consequence, [**low
probability**.]{.mark}]{.underline}[\" [How do we
compute]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [probability of]{.mark} catastrophic
[events]{.mark} of a type [that has never happened]{.mark}]{.underline}?
Does 70 years without nuclear annihilation tell us that there\'s a low
probability of nuclear catastrophe \-- or just tell us that we haven\'t
had a nuclear catastrophe yet?\... Lack of catastrophic change might
signify a system in stable equilibrium, but sometimes \-- as with
earthquakes \-- pressure may be building up over time, undetected\....
Most analysts assumed the Soviet Union was stable \-- until it
collapsed. Analysts predicted that Egypt\'s Hosni Mubarak would retain
his firm grip on power \-- until he was ousted. How much of what we
currently file under \"Stable\" should be recategorized under \"Hasn\'t
Collapsed Yet\"? This, then, is the character of world messiness in this
first quarter of the 21st century. So on to the next question: Where, in
all this messiness, does the United States find itself?

[Because the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} their [Allies share common security interests and
common values and face common challenges]{.underline} (threats, risks),
[they rely on other **partnering nations**]{.underline}. All major NATO
nations' strategies recognize and emphasize the importance of
multinational operations; each country reaffirms its will to act with
others when it can, giving priority to "regional" or "ideological"
allies and friends. Multinational operations are often analyzed as a
compromise between military capability and political constraints,
usually include a wide spectrum of missions; the intensity ranges from
war to long-term tasks with a civilian nature in which the military
apparatus plays a minor but necessary role. Multilateral actions of war
are the extreme circumstance for [[conducting]{.mark}
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} whose goal is to quickly [achieve]{.mark}
the [multinational]{.mark} collective [objectives with as little cost as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Peacetime engagement activities involving
the military help to shape the security strategic environment by sharing
experience in early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management,
post-conflict rehabilitation, promotion of human rights, and
strengthening democratic reforms. Although they are theoretically based
on individual State requests and needs, bilateral military relations
with "neutral" States and the [[S]{.mark}tate [P]{.mark}artnership
[P]{.mark}rogram]{.underline} / PfP seek means to [[achieve]{.mark}
**rationalization**]{.underline}, **[standardization]{.underline}**,
[and **[interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline} that will [significantly
enhance the probability of operational success in multinational
missions]{.underline}. For commanders as for political actors, the key
is to build relationships, trust, cooperation, and cohesion at all
military levels, while overcoming language and cultural barriers and
relevantly applying common procedures or norms.

These [accomplishments display U.S. commitment in relevant security
areas]{.underline}, and are [designed to [lend **credibility**]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} its [alliances]{.mark} by enhancing regional
stability]{.underline} and providing a crisis response capability
[[while **promoting**]{.mark} [**U.S. influence** and
**access**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Four significant paths have been
followed by the SPP/PfP since the beginning of the 21st century. Several
countries from Central and Eastern Europe have become members of NATO,
correlatively the number of SPP/ PfP participating countries. NATO has
also multiplied several instruments (Individual Partnership Program;
Planning and Review Process; Operational Capabilities Concept) which
deepen this program by allowing partners to adapt their participation
through additional opportunities based upon their national objectives
and capacities and perspective (Individual Partnership Action Plan ;
Annual National Program; Membership Action Plan). A third dimension of
NATO partnership is directly linked to the allied military presence in
Afghanistan[. [At]{.mark} tactical and [operational
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[SPP]{.mark} innovative
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} combined with PfP [low-tech and

[tech]{.mark}nologies** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} most of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and non- NATO partners. The second aspect
here is the growing strategic importance of the Caucasus and Central
Asia that come out as the existence of PfP countries/SPP participants in
the region and the perspective of the future Afghan participation in
NATO partnership initiatives. Finally, the PfP is increasingly used to
build cooperative relationships with countries in the region by
regionalizing the treatment of security and stabilization missions.

Escalating political violence that does not result in a failed or
collapse state can still lead to tragic consequences that are less than
civil war. This quasi-conflict condition of becoming a continuing
simmering state with the potentially violent state action referred to as
a "Frozen Conflict". Examples of potential for unchecked political
terror are the Frozen Conflicts in Moldova, Armenia, and
NagornoKarabakh. In these nations, there are no massively scaled,
centrally coordinated military operations ongoing, but nonetheless,
repressive actions of government forces continue against an indigenous
separatist population seeking autonomy. In addition, [while there is
**no US commitment** of active duty, military combat troop

international politics, as discussed by Waltz, neither foreign policy
nor federalism is able to address the growth of state policies because
of the divided nature of the programs used. That is, implemented on a
national level, while carried out on a provincial level.

There is evidence of a significant quantitative knowledge gap between

National Guard leadership and foreign partners continually state these
qualitative outcomes of SPP. Conversely, the Government Accounting

that SPP needs far more quantitative data collection and analysis to
properly assess program efficiency and effectiveness. The measurable
outcomes, not merely public budgeting line item outputs, on democratic
consolidation principles such as reducing political terror in partner
nations, are needed to assess SPP program effectiveness. Though **[the
program is wildly popular]{.underline}**, there remains a disconnection
between leadership's pronouncements and a testable, measurable program
evaluation. Until most recently, SPP effectiveness as has been
qualitatively evaluated and the results consistently associated with the
value of trust-building and strengthening relationships with foreign
partners (NGAUS, 2016). Evaluation metrics included outputs related to
the number of foreign engagement missions, the numbers of individual
troops participating in SPP events, and the dollars spent in
implementing the SPP annually. The evaluation of program effectiveness
has not broached the broader concept of the whether the program affects
long-term outcomes on democratic consolidation and political terror.
Countering the possibly biased qualitative assessment of stakeholders,
the official US Government's assessments of security cooperation
programs in general, and of SPP, in particular, offer much more tempered
endorsements of such programs: According to the private National Guard
of the United States Association (NGUSA): [The]{.underline} [National
Guard State Partnership Program]{.underline} (SPP) [is]{.underline} one
of the most innovative **[low-cost security cooperation]{.underline}**
tools available to the United States...In addition to
military-to-military engagements; SPP leverages the whole-of-society

whole-of-government engagements. Though **[policymaker
support]{.underline}** for DSC programs **[is strong and
pronouncements]{.underline}** **[of great success are
common]{.underline}**, there is a counter-argument to its success. There
are obvious real-world events that challenge the efficaciousness of DSC
programs in building stabilization and/or stemming the use of state
security forces to violently suppress political dissent or for soldiers
to attack the government. These counter arguments are usually in real
world news headlines from around the world. 31

[Ballot [Initiatives]{.mark} that [Respond to **Federal
Inaction**]{.mark}]{.underline}

There were a number of policy issues that appeared on multiple state
ballots during the past several election cycles. Voters have cast their
ballots on topics ranging from same-sex marriage and gambling to
education, energy, election reform, and taxes. Eminent domain, the
minimum wage, abortion, government finances, and animal rights were
other subjects that occupied voters' attention. This study focuses on
four issue areas, most of which were considered in multiple states and
targeted federal policy either by responding to perceived inaction or by
challenging federal law.

The Minimum Wage

Until the newly elected Democratic Congress tackled the issue in early
2007, the federal government had not enacted a minimum wage increase
since 1997, when it was raised to five dollars and fifteen cents an
hour. Not content to wait for the federal government to act on what they
perceived to be an important issue, in 2006 voters in six states
(Nevada, Arizona, Ohio, Colorado, Missouri, and Montana) ratified
initiatives to increase the minimum wage and index it to inflation, in
some cases overwhelmingly. Eleven state legislatures approved raises in
2006 as well. The average ''yes'' vote for the 2006 ballot measures was
66 percent, and the average margin of victory was thirty-one points. In
2004, voters in Florida and Nevada overwhelmingly supported minimum wage
ballot measures. In total, the National Conference of State Legislatures
(2007b) reports that thirty states and the District of Columbia have
adopted state minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum
wage. Clearly, despite inaction at the federal level there is much
support for raising the minimum wage among both state voters and elected
officials, including Democratic and some Republican governors and
legislators.

The ballot presence of hot-button issues such as same-sex marriage and
the minimum wage has led scholars to investigate the mobilizing effects
of these issues (Abramowitz 2004; Smith 2006; Nicholson 2005) and to
uncover evidence of initiatives' educative and electoral spillover
effects. Smith and Tolbert, among the first to study the educative
effects of direct democracy, found that initiative use is associated
with increases in voter turnout, civic engagement, political interest,
and political knowledge (Tolbert and Smith 2006; Smith and Tolbert
2004). Smith and Tolbert (2001), Kousser and McCubbins (2005), and
others document the spillover effects of ballot initiatives on broader
electoral and political processes such as citizens' voting behavior in
candidate elections and political party and interest group strategies.
Smith (2006) notes that political officials (such as Arnold
Schwarzenegger) and party operatives have skillfully used the initiative
process to advance their policy agendas, threaten the legislature into
action, and frame candidate elections. Smith, DeSantis, and Kassel
(2006) find a positive correlation between support for anti-same-sex
marriage measures and the vote for George W. Bush in Ohio and Michigan
in 2004. Kousser and McCubbins (2005) describe how Democratic party
activists in Colorado helped sponsor a successful 2004 initiative to
increase mass transit funding that contributed to high voter turnout and
Democratic victories in an election when Republican candidates dominated
in many other states. In a wide-ranging study, Nicholson (2005) finds
that ballot measures have agenda-setting, priming, and electoral
spillover effects, altering the weight voters assign to various issues,
the standards by which they evaluate candidates for congressional and
gubernatorial offices, and the strategies of political candidates and
parties.

No longer the exclusive domain of citizens or interest groups, political
party organizations, candidates, and elected officials now use
initiative elections for many purposes: To increase voter registration
and turnout, advance their political agendas and ideologies, circumvent
contribution and expenditure limits in candidate races, selectively
mobilize support for their own candidates, prime vote choice for issues
on which they believe they have an advantage, or drive a wedge in
opponent coalitions (Smith 2005, 2006; Kousser and McCubbins 2005; Smith
and Tolbert 2001). As candidates and parties seek initiative success for
policy or ideological reasons, they also force their opponents to drain
their resources in attempting to defeat initiatives that run counter to
their own policy and political goals.

The minimum wage ballot measures that experienced overwhelming success
in 2004 and 2006 were part of a concerted effort by progressive
activists to mobilize sympathetic voters and sway candidate elections.
Support for Florida's 2004 minimum wage initiative by the Association of
Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN) led to the adoption of the
measure as well as a successful voter registration drive. The group
appeared to achieve its goals of '''driving heightened Democratic
turnout, passing the initiative, and building permanent political
capacity for future gains''' (quoted in Kousser and McCubbins 2005,
973). In 2004 progressive activists in Nevada and Florida, with the
approval of the Democratic National Committee, used focus groups and
pre-election surveys to pretest the language of a variety of minimum
wage proposals. They selected those they believed would mobilize
low-income voters who would also support Democratic candidates,
including presidential nominee John Kerry (Smith 2006). In 2006, the
belief that minimum wage ballot initiatives could mobilize
Democratic-leaning voters was an attractive possibility for labor unions
(particularly the AFL-CIO, which launched its ''America Needs a Raise''
campaign that year) and other progressive groups such as ACORN
interested in unseating the Republican congressional leadership (Broder
2006; Andrews 2006). The objectives of minimum wage sponsors, then, were
manifold, including bringing about both state and federal policy change,
boosting voter registration and turnout, and influencing candidate
elections.

Even before they appeared on state ballots and in Congress, [proposals
to increase the minimum wage received high levels of support in public
opinion polls]{.underline} (Roper Center 2007, 55). Democrats in
Congress are certainly more sympathetic to a minimum wage increase than
are most Republicans, and it is not surprising that they would choose to
address the issue as one of their signature initiatives in the 110th
Congress in early 2007. Still, the evidence presented here suggests that
supporters of raising the minimum wage were able to simultaneously
achieve three objectives: [[Advocates took **independent state-level
action**]{.mark} to address a policy issue of public
concern]{.underline}; they had a hand in helping to bring about an
electoral majority in Congress more favorable to increasing the minimum
wage; and their efforts led to increased turnout (if not Democratic
victories) in at least some of the states where the measures appeared.

[As predicted, the [success]{.mark} of minimum wage initiatives
[in]{.mark} multiple [states]{.mark}]{.underline} during the 2004--2006
election cycle [[ultimately resulted in]{.mark} intergovernmental policy
[consensus. Impatient with]{.mark} the pace of [federal
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} to raise the minimum wage, [[state
lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and voters [used the legislative
process]{.underline} and direct democracy institutions [to [address the
issue]{.mark}, ultimately [producing]{.mark} a [divergence]{.mark} in
policy]{.underline} not only [[between states and the fed]{.mark}eral
government]{.underline} but across states as well. [The]{.underline}
newly elected [Democratic [Congress resolved this]{.mark} federal--state
policy diversity]{.underline} (if not state-to-state diversity; many
states set their minimum wage rates higher than the federal level) [by
acting to raise the minimum wage for the first time in ten years.
[However]{.mark}, some evidence suggests that **[state]{.mark} voters
and [policymakers, and not federal]{.mark} lawmakers, [receive]{.mark}
most of [the credit]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} policy [innovations that
**originate at the state level**. The House]{.mark} of Representatives
[passed a bill]{.mark} to raise the minimum wage]{.underline} during the
second week of the congressional session, [[but]{.mark} in
a]{.underline}n early February 2007 [poll [fewer than one in
five]{.mark} respondents [gave]{.mark} the House [credit]{.mark} for
this accomplishment]{.underline} (Roper Center 2007, 131); 84 percent of
survey respondents favored a minimum wage increase in 2006, but in March
2007 a mere 2 percent of respondents cited the issue when asked what was
the most important thing Congress had done in its first few months
(Roper Center 2007, 090). While [[Congress received **little credit**
for]{.mark} its [support]{.mark}]{.underline} for a minimum wage
increase, the initiatives' overwhelming success and the Democratic
takeover of Congress in 2007 brought state and federal policy more in
line with public opinion, enhancing the opinion-policy connection
particularly at the state level and fostering vertical policy consensus
and diffusion.

ballots on topics ranging from same-sex marriage and gambling to
education, energy, election reform, and taxes. Eminent domain, the
minimum wage, abortion, government finances, and animal rights were
other subjects that occupied voters' attention. This study focuses on
four issue areas, most of which were considered in multiple states and
targeted federal policy either by responding to perceived inaction or by
challenging federal law. The Minimum Wage Until the newly elected
Democratic Congress tackled the issue in early 2007, the federal
government had not enacted a minimum wage increase since 1997, when it
was raised to five dollars and fifteen cents an hour. Not content to
wait for the federal government to act on what they perceived to be an
important issue, in 2006 voters in six states (Nevada, Arizona, Ohio,
Colorado, Missouri, and Montana) ratified initiatives to increase the
minimum wage and index it to inflation, in some cases overwhelmingly.
Eleven state legislatures approved raises in 2006 as well. The average
''yes'' vote for the 2006 ballot measures was 66 percent, and the
average margin of victory was thirty-one points. In 2004, voters in
Florida and Nevada overwhelmingly supported minimum wage ballot
measures. In total, the National Conference of State Legislatures
(2007b) reports that thirty states and the District of Columbia have
adopted state minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum
wage. Clearly, despite inaction at the federal level there is much
support for raising the minimum wage among both state voters and elected
officials, including Democratic and some Republican governors and
legislators. The ballot presence of hot-button issues such as same-sex
marriage and the minimum wage has led scholars to investigate the
mobilizing effects of these issues (Abramowitz 2004; Smith 2006;
Nicholson 2005) and to uncover evidence of initiatives' educative and
electoral spillover effects. Smith and Tolbert, among the first to study
the educative effects of direct democracy, found that initiative use is
associated with increases in voter turnout, civic engagement, political
interest, and political knowledge (Tolbert and Smith 2006; Smith and
Tolbert 2004). Smith and Tolbert (2001), Kousser and McCubbins (2005),
and others document the spillover effects of ballot initiatives on
broader electoral and political processes such as citizens' voting
behavior in candidate elections and political party and interest group
strategies. Smith (2006) notes that political officials (such as Arnold
Schwarzenegger) and party operatives have skillfully used the initiative
process to advance their policy agendas, threaten the legislature into
action, and frame candidate elections. Smith, DeSantis, and Kassel
(2006) find a positive correlation between support for anti-same-sex
marriage measures and the vote for George W. Bush in Ohio and Michigan
in 2004. Kousser and McCubbins (2005) describe how Democratic party
activists in Colorado helped sponsor a successful 2004 initiative to
increase mass transit funding that contributed to high voter turnout and
Democratic victories in an election when Republican candidates dominated
in many other states. In a wide-ranging study, Nicholson (2005) finds
that ballot measures have agenda-setting, priming, and electoral
spillover effects, altering the weight voters assign to various issues,
the standards by which they evaluate candidates for congressional and
gubernatorial offices, and the strategies of political candidates and
parties. No longer the exclusive domain of citizens or interest groups,
political party organizations, candidates, and elected officials now use
initiative elections for many purposes: To increase voter registration
and turnout, advance their political agendas and ideologies, circumvent
contribution and expenditure limits in candidate races, selectively
mobilize support for their own candidates, prime vote choice for issues
on which they believe they have an advantage, or drive a wedge in
opponent coalitions (Smith 2005, 2006; Kousser and McCubbins 2005; Smith
and Tolbert 2001). As candidates and parties seek initiative success for
policy or ideological reasons, they also force their opponents to drain
their resources in attempting to defeat initiatives that run counter to
their own policy and political goals. The minimum wage ballot measures
that experienced overwhelming success in 2004 and 2006 were part of a
concerted effort by progressive activists to mobilize sympathetic voters
and sway candidate elections. Support for Florida's 2004 minimum wage
initiative by the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now
(ACORN) led to the adoption of the measure as well as a successful voter
registration drive. The group appeared to achieve its goals of
'''driving heightened Democratic turnout, passing the initiative, and
building permanent political capacity for future gains''' (quoted in
Kousser and McCubbins 2005, 973). In 2004 progressive activists in
Nevada and Florida, with the approval of the Democratic National
Committee, used focus groups and pre-election surveys to pretest the
language of a variety of minimum wage proposals. They selected those
they believed would mobilize low-income voters who would also support
Democratic candidates, including presidential nominee John Kerry (Smith
2006). In 2006, the belief that minimum wage ballot initiatives could
mobilize Democratic-leaning voters was an attractive possibility for
labor unions (particularly the AFL-CIO, which launched its ''America
Needs a Raise'' campaign that year) and other progressive groups such as
ACORN interested in unseating the Republican congressional leadership
(Broder 2006; Andrews 2006). The objectives of minimum wage sponsors,
then, were manifold, including bringing about both state and federal
policy change, boosting voter registration and turnout, and influencing
candidate elections. Even before they appeared on state ballots and in
Congress, proposals to increase the minimum wage received high levels of
support in public opinion polls (Roper Center 2007, 55). Democrats in
Congress are certainly more sympathetic to a minimum wage increase than
are most Republicans, and it is not surprising that they would choose to
address the issue as one of their signature initiatives in the 110th
Congress in early 2007. Still, the evidence presented here suggests that
supporters of raising the minimum wage were able to simultaneously
achieve three objectives: [[Advocates took **independent state-level
action** to address a policy issue]{.mark} of public
concern]{.underline}; they had a hand in helping to bring about an
electoral majority in Congress more favorable to increasing the minimum
wage; and their efforts led to increased turnout (if not Democratic
victories) in at least some of the states where the measures appeared.
[As predicted, the success of minimum wage initiatives in multiple
states]{.underline} during the 2004--2006 election cycle [ultimately
resulted in intergovernmental policy consensus. Impatient with the pace
of federal efforts]{.underline} to raise the minimum wage, [state
lawmakers]{.underline} and voters [used the legislative
process]{.underline} and direct democracy institutions [to address the
issue, ultimately producing a divergence in policy]{.underline} not only
[between states and the federal government]{.underline} but across
states as well. [The newly elected Democratic Congress resolved this
federal--state policy diversity]{.underline} (if not state-to-state
diversity; many states set their minimum wage rates higher than the
federal level) [by acting to raise the minimum wage for the first time
in ten years. However]{.underline}, some evidence suggests that
[**[state voters and policymakers, and not federal lawmakers,
receive]{.mark} most of [the credit]{.mark}** [for policy innovations
that **originate at the state level**. The House]{.mark} of
Representatives [passed a bill to raise]{.mark} the [minimum
wage]{.mark}]{.underline} during the second week of the congressional
session, [but in a]{.underline}n early February 2007 [poll fewer than
[one in five]{.mark} respondents [gave]{.mark} the House [credit]{.mark}
for this accomplishment]{.underline} (Roper Center 2007, 131); 84
percent of survey respondents favored a minimum wage increase in 2006,
but in March 2007 a mere 2 percent of respondents cited the issue when
asked what was the most important thing Congress had done in its first
few months (Roper Center 2007, 090). While [Congress received **little
credit** for its support]{.underline} for a minimum wage increase, the
initiatives' overwhelming success and the Democratic takeover of
Congress in 2007 brought state and federal policy more in line with
public opinion, enhancing the opinion-policy connection particularly at
the state level and fostering vertical policy consensus and diffusion.

[Security assistance in a **tense era** of **great power
competition**]{.underline} [is extremely sensitive and can increase
**tension** and lead to **miscalc**ulation]{.underline}. [The risk in
**today's geopolitical environment** is that providing **sensitive** and
potentially **provocative** assistance will not receive the same
scrutiny from policymakers and will become the **norm** for]{.underline}
the administering agency, [the DOD]{.underline}. [In the last era of
great power competition, the **Cold War**]{.underline}, [security
assistance]{.underline} often **[stoked tension]{.underline}** [between
the United States and the Soviet Union and led to **spiraling
commitments**]{.underline}. For instance, Soviet provision of nuclear
missiles to Cuba led to a **[nuclear]{.underline}** standoff, while U.S.
military support for Vietnam led to deepening U.S. engagement.

As competition with China and Russia increases, security assistance
could once again prove a major source of tension and cause
[miscalc]{.underline}ulation. Providing aid in this environment is not a
mere technical military matter, but ultimately a political and
diplomatic concern that is highly sensitive. Yet today, it is the DOD
that is driving assistance to countries such as Ukraine and regions such
as Southeast Asia.13 When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the National
Security Council became significantly involved in policymaking and
limited types of assistance that could be provided, including lethal
aid.14 Such unique scrutiny was warranted because there was a crisis
involving a U.S. partner and a nuclear-armed state. But the nature of
White House intervention was necessary in large part because the
security assistance process---for both decision-making and for providing
assistance---was broken.

[A military-led response can overprioritize military engagement
and]{.underline} could unintentionally [steer]{.underline} American
[engagements into **high-risk** confrontations]{.underline}. [Without
**careful calibration** and understanding of **broader** political
context]{.underline}, [there is **real concern** that the DOD could get
ahead of U.S. policy or drive it in a more **military-centric**
direction]{.underline}. For example, China could interpret the DOD's
provision of some security assistance through the agency's Southeast
Asia Maritime Security Initiative as an act of aggression if it is not
carefully and effectively calibrated against broader political concerns
in the region.15 Given the political sensitivities of great power
competition, responsibility and oversight for security assistance
decisions should rest with the agency most in tune with broader U.S.
foreign policy concerns and diplomatic developments: the State
Department.

#### Counterplan avoids Russian blowback

This paper identifies the dependent and independent variables before
moving into a brief history of the State Partnership Program and its
precursor, the Norwegian Reciprocal Exchange Program. The focus will
then be on the implications of using reserve forces in military exchange
programs, looking specifically at Norway and Poland as examples of
countries involved in partnership programs. The dependent variable of
this case study is the level of perceived aggression the United States
displays through involvement in military exchange programs. This
variable can be measured in relative terms by examining the actions
taken by opposing states to try and restore the balance of power, and
thus their own security. The U.S.'s State Partnership Program, created
during the time of the Soviet Union collapse, reached out to former
Soviet countries as well as other countries that had been independent,
yet still under the Russian sphere of influence. [Several]{.underline}
independent [variables play into the level of perceived
aggression]{.underline}. First is the geographical location of the state
with whom the U.S. partnered. Soviet Russia would be less 4 concerned by
a military partnership with Norway, which is further away from Russia
and is more economically and culturally tied to Western Europe, than it
would be with a partnership with Poland, which is adjacent to the Soviet
Union and is of ideological importance to the union. Additionally, [the
**kind of military force** that is used in a military exchange can
affect the perceived level of aggression]{.underline}. [For example,
**active duty forces**]{.underline} or Special Forces **[would be seen
as extremely threatening by Russia]{.underline}**, especially in the
wake of the Cold War. [Conversely, the use of National Guard or Reserve
forces **would be less threatening**, since these are part-time military
members]{.underline}.

A final distinction is between cooperative and noncooperative games. A
noncooperative game has each player acting on his/her own. In contrast,
cooperative game theory involves players acting in unison as a coalition
to maximize some joint gain that is subsequently divided among coalition
members. [The **[devil]{.mark} is [in the details]{.mark}**

ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even though this book is about
transnational cooperation, we rely exclusively on noncooperative game
theory for a number of reasons. First, all cooperative games can be
expressed as a noncooperative game. Second, a noncooperative game can
encompass cooperative or mutually beneficial outcomes along with
mutually deficient outcomes. Third, by eschewing cooperative games, we
do not have to impose a payoff division assumption that can always be
subject to question. Fourth, countries cherish their sovereignty and
rarely form tight, enforceable ties With Other countries that allow the
collective to act as one, as required by cooperative game. For example,
[**[NATO allies]{.mark}** must [vote]{.mark} unanimously [on]{.mark}

**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As such, NATO is a loose
alliance because allies can block undesirable policy changes or

which we can avoid by staying with a noncooperative game representation.

[[Using]{.mark} the [National Guard]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [primary
tool]{.mark} to develop relationships [with]{.mark}]{.underline}
potential [[allies]{.mark} [is a **diplomatic
multiplier**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and its utility across the various
domains of diplomacy was recognized after only a few years of effort. In
a 2002 article in the Washington Quarterly, former Colorado Governor
Bill Owens touted the [S]{.underline}tate [P]{.underline}artnership
[P]{.underline}rogram as a [[proven approach]{.mark}
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[strategic]{.mark} [democracy
building]{.mark}]{.underline}**." 23 Governor Owens was one of the first
to document the [SPP's]{.underline} "[quiet achievements]{.underline}"
[in facilitating the development of **emerging democracies**
[beyond]{.mark} the [typical military-to-military
exchanges]{.mark}]{.underline}. For perhaps the first time, [under SPP
**[state governments]{.mark}** [became]{.mark} **[involved]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} [helping]{.mark} the [federal]{.mark} government in
[achievi]{.mark}ng **[diplomatic goals]{.mark}** abroad]{.underline}.

By 1995, the program had expanded its scope to include "multifaceted
engagement activities...in the social, economic and military spheres."
24 In cooperation with state and municipal agencies, the program
provided assistance and training in "emergency management, disaster
relief operations, civil and criminal justice, judicial processes, and
law enforcement." 25 As a result of these engagements over time, more
informal relationships developed. "Through SPP, many countries have
established successful governmental, educational, and medical
relationships with counterpart agencies from the partner states." 26

This is the greatest advantage of the State Partnership Program. Because
of the [**[dual-status]{.mark} [nature]{.mark}** of the National Guard
as both a **federal** and a **state** agency]{.underline}, ~~manned~~
\[[staffed]{.underline}\] [by **citizen-soldiers**]{.underline}, it is
[only natural for relationships to develop beyond the **military
aspect** of the partnership]{.underline}. The citizen-soldiers of the
National Guard are natural ambassadors for the American people, who also
happen to have military skills. And while their military skills are the
primary tools for engagement, their civilian skills and experiences also
add intangible factors that enhance these interactions with their
counterparts.

[[National Guard]{.underline}]{.mark} soldiers are [more closely tied to
their]{.underline} families and their [communities]{.underline} than the
typical active component soldiers living on large bases. They also have
a certain local perspective that they bring to the table and, all
politics being local, citizen-soldiers understand issues that are
important to the common man, his family and his community. It is [from
this perspective that **[sincere]{.mark}** and [**lasting
relationships**]{.mark} are [developed]{.mark} with their
counterparts]{.underline}.

Governor Owens was not the only state executive to understand the value
of the [[S]{.mark}tate [P]{.mark}artnership
[P]{.mark}rogram]{.underline}. Former Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor
Barbara Lawton not only understood the program's inherent value, she
also saw [vast untapped [potential for]{.mark} [further]{.mark}
**public** and **[citizen diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2010 she
chaired a roundtable discussion calling for more citizen-diplomacy,
using [SPP]{.underline} as a model for what she described as a "State
Partnership Framework" to [[facilitate increased]{.mark}
[contact]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [state]{.mark} and local
[level]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the report of the discussion, the SPP
was recognized by Lieutenant Governor Lawton as one of two existing,
trusted state institutions (the other being state universities), that
"are ideally positioned to develop a strategic hybrid of public and
citizen diplomacy in fifty states." 27

The conference's focus on the potential [role of the
citizen]{.underline} and the individual states [in shaping **U.S.
foreign relations** goes **straight to the heart** of the potential of
SPP]{.underline}. While public diplomacy is government-centric,
[[citizen diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, through face to face personal
encounters, [[carries]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[greater

While the forum was centered on citizen diplomacy and the role of the
state, it was clear the State Partnership Program was recognized as
having already transcended the gap between government and citizen
diplomacy.

The [ability to establish **enduring relationships** is a unique
attribute of the National Guard]{.underline}. "The [[SPP]{.mark} model
has [proven successful in building]{.mark} and sustaining enduring and
**[trusting strategic partnerships]{.mark}**]{.underline} in

Defense and State, as well as academia. Among the notable attendees was
Reta Jo Lewis, [**State Department** Special Representative for
Intergovernmental Affairs]{.underline}, who also [**touted** the
**program's role** in **diplomacy**]{.underline}. Although the federal
government, not the states, has the responsibility for conducting

local [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} can help the Department of State to
"[[establish]{.mark} **[durable foreign

"Sometimes the [**personal [relationships]{.mark}** that are created
[through]{.mark} the [SPP]{.mark} can [have]{.mark} a

#### There's an empirical record of complete and total success

Region," <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589403.pdf)//BB>

[SPP countries demonstrated success in reforming their defense sectors
and **enabling and facilitating enduring** broad-spectrum security
relationships]{.underline}. **[The outcomes have been
dramatic]{.underline}**, [with partners supporting U.S. and
international security objectives through training received and
transformation performed through SPP]{.underline}. [SPP partners made
**significant contributions** to collective defense efforts in
NATO]{.underline} by supporting peace and stability operations in the
Balkans and uniting in a fight against violent extremism through support
to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2003. For example, Slovenia
assisted the U.S. and NATO in its efforts to stabilize and bring peace 8
to the Balkans by providing troops in support of Stabilization Force
(SFOR) in the 1990s. SPP countries' support of the war effort in Iraq
and Afghanistan clearly demonstrated the ability of partners to provide
military forces to operations. After the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003,
thirty-eight other countries joined this "coalition of the willing" to
help depose Saddam Hussein and topple his regime.21 Twenty-five of the
troopcontributing states were SPP partners, which made up 65.7% of the
troop contributing countries to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). 22 For
example, Thailand, partnered with the state of Washington, and the
Philippines, partnered with Hawaii, provided military support for
reconstruction efforts in Iraq while other SPP countries provided combat
brigades. When the country of Georgia deployed one of its brigades to
Iraq in 2007, several Soldiers from the Georgia Army National Guard
deployed along with them and served with them throughout their
deployment.23 This Georgian brigade's capability to deploy and fight
stemmed from a concerted SPP effort to develop their sustainment
capabilities during the year prior. After returning from a deployment to
Iraq in 2006, a fortuitous visit by the Brigade Commander of the 48th
Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) of the Georgia Army National Guard
on a training visit to Tbilisi, Georgia, in early 2007 led to the
development of a four month training program from April through July
2007 to improve the combat service support capabilities of the Georgian
Army. In conjunction with the Georgia Security and Stability Operations
Program (GSSOP II), the 48th IBCT deployed teams of National Guardsmen
to Georgia to train the Georgians in supply and maintenance
operations.24 In addition to the country of Georgia, Poland also
provided 9 combat units to support the war effort in Iraq. In both
instances, the brigades from these countries deployed along with
embedded Soldiers from their partnered states in the form of Bilateral
Embedded Support Teams (BEST). In these two cases, Illinois and Georgia
each deployed Soldiers alongside their partnered countries.25 In several
instances, the troop-contributing SPP countries would only provide
troops if their SPP partners from the U.S. accompanied them.26
Opportunities like this enabled the U.S. military to be reinforced with
troops from an unexpected source, and these sources were even more
heavily relied upon during the war in Afghanistan. As of 2012, fifty
separate countries contributed combat forces to the International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in support of Operation Enduring
Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan,27 and SPP countries made up a significant
percentage of the overall troop contributing nations to ISAF --
twenty-three out of the forty eight troop contributing nations.28
Collectively, SPP countries provided over 8,200 troops to ISAF.29 For
example, Poland, partnered with Illinois, provided an entire Battle
Group that served and fought as a battle space owner in Afghanistan.
Other countries participating in the SPP, such as Jordan, Macedonia, and
Mongolia, also provided troops in support of ISAF for purposes such as
force protection.30 Several other SPP countries provided troop support
to ISAF in the form of Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLTs),
which made up a large percentage of these SPP country troop
contributions. The OMLTs were responsible for embedding with and
training and mentoring the Afghan National Army (ANA).31 Latvia, the
very first SPP country, along with its partnered state, Michigan,
deployed the first BEST OMLT to Afghanistan in support of OEF in 2008.32
In all, twenty-four separate countries provided OMLTs to Afghanistan in
support of ISAF 10 efforts to develop and train the ANA, and of those
twenty four OMLT providing countries, ten are countries participating in
the SPP. The [contemporary historical examples of partnership extended
beyond the war fighting role and also included examples of supporting
**partner capacity** to build and recover, **developing professional
forces**, and **facilitating enduring relationships**]{.underline}.
These contemporary examples of SPP partnership activities and outcomes
are much more representative of civilian diplomacy and the whole of
government approach to partnering. These examples include port security,
humanitarian assistance, defense support to civil authorities (DSCA),
government and economic development, and combating transnational
criminal activities in support of the four SPP goals. "[The unique
civil-military nature of the National Guard allows the SPP to engage in
a wide range of Security Cooperation activities]{.underline}, **[such
as]{.underline}**: Disaster Preparedness, Humanitarian Assistance,
Defense Support of Civil Authorities, Chemical,
**[Biological]{.underline}**, Radiological, and Nuclear, Cyber, Reserve
Component Reform, Counterdrug, Border/Port Security,
**[and]{.underline}** **[Public/Private Partnerships]{.underline}**."33
Serbia provides an example. In 1999, the United States and NATO
conducted offensive air operations against Serbian forces as a part of
Operation Allied Force in order to deter Serbian aggression in Kosovo.34
Over a decade later, the relationship between Serbia and the United
States evolved into a much more peaceful one. Serbia has since entered
into an SPP agreement with the National Guard in the state of Ohio. In
2010, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from the Serbian Army graduated
from the Ohio National Guard NCO academy, and these partners'
military--to-military engagements recently included humanitarian
missions to rehabilitate several schools 11 damaged during a powerful
5.3 magnitude earthquake in November 2010.35 This partnership, which
began in 2006, is more than just a military to military partnership.
Their goals are also to further develop the cultural bonds between the
United States and Serbia through enhanced engagements between
universities and youth programs. In September 2010, Ambassador Mary
Burce Warlick, U.S. Ambassador to Serbia, praised the SPP for playing a
critical role in improving U.S. and Serbian relations.36 SPP also
facilitated private organizations and business engagements as well as
government to government engagements as it developed enduring
relationships. The SPP effectively built relationships at the local
level and linked local U.S. leaders with national leaders from other
countries, such as Senegal. After expressing a desire to develop their
country's ability to conduct crisis management and search and rescue
operations, as well as improve the professionalism of their NCO corps
and develop family support programs, Senegalese leaders entered into a
SPP agreement with the State of Vermont in 2009.37 In September 2010,
President Abdoulaye Wade, President of Senegal, visited Burlington,
Vermont, and remarked that he will take back to Senegal a better
understanding of the state's economic model as well as a better
understanding of the relationship and interaction between business,
services, and tourism and their contributions to quality of life.38 SPP
built partner capacity to deter, prevent, and prepare for threats to
trade and commerce. Thailand and its partner state, Washington,
conducted several port security exercises between 2003 and 2012. These
exercises focused on responding to hazard material and WMD incidents,
crisis management, port security, and disaster planning and included
participants from the Royal Thai Army, Navy, and Marine Department, as
12 well as the Thai National Security Council and other civilian
agencies along with members of the Washington Air and Army National
Guard and other U.S. civilian participants.39 This partnership improved
port security operations at the Port of Tacoma in Tacoma, Washington,
which handles a significant amount of cargo exported from port at Leam
Chabang in Thailand every year.40 These examples clearly demonstrate the
SPP's ability to achieve success in the goal of building partnership
capacity to deter, prevent, and prepare for natural/manmade disasters
with emphasis on civil-military and interagency cooperation while also
building partnership capacity to respond and recover from attack and
man-made disasters. It also clearly develops the ability to support
partners' defense reform and professional development, as well as
enabling and facilitating enduring broad-spectrum security relationships
in support of the DoS and other lead agencies. While each of these
examples provides far more concrete evidence of the SPP's effectiveness,
military and civilian leadership testimony provides additional support
to the effectiveness of the program. During a speech delivered on July
17, 2012, at a National Guard Symposium on Mutual Security Cooperation,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, stressed
the imperative for major powers to develop partnerships that work within
a "competitive fiscal and security environment" in order to confront the
decentralized threats of the 21st century. He went on to praise the SPP
for its ability to provide continuity in relationships among the leaders
of the partnered states and countries. He also remarked, "[the State
Partnership Program has reaped benefits far]{.underline} 13 [beyond what
was initially conceived" and added that it was "a modest investment for
a **pretty substantial return**]{.underline}."41 During recent testimony
regarding their GCC Defense Posture Statements before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, [several GCC Commanders]{.underline} testified
regarding the effectiveness of the program. They [praised the value of
the SPP]{.underline} within their respective GCCs, and requested
additional SPP support. For example, in 2009, General Brantz Craddock,
Commander, USEUCOM, testified that the [SPP "continues to be one of our
**most effective** \[build partner capacity\] programs...the unique
civil-military nature of the National Guard allows it to participate
actively in a wide range of security cooperation activities and help
bridge the gap between DoD and DoS responsibilities]{.underline}..."42
His successor, Admiral James Stavradis, also testified in 2012 that [the
program is "one of European Command's most **unique**, **cost
effective**, and **essential** international engagement
tools]{.underline}...[that support key Theater Security Cooperation
objectives and preserve and develop these important strategic
partnerships]{.underline}\..."43 The Commander of USAFRICOM, General
Carter F. Hamm testified in 2012 that the SPP was an "important
component" of USAFRICOM's "efforts to strengthen defense capabilities of
African partners".44 He further added that he had asked NGB to add two
additional partnerships and consider further expansion of the program.45
U.S. civilian leadership also provide testament to the success of the
SPP. "[In a 2010 survey of Ambassadors]{.underline} to USEUCOM SPP
nations: [6 said SPP is their **most significant program**; 14 said SPP
is a **significant program** that adequately supports their
objectives]{.underline}; and 1 said SPP adequately supports their
objectives, but would like to see increased engagements."46

As the nation confronts its current economic crisis, the Department of
Defense faces budget reductions between four hundred billion and one
trillion dollars over the next ten years. Yet in spite of constrained
resources the United States must continue to meet National Security
challenges in this "era of persistent conflict". The strategy to meet
these challenges and overcome diminished capacity will rely more heavily
than ever on security cooperation, engagement and building partner
capacities. [[Gaining]{.mark} [s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation]{.underline} and aiding partner nations [[to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[capabilities]{.mark} is a way to
**[shape]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[deter conflict]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [assure]{.mark} access and
**[assistance]{.mark}** in the event of conflict]{.underline}. For

[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}artnership [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}rogram [has
[evolved]{.mark}]{.underline}, almost imperceptibly, [[as a

**building**]{.mark} **partner [capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This

Defense **[Security Cooperation Efficaciousness]{.underline}**

Currently, [the senior-most foreign military and civilian decision
makers who have previously and are currently participating in the
program view the State Partnership Program in **glowing
terms**.]{.underline} The following illustrates the level of endorsement
of the security cooperation program: \"...Multiply that by 22 all around
Europe and you can see [the bang for the buck here is really **quite
significant**]{.underline}.\[**[SPP]{.underline}**\] [is a very powerful
tool]{.underline}. **[It is unmatched]{.underline}**. [They are, bang
for the buck, one of the best things going]{.underline}. [Anything that
enhances state partnership is **money in the bank** for the regional
combatant commanders]{.underline}." - Admiral James Stavridis, Former
USEUCOM Commander Retired US Navy Admiral Stavridis' glowing praise of
SPP is not unique. There is evidence of a significant quantitative
knowledge gap between security cooperation stakeholders and government
policy evaluators. National Guard leadership and foreign partners
continually state these qualitative outcomes of SPP. Conversely, the
Government Accounting Office (GAO) and Congressional Research Service
(CRS) have concluded that SPP needs far more quantitative data
collection and analysis to properly assess program efficiency and
effectiveness. The measurable outcomes, not merely public budgeting line
item outputs, on democratic consolidation principles such as reducing
political terror in partner nations, are needed to assess SPP program
effectiveness.

#### Solves security cooperation\-\--includes defense management building AND innovation.

Capacity", <https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=815338>, HBisevac)

Within these four goals, the [SPP]{.underline} facilitates the
development of a regional and global environment congruent with the U.S.
national interests of security, prosperity, values, [and international
order]{.underline}. 21 In addition, these [goals facilitate a stable
global environment that influences U.S. partners]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} potentially [adversaries away from]{.underline}
negative and disr[uptive approaches]{.underline}.

The [first goal]{.underline}, [to deter adversaries and regional
conflict]{.underline} is supplementary to the second goal to respond and
recover from attacks and disasters. The [focus]{.underline} of the two
goals are [developing **defense management capacity**]{.underline},
[training **personnel** with the capabilities to deter]{.underline}
internal and external [adversaries]{.underline}, [and utilizing
**appropriate action** when events occur]{.underline}. [**Interagency**
and **civil military cooperation** is critical to the
**development**]{.underline}, **[sustainment]{.underline}**, [and
**execution** of the capability]{.underline}. 22 The [National
Guard]{.underline} core missions [provide]{.underline} a [unique
capability and institutional knowledge]{.underline} to meet these two
goals. At the federal, state, and local levels, the National Guard
supports the land and air component missions, the homeland defense
mission, and the support of civilian authorities and disaster relief
missions. The National Guard capacity to mentor and train at the various
levels with the partner is representative of the U.S. armed forces.
Interagency integration is standard practice at the local, state, and
federal levels within the National Guard. These two goals provide the
partner a core capacity for developing force sustainment and growth in
the last two goals

The third goal [supports the partner nation's **defense innovation** and
**professional development** with concern for the challenges faced in
the global community]{.underline} today and in the future.23 This goal
[enables the partner to **strengthen** and **sustain capacity** through
development of institutions that establish and maintain
**standards**]{.underline}. The foundation of [standards directly
supports interoperability with the U.S]{.underline}., regional partners,
nongovernment organizations (NGO) and International Government
Organizations (IGO). Every National Guard state has a Regional Training
Institute that supports collective and individual development. The
[partner is able to utilize the National Guard knowledge of military
schooling operations to develop their own institutions]{.underline}
through exchanges and training programs. At the state level, the
National Guard develops and submits annual budgets and requests to NGB
for operational maintenance, equipping the force, and sustaining bases
and armories. Through mentoring and engaging with key partner leaders,
the [SPP can assist the development of a **sustainable partner defense
management**]{.underline} that understands how ways and means achieve
the ends identified by civilian leadership.

The last goal seeks to facilitate partner involvement in regional and
international organizations. 24 [Development of]{.underline} regional
and [**international military cooperation** is within the capabilities
of the National Guard]{.underline}. Most brigade size National Guard
units reside in multiple states. Due to the nature of split-state force
structure, [the involved states develop relationships that ensure unity
of effort and support]{.underline} across state boundaries. Development
of interstate training plans, resourcing responsibilities, and command
authorities are similar to the skill sets required to operate in
regional and international coalitions. [These skills]{.underline}
coupled with GCC support can build the necessary capacity to develop
partner relationships with neighboring countries, to [ensure **unity**
of **effort**]{.underline}, **[interoperability]{.underline}**, [and
**mutual support**]{.underline}. These four goals further protect U.S.
interests and stature in the global community. [Essential to the
**relationship** and **building strong partnerships** is correctly
**identifying** the **threat** and the environments the capability
operates within to **deter threats** and **respond** to
**conflict**]{.underline}.25

the only single agency that truly has the]{.underline} "**[big

Commanders and the American taxpayers.

U.S. Airmen with the Indiana Air National Guard, and Slovak armed forces
personnel participate in joint training Feb. 22, 2022, at the 122nd

further build a robust State Partnership that Indiana and Slovakia have
held for over 25 years. The [[S]{.mark}tate [P]{.mark}artnership

commitment]{.mark} [to]{.mark} our **[NATO

**[security]{.mark}** and **stability**]{.underline}.

Along with Ukraine, the National Guard is partnered with 23 European
nations, including 14 NATO allies. Eifert said the conflict in Ukraine
has reinforced the NATO coalition, with a focus on building and
strengthening partnerships.

"I think one of the outcomes of the invasion of Ukraine is it has really
rallied the NATO alliance and our allies and partners in ways we haven't
seen in a while," he said.

Army Maj. Gen. Gregory Knight, Vermont's adjutant general, said a [[key
focus]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [SPP]{.mark} has been
**[interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, demonstrated by the Vermont
National Guard providing F-35 combat aircraft support to the NATO Air
Policing mission in Europe.

"[Working with]{.underline} our [NATO allies]{.underline} on aviation
platforms, \[[it's]{.underline}\] [an **incredibly detailed** level of
**training**]{.underline}," he said.

While the focus of the SPP has been military-to-military tactics
exchanges, Knight said the Vermont National Guard is pursuing a whole of
society approach to its partnerships with North Macedonia, Senegal, and
one of the most recent additions to the SPP, Austria, respectively.

"Recently, I hosted the Austrian minister of defense in Vermont," he
said. "We met with the governor and held a business roundtable. There
were a lot of discussions on renewable energy and things that had
nothing to do with the military. But that's really the foundational
element that will start the partnership. And there's just huge potential
for it to grow from there."

State Partnership Program engagements occur with countries worldwide,
with National Guard elements paired with partner nations in every
geographic combatant command. The Florida Guard is addressing ongoing
security threats, "like human trafficking, illegal drugs and arms trade,
and countering China's growing global influence in our own hemisphere,"
within the Caribbean, said Eifert.

This year alone, [the [National Guard]{.mark} has assisted U.S. Southern
Command in [accomplishing]{.mark} theater campaign
objectives]{.underline} by conducting 30 engagements in eight countries,
with another 12 scheduled this fiscal year. These [[exchanges]{.mark}
[include]{.mark}]{.underline} small-[unit security]{.underline},
[maritime search and rescue]{.underline}, noncommissioned officer
leadership development, [public affairs]{.underline}, small-[unit
patrolling]{.underline}, [[**logistics** and]{.mark}
**sustainment**]{.underline}, [and **[cyber
protection]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

One of the elements that sets U.S. military forces apart from potential
peer and near-peer adversaries is the development and application of the
noncommissioned officer corps --- a requirement of NATO membership and a
component of many state partnership activities, said Air Force Maj. Gen.
Daryl Bohac, adjutant general for the Nebraska National Guard.

The Nebraska Guard has worked closely with the Texas National Guard to
develop an NCO corps in shared partner Czech Republic's armed forces.
"They are a full NATO member and actively participating in the support
of Ukrainian armed forces in their counter efforts against the evasion
of threats," Bohac said.

While close ties in Europe have been reaffirmed by recent events, Eifert
said [the [**sky** is]{.mark} [the **limit**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
[S]{.mark}]{.underline}tate [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}artnership
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}rogram [[to]{.mark} expand and
[evolve]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[The ***bang for the buck*** that you get out of this program to
grow]{.underline}, it seems like a no brainer to me, especially given
the impact it has directly on our National Defense Strategy," he said.

U.S. foreign policy interests, the federal government can easily preempt
the state or local policies in question. Further, with the world\'s
increased interconnectedness, it is more likely that if a foreign
government takes offense to a locality\'s policy it can discriminate
between the policy of the locality and the policy of the federal
government. n155

The [National Guard]{.underline} State Partnership Program
([[SPP]{.underline}]{.mark}) has [continually [received **rave
reviews**]{.mark} from Combatant Commanders]{.underline}. Major General
Frederick S. Rudesheim, US Army South Commander, called the program
"almost incalculable."3 Admiral James Winnefeld, Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, called it "one of the best foreign policy
bargains our nation has."4 Perhaps the most ringing endorsement comes
from Admiral James Stavridis, Former US European Command Commander, when
he stated [the [SPP]{.mark} is]{.underline}, "[a **[very
powerful]{.mark} [tool]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It is
unmatched]{.underline}. They are, bang for the buck, one of the best
things going. Anything that enhances state partnership is money in the
bank for the regional combatant commanders." 5 In fact, [it is
[**difficult** to find]{.mark} a **[criticism]{.mark}** of the program
[from **anyone**]{.mark} [who has experienced it on the
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given such reviews, why would the US
government not expand its model to include more interactions that would
improve interoperability with partner nations?

The [[SPP]{.underline}]{.mark} model uses the power of American ideas
and perpetuates them through personal relationships. Additionally, it
can [[give]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark} [to
**improve**]{.mark} **[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} in various
regions [around the globe [advancing]{.mark}]{.underline} our
**[[logistical readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, the
effectiveness of ideas and relationships are difficult to measure and
too often, we choose not to. The Partnership Program is no exception.
The program's annual report shows measures of performance only and does
not assess its effectiveness.

This paper will explore the power of sustained relationships and idea
sharing in relation to the National Guard State Partnership Program. It
will make a case for logistical preparation of the battlefield through
the program for both infrastructure improvement and economic
development. Furthermore, it will address the ineffectiveness of the
current means of program assessment and provide recommendations for
improvement.

The Power of Ideas, Relationships, and Being Prepared

Only history will tell if the success of the US is one that will last,
but there is little doubt that the power it holds in the current
international world order is unmatched. Whether we are watched in
covetousness, fear, awe, or disdain\--we are watched. American power
likely lies in a combination of realms that include economic, political
and military components, but we should not discount the power of
American ideas. The idea that liberty could act as a cornerstone for
responsible government was one of America's first and greatest ideas.
While there is much debate on whether democracy is a right fit for all
nations, liberty in the form of self-determination is viewed as
necessary for the liberal world order. President George Bush stated in
his second inaugural address, "the survival of liberty in our land
increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best
hope for peace in our land is the expansion of freedom in all the
world."6 However, liberty is not the only American idea that resonates
around the globe. Capitalism, free trade, and civic responsibility are
all ideas that have found purchase in even the most unlikely global
forums.

Ideas are not necessarily epiphenomenal, however. Ideas, often thought
of as dependent variables, can also be independent in that the idea
itself will play a role in the way people shape their environment.7 It
is this concept that explains why decisions and changes that the United
States makes are felt around the globe. Our ideas take on a cultural
power of their own and become a useful tool in advancing the
international world order. Given the power of our ideas, the US needs to
spend conscious effort in sharing the good ones. The culture of ideas
often spreads on its own; however, adding the power of a mutually
beneficial relationship can increase the results.

The power of relational transactions is readily understood by most;
however, Americans tend to apply the concept within their own cultural
paradigms. This can be a dangerous practice, especially now that the US
unipolar moment is at an end.8 Although the idea of unipolarity was
generally accepted after the fall of the Soviet Union, perhaps the US
was never truly in a unipolar moment. The US has always relied on allies
and partners to attain its goals when acting on foreign soil.
Essentially, the US cannot accomplish power projection on land in the
current liberal world order without assistance from partners. That
assistance may take the form of merely granting access, but in most
cases provides local industry and services and, in the best cases, labor
and resources. These partnerships take time and effort to be effective
and do not come without challenges such as that of alignment of
interests and degree of commitment.9 [Strong relationships
with]{.underline} these potential [partners will naturally **reduce**
the friction of **coalition creation**]{.underline}.

[[Relationships with]{.underline}]{.mark} some level of
**[[permanence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nurtured over time,
[[have]{.mark} a **far [greater likelihood]{.mark}** [of
producing]{.mark} goal alignment and [commitment]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
can [overcome **integration**]{.mark} [and **interoperability
issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the way in which the US
government manages foreign diplomatic relationships on various levels
such as US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Foreign
Service is very similar to the active military service in that
individuals move from position to position throughout their career
within an area of expertise. Both organizations' personnel systems are
not organized in such a way to encourage long-term relationships. While
the relationship between a given country and the US may be enduring, the
relationships with individuals in the foreign diplomacy realm tend to be
fleeting. [Short-term assignments can be **detrimental** to relationship
building and keep the US from realizing a full level of **logistical
preparation**]{.underline} in these partner regions. In much the same
way as [the spread of ideas and building of [long]{.mark}-[term]{.mark}
[relationships]{.mark} helps to integrate with partners on a cognitive
level]{.underline}, [[building partner]{.mark} [capacity]{.mark} in a
physical sense [through **logistical preparation**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[infrastructure improvement]{.mark}** can [ensure
**interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Having interoperability is
important if we should find ourselves in a conflict or humanitarian
assistance role in areas without a significant US or North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) presence.

Michael Desch writes that [military effectiveness is a]{.underline}
"[**preponderance** in the **material power assets** available to the
state]{.underline}."10 This availability includes both the equipment and
supplies that a country brings to the fight and the supplies and access
they are able to acquire in the regions where they are involved. The
[ability to set the theater **prior** to a conflict is paramount to the
success of any long-term engagement]{.underline}. The Marine
Expeditionary Unit is often the first unit to arrive in a theater in a
crisis. It can sustain itself for only 15 days before it needs
resupply.11 Even when entire divisions enter a theater with full
sustainment packages, all the supplies must travel along the local lines
of communication and often rely on local labor at debarkation sights.
Longterm sustainment of forces in theater requires compatible
infrastructure and local contracts to be effective and efficient. The
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tate [[P]{.underline}]{.mark}artnership
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}rogram is [**[ideally suited]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} [creating]{.mark} the relationships needed in
countries]{.underline} throughout the world [that [increase]{.mark} our
[**preparedness** for conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} wherever it may
arise.

[Another aspect of the SPP that distinguishes it from similar
engagements by active component forces stems from the National Guard's
dual status as both a state and a federal organization]{.underline}. In
its federal status, the National Guard is a reserve component of the
Army and the Air Force and is trained, organized, and equipped to
conduct a wide spectrum of military activities. However, the National
Guard is also the organized militia of each state, and, in that
capacity, routinely operates under the control of its state governor,
typically to respond to disasters and civil disorders. [National Guard
personnel in a "Title 32 status" have also conducted counterdrug, border
security, and airport security missions]{.underline}. [The practical
expertise the National Guard has acquired in these areas may be
complemented by the skills that National Guard personnel develop in
their civilian occupations]{.underline}. For example, a National Guard
Soldier may serve as an infantryman in his Guard unit, but may be a
state trooper, paramedic, or emergency dispatcher in his civilian job.
[The expertise that National Guard units have acquired in conducting
these types of operations are **often in demand** among foreign
militaries]{.underline}, which frequently play a major role in their
nation's disaster response plans, and may play significant roles in
their nation's border security, civil disorder, or counterdrug
operations. Although active component forces have significant expertise
in these areas, as evidenced, for example, by the role active component
personnel played in responding to the earthquake in Haiti and the floods
in Pakistan in 2010, it is typically not exercised with the frequency of
National Guard forces and, in certain cases, is intentionally limited by
law.

ARLINGTON, Va. -- More than 20,000 service members from over 20
countries supporting NATO, including the [National Guard]{.underline},
[showcased]{.underline} their [integrated military capabilities during
large-scale exercises]{.underline} throughout Europe in April and May.

The world's largest peacetime military alliance [conducted activities
ranging from **cyber warfare** to **airborne operations**]{.underline}
across Baltic and Balkan regions, bordering the ongoing conflict in
Ukraine.

The [exercises]{.underline} are [designed to ensure the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [NATO]{.underline} and
partner nations "are [prepared to defend every inch of NATO
territory]{.underline} with a strong, combat-credible force to ensure we
stay stronger together in the face of any aggression," said Gen.
Christopher Cavoli, U.S. Army Europe and Africa commanding general.

Guard members traveled to Europe from Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois,
Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont and
West Virginia to support exercises Locked Shields, Swift Response and
DEFENDER-Europe 2022.

So far this year, more than 4,000 Guard members supported these and
other exercises in Europe.

"The [National Guard has been a **major contributor** to U.S. European
Command exercises]{.underline} this year," said U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen.
Jessica Meyeraan, director of USEUCOM exercises and assessments. "When
these forces train alongside allies and partners, it's mutually
beneficial. Not only [does it improve **interoperability** and
**capability** within the alliance]{.underline}, the National Guard
units receive immeasurable benefit from these training engagements."

In April, West Virginia and North Carolina National Guard members joined
exercise Locked Shields 22, one of the world's largest international
cyber defense exercises with more than 2,000 participants from 24
nations. The annual exercise was run virtually by the NATO Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, April 19-21.

[Participants formed cyber rapid reaction teams and deployed to assist a
fictional country in handling a large-scale cyber incident]{.underline}.

"I think [Locked Shields showcased the **unique capabilities** the
National Guard is able to bring to the **cyber
battlefront**]{.underline}," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ian Frist, an
exercise participant with the West Virginia Guard's 197th Regiment
(Regional Training Institute). "Living in both worlds
[gives]{.underline} me [an incredibly unique perspective on
**cybersecurity operations**]{.underline} that I felt was indispensable
during the exercise."

In addition to participating in exercises remotely from the United
States, Guard members traveled to Europe to participate in exercises
like Swift Response 22, which focused on airborne and air assault
operations. The annual U.S. Army Europe and Africa Command multinational
training exercise included forces from 17 countries from May 2-20 in
Norway, Latvia, Lithuania and North Macedonia.

In North Macedonia, Vermont National Guard members built on their
partnership with their NATO counterparts.

The two militaries are uniquely familiar with each other, having trained
together since 1993 as part of the Department of Defense National Guard
Bureau State Partnership Program. The program pairs each state's
National Guard with the armed forces of partner countries in a
cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship. The SPP has 87
partnerships with 95 countries -- 45% of the world's nations. Twenty-two
of those partnerships are in Europe, 13 with NATO members.

"Now that North Macedonia is a part of NATO, it opens the door for them
to participate in more training exercises with the U.S. and its NATO
partners," said U.S. Army Col. Justin Davis, Vermont National Guard
director of plans and operations. "As our state partner, it only
increases our relationship-building between the Vermont National Guard
and North Macedonia."

Before participating in Swift Response, the [Vermont National Guard had
already conducted more than 350 military-to-military engagements with
North Macedonia]{.underline}. Most of the 120 Vermont Army National
Guard members who traveled to North Macedonia were members of Company A,
3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry (Mountain), 86th Infantry Brigade Combat
Team (Mountain). Many of these Soldiers were recently deployed in desert
terrain to support U.S. Central Command.

"For most of our Soldiers it will be the first time they have trained in
Europe," said U.S. Army Capt. Aaron Harkness, assistant plans officer
with the battalion. "The environment, terrain, and training mission are
different from what we have been focusing on over the last two years. It
will be great for us to get back to training in a mountainous
environment where we can utilize the terrain to our advantage."

In addition to training on the ground, another [120 National Guard
members from Maryland Air National Guard's]{.underline} 175th Wing
[supported the exercise from the sky with 10 A-10 Thunderbolt II
aircraft]{.underline}.

"While operating in North Macedonia posed unique challenges, they were
quickly overcome by world-class host nation support, and the solely
unique capabilities of the A-10 were brought to the fight with 100%
success," said U.S. Air Force Maj. Chris Hoffman, a pilot with the wing
and the project officer for the North Macedonian portion of the
exercise. "The team-building across multiple military branches and NATO
partners was unparalleled."

Simultaneously to the 9,000 multinational personnel conducting Swift
Response, more than 8,000 more were taking part in DEFENDER-Europe 22,
which continues through the end of June. More than 1,300 Guard members
made up roughly one-third of the U.S.-based personnel who traveled to
Europe to participate in the exercise.

DEFENDER-Europe 22 spans nine countries: Denmark, Germany, Greece,
Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Estonia. The annual
U.S. Army-led multinational joint exercise builds readiness and
interoperability between 11 U.S., NATO and partner militaries.

"When we started the exercise, I asked you all to become a strong team
because that's what this alliance is all about," said Slovakian Lt. Gen.
Pavel Macko, the deputy chief of the general staff of the armed forces
of the Slovak Republic. "I've seen a strong team, many different
uniforms, heard different accents, but I can tell you we speak the same
language of values, we speak the same the language of tactics."

These annual large-scale exercises are not new or unfamiliar to the
National Guard, U.S. military, or their NATO allies. Exercises in Europe
are planned and conducted year-round to maintain the readiness of
strategic partnerships while sustaining normal operations in the rest of
Europe.

The Guard will continue to be a significant presence in the ranks of the
64,000 U.S. military personnel supporting U.S. European Command
exercises.

"The [propensity to utilize National Guard units during]{.underline}
U.S. European Command exercises and [operations is a testament to the
**unique capability** and expertise these service members bring to the
theater]{.underline}," said Meyeraan. "As we continue to train alongside
our allies and partners, the National Guard will continue to have a
significant role in those activities."

**foreign policy**]{.underline}. Under the U.S. federal system, [states
have a significant policy role]{.underline}, but one largely limited to
domestic and economic matters. [Foreign]{.underline} and [defense
policy]{.underline} are [assumed to remain the responsibility of the
federal government]{.underline}. Yet, [states are getting more and more
involved in these matters]{.underline}, and their impact is growing.
Aside from the now routine gubernatorial international trade mission,
state governments have adopted outspoken positions on issues such as the
conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, human rights abuses in
Nigeria and Burma, use of Holocaust-era bank accounts, and war with
Iraq. [State national guards have come to play an essential role in
recent overseas military campaigns]{.underline} and homeland security
operations. This growth of international activity by states remains
underappreciated due to existing approaches to foreign policy analysis.

This article argues that states can and do play an important role in
contemporary U.S. foreign policy. From both a federalism and
decision-making perspective, states have a limited international role
and minimal influence in shaping the policies of the U.S. federal
government toward other nations. As a result, state involvement in
international affairs is most often seen as economic activity. An
implementation perspective, however, reveals a growing role for states
in carrying out U.S. foreign policy, including the \"high politics" of
national security issues. This article will discuss the value of
studying foreign policy implementation and the [**growing role** of
states through]{.underline} an investigation of [the]{.underline} State
Partnership Program (**[SPP]{.underline}**). The [SPP links **State

"[enhance combatant commander's ability to establish **enduring**

capacity**]{.underline} across all levels of society." 17 Essentially,
the program pairs the militaries of partner nations with the National
Guard of a particular U.S. state. The original intent of the program was
to develop relationships and to assist in reforming the defense
establishments of the former Soviet states, primarily through
military-to-military engagements which also provide valuable training
for the National Guard.18

The first partnerships were established in 1993, pairing New York with
Estonia, Michigan with Latvia, and Pennsylvania with Lithuania. Today
the program involves 63 partnerships with 70 countries throughout all
six Geographical Combatant Commands, with more countries requesting
participation. Virtually all of the fifty-four U.S. states and
territories are involved in the program, with some states having more
than one partner nation.

The [program directly **supports Security Cooperation** activities
designed to develop relationships that promote]{.underline} specific
[U.S. **security interests**]{.underline}; [develop

assistance at a critical time as a result of the State Partnership
Program. Some partner nations provided troops for direct employment, and
in a number of instances they deployed alongside their National Guard
counterparts. Others filled peacekeeping missions to relieve coalition
partners for duty in Afghanistan and Iraq, or provided critical basing
and logistical support, as well as intelligence sharing. In terms of the
Global War on terror, clearly, the [S]{.underline}tate
[P]{.underline}artnership [P]{.underline}rograms [meets the **military
objectives** of **security cooperation**]{.underline}.

Yet while the original focus was on military-to-military training
exchanges, over the years the program has taken on more of a "whole of
government" approach based on the needs and desires of the host nations.
Some of the other activities are military-to civilian events, termed
"inter-agency activities", primarily involving training in military
support to civil authorities, including training in law enforcement and
response to manmade and natural disasters, "but can include other areas
of cooperation and capacity building." 20

While the [SPP]{.underline} is a DoD program, it is [managed in concert
with the State Department]{.underline} and [all activities abroad are
conducted with]{.underline} the [approval]{.underline} or concurrence
[of]{.underline} the various Ambassadors or [Chief's of Mission as well
as the Geographic Combatant Commands]{.underline}. In this way,
[activities are coordinated so that unity of effort is
assured]{.underline} relative [to the corresponding]{.underline} Theater
and Country Campaign Plans and the [Mission Strategic Plans of the State
Department]{.underline}. Through this coordinated effort, the SPP
supports the goals of the various departments and agencies' nested
strategies in support of National Security Objectives.

Additionally, there are also some concurrent non-military engagements
involving civilian-to-civilian activities. Typically these involve
"education, medical, legal, business and professional exchanges." These
events are often facilitated, or arranged, through the SPP but funded
through other means such as "the state, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) or private resources, or by another federal agency." However,
these activities are coordinated through and endorsed by the U.S.
Ambassador (to the host nation) and briefed to the Geographic Combatant
Commander (GCC).21 According to the National Guard Bureau, "the typical
SPP event is a week-long subject matter expert exchange, with three to
five National Guard subject matter experts participating, with an
average cost of approximately \$20,000." 22

The [S]{.underline}tate [P]{.underline}artnership [P]{.underline}rogram
has **[morphed itself]{.underline}** over nearly two decades [from a
tool for developing military professionalism and capacity to **something
more**]{.underline} attuned to the President's vision outlined in the
2010 National Security Strategy. Through natural progression, and the
needs of the partner states, [the program today]{.underline} also
[functions as a bridge between the diplomatic efforts of federal and
state governments]{.underline} and quasigovernment and non-governmental
agencies. In short, the [SPP has been facilitating a]{.underline}
"**[whole of society]{.underline}**" [approach to
engagement]{.underline} as envisioned by the President and others for
many years. It could be said that the [SPP has]{.underline}, perhaps
inadvertently, [identified a gap in]{.underline} our **[previous
diplomatic efforts]{.underline}**. And while SPP may not have the
capacity to bridge that gap entirely, it is certainly a model for
further expansion of citizen-diplomacy.

[The SPP's success centers on the National Guard's ability to provide
trained and professional Soldiers]{.underline} and Airmen who bring
civilian and disaster/ emergency response skillsets to their engagement
with partner nations. These capabilities, along with the authority to
engage with security and disaster/emergency response organizations in
addition to the partner nation's military, provide a uniquely useful
security cooperation tool for the geographic combatant commanders. [As
the SPP grows, it has become increasingly integrated in combatant
commanders' theater security cooperation strategies, as well as U.S.
ambassadors' integrated country plans]{.underline}.
[Multiple]{.underline} [current and former combatant commanders and U.S.

Many [**S**tate **P**artnership **P**rogram]{.underline} stakeholders,
including State Partnership Program Coordinators, Bilateral Affairs

program, but the program [lacks a **comprehensive oversight framework**
that includes clear program **goals**]{.underline},
**[objectives]{.underline}**, [and metrics to measure
**progress**]{.underline} against those goals, which limits the
Department of Defense's (DOD) and Congress' ability to assess whether
the program is an effective and efficient use of resources. The benefits
described by all stakeholders focused on the program's contributions to
meeting their specific missions, such as building security
relationships, providing experience to guardsmen, and supporting
combatant commands' missions. [Goals]{.underline},
[objectives]{.underline}, [and metrics]{.underline} to measure progress
[are necessary for management oversight]{.underline}, [and National
Guard Bureau]{.underline} officials told GAO that they [recognize the
need to **update** the program]{.underline}'s goals and develop metrics
and have initiated efforts in these areas. Officials expect completion
of these efforts in summer 2012. Until program goals and metrics are
implemented, [DOD cannot **fully assess** or **adequately oversee** the
program]{.underline}.

[S]{.underline}tate [P]{.underline}artnership [P]{.underline}rogram
[**activity data** are **incomplete** as well as inconsistent and
**funding data** are **incomplete**]{.underline} for fiscal years 2007
through 2011; therefore GAO cannot provide complete information on the
types and frequency of activities or total funding amounts for those
years. GAO found that the multiple [data systems]{.underline} used to
track program activities [and funding are **not
interoperable**]{.underline} and users apply varying methods and
definitions to guide data inputs. The [terminology used to identify
activity types is **inconsistent** across the combatant commands and the
National Guard Bureau]{.underline}. Further, funding data from the
National Guard Bureau and the combatant commands were incomplete, and
while the National Guard Bureau provided its total spending on the
program since 2007, it could not provide information on the cost of
individual activities. Although the National Guard Bureau has initiated
efforts to improve the accuracy of its own State Partnership Program
data, without common agreement with the combatant commands on what types
of data need to be tracked and how to define activities, the data cannot
be easily reconciled across databases.

The [most **prominent challenge**]{.underline} cited by State
Partnership Program stakeholders [involved how to fund activities that
include U.S. and **foreign partner**]{.underline} **[civilian
participants]{.underline}**. Activities involving civilians, for
example, have included subjectmatter expert exchanges on military
support to civil authorities and maritime border security. Although DOD
guidance does not prohibit civilian involvement in activities, many
[stakeholders have the **impression** that the U.S. military is **not
permitted** to engage civilians]{.underline} in State Partnership
Program activities and some [states]{.underline} may have [chosen not to
conduct any events with civilians due to the perception that it may
**violate DOD guidance**]{.underline}. DOD and the National Guard Bureau
are working on developing additional guidance and training in this area.
Until these efforts are completed, [**confusion** may **continue to

Some [critics]{.underline} come from Congress, who [**raised concerns**
over SPP's effectiveness]{.underline}, [conformity to federal
law]{.underline}, [nesting with TSCPs, and **encroachment** upon or
conflicts with DoS and USAID interests, responsibilities, and
programs]{.underline}.48 In a 2011 Congressional Research Service (CRS)
report, congressional researchers noted that **[the program
suffers]{.underline}** [from written assessments "limited in scope" and
focused on "outputs... rather than outcomes"]{.underline}49 The report
also noted that "the SPP has no dedicated statute authority"50 of its
own and uses several different statues within United States Code
(U.S.C.) to authorize SPP activities. These statues range from Title 10
U.S.C. (Armed Forces), to Title 32 U.S.C. (National Guard), to Title 22
U.S.C. (Foreign Relations and Intercourse).51 The 2011 CRS report
provided several options for Congress to consider: (1) consider a
Directive Type Memorandum regarding SPP funding, (2) direct periodic
evaluations, (3) require centralized approval of SPP activities, and (4)
codify the SPP in law. 52 Still, the report acknowledged SPP's ability
to build enduring relationships; capitalize upon unique civilian skill
sets of National Guard Soldiers and Airmen and the dual state and
federal status of the National Guard; remain engaged with high and low
priority nations; and develop unique relationships between states and
foreign countries.53 Despite the issues outlined in the CRS's report, a
15 subsequent U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report characterized
the SPP as "a force enabler for the combatant commands". 54 [In May
2012, the GAO conducted an investigation into SPP and **found several
problems**]{.underline}. [They identified]{.underline} a lack of
comprehensive oversight that clearly defined and outlined the program's
goals, objectives, and measures of performance. There was insufficient
data available for an assessment, to include management of funding from
2007-2011, multiple data management systems, inconsistent program
terminology between the GCCs and National Guard Bureau (NGB), and
[challenges with funding civilian participation in the
program]{.underline}.55 The GAO, therefore, found that neither Congress
nor the DoD can quantitatively assess the effectiveness and efficiency
of the program.56 Thus, the GAO made the following recommendations to
the DoD in May 2012: develop an oversight process to measure program
effectiveness and standardize data management; develop specific guidance
for funding civilian participation in the program; and develop
additional training for SPP Coordinators and Bi-Lateral Affairs
Officers.57 In an effort to address the Congressional concerns, NGB
began implementing a more formal process for assessing the program's
goals, and tracking program funding in accordance with the
recommendations in the GAO's report. NGB has also initiated a more
comprehensive and formal training process for Bi-Lateral Affairs
Officers and SPP Coordinators, 58 but the ability to quantitatively
assess the program has yet to be Reached.

Historically, the SPP has faced issues stemming from the way in which
the program is funded and how funding interacts with program management
and manning. This section will detail the intricacies of SPP funding and
how it creates challenges in meeting national security cooperation
objectives. The [[SPP]{.mark} is managed by the NGB]{.underline}, and
[the]{.underline} stable-[state program management personnel are sourced
from the NG]{.underline}. However, [[engagements]{.mark} with Partner
Nations are [funded through]{.mark}]{.underline} COCOM
[[O]{.mark}perations [and]{.mark} [M]{.mark}aintenance]{.underline} (OM)
[funds]{.underline}. Significantly, the NG personnel must be on active
duty (Title 10) orders when they participate in engagements overseas.
Thus, a problem in funding is created when moving personnel from Title
32 to Title 10 status, as the care and feeding of these personnel is not
captured within OM funds, nor is it accounted for in authorizations
under traditional NGB funding streams. Furthermore, engagements are
designed to meet specific objectives, which are associated with
different authorities. Therefore, any "activity that relies on multiple
security cooperation authorities must comply with all legal and policy
requirements for each authority relied on, and use the appropriate
funding for each authority."55 The intricacies of complex engagements
spanning multiple objectives complicate planning and manning the
activities appropriately in order to utilize the best personnel
available to optimize each engagement.

Much of the management of State Partnership Program
([[SPP]{.underline}]{.mark}) activities [[is handled
by]{.underline}]{.mark} SPP coordinators assigned to each state's
[[National Guard headquarters]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** by [[military officers]{.mark} assigned
full-time to the U.S. Embassy accredited to the partner
nation]{.underline} ‒ normally from the state National Guard involved in
the partnership ‒ [[whose duty description includes]{.mark} coordinating
SPP and often [other]{.mark}]{.underline} Department of Defense
(**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[security cooperation
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The combatant commands (CCMDs) manage
the latter group, providing for their pay and performance evaluations.
These officers serve in a Title 10 status, typically hold the rank of
captain through lieutenant colonel, but have different titles and tours
of duty depending on the CCMD to which they are assigned. For example,
officers serving in embassies within the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM)
area of responsibility (AOR) are known as bilateral affairs officers
(BAOs) and serve two-year tours, which can be extended. Those in the
U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) AOR are known as traditional
combatant commander's activities (TCAs) coordinators and are usually on
six-month temporary duty assignments, which can be extended. In nations
without a BAO, TCA, or similar officer, the state's SPP coordinator
travels to the partner nation to coordinate SPP activities. The National
Guard Bureau (NGB) would prefer to have a BAO, TCA, or similar officer
stationed at the U.S. Embassy for each of the 73 partnerships, and it is
currently working on a plan to fund this.

Region," US Army War College,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589403.pdf)//BB

The primary deterrent to SPP expansion within the Asia-Pacific region,
as well as within other geographic regions, is lack of adequate funding.
NGB currently receives a congressional funding allocation of
\$13,000,000 total for all 65 state partnerships.73 This essentially
equates to \$200,000 per partnership annually. Additionally, [each new
partnership costs approximately \$830,000 initially.]{.underline}74
Based upon an expectation that congressional funding will remain at the
current level for the next ten years, NGB currently forecasts expansion
of the program at the rate of two countries per year over the course of
the next ten years.75 Regrettably, this forecasted growth rate does not
immediately take full advantage of the maximum partnering capacity of
the National Guard. NGB estimates full partnering capacity of all 54
states and territories to be 85 partnerships.76 At the forecasted growth
rate of two partnerships per year, it will take a full decade for the
U.S. to maximize the full potential of the SPP. [In order to take full
advantage of the states' maximum partnering capacity]{.underline}, DoD
should immediately expand the program by 20 additional partnerships.
**[Congress would need to increase the funding for the
SPP]{.underline}** from its current allocation of \$13,000,000 to
\$26,600,000 initially in order **[to fund]{.underline}** the initial
**[partnership start-up costs]{.underline}**, followed by an increase in
annual funding of \$4,000,000 thereafter for a total yearly funding of

### 2AC\-\--INB\-\--Soft Power Defense

#### Soft-power is either resilient or everything else that Trump has done thumps.

**Brands 2018** - Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor at the
Henry A. Kissinger Center for Global Affairs at Johns Hopkins
University\'s School of Advanced International Studies (Hal, \"Not Even
Trump Can Obliterate America\'s Soft Power,\" Jan 18,
https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-18/not-even-trump-can-obliterate-america-s-soft-power)

Third, [[Trump]{.mark} has [weakened American soft power]{.mark} through
his own behavior]{.underline}. He is hardly the only president to say
loathsome things, but he is unique in displaying his unattractive
qualities so openly, so unembarrassedly, so repeatedly. [[The
president's use of racist and xenophobic appeals]{.underline}]{.mark},
his disdain for democratic norms, his generally crass style of rhetoric
and action --- [all these characteristics [have been dragging down
global respect for America]{.mark} since the moment he took
office]{.underline}. The outraged global reaction to the "shithole
countries" incident was sadly familiar --- it mimicked the criticism the
president earned through his refusal to condemn white supremacists after
the violence last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as
several other episodes. There is no ambiguity about the effect this is
having. As early as June 2017, America's global favorability in the Pew
poll of global attitudes and trends had dropped from 64 percent at the
end of Barack Obama's presidency to 49 percent under Trump. Large
majorities of global respondents described the American president as
"intolerant," "arrogant" and "dangerous." Even Xi Jinping and Vladimir
Putin --- ambitious dictators of revisionist countries --- had higher
personal favorability ratings than Trump. As Trump's own defense
secretary, James Mattis, has remarked, the U.S. needs to "get the power
of inspiration back." That's not going to happen as long as Trump is
president. [The real question is how long it will take American soft
power to recover once he departs]{.underline}. The good news is that
U[.[S. soft power has traditionally been quite resilient --- it has
survived globally unpopular presidents before]{.underline}]{.mark}[. The
reason for this,]{.underline} as the Harvard scholar Joseph Nye points
out, [is that over the long term U.S. soft power derives less from the
image of any individual than from the broader attractiveness of
America's society, culture and political values]{.underline}. The bad
news, however, is that [[Trump can]{.mark} nonetheless [do damage that
will not be so easy to repair]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Nicholas Burns
and Ryan Crocker, two of America's most distinguished diplomats, have
noted, the brain drain affecting the State Department today will have a
lasting effect on America's ability to exert non-military power
effectively, because the department is losing so many individuals with
experience that takes years or even decades to develop. (The fact that
applications for entry-level spots in the Foreign Service are also down
will make replacing that expertise all the harder.) More problematic
still, even if Trump does not succeed in making the U.S. a less
tolerant, less democratic, less attractive society, he may affect global
views of America even after he leaves office. Once Trump is gone, most
governments and populations around the world will probably breathe a
sigh of relief. But they won't forget that Americans elected such an
individual as its president, and they will surely wonder what that says
about the judgment and the character of the nation that has long claimed
to be the "last, best hope of mankind." [Most of the countries the U.S.
has traditionally worked with will be eager for their relationships with
the superpower to get back to normal. Yet they will have seen what the
U.S. electoral system is capable of producing, and so [it will be a long
time before the world]{.mark} ever [looks at America]{.mark} quite [the
same way again]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Soft power is [irrelevant]{.underline} to leadership.

**Fedirka 2017** - Senior Analyst @ Geopolitical Futures (Allison,
\"Hard Power is Still King,\" Jul 20,
https://geopoliticalfutures.com/hard-power-still-king/)

Soft Power Doesn't Make Great Powers Nevertheless[, many remain fixated
on soft power. Just this week, [a]{.mark}]{.underline} U.K.-based
consultancy [[firm]{.underline}]{.mark} called Portland, in cooperation
with the USC Center on Public Diplomacy, [[published a report ranking
the]{.mark} world's [top 30 countries by soft power]{.mark}. [The
ranking is based on the composite score of soft power]{.mark}
[elements]{.mark}: culture, digital footprint, government, engagement,
education and business/enterprise.]{.underline} The first thing that
stands out is that [[European countries dominate the list,]{.mark} and
these countries outrank others that are geopolitical
heavyweights]{.underline}. [Ireland outranks Russia, and Greece is above
China]{.underline}. In fact, Russia, China and Turkey are all in the
bottom six of this top-30 ranking. That two small European countries are
considered more powerful than three much larger countries -- countries
that are major geopolitical centers of gravity -- should automatically
raise questions about the credibility of soft power. A second
observation is that [most of the countries at the top of the soft power
ranking -- France, the U.K., [the U.S]{.mark}. and Germany -- [are also
among the world leaders in hard pow]{.mark}]{.underline}[er]{.mark}[.
[The U.S. has]{.mark} regularly [demonstrated]{.mark} that through hard
power measures such as sanctions or military activity[, it can coerce
other countries to change their behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Germany
is the economic powerhouse of the European Union and has threatened
economic measures against smaller EU countries, especially Greece, to
coerce them into supporting EU regulations. France's cultural influence
-- a component of soft power -- does have global reach, but the
foundation for this cultural influence was colonization, a product of
hard power. [[Soft power]{.mark} reads well on paper, but its
[dependence on persuasion makes it]{.mark} largely
[inconsequential]{.mark} in the world of geopolitics, whereas hard power
dictates reality and the course of events]{.underline}.

Turmoil, disengagement But today, as noted by Mattis, [the [turmoil
associated with domestic political discord]{.mark}, as well as a
disengagement with the international community on key issues, [puts U.S.
soft power severely at ris]{.mark}]{.underline}[k]{.mark}. Domestically,
[[the]{.mark} president's [DACA debacle, as well as his failure
to]{.mark} unequivocally [denounce]{.mark} the violence instigated and
perpetrated by [neo-Nazis]{.mark}]{.underline} and white supremacists in
Charlottesville[, [have left much of the world
reeling]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In the instance of
Charlottesville, where President Donald Trump resorted to proclaiming
that there was "blame on both sides," it took a foreign leader, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel, to rightfully condemn the events as
"horrifying," "racist," and "evil." Though Global Trumpism (to use Mark
Blyth's aptly entitled phrase) seems to be sweeping the Western world,
basic liberal democratic values remain a fundamental linchpin of global
order. [[Trump's antics,]{.mark} glaringly hypocritical to professed
American values[, repel foreign actors and damage our image
abroad]{.mark}]{.underline} --- ultimately undermining our soft power.
Additionally, [[blunders over]{.mark} the support of [NATO]{.mark},
withdrawal from the [Paris]{.mark} Climate Accord, [and]{.mark}
bellicose [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} of meeting the North Korean
challenge with "fire and fury like the world has never seen" further
[[weaken our international standing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Paris has
been, more than anything, an acknowledgment of the grave threat climate
change poses to human society. Though the accord doesn't contain binding
agreements upon signatory states, the concerted will of the
international community to hold strong to Paris leaves the United States
isolated from international political consensus on perhaps the most
sensitive issue of our time. Taking a serious toll Recent polling data
from the Pew Research Center suggests these occurrences are having a
serious toll on our power of attraction. Whereas only 25 to 30 percent
of Europeans polled during Barack Obama\'s administration felt the U.S.
was "on the decline," recent surveys taken during the Trump
administration show this number has spiked to 52 percent. [Fewer
countries than ever before view the United States as the world's leading
economic power]{.underline} (many replacing it with China). Nearly [75
percent of the world has given Trump a vote of no confidence in his
ability "to do the right thing regarding world affairs."]{.underline}
This is in stark contradistinction to Obama's time in office, where at
any given moment the world population believed he would "do the right
thing regarding world affairs" over 75 percent of the time. These trends
and numbers, however, only confirm what many of us had already feared
--- President Trump's unwillingness or inability to protect and advance
fundamental U.S. interests due to the political necessity of maintaining
his base at home. And although Mattis and Nye are both optimistic of the
United States\' ability to retain or recover many of her soft power
resources in the future, such assurances in an age of pressing political
challenges and revisionist international powers are surely no guarantee.
Rather, it is much more likely this cascade begun by the Trump
administration, indicative of the deeper and systemic pathologies of
American political institutions, will persist far beyond a single
presidency. As the ancient Greek historian, Thucydides, once warned, the
delusional self-aggrandizement and egoism of a declining power
accelerates its demise. Cleon-like, [[Trump is]{.underline}]{.mark}
accelerating ours, [[ushering in the]{.mark} tragic and untimely
[decline of American soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Soft power fails. 

Jim **Lacey 13** --- Jim Lacey, Professor of Strategic Studies at the
Marine Corps War College, holds a Ph.D. in Military History from Leeds
University, 2013 ("Soft Power, Smart Power," National Review Online,

Accessed 05-27-2013)

During World War II, Stalin's advisers encouraged him to seek the favor
of the pope. He famously replied: "How many divisions does the pope
have?" Decades later, the Soviets came to realize that papal power was
not something to cavalierly disregard. Many, in fact, claim that Pope
John Paul II's moral authority was decisive in breaking the Soviet hold
on Poland and propelling the Evil Empire toward its final demise. It
was, therefore, a true example of the clout of "soft power." Of course,
one can maintain that view only by discounting the massive U.S. and NATO
military forces that kept Soviet hard power in check for decades. A few
years back, a number of policymakers, jumping on a popular academic
trend given its greatest voice by Joseph Nye, began espousing a theory
of soft power. In this new and shiny vision, America could wield its
greatest global influence through the power of its example. The world
would just look at how good we were, and how great it was to be an
American, and clamor to follow us. Somehow these visionaries neglected
to notice that Europe's almost total unilateral disarmament had failed
to translate into influence on the global stage. Rather, it had done the
opposite. In a remarkably short time, European opinions on any matter of
consequence ceased to matter. Worse, a large segment of the world took a
good look at the American example and was repelled. Some of these people
launched the 9/11 attack. At some point, it became clear that those
holding a world vision that included returning to eighth-century
barbarism were not finding our example attractive. Our deep-thinking
strategists realized they needed a new answer. What they came up with
was even more seductive than soft power. In the future, America would
prosper through the employment of "smart power." One wonders if our
policymakers had been willfully employing "dumb power" for the previous
two centuries. In any case, smart-power advocates claimed that a new
policy nirvana was attainable, if only we could find the right mix of
soft and hard power. Well, [[soft power]{.mark} and smart power were
[]{.mark}fascinating intellectual exercises that **[led
nowhere]{.mark}**. [**Iran** is still building nuclear weapons,
**No**]{.mark}**rth [Ko]{.mark}rea** is [threatening]{.mark} to nuke
[U.S. cities, and **China**]{.mark} is [becoming]{.mark} militarily
[more aggressive]{.mark}. It turns out that power is what it has always
been --- the ability to influence and control others --- and deploying
it requires, as it always has, **hard instruments**. [Without superior
military power and]{.mark} the [economic strength]{.mark} that underpins
it, [the U.S. would have no]{.mark} more [ability to influence global
events]{.mark} than **Costa Rica**]{.underline}. When President Obama
made the strategic decision to pivot toward Asia, he did not follow up
by sending dance troupes to China, or opening more cultural centers
across the Pacific's great expanse. Rather, he ordered the U.S. military
to begin shifting assets into the region, so as to show the seriousness
of our intent. If North Korea is dissuaded from the ultimate act of
stupidity, it will have a lot more to do with our maintenance of ready
military forces in the region than with any desire the North Korean
regime has for a continuing flow of Hollywood movies. [By now [**every
serious strategist and policymaker** understands]{.mark} that [if the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is going to
continue influencing global events it requires **hard
power**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- a military --- [second to
none]{.underline}. That is what makes a new report from the
well-respected Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
troubling. According to SIPRI, in 2012, China's real military spending
increased by nearly 8 percent, while Russia's increased by a whopping 16
percent. Worse, SIPRI expects both nations to increase spending by even
greater percentages this year. The United States, on the other hand,
decreased real spending by 6 percent last year, with much larger cuts on
the way. After a decade of war, much of our military equipment is simply
worn out and in need of immediate replacement. Moreover, technology's
rapid advance continues, threatening much of our current weapons
inventory with obsolescence. [As much as the]{.underline} utopians
([soft-power believers]{.underline}) [want to deny it, American power is
weakening even as the world becomes progressively less stable and more
dangerous]{.underline}. In a world where too many states are led by men
who still believe Mao's dictum that "Power comes from the barrel of a
gun," weakness is dangerous. Weakness is also a choice. The United
States, despite our current economic woes, can easily afford the cost of
recapitalizing and maintaining our military. We are not even close to
spending levels that would lead one to worry about "imperial
overstretch." Rather, our long-term security is being eaten up so as to
fund "entitlement overstretch." I suppose that one day, [if left
unchecked, the welfare state will absorb so much spending that the only
military we can afford will be a shadow of what has protected us for the
past seven decades. Soft power will then]{.underline} cease to be one
option among many and, instead, [become our only choice. [We will become
**as relevant** ]{.mark}**to the rest of the world [as
Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I wonder how many people realize just how
different their daily lives will become if that day arrives. [For a long
time, American hard power has cast a protective shield around the
liberal world order. It will not be pretty when that is
gone]{.underline}.

There is [[no]{.mark} scientific [basis]{.mark} to suggest that

intelligent **life**]{.underline}" (by which I assume the report authors
[[mean]{.mark} [**human** **extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}) by 2050.
However, climate breakdown does pose a grave threat to civilization as
we know it, and the potential for mass suffering on a scale perhaps
never before encountered by humankind. This should be enough reason for
action without any need for exaggeration or misrepresentation! A
"Hothouse Earth" scenario plays out that sees Earth's temperatures
doomed to rise by a further 1°C (1.8°F) even if we stopped emissions
immediately. Peter Kalmus, Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory
This word choice perhaps reveals a bias on the part of the author of the
article. A temperature can't be doomed. And while I certainly do not
encourage false optimism, [assuming]{.underline} that [humanity is

et al (2017) although the report does not include a citation of the
paper as the source of that statement. The way it is written here (and
in the report) is misleading because it gives the impression that
everyone dies in those conditions. That is not actually how Mora et al
define "deadly heat" -- they merely looked for heatwaves when somebody
died (not everybody) and then used that as the definition of a "deadly"
heatwave. North America suffers extreme weather events including
wildfires, drought, and heatwaves. Monsoons in China fail, the great
rivers of Asia virtually dry up, and rainfall in central America falls
by half. Andrew King, Research fellow, University of Melbourne:
[[Projections]{.underline}]{.mark} of extreme events such as these [are

Data Scientist, Jet Propulsion Laboratory: The deadly heat projections
(this, and the one from the previous paragraph) come from Mora et al
(2017)1. It should be clarified that "deadly heat" here means heat and
humidity beyond a two-dimension threshold where at least one person in
the region subject to that heat and humidity dies (i.e., not everyone
instantly dies). That said, in my opinion, the projections in Mora et al
are conservative and the methods of Mora et al are sound. I did not
check the claims in this report against Mora et al but I have no reason
to think they are in error. 1- Mora et al (2017) Global risk of deadly
heat, Nature Climate Change The knock-on consequences affect national
security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic
disease outbreaks, are overwhelming. Armed conflicts over resources may
become a reality, and have the potential to escalate into nuclear war.
In the worst case scenario, a scale of destruction the authors say is
beyond their capacity to model, there is a 'high likelihood of human
civilization coming to an end'. Willem Huiskamp, Postdoctoral research
fellow, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research: This is a highly
questionable conclusion. The reference provided in the report is for the
"Global Catastrophic Risks 2018" report from the "Global Challenges
Foundation" and not peer-reviewed literature. (It is worth noting that
this latter report also provides no peer-reviewed evidence to support
this claim). Furthermore, if it is apparently beyond our capability to
model these impacts, how can they assign a 'high likelihood' to this
outcome? While it is true that warming of this magnitude would be
catastrophic, making claims such as this without evidence serves only to
undermine the trust the public will have in the science. Daniel Swain,
Climate Scientist, University of California, Los Angeles: It seems that
the eye-catching [headline]{.underline}-level
[[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} in the report [[stem]{.underline}]{.mark}

The answer to my question trickled in slowly over a number of years.
[Evidence began to emerge that **[scientists]{.mark}**
**[acknowledge]{.mark}d** a large [**gap** between]{.mark} the
**actual** **[observed]{.mark}** real-world temperature
datasets]{.underline} (from satellites) [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} those
temperature [[predictions]{.mark} [from]{.mark} **computer climate
[models]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While these differences may not prove
the allegations against the Climategate scientists, they do confirm one
thing: the computer climate models exaggerate the future warming rate
due to their high sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions. As a result,
the models continue to show an excessive and unreal warming rate for
future decades. Despite plenty of evidence, the [[IPCC continues to
use]{.mark} these **[faulty]{.mark} model [predictions]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} inform the **public** and **policymakers** about future
changes in temperature. A steady stream of scientific studies has
documented the **evidence for lack of dangerous
warming**]{.underline}---IPCC's level of warming based on fifth- and
sixth-generation (CMIP5 and CMIP6) models and the apparent absence of
climate-induced ecological collapse. [In 2020 alone, [over 400]{.mark}
peer**-reviewed scientific [papers]{.mark}** [took up]{.mark} a
[**skeptical position** on **climate**
**alarmism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These papers]{.underline}---and
hundreds from previous years---[address various issues related to
climate change]{.underline}, including problems with climate change
observation, climate reconstructions, lack of anthropogenic/CO2 signal
in sea-level rise, natural mechanisms that drive climate change (solar
influence on climate, ocean circulations, cloud climate influence, ice
sheet melting in high geothermal heat flux areas), hydrological trends
that do not follow modeled expectations, the fact that corals thrive in
warm, high-CO2 environments, elevated CO2 and higher crop yields, no
increasing trends in intense hurricanes and drought frequency, the myth
of mass extinctions due to global cooling, etc. [[Academia]{.mark} is
[filled with]{.mark} scientific [literature]{.mark} [that
**contradicts**]{.mark} the [position of]{.mark} those who believe
[climate change is **unprecedented**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Also, during
the course of the last decade, it became apparent that most of Al Gore's
claims in his 2006 documentary were false. Contrary to his claims, polar
bear populations remained steady, the Arctic did not become ice free
during the summer of 2014, and storms did not get stronger due to global
warming. In simple words, Gore misled the world and promoted falsehood
as science, and he continues to do so while profiting from a renewable
industry that is sold as the cure for global warming. Yet, he himself
generates carbon dioxide emissions many times higher than an average
family's. So, [not only are the predictions of models
wrong]{.underline}, [but also the interpretations of]{.underline}
climate data and the propaganda of a [climate doomsday were also
wrong]{.underline}. Today, we know the modern [[warming]{.mark}
[rate]{.mark} is [not **unprecedented**]{.mark}. [Warming]{.mark} of
such magnitude has **[happened]{.mark} [twice]{.mark}** [within]{.mark}
the [past **2000** **years**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Further, ice at both
poles is at historic highs, even compared with the Little Ice Age of the
17th century. Besides, there has been no increase in extreme weather
events due to climate change and the loss of lives due to environmental
disasters has drastically reduced during the last 100 years. So, I am a
climate realist. I acknowledge that there has been a gradual increase in
global average temperature since the end of the Little Ice Age in the
17th century. I acknowledge that climate change can happen in both
ways---warming and cooling. I do understand that anthropogenic CO2
emissions and other greenhouse gases could have positively contributed
to the warming from mid-20th century onwards. I also acknowledge that
warming and the increased atmospheric carbon dioxide that has
contributed to it have actually helped society. The current atmospheric
carbon dioxide concentration, nearly 50 percent higher than in the 17th
century, and the warming---which has occurred chiefly in winter, in
higher latitudes and altitudes, and at night, thus raising cold
temperatures but with little effect on hot temperatures---have actually
resulted in optimal conditions for global plant growth, thus aiding in
the flourishing of the agricultural sector. The Bengal tiger populations
have bounced back, and polar bear populations are steady, thanks to
conservation efforts. Forest area in Europe is increasing every year,
and countries are planting tree saplings at a record rate. Life
expectancy has reached all-time highs in many countries, and more people
are constantly pulled out of extreme poverty every year (although
business lockdowns to fight COVID-19 threaten to reverse that trend).
Access to freshwater has improved and human productivity has increased
drastically. So, [there is [no actual **climate
emergency**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, what we have are celebrities,
activists, un-elected political bodies like the UN, and even some
climate scientists religiously promoting a popular doomsday belief. [The
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} do not know the future, and neither do the
Climategate scientists. But an [[exaggerated]{.mark} view of
**[future]{.mark}** warming provides the ideal background for
anti-carbon-based fuels policies that will undermine the **economic
well-being** of every society in the world.]{.underline} We must not
allow that.

#### Their models are [bad]{.underline} and [offend]{.underline} consensus

**Piper 19** \-- Kelsey Piper, citing John Halstead climate change
mitigation researcher at the Founders Pledge. \[Is climate change an
\"existential threat\" --- or just a catastrophic one? 6-28-2019,
https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/6/13/18660548/climate-change-human-civilization-existential-risk\]

I also talked to some researchers who study existential risks, like John
[[Halstead]{.underline}]{.mark}, who studies climate change mitigation
at the philanthropic advising group Founders Pledge, and who
[[has]{.mark} **a detailed online [analysis]{.mark}** [of
**all**]{.mark} **the (strikingly few) [climate]{.mark} change
[papers]{.mark}** [that address **ex**]{.mark}**istential
[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} (his analysis has not been peer-reviewed
yet).

Halstead looks into the models of potential temperature increases that
Breakthrough's report highlights. The models show a surprisingly
**[large [chance of extreme]{.mark} degrees of
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Halstead points out that in many
papers, this [[is]{.mark} the [result of]{.mark} **the
[simplistic]{.mark} form** of **statistical [modeling]{.mark}**
used]{.underline}. Other papers have made a convincing case that
[**[this]{.mark} form of statistical [modeling]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
**an [irresponsible]{.mark} way** to reason about climate
change]{.underline}, and that [**the dire [projections]{.mark}** [rest
on **a**]{.mark} **statistical [method]{.mark}** [that is]{.mark}
**widely [understood]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark} **a [bad]{.mark}
approach** for that question]{.underline}.

Further, "the carbon effects don't seem to pose an existential risk," he
told me. "People use 10 degrees as an illustrative example" --- of a
nightmare scenario where climate change goes much, much worse than
expected in every respect --- "and looking at it, [**even [10
degrees]{.mark}** [would not]{.mark} **really cause the
[collapse]{.mark}** of industrial [civilization]{.mark},"]{.underline}
though the effects would still be pretty horrifying. (On the question of
whether an increase of 10 degrees would be survivable, there is much
debate.)

Does it matter if climate change is an existential risk or just a really
bad one?

That last distinction Halstead draws --- of climate change as being
awful but not quite an existential threat --- is a controversial one.

That's where a difference in worldviews looms large: Existential risk
researchers are extremely concerned with the difference between the
annihilation of humanity and mass casualties that humanity can survive.
To everyone else, those two outcomes seem pretty similar.

To academics in philosophy and public policy who study the future of
humankind, an existential risk is a very specific thing: a disaster that
destroys all future human potential and ensures that no generations of
humans will ever leave Earth and explore our universe. The death of 7
billion people is, of course, an unimaginable tragedy. But researchers
who study existential risks argue that the annihilation of humanity is
actually much, much worse than that. Not only do we lose existing
people, but we lose all the people who could otherwise have had the
chance to exist.

In this worldview, [**7 billion humans dying** is **not just seven
times** as bad as 1 billion humans dying --- it's **much
worse**]{.underline}. This style of thinking seems plausible enough when
you think about past tragedies; the Black Death, which killed at least a
tenth of all humans alive at the time, was not one-tenth as bad as a
hypothetical plague that wiped us all out.

Most people don't think about existential risks much. **[Many [analyses
of climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}** --- including the report Vice
based its article on --- [[treat]{.mark} the [deaths of **a
billion**]{.mark} **people** [and]{.mark} **the [extinction]{.mark} of
humanity** as **pretty similar outcomes,
[interchangeably]{.mark}**]{.underline} using descriptions of
catastrophes that would kill hundreds of millions and catastrophes
that'd kill us all. And the existential risk conversation can come
across as tone-deaf and off-puttingly academic, as if it's no big deal
if merely hundreds of millions of people will die due to climate change.

Obviously, and this needs to be stressed, climate change is a big deal
either way. But there are differences between catastrophe and
extinction. If the models tell us that all humans are going to die, then
extreme solutions --- which might save us, or might have unprecedented,
catastrophic negative consequences --- might be worth trying. Think of
plans to release aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight and
cool the planet back down in the manner that volcanic explosions do.
It'd be an enormous endeavor with significant potential downsides (we
don't even yet know all the risks it might pose), but if the alternative
is extinction then those risks would be worth taking.

But if the models tell us that [[climate]{.mark} change [is]{.mark}
**devastating but [survivable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [[most models
show]{.underline}]{.mark}, then those last-ditch solutions should
perhaps stay in the toolkit for now.

Then there's the morale argument. Defenders of overstating the risks of
climate change point out that, well, understating them isn't working.
The IPCC may have chosen to maintain optimism about containing warming
to 2 degrees Celsius in the hopes that it'd spur people to action, but
if so, it hasn't really worked. Maybe alarmism will achieve what
optimism couldn't.

That's how Spratt sees it. "Alarmism?" he said to me. "Should we be
alarmed about where we're going? Of course we should be."

Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg has taken an arguably alarmist bent in
her advocacy for climate solutions in the EU, saying, "Our house is on
fire. I don't want your hope. \... I want you to panic." She's gotten
strong reactions from politicians, suggesting that at least sometimes a
relentless focus on the severity of the emergency can get results.

So where does this all leave us? It's worthwhile to look into the
worst-case scenarios, and even to highlight and emphasize them. But
[[it's important to]{.mark} **accurately [represent]{.mark}**
[current]{.mark} climate [consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} along the way.
It's hard to see how we solve a problem we have widespread
misapprehensions about in either direction, and when a warning is
overstated or inaccurate, it may sow more confusion than inspiration.

[Climate change **won't kill us all**]{.underline}. That matters. Yet
it's one of the biggest challenges ahead of us, and the results of our
failure to act will be devastating. That message --- the most accurate
message we've got --- will have to stand on its own.

**Spiro \'99** (Peter J. Spiro, Associate Professor at Hofstra Law
School, 1999, Lexis//GH-Aspomer)

Zschernig has been questioned even by those who otherwise propound
federal exclusivity. n87 But the decision seems both explained and
justified (at least at the time) by its Cold War context. [In the
tinderbox world of superpower competition, the potential consequences of
giving offense were obviously profound]{.underline}. [One could not
expect the Soviets]{.underline} necessarily [to understand that when a
state official spoke, **it was not for the nation**]{.underline}; or at
least [one would not want to risk error]{.underline} in assessing that
perception. At the very least, **[there was the specter of *state
action* upsetting the elaborately choreographed relationship between
East and West]{.underline}** Blocs; at worst, **[one
could plausibly draw a scenario in which offense caused by state
action lit the fuse to World War III]{.underline}**. Nor against this
backdrop could one rely on the political branches to beat back state
action before the damage was done; n88 the context, in other words,
supported the strict application of a dormant federal power. n89
\[\*1243\] Zschernig found parallels in two other contexts at the
juncture of state activity and foreign relations. In applying the
dormant foreign Commerce Clause to strike down a state tax on
foreign-owned cargo containers, the Court in Japan Line emphasized the
\"paramount\" requirement that the federal government \"speak with one
voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.\"
n90 The Court stressed the danger that a state tax on international
instrumentalities could provoke the retaliation of foreign nations,
which \"retaliation of necessity would be directed at American
transportation equipment in general, not just that of the taxing state,
so that the Nation as a whole would suffer.\" n91 As in Zschernig, the
Japan Line Court nullified the state measure notwithstanding the absence
of an affirmative federal policy (either through treaty or statute) on
the issue. California, the Court concluded, \"may not tell this Nation
or Japan how to run their foreign policies\" in \"an area where a
uniform federal rule is essential\... Even a slight overlapping of tax -
a problem that might be deemed de minimis in a domestic context -
assumes importance when sensitive matters of foreign relations and
national sovereignty are concerned.\" n92 Perhaps even more clearly than
the dormant foreign affairs power, this sort of severe application of
the dormant foreign Commerce Clause would have seemed defensible,
especially insofar as it built upon a well-settled dormant power in the
domestic commerce context. n93 Japan Line was handed down against an
international economic backdrop not far removed from the corresponding
national security context, where before theentrenchment of today\'s free
trade regimes the specter of trade wars loomed in economic relations
even between friendly states. \[\*1244\] Finally, one can also integrate
into the rule of federal exclusivity the designation of customary
international law as part of federal common law. Under the regime of
Swift v. Tyson, n94 the federal courts were free to apply general common
law, including customary international law, without regard to the common
law interpretations of state courts; there was no need specially to
justify the application of customary international law in the absence of
controlling state or federal statutory or constitutional law. n95 That
changed with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, n96 which denied the federal
courts the power to create common law \"except in matters governed by
the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress.\" n97 The presumption
thereafter was that federal common lawmaking had to be grounded in some
particular federal interest. n98 It was only with the Supreme Court\'s
1964 decision in Sabbatino that the application of customary
international law as federal common law was found acceptable under Erie.
n99 That holding can be justified on the same basis as the dormant
\[\*1245\] foreign affairs power. Inappropriate interpretation of or
noncompliance with customary international law could cause offense to
foreign nations, which might respond with action against the nation as a
whole. The Court did not clearly articulate its holding in such terms,
adverting only to unspecified \"potential dangers\" n100 were Erie
extended to legal problems affecting international relations, and noting
\"a concern for uniformity in this country\'s dealings with foreign
nations.\" n101 The decision did, however, cite commentary that
advocated federal court interpretation of customary international law,
\"lest the provincialism of state courts lead to impolitic judicial
decisions offensive to the sensibilities of foreign nations.\" n102 As
with the dormant foreign affairs power cases, the rule against state
court interpretation of customary international law would seem to have
been justified, especially in a Cold War context. To take the facts of
Sabbatino itself, the federal government couldn\'t have state courts
misapplying the act of state doctrine n103 to deny the effectiveness of
Cuban (and other Communist Bloc) nationalizations; the risk of upsetting
the superpower balance would have been too great to trust the
responsibility of applying or interpreting the relevant standards to
nonfederal actors. n104 And that perhaps explains why \[\*1246\] the
inclusion of customary international law in the category of federal
common law has, until recently, been accepted as uncontroversial. n105
And so these three different strands of the exclusivity principle - the
dormant foreign affairs power, the dormant foreign commerce power, and
the inclusion of customary international law as a part of federal common
law - all seemed sustainable in a world that would not differentiate
between the component unit and the whole. However important they would
otherwise be, federalism values could not be vindicated in the face of a
plausible and substantial risk that unconstrained state action would
result in dramatic harm to the nation as a whole. C. [The Case for
Maintaining Federal Exclusivity ]{.underline}If one assumed a world in
which nations were still held responsible for the acts of their
component units, one could support a fairly strong case for confirming
the holdings of Zschernig, Japan Line, and Sabbatino, and the precept
that the [states should be denied the tools
to **interfere** with national foreign relations]{.underline}. n106
Constitutional pedigree aside, the functional \[\*1247\] underpinnings
of the exclusivity principle are powerful. It is not just that
individual states will take action that will harm other states, though
that fact highlights the problems of state-level action from a
democratic process perspective. It is that such [decisions will be
consistently distorted in the face of significant externalities;
state-level actors, because they do not shoulder the consequences of
their actions, will not take into account those consequences in the
decision-making balance]{.underline}. [These externalities will also
tend to create **information deficiencies**; **because the states will
not shoulder the consequences of their conduct, they have less incentive
to understand what those consequences will be**.]{.underline} Indeed, a
standard lament of [state-level foreign policy]{.underline} activity is
that it [is based on insufficient expertise]{.underline}. n107 Assuming
continued externalities, the case against state-level action remains
strong. The magnitude of state and local international activity has
grown dramatically in recent years, so that one might expect a growing
risk of unwelcome resulting entanglements; though much of this activity
is benign, some provokes the traditional concerns of the exclusivity
principle. [The]{.underline} persistent [potential
for]{.underline} [subfederal action to **disrupt national foreign
relations** is demonstrated by the recent diplomatic controversy and
constitutional litigation concerning state ]{.underline}and
local [sanctions against companies doing business in Burma]{.underline}.
n108 Though they enjoy the formal power to suppress it, the political
branches of the federal government remain less well positioned to police
this activity than the courts. The changing construction of
international society aside, n109 perhaps the best argument for
softening the rule of federal exclusivity highlights the end of the Cold
War and the diminished ultimate dangers of foreign retaliation. In
recent years there has been a marked blurring of the distinction between
foreign and domestic affairs; so fast has the line eroded - hastened by
the communications revolution, the greater ease of travel, and the
growing priority of trade over traditional national security issues -
that globalization has become almost an instant cliche. The
international arena is now very much of local interest, as reflected in
the dramatically \[\*1248\] heightened profile of state and local
governments on the world scene. This is particularly pronounced in
matters relating to trade and investment. One in six private-sector jobs
in the United States is now linked to the global economy. n110 The
number of Americans working for foreign companies in the United States
now stands at five million; foreign direct investment in the United
States has quadrupled since 1981. n111 [Subfederal
jurisdictions]{.underline} now see international trade and foreign
investment as critical to their economic well-being. They [compete
ferociously for foreign investment with tax breaks and other
incentives]{.underline}. n112 [Most states now maintain at least one
trade office abroad;]{.underline} n113 many have concluded trade-related
agreements with foreign entities; n114 and the foreign trade mission has
become a standard responsibility for governors and large-city mayors.
Most of these trade and investment-related activities are
unobjectionable, from both policy and constitutional perspectives. n115
\[\*1249\] [The growing importance of the world to the states has also
made the states more important to the world. If they stood as
independent nations, seven American states would be counted among the
top twenty-five countries in terms of gross domestic
product]{.underline}; even Vermont, with the smallest economy among the
states, would outrank almost 100 nations. n116 It is thus not surprising
that foreign authorities, themselves critically interested in global
commerce, court state-level officials to attract investment from and
promote exports within the subfederal jurisdictions.
Moreover, [state]{.underline} and
local [governments]{.underline} directly [control
vast]{.underline} procurement [budgets]{.underline}; the annual
expenditures of state and local governments exceeds one trillion
dollars. n117 [Subfederal]{.underline} governments now [have
international economic clout. The problem is that this clout can
and will occasionally be deployed in ways that **offend** foreign

2\. [The Danger of Retaliation against the Entire Nation]{.underline}
Above all, however, the Framers stressed a concern at the outset that
continues to be politically relevant today: \"that the peace of the
WHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART,\" for \"\[t\]he
union will undoubtedly be answerable to foreign powers for the conduct
of its members.\"107 [[State involvement]{.mark} in the international
realm **[risks conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with nations
that]{.mark} may [retaliate]{.mark}]{.underline}---[economically,
[militarily]{.mark}, or otherwise]{.underline}---[[against the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[**as a
whole**.]{.underline}]{.mark}108 For the Framers, this was no
hypothetical danger. Their experience under the Articles of
Confederation underscored the very real threats and concrete retaliatory
conduct, including war, that state disregard of national treaty
obligations had provoked. Since 1789, the Supreme Court has consistently
echoed the same concerns. In 1832, in Brown v. Maryland,109 the Court
struck down a Maryland law that required licenses for certain imports,
emphasizing that the state law at issue could spark disputes with other
nations. \"What answer,\" Chief Justice Marshall asked, \"would the
United States give to the complaints and just reproaches to which such
an extraordi¬nary circumstance would expose them? No apology could be
received, or even offered.\"110 It is one thing, the Court has
suggested, for a state to expose itself to the risks of conflict with a
foreign power, but it is quite another to arrogate to itself the power
to expose its fellow states to those risks. Hence, in the same vein, the
Court in 1875 struck down a California law that in effect regulated
immi¬gration, and by implication, commerce with foreign nations. The
injured nation could not direct a claim for redress to California, the
Court observed, because California could: hold no exterior relations
with other nations. It \[the foreign claim\] would be made upon the
government of the United States. If that government should get into a
difficulty which would lead to war, or to suspension of intercourse,
would California alone suffer, or all the Union?111 A century later, in
1979, California imposed an ad valorem property tax on foreign-owned
cargo containers. The Court again invalidated the state law, mind¬ful
that the \"risk of retaliation by Japan \... \[was\] acute, and such
retaliation of necessity would be felt by the Nation as a whole.\"112
The Court\'s concerns in this regard are now embodied in the so-called
\"one voice\" doctrine---a putative requirement, inferred from the
Constitution\'s text and structure, that the nation speak with one voice
in the realm of foreign affairs. [The [one-voice
doctrine]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[reflects a **reasonable**]{.mark}
**national [interest]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[in bolstering the
**efficacy** of **American foreign [policy]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The

from]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [the appearance of national [unity
and]{.mark} popular [support.]{.mark} Open [conflict between the
fed]{.mark}eral [and state]{.mark} government[s]{.mark} [on
**key**]{.mark} **foreign policy [questions]{.mark}**]{.underline} can
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** [national foreign policy
[objectives.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, sometimes the foreign
policy of the federal government is less than clear. Yet [the federal
government's silence]{.underline} with respect to a particular issue of
foreign policy [does not]{.underline} neces¬sarily [imply an absence of
a federal policy. Still less does it indicate that the states should
feel free to enter the field. [Federal silence]{.mark}, inaction,
[or]{.mark} [ambiguity]{.mark} [may be calculated.]{.mark} Sometimes the
best policy is]{.underline} to do and say nothing, or deliberately to
attempt, with nuance[, to leave national policy unclear.]{.underline}113
But the question is whether the doctrine has been expanded beyond the
limit of its logic.114

[Suspicious about the military content and [**wary of antagonizing
China,** Nepal rejects a U.S]{.mark}. disaster mitigation
[program]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fearing that [the U.S. State Partnership
Program ([SPP) is a trap to]{.mark} involve Nepal in an anti-China
military alliance, the Sher Bahadur Deuba government has rejected the
program.]{.underline} The Deuba government -- like predecessor
governments in 2015, 2017 and 2019 -- was initially impressed with the
SPP for its disaster mitigation content, but it had to reject the
partnership in the end, because the mood in Nepal is unambiguously
against foreign programs that smack of a military alliance. Nepali
governments have generally not wanted any transnational agreements that
could jeopardize their delicately balanced relationship between India
and the United States on the on hand and China on the other. [Flush with
success in convincing the Deuba government to get the Millennium
Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact ratified by the Nepali parliament in
February, the U.S. moved to bolster the military dimension to Nepal-U.S.
relations by pushing ahead with a pending request from Nepal to join the
SPP.]{.underline} The SPP is a bilateral program that is outwardly
peaceful in intent. But it is perceived to have deep-set military
objectives with consequences not only for Nepal's internal security, but
also for relations with its two big neighbors, China and India[. Critics
in Nepal say **that [joining]{.mark} the [SPP would be tantamount to
signing]{.mark} onto to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy ([IPS]{.mark}**).
The impact on Sino-Nepal relations would be catastrophic if the SPP
leads to stronger Nepal-U.S. military ties.]{.underline} At the same
time, [India might not be thrilled either.]{.underline} Under the SPP,
the Indian Army's exclusive and unique relationship with the Nepali Army
would be diluted, a prospect the conservative Indian top brass cannot
reconcile with. Critics say that while disaster mitigation is fine, the
rub lies elsewhere: The SPP is administered by the National Guard
Bureau, guided by State Department foreign policy goals, and executed by
each U.S. state's senior military officer (the state adjutant general)
in support of the Department of Defense policy goals. "[Through SPP, the
National Guard conducts military-to-military engagements in support of
defense security goals but also leverages whole-of-society relationships
and capabilities to facilitate broader interagency and corollary
engagements spanning military, government, economic and social spheres,"
the U.S. National Guard website says. In other words, [the
**SPP**]{.mark} is [a multi-purpose vehicle to **advance**]{.mark}
wide-ranging **[U.S. political and strategic objectives under]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} overall [cloak of humanitarian
engagement]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Worried about Nepal coming under more
pressure from the United States, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi
called on Nepal's home minister, ostensibly to get confirmation of
Nepal's continued adherence to the "One China" policy. But sources said
that [the SPP was the envoy's main concern. Nepal's condemnation of
Russia for its aggression in Ukraine had made Beijing suspicious about
growing links between the Deuba and the Biden regimes.]{.underline}

We held in New York that Congress cannot compel the States to enact or

circumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States\' officers
directly. The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring
the States to address particular problems, nor command the States\'
officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or
enforce a federal regulatory program. It matters not whether
policymaking is involved, and no case-by-case weighing of the burdens or
benefits is necessary; such commands are fundamentally incompatible with
our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.n65 The concerns
