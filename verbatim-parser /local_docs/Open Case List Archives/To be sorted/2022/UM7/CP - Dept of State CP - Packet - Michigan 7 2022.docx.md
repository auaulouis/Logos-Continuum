# DEPARTMENT OF STATE CP

## NOTES

This counterplan should be treated as a "PIC" out of DoD
**[administration]{.underline}** and **[funding]{.underline}** of
security cooperation. Activities very similar to "security cooperation"
can be accomplished between the US and NATO under the moniker "security
assistance."

The two primary net-benefits, thus far, are:

1-DoD funding/resources tradeoff DA. The DoD tradeoff DA is very simple:
the plan requires drawing significant resources from the DoD, the
counterplan doesn't

2-Diplomatic Credibility internal net-benefit. The Diplomatic
Credibility Good net-benefit is more complicated. It argues that the
counterplan re-centers the State Department, instead of the military, as
the leader of US foreign assistance, which promotes the ability of
diplomats, as opposed to servicepeople, to achieve their desired
outcomes. That's good because diplomacy should lead the charge for
solving transnational existential threats. Like most internal
net-benefits, there are flaws: the counterplan's single action is likely
insufficient to boost credibility, the military and state department can
both lead together and the State Department might not be the ideal
department to lead challenges in, and out, of NATO.

There are a variety of other net-benefits that will come out in wave 2:

\--DoD assistance causes Russian aggression, DoS assistance doesn't

\--DoD assistance precludes effective Congressional oversight, DoS
assistance doesn't

\--DoD assistance condones human rights violations, DoS assistance
doesn't

Although I have a start on some of those positions, I chose to exclude
them in order to streamline this file as much as possible.

There are two (related) concerns that I want to note. They should be in
the back of your mind as you are prepping the file, and should be noted
when refuting the argument.

1---I am uncertain that, by September, you will want to think of this as
the "security assistance" counterplan. Although the negative competition
evidence is pretty good (Kerr is by far the best), there is also very
good evidence that describes security cooperation as a subset of
security assistance -- making the CP plan-plus, and/or link to the
disadvantages. Also, "security assistance" is often referencing security
sector assistance, which is more about building domestic resilience than
establishing war-fighting abilities (depending on the aff, that might be
a feature not a bug). There are certainly other ways to write the
counterplan text. After seeing debates in the first week of camp, the
second version of the file might look a lot different.

2---I am uncertain if it's best to think of this CP as a PIC out of the
DoD entirely, or a PIC out of DoD administration (still allowing for DoD
involvement). This might seem like a semantic distinction, but it
matters quite a bit for the way that net-benefits and solvency operate.
For example, if the counterplan entirely excludes the DoD, it will
likely be a bit less solvent on mostly military matters (like LAWS). If
the counterplan includes the DoD, but does not have them fund or
administer the cooperation, then the counterplan likely solves a bit
better but has a more limited range of net-benefits. The current version
of the file certainly allows the neg to say the military is
significantly involved in the counterplan, just that the specific
initiative would be administered, and funded, by the State Department.
DoS can sell military articles, interact with foreign militaries, and
even have service-members on staff, which is important to remember when
debating the solvency of the counterplan.

When prepping the file, I would start by doing the following:

\-\--Read it. Don't highlight it the first time, see what's there. If
you don't know what's there, or what you need to refute, you won't know
what to highlight anyway.

\-\--Read every plan, solvency advocate and "military key" card in each
of the affirmatives produced

\-\--Write a 1nc shell that's specific to each of those affirmatives,
and a 2nc block responding to each aff's "military key" claims. Make the
decision: internal net-benefit, or not?

\-\--Then, start to highlight the file \-\-- specifically highlighting
the parts of evidence that helps with each strategy.

If anyone has questions, feel free to email me at brickerb@umich.edu

#### Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its [security assistance]{.underline} with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in one or more of the following areas: artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity.

#### The counterplan [competes]{.underline}. The plan's "security cooperation" requires the Department of Defense. The counterplan's "security assistance" is administered by the Department of State.

Finally, [in the U.S. government, "security cooperation" and "security
assistance"]{.underline}---[which]{.underline} [are the chief lines of
effort in the U.S. toolkit to help partners bolster their security and
work with the **U**nited **S**tates to support common security
objectives]{.underline}---[are]{.underline} overlapping but
**[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[interchangeable]{.underline}**.
[**The distinction between "security cooperation" and "security
assistance" activities has to do with the agency administering the
program**: in simplest terms, it is **either** an activity of the
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense (security cooperation) or the
**D**epartment **o**f **S**tate (security assistance)]{.underline}.
[DOD]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the Department of State
([DOS]{.underline}) [have shared responsibility for engaging with
foreign partner militaries]{.underline} since the mid-twentieth century,
[with]{.underline} the bulk of congressional **[security assistance
funding]{.underline}** [allocated to DOS]{.underline}. [Any security
assistance administered by DOD]{.underline}---whether funded under Title
10 (Armed Services) or Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) of the U.S. Code---[is
a "**security cooperation**" activity]{.underline}.\[21\] After the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the legal framework for the
funding and administration of such activities evolved in response to
emerging threats. Congress increasingly granted funding and authorities
directly to DOD under Title 10 for security cooperation.\[22\]
Therefore, while DOS security assistance programs can include DIB
components, the majority of DIB-specific programming is currently funded
under and implemented by the Department of Defense and is thus
considered security cooperation.

[U.S. security assistance is broken and in need of an
overhaul]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, the bureaucratic
system developed to deliver billions of dollars of military aid to
partner nations has evolved and expanded not by design but as the result
of a series of ad hoc legislative and policy changes. [Though the U.S.
Department of State was initially in charge]{.underline} of security
assistance policy and accounts, [since 9/11, the]{.underline} U.S.
Department of Defense (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [has established a
separate]{.underline}, well-funded security [assistance bureaucracy at
the Pentagon. This has inhibited effective congressional oversight,
harmed coordination between diplomacy and defense, and contributed to
the growing militarization of U.S. foreign policy. It has created a
**dysfunctional**]{.underline} and bifurcated [security assistance
system]{.underline}. [Under the current security assistance system, the
returns on America's security investments are **limited**,
**inconsistent**, and **not** **strategic**. The consequences of today's
broken system include increased reliance on the military to solve
foreign policy challenges; a perpetuated status quo]{.underline} whereby
nondemocratic partners receive U.S. assistance and where human rights
abuses are ignored; [and an **ineffective and unwieldy**
bureaucracy]{.underline}. This matters because the United States depends
on capable allies and partners as a core component of its national
security strategy, but the current system is not suited to the task. [A
new administration can change this by embracing]{.underline} wholesale
[reform]{.underline} of the security assistance system. To do so,
however, a [Biden]{.underline}-Harris administration [must]{.underline}
move quickly to work with Congress and include such reforms in any
effort to [**rebuild and revive** U.S. diplomacy]{.underline}. [This
will require]{.underline} talking not only about **[security
assistance]{.underline}** **[authorities]{.underline}**, but
fundamentally about **[money and resources]{.underline}** as well. [Any
reform efforts intending to bolster the role of the State Department
must start by examining how funding is]{.underline} oriented and
[balanced between]{.underline} the [departments]{.underline}. This
necessitates close cooperation with the Hill. There must be a dramatic
realignment of U.S. security assistance. This report provides an
overview and a systemic critique of the current bureaucratic structure
of U.S. security assistance and outlines how transferring resources and
responsibilities for security assistance back to the State Department
will better advance U.S. interests and address the current geopolitical
challenges America confronts. It calls for reviving the centrality of
diplomacy by restoring the State Department's role, as originally
intended under U.S. law, as the overseer of all U.S. foreign assistance.
It also offers recommendations for expanding and training the security
assistance workforce, improving interagency coordination, elevating
human rights concerns in security assistance policy, and adapting best
practices from the DOD. Specifically, this report calls for transferring
the following programs and funding from the DOD to the State Department:
The relatively newly created Section 333 train and equip authority,
which replicates the State Department's Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
authority The DOD's security assistance authorities that focus on
long-term security force reform to the State Department, including the
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund, and the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative fund This would result in a roughly \$7 billion transfer,
significantly augmenting the State Department's budget and capacity to
guide security assistance policy. [Putting the State Department back in
charge]{.underline} of security assistance [will]{.underline} be a major
reform and will [require]{.underline} significant operational changes
within the department, as well as [a dramatic expansion of its
administrative capacity]{.underline}. This will take time to implement
and require significant reform within the agency. [The DOD has done an
admirable job]{.underline} in setting up a new institutional structure,
in implementing assistance, and in coordinating with the State
Department. [However, officials across the U.S. foreign policy world
acknowledge that the system is **not working**]{.underline}. Tommy Ross,
a former [DOD]{.underline} official in charge of overseeing the
Pentagon's security assistance, recently argued that U.S. [security
assistance is "**not** fit for purpose" and is "**out of sync** with
U.S. priorities]{.underline} when it comes to where resources are needed
most [and]{.underline} the types of [capabilities required by America's
allied and partners."]{.underline}1 Indeed, throughout much of the last
decade, [it has been DOD officials who publicly argued for increased
funding for the State Department]{.underline}.2 Ultimately, [the
current]{.underline} bifurcated security assistance [system is
suboptimal and results in the bureaucratic diminishment of the State
Department relative to the]{.underline} military considerations of the
[DOD]{.underline}. [Transferring]{.underline} resources and
[responsibility to the **State** Department would centralize
responsibility for foreign aid under diplomatic control]{.underline},
while improving interagency cooperation, as DOD would remain the primary
implementer of U.S. assistance. Some of these ideas will likely be met
with innate skepticism from a generation of security professionals whose
experience in Washington has been characterized by an ever-withering
State Department and an ever-strengthening Pentagon. This report
anticipates and rebuts likely arguments against reform, including the
capacity of the State Department to take on this responsibility, the
benefits of the Pentagon's current management, or the unnecessary
disruption that would result from significant bureaucratic change laid
out in this proposal. [Failing to reform security assistance not only
leaves the United States with a **wasteful and inefficient** status quo,
it also perpetuates the **marginalization of diplomacy** and locks in
the **military's newly found dominance** in driving U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}. [The current security assistance
system]{.underline} evolved to address the threats posed by the
post-9/11 era and [is now outdated and ill-suited for a new geopolitical
environment]{.underline} characterized by competition. [If the next
administration is to revive U.S. diplomacy and rebuild the State
Department, it must empower the agency to oversee]{.underline} and
direct [foreign assistance]{.underline}. The [Biden]{.underline}-Harris
administration [should]{.underline} seize the opportunity to work with a
new Congress to [reform the system]{.underline} from its first days in
office [and **restore an effective tool** in the U.S. foreign policy
arsenal.]{.underline} A new [security assistance]{.underline} system,
[centralized and coordinated within the State Department, would allow
the United States to wield its security assistance **more effectively
and responsibly** in today's competitive geopolitical
environment.]{.underline} Arms transfers, training, and [support
could]{.underline} also [better support U.S. foreign policy
goals]{.underline}, in particular [bolstering democratic partners and
emerging democracies, making them stronger U.S. partners to counter
threats from authoritarian actors]{.underline}. [Empowering the State
Department to]{.underline} oversee and [manage security assistance would
also ensure that aid is used to advance a values-based foreign policy
that **respects and supports human rights**]{.underline}.3 [It would
also give U.S. **diplomats greater clout and leverage** and]{.underline}
potentially [create greater coherence to]{.underline} the provision of
[foreign assistance overall]{.underline}. [The result would be to
strengthen **a key tool in the U.S. foreign policy toolbox** and
increase the **clout and authority of America's diplomats**, which is
badly needed in this new era of geopolitical competition]{.underline}.

[DIPLOMACY has never been so important as now]{.underline}, when we are
confronting the most serious crises since the Second World War: the
global pandemic and economic collapse. When we emerge finally from the
grip of the coronavirus, Americans will need to account for a
public-health disaster that has killed well over 100,000 people to date
and shuttered nearly every institution in our society (including
Harvard) for much of the spring and into the summer. But [we'll also
need to look beyond our borders]{.underline} to assess what went wrong
globally. Why did the World Health Organization---its long and
continuing record of expertise in matters of global health
notwithstanding---not press China more aggressively to tell the truth
about the virus in early January? [How should nations be better
prepared]{.underline} for a possible second wave? Can they agree to
share a vaccine equitably among the world's 7.7 billion people?
[Will]{.underline} the [major economies collaborate]{.underline} to
prevent the current recession from turning into another Great
Depression? [The answer to these questions will depend]{.underline} in
large measure **[on]{.underline}** **[our ability to work diplomatically
across the world]{.underline}** in this multi-front struggle. As a
former career Foreign Service officer, I have spent four decades of my
professional life representing the United States overseas and teaching
about America's role as the indispensable power in the international
arena. For much of that time, [the nation leaned heavily on its
unmatched military might]{.underline}---[during the Cold War, after
9/11, and in the Afghan and Iraq wars. **Now**]{.underline}, with the
spread of the coronavirus to every inhabited continent, **[diplomacy's
time has come in the reconstruction of a more stable and better
world]{.underline}**. Unfortunately, restoring the role of U.S.
diplomacy won't be easy. One early casualty of the pandemic is our
plummeting credibility as the unmatched global power. For the first time
since World War II, America has chosen not to lead in confronting a
quintessentially global threat. With American energy and confidence in
short supply, President Donald Trump is a spectral figure on the world
stage as nations struggle to contain the virus. Instead of leading the
G-20 major economies against the contagion, the world has watched an
American president castigate China for birthing the "Wuhan Virus," pin
the blame for the failed response on the World Health Organization,
and---as one of my European students lamented---fail even to offer a
simple word of sympathy in all those endless news conferences to those
dying in Italy and Spain and other bedrock allies. Former Secretary of
State Colin Powell has long maintained that [America should place its
diplomats out in front]{.underline} ("on point" in the military
vernacular), [with]{.underline} the [armed forces]{.underline} in
reserve, [to be used only when diplomacy fails]{.underline}. Powell's
dictum is an important reminder of how the United States should seek to
lead in this time of pandemic, for the [coronavirus is only one of many
among a new type of threat that requires us to **lead**]{.underline} as
much **[through]{.underline}** the power of **[diplomacy]{.underline}**
as through that of the military. Many of the students I teach point to
[transnational threats that affect every nation]{.underline} and person
on earth as our greatest challenges: **[climate change]{.underline}**,
**[food and water shortages]{.underline}**, **[narcotics and crime
cartels]{.underline}**, the lack of **[cyber security]{.underline}**,
and **[pandemics]{.underline}** top the list. [We cannot succeed in
containing them without]{.underline} forming **[diplomatic
alliances]{.underline}** among governments, universities, foundations,
businesses, and citizens. This new brand of diplomacy is not an
alternative to the military but its logical partner in the twenty-first
century American arsenal. The military remains essential to fight
terrorists, and to counter rivals Russia and China and outlaw
governments in North Korea and Iran, but even in these cases we have to
have robust diplomacy to achieve our aims. Even if we deployed the full
might of the U.S. military to eliminate the North Korean and Iranian
nuclear programs, and the regimes that support them, does anyone believe
that would, by itself, "solve" the problem? Even in those cases, deft,
multilateral diplomacy will have to play a lead role---as recent
experience has shown. **[We can no longer default to force
alone]{.underline}**, as we have done so often since 9/11. A Foreign
Service for 2030 AMERICA'S DIPLOMATIC EFFECTIVENESS rests, in large
part, on the women and men of the U.S. Foreign Service---more than
11,000 career officials in more than 280 embassies and consulates and at
the State Department in Washington, D.C. They are our primary interface
with foreign governments, businesses, and citizens. They adjudicate
immigrant and non-immigrant visas and refugee admissions to the United
States. They help American businesses overcome barriers to foreign trade
and investment. They manage difficult war and peace challenges in every
corner of the world---from daily challenges to the most intricate,
strategic matters vital to our national security and prosperity.
Diplomatic collaboration also underpins our ability to advance the more
positive scientific, technological, and societal trends that can sustain
the historic alleviation of poverty worldwide, promote women's rights,
and realize the promise of a carbon-free economy. Just when we need to
turn to diplomacy, however, the Foreign Service is experiencing one of
the greatest crises in its long history. Some of the damage has been
caused by prior Democratic as well as Republican administrations. The
United States is the only major country that fills a third or more of
its ambassadorial assignments with political appointees, often poorly
qualified, from outside the career ranks---often depriving the country
of the advantages it could secure with expert, professional, nonpartisan
diplomatic representation around the world. That mistake has only
accelerated, with the current administration appointing the lowest
percentage of career ambassadors in more than half a century. Former
generals and admirals have been appointed to ambassadorships that would
otherwise be filled---as they should be---by civilian officers. The
politicization and militarization of our foreign policy by both parties
is a genuine problem. More broadly, the Foreign Service has been
substantially weakened and is in need of major repair. Even as the Trump
administration's budget requests for the Department of Defense rose from
\$686 billion to as high as \$718 billion during its first two years, it
sought to slash the State Department's budget by up to a third. The
administration fired several of America's most senior and experienced
diplomats early in 2017 and sidelined countless others, triggering an
exodus of officers of every rank. The president himself has castigated
career diplomats as the "Deep State." Unsurprisingly, morale has crashed
and young Americans' applications for the Foreign Service have fallen to
just under 10,000 from a high of 31,000 in 2003---a worrisome indicator
that our nation's ability to attract superb diplomatic talent is being
eroded. Re-Imagining American Diplomacy THE KENNEDY SCHOOL launched an
ambitious, nonpartisan initiative this winter---A New American Diplomacy
for the 21st Century---to address these concerns and spark a national
conversation about the future of the Foreign Service. I am working with
former Foreign Service colleagues, Ambassadors Nancy McEldowney, Marc
Grossman, and Marcie Ries, to issue a major public report after the
November presidential election. We have organized online meetings with
hundreds of current and former officials, business and nonprofit
leaders, and everyday citizens to discuss ways to strengthen the career
service. American diplomacy needs a major generational update. Since
9/11, Congress and three administrations have reformed the U.S. military
and intelligence services and created the Department of Homeland
Security. But collectively, they did little to re-imagine diplomacy's
role in the American arsenal. During the last century, there have been
just three efforts to modernize the U.S. diplomatic corps: in 1924,
1946, and 1980 (when Congress passed the last major State Department
Authorization Act). In our vastly altered geo-strategic environment, 40
years later, it is time to renew the mission of the Foreign Service.
Barack Obama, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mahmoud Abbas, September 22, 2009,
at the Waldorf Astoria, New York City Photograph by John
Angelillo-Pool/Getty Images We can mine America's long diplomatic
history for inspiration. Drawing on my own experience, I recall, as a
young intern at the U.S. embassy in Mauritania, seeing first-hand the
respect and influence President Jimmy Carter earned as the first U.S.
leader to make Africa a priority. A decade later, when I served at the
National Security Council with responsibility for the Soviet Union, I
witnessed President George H.W. Bush negotiate the peaceful end of the
Cold War and Bill Clinton consolidate the triumph of democracy over
communism. President George W. Bush launched the bipartisan PEPFAR
initiative to help in the fight against HIV/AIDs, polio, malaria, and
other deadly diseases in Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere (a useful
precedent when thinking about what it will really take to combat the
coronavirus, not only in the developed nations, but in those with far
fewer economic and healthcare resources). It was on 9/11, however, as
U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that I
learned one of the most powerful lessons about diplomacy. Just a few
hours after Al Qaida terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, my phone started to ring at NATO headquarters outside
Brussels. My Canadian colleague, David Wright, called first---followed
by the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Germany,
Italy, and many others. Each asked, "What can we do to help?" Those were
very welcome words on the single darkest day in recent American history.
By the next morning, invoking Article 5 of the 1949 NATO Treaty for the
first time in history, all of the NATO-allied countries came to the
rescue of the United States---lending mighty political and diplomatic
support to the military response that would come later. Our allies
considered Osama Bin Laden's attacks on New York and Washington as an
attack on them as well. Their militaries all went into Afghanistan with
us (the majority remain 19 years later---and they and other partner
nations have suffered more than 1,000 combat deaths; we owe them a lot).
Contrary to such evidence, the current president believes the United
States is strongest when it acts alone---unburdened of allies and
partners whom he views as relics of our Cold War past. I lived the
history of 9/11 and draw a very different lesson about the value of
allies to the United States. Why would we want to live alone in a
troubled and dangerous world, without the benefit of friends and allies
by our side? [Our NATO allies]{.underline}, as well as Japan, South
Korea, and Australia, [act as multipliers of American power in the
world]{.underline}. They provide a lifeline of military, economic, and
political support when we often need it most. They represent the great
power differential between the United States and our rivals Russia and
China, who can count on no such allies when the chips are down. As we
recover from two decades of war and COVID-19's assault on our society
and economy, we will need to look at our global role in a new way. The
era when America could run the world by fiat has vanished. We are still
the strongest economic, military, and technological power---but China,
India, and others are gaining on us. We can no longer overpower our
adversaries in every crisis. [And although we will need to call on the
military to defend us in the future, we will more often than not need to
outwit and outmaneuver adversaries through]{.underline} the strength of
our **[diplomats]{.underline}** and our alliances---not to mention
mustering support for those broader, nonmilitary crises we now face,
**[from pandemics to climate change]{.underline}**.

[U.S. Code Title 22 provides congressional authority to conduct DoS
Security Assistance programs]{.underline}. The programs are carried out
through two basic laws, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA).24 AECA enacted congressional
legislative controls over export of defense articles and services. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee are responsible for foreign assistance and Security Assistance
program authorization legislation. The Senate and House Armed Services
Committees are responsible for defense programs authorization
legislation. [The term **security cooperation** is used within DoD,
whereas the term **security assistance** is used within the
DoS]{.underline}. It is important to note that these congressional
committees play a role only in FMS authorization. Although Congress
maintains legislative control over exports, FMS is a nonappropriated
program, external to the U.S. budget, and the president is charged with
signing off on spending for the program. Through Executive Order 11958,
as amended, the President delegates selected functions in the AECA to
the secretaries of State and Defense. They are required to provide
reports to Congress and obtain specific congressional approval on
certain exports or transfers. [The DoS has responsibilities relating to
**security assistance**, which include managing the export of defense
articles, services, training, and military technology]{.underline}.25
[DoD has responsibilities relating to **security cooperation**, which
include activities to encourage and enable international partners to
work with the United States to achieve strategic
objectives]{.underline}.26 The military departments and other DoD
agencies involved in managing FMS programs are collectively called
implementing agencies (IAs). The Army, Navy, and Air Force usually have
the responsibility of being the IA in the process of FMS.27 The Air
Force agency for all security cooperation programs is the Office of the
Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International Affairs
(SAF/IA). The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition has
oversight in the execution by virtue of having responsibility for Air
Force acquisition. SAF/IA is supported by the Air Force Security
Assistance Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, for most FMS
and other logistics functions. The Air Force Security Assistance
Training (AFSAT) squadron at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is in
charge of planning and, with AETC, managing the Air Force international
military training. It is organized under the authority of AETC.

nation's request for support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the
foreign country to develop its internal capacity to protect its people
and limit internal or external threats. The security cooperation
exercise Baltic Operation, held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign
country using the resources 9 provided by the United States to improve
its national defense capabilities in direct response to a perceived
threat to its sovereign borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting
to develop its military capabilities and project an image of strength in
an effort to maintain the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the
conclusion of the Singing Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future
Russian incursion across its borders. [In contrast to this appropriate

#### It\'s strictly limited to DoD actions

Cooperation Studies (Ronald, "The Management of Security Cooperation,"
<http://cebw.org/images/docs/Legislacao_Webinar/Greenbook_39_0.pdf)//BB>

**[Introduction to Security Cooperation]{.underline}**

Introduction

[The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative]{.underline} (DRI). At that time, the then
named Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day to day
management responsibilities of many security assistance programs
authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export
Control Act (AECA). The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain
Department of Defense (DoD) funded international programs along with
their personnel and associated resources. So that other U.S. government
(USG) agencies, the private sector and foreign governments could better
understand DSAA's enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security
assistance (SA), DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs. In addition, DSCA leads the broader USG
security cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation
programs continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs) or the
military departments (MILDEPs). What further complicated the management
of security cooperation was that the in-country point of contact between
the USG and the host nation generally is either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) sponsored defense attaché office (DAO) or the DSCA
sponsored security cooperation office (SCO). These two spigots for
security cooperation with a country required a broad knowledge and skill
baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD and its agencies and
the MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of
in-country security cooperation were generally resolved with the
establishment of the Senior Defense Official-Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT)
having oversight over both the SCO and DAO organizations. It was not
until 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **formal**]{.underline}, yet
still very broad, **[definition of security cooperation]{.underline}**
in Joint Pub 1-02:

> [All **DoD** interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation.

[DODD 5132.03]{.underline}, DoD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation, 29 December 2016, [further defines security
cooperation with assigned responsibilities]{.underline}:

> [All **DoD** interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and partner nation military and security
> capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and
> provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to allied
> and partner nations. This includes DoD administered security
> assistance programs.

#### The most [clear and specific]{.underline} definition conclusively requires the DoD

**Reighard 6**, Lt Col in USAF (Robert, "SECURITY COOPERATION:
INTEGRATING STRATEGIES TO SECURE NATIONAL GOALS," USAWC STRATEGY
RESEARCH PROJECT, https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA449543.pdf)//BB

[Security cooperation has been a part of the U.S. Armed Forces for many
years]{.underline}. In fact, historians reveal that [the U.S. military
has always engaged in security cooperation with other countries and
their military forces]{.underline}. [However, the term used to designate
such activities is now "**Security Cooperation**," a term that has
evolved conceptually]{.underline} through various programs over the
years. [During the 19**90s**, the terms "engagement" and "shaping" were
used without]{.underline} sufficient [specificity]{.underline}; they
were often used interchangeably, [resulting in confusion]{.underline}
that led to problems in both planning and execution. [DOD thus adopted
"Security Cooperation" in 2001. It included a broad range of
military-to-military activities]{.underline}, but it also clarified
roles and responsibilities. [The term Security Cooperation thus
describes]{.underline} a broad range of [activities used by the
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense]{.underline} in peacetime operations.
These activities refer to all DOD interactions that are [carried out
with foreign defense establishments]{.underline}, such as combined
exercises, combined training, combined education, military-to-military
contacts, humanitarian assistance, and information operations.

#### [Budget classification]{.underline} proves it's military-to-military 

**Van Eerden 20**, Captain (James, "Seeking Alpha in the Security
Cooperation Enterprise A New Approach to Assessments and Evaluations,"
Journal of Advanced Military Studies, 11.1)//BB

[The]{.underline} Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 [President's Budget: Security
Cooperation]{.underline} Consolidated [Budget]{.underline} [Display
outlines seven categories of security cooperation]{.underline} activity,
including [military-to-military engagements]{.underline}, [support to
operations]{.underline}, and [humanitarian and assistance activities,
among others]{.underline}.6 The **[security cooperation]{.underline}**
[framework traditionally includes]{.underline} [security
assistance]{.underline} (SA), [security force assistance]{.underline}
(SFA), [and]{.underline} some aspects of [foreign internal
defense]{.underline} (FID).7 In the context of this article, **[the term
security cooperation refers]{.underline}** primarily **[to
military-to-military engagement]{.underline}**s, [where the U.S.
military engages in training partner forces under the auspices of Title
10 and Title 22 authorities]{.underline}.

#### Security Cooperation is military-to-military activity

**Finkelstein 10**, PhD, Vice President of the CNA Corporation, an
independent, non-profit research institution in Arlington, Virginia
(David, "The Military Dimensions of U.S.-China Security Cooperation:
Retrospective and Future Prospects," *Center for Naval Analyses*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA530755>)//BB

The United States and China have engaged in security cooperation on a
variety of international issues since the normalization of relations in
1979. In fact, security cooperation began even before the formal
establishment of state-to-state relations. We recall that during the
height of the Cold War the two nations demonstrated that when a pressing
and shared security concern in that case, the former Soviet Union
presented itself, Washington and Beijing were capable of working
together, extant differences notwithstanding. Security consultations and
sometime security cooperation between the two countries continue today.
But as the record of security cooperation is reviewed, one comes to the
conclusion that, for the most part, U.S.-China security cooperation has
been mainly of a political nature and operationalized at a high level of
strategic policy coordination. Security cooperation between the two
nations has been largely the purview of U.S. and Chinese civilian
officials and diplomats, not generals and admirals. In other words, over
the course of 30 years of relations, security cooperation between the
defense-military establishments of the United States and China \-- the
uniformed services \-- has been the exception rather than the rule. If a
serious discussion about future security cooperation between the U.S.
Navy and the PLA Navy is to take place \-- a leitmotif of this series of
conferences as described by the sponsors \-- then some of the issues,
challenges, and problems from the past need to be confronted even as we
look over the horizon. For the purposes of this paper, [**security
cooperation** is **defined** as the two militaries working together to
achieve a common objective \-- not high-level visits, exchanges, port
calls, or other activities that are mainly symbolic or representational
in nature]{.underline}.

[This briefing paper provides an overview of a central]{.underline}, but
often overlooked, [instrument of US]{.underline} remote [warfare:
security cooperation]{.underline}. In the briefing, [security
cooperation is defined as **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense-managed
programmes to train, equip and advise foreign security forces to fight
alongside]{.underline}, or as surrogates for, [American 'boots on the
ground']{.underline}. Since the final years of the Bush administration,
this feature of remote warfare has emerged as a central instrument in
the US counterterrorism toolbox. In comparison to the kinetic face of
remote warfare, however, it remains poorly understood. This briefing
paper demonstrates the significance of security cooperation to remote
warfare. It focuses on the use of security cooperation in US
counterterrorism operations during the Obama presidency, with examples
drawn from efforts to combat Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and
Al-Shabaab. It concludes by briefly considering the future of security
cooperation under the Trump administration.

[Security cooperation is **defined** as the means by which the
**Department of Defense** encourages and enables countries to work with
the United States]{.underline}. It includes official, cooperative and
general non-combat interactions.4 [Military organizations conduct
security cooperation]{.underline} activities, as part of the range of
military operations. These activities are intended to build
institutional capacity within partner nation security structures so
those nations can become self-sufficient, secure their populations,
control their borders and contribute to regional peace. Security
cooperation activities are also aimed at developing peacetime
interoperability between US and partner forces so that in times of
crisis, activities are executed effectively and efficiently. The US also
conducts security cooperation to enhance relationships with partner
nations and to gain dependable host nation support. Though sometimes
misconstrued, routine military cooperation activities can evolve into
relationships that help ensure the US can successfully assist regional
partners in times of crisis. For example, US ability to position forces,
equipment and supplies, or use ports, warehouses and airfields when
planning and conducting crisis response operations could save time...
and ultimately, lives.

#### Even the broadest definitions requires the DoD

**Williams 12**, Lt Col in Army National Guard (James, "The National
Guard State Partnership Program: Element of Smart Power,"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA562110.pdf>)//BB

Similarly, the six Geographic Combatant Commanders (COCOMs) have
underscored security cooperation and building partner capacity as
essential to their respective Theater Strategy Plans and Country
Campaign Plans in support of National Security objectives. In every
COCOM posture statement the reader will find references 7 to the
importance of the concepts of cooperation, engagement, and building
partner capacity. ["Security Cooperation]{.underline}" [is defined
**broadly** as interactions between the Department of Defense and
foreign militaries that promote specific United States security
interests; develop allied and friendly military capabilities; and
provide the United States with both peacetime and contingency access to
host nations]{.underline}.12 Typical **[security]{.underline}**
**[cooperation]{.underline}** and engagement [activities include
military-to-military contact, coalition training, nation assistance and
long term operations]{.underline}. These types of activities range from
Navy ship port visits to combined training exercises, foreign military
education, leader conferences, foreign military sales and counter-drug
operations.

#### Security Cooperation requires a [military branch]{.underline} to be the implementing agency

**Arnold 20**, colonel in USAF (Jason, "Add Value to Security
Cooperation through Joint Unification," FAO Journal of International
Affairs,
<https://faoajournal.substack.com/p/add-value-to-security-cooperation?s=r)//BB>

[In]{.underline} the [Security Cooperation]{.underline} Enterprise, [the

[**implementing agencies** of]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales
([FMS]{.underline}) cases, Building Partner Capacity ([BPC]{.underline})
cases, [and]{.underline} in [training]{.underline} activities.\[6\]
These SC programs provide our international partners with the
capabilities they require both for their own security and to assist in
regional security objectives that improve the overall global security
situation. Most open [SC cases have **one of the military departments**
as an Implementing Agency]{.underline} (IA) [and each service has built
its own organizational structure, bureaucracy, and automated systems to
support the effort]{.underline}.\[7\]

### AT PDCP\-\--Prefer Our Interp

#### Given that basically [any]{.underline} activity is included, the [only functional limit]{.underline} on the topic has to come at the [agent-level]{.underline}

**Mazarr 22**, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation.
Previously he worked at the U.S. National War College, where he was
professor and associate dean of academics; as president of the Henry L.

special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Michael,
"Security Cooperation in a Strategic Competition," RAND,
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA650-1.html>)

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [Official U.S. government definitions of security
cooperation are very **broad**.]{.underline} [One
definition]{.underline} from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
[states that security cooperation]{.underline}

> [comprises all activities undertaken by]{.underline} the Department of
> Defense ([DoD) to encourage and enable international partners to work
> with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates to achieve strategic
> objectives. [It includes **all** DoD interactions with foreign defense
> and security establishments,]{.underline} including all
> DoD-administered Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense
> and security relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests,
> including all international armaments cooperation activities and SA
> activities; develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions clearly include almost **any security-related
activity** for **any purpose**.]{.underline} To scope the focus of the
study, [we reviewed]{.underline} official state documents and strategies
and the literature on security cooperation to identify [11 types of
activities]{.underline}:

1\. [military aid]{.underline}, which includes funding through the
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles
program, and other grants and loans

2\. [arms sales]{.underline} and transfers,4 such as U.S. arms sales
through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) programs

3\. [military capacity-building]{.underline}, such as U.S. activities
under Section 1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and
Sections and 2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the train and equip

cases, the different countries define the categories somewhat
differently, so we could not develop data on entirely comparable sets of
security cooperation activities.

### AT PDB\-\--No Solvency

#### The permutation is two [simultaneous]{.underline} and [overlapping]{.underline} assistance programs. That dooms solvency for [both]{.underline}. Duplication causes [operational and planning]{.underline} conflicts that cause great power [miscalculation]{.underline}

**Bergmann 21**, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress,

The result today is that the United States has [two distinct security
assistance systems]{.underline} --- [one at the State Department and one
at the Defense Department]{.underline} --- **[doing the same
thing]{.underline}**. That [has created a bureaucratic mess involving
countless planning and operational conflicts]{.underline} --- one that
also makes it impossible for Congress to conduct effective oversight,
since the two departments answer to different committees. Recognizing
the problem, some policymakers in Congress and the Pentagon have
recently implemented a few useful reforms --- but they go only so far.
Today, when combatant commanders show up in the countries they're
assigned to, they frequently have security assistance funding at their
disposal. But State Department officials of similar rank often lack
comparably flexible funding and yet have to deliver tough messages on
other U.S. foreign policy priorities, from human rights to economic
reform, democratization or even climate policy. This [power imbalance is
not lost on foreign partners, and they act accordingly, often **tuning
out the State Department** while cultivating their relations with the
Defense Department]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} current [bifurcated
system is not just wasteful]{.underline} --- [it's also]{.underline}
potentially [dangerous]{.underline}. Policymakers originally expanded
Defense Department assistance in response to the post-9/11 focus on
counterterrorism, when security assistance was often seen as a technical
tool to smooth collaboration with foreign militaries. But [in a new era
of global great power competition, the provision of arms to another
country sends a loud foreign policy signal, one that **can easily lead
to** **miscalc**ulation. Those assistance decisions need to be well
coordinated and calibrated by **diplomats**, **not
generals**]{.underline}.

Max Bergmann, [a former State Department official]{.underline} who
authored security assistance reform recommendations last year,
[said]{.underline} [efforts to shift greater authority to **the State
Department** will succeed only if the White House prioritizes
them]{.underline}. [In a high-stakes competition with China, the U.S.
can't afford for parallel security-assistance bureaucracies to undermine
statecraft]{.underline}, he said. "[What is critical is that we have
**full control** over that lever, and not have it be a **bureaucratic
mess** where one hand doesn't know what the other is doing and it's
difficult for any senior policymaker in the White House to know
**what**]{.underline} the hell[**'s** going on]{.underline}," said
Bergmann, now a senior fellow at Center for American Progress.
Meanwhile, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on both
sides of the aisle are generally supportive of shifts, arguing for an
overhaul of the current setup. "[As the **Defense** Department continues
**efforts** to **cut the State Department out of** **security
cooperation**]{.underline}, we've seen a greater focus on short-term
tactical capabilities than on sustainable forces aligned with strategic
foreign policy," Risch said. "We must address governance challenges like
corruption in all our activities, and we need to professionalize our
security assistance workforce."

[The DOD's duplicative security assistance programs **complicate overall
foreign policymaking**]{.underline}. Reforming security assistance by
**[centralizing resources at the State Department]{.underline}**---and
coupling the move with necessary reforms at the State
Department---**[would go a long way toward improving this policy
process]{.underline}**.

[U.S. military]{.underline} SC [\[**Security Cooperation**\]
efforts]{.underline} may also [**complicate** diplomacy. Generals whisk
in on executive jets with large entourages and largesse in the form of
SC funds and services. The result is that foreign officials see their
military counterparts as congenial and influential partners in
**contrast** to the U.S. ambassador]{.underline}---who comes with little
in the way of other aid and is often seen as browbeating and meddling in
sovereign affairs---[whose role is to try to **hold back the tide of
illiberalism**]{.underline} much to the chagrin of his or her
counterparts.

#### Diplomacy has to be the tool of [first-resort]{.underline} to restore US diplomatic leadership

**Burns 19**, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace and the author of The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy
and the Case for Its Renewal (Random House, 2019), from which portions
of this essay are adapted. He was a career diplomat in the U.S. State
Department for 33 years, serving as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State from
2011 to 2014 (William, "The Lost Art of American Diplomacy," *Foreign
Affairs*,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-03-27/lost-art-american-diplomacy)//BB>

**[Diplomacy]{.underline}** may be one of the world's oldest
professions, but it's also one of the most misunderstood. It[**'s**
mostly a quiet endeavor, less swaggering than unrelenting, oftentimes
operating in back channels, out of sight and out of mind]{.underline}.
U.S. President Donald Trump's disdain for professional diplomacy and its
practitioners---along with his penchant for improvisational flirtations
with authoritarian leaders such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un---has put
an unaccustomed spotlight on the profession. It has also underscored the
significance of its renewal. [The neglect and distortion of American
diplomacy]{.underline} is not a purely Trumpian invention. It [has been
an episodic feature of the United States' approach to the world since
the end of the Cold War.]{.underline} The Trump administration, however,
has made the problem infinitely worse. There is never a good time for
diplomatic malpractice, but the administration's unilateral diplomatic
disarmament is spectacularly mistimed, unfolding precisely at a moment
when American diplomacy matters more than ever to American interests.
[The United States is no longer the only big kid on the geopolitical
block, and no longer able get everything it wants on its own, or by
force alone]{.underline}. [Although the era of singular U.S. dominance
on the world stage is over, the United States still has a better hand to
play than any of its rivals]{.underline}. **[The country has a window of
opportunity to lock in its role as the world's pivotal
power]{.underline}**, [the one **best placed** to shape a changing
international landscape before others shape it first]{.underline}. [If
the United States is to seize that opportunity and safeguard its
interests and values, it will have to rebuild American diplomacy and
**make it the tool of first resort**]{.underline}, backed up by economic
and military leverage and the power of example.

#### The link is linear. [Every]{.underline} funding decision matters. 

**Ryan 16**, writes about diplomacy, national security and the State
Department for The Washington Post. She joined The Post in 2014 to write
about the Pentagon and military issues (Missy, "State Department and
Pentagon tussle over control of foreign military aid," *Washington
Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-and-pentagon-tussle-over-control-of-foreign-military-aid/2016/07/10/ddc98f3e-42b0-11e6-88d0-6adee48be8bc_story.html)//BB>

State Department officials fear that [an expansion in Pentagon control
over security assistance would impair diplomatic efforts and move the
United States further from the]{.underline} Obama administration's [goal
of getting the military out of foreign aid]{.underline}. Diplomats also
say that [military-led programs]{.underline}, without adequate input
from the State Department, can [overlook key human rights or governance
concerns and heighten tensions with nations such as China and Russia,
because foreign governments see assistance delivered by the U.S.
military, rather than civilian agencies, as a potential
threat]{.underline}. "We've got to balance the various components of our
foreign policy," said a senior State Department official who, like
others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal
deliberations. "[**The more money and more authority you move out of
traditional accounts** we have used for decades to work with our
partners, the **more you lose the ability to balance**]{.underline}."

#### The State Department needs [primacy]{.underline} to effectively establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries

**Withers 8**, WOLA Senior Fellow focused on human rights in Latin
America, et al (George, "Ready, Aim, Foreign Policy," *WOLA*,
<https://www.wola.org/sites/default/files/downloadable/Regional%20Security/past/LAWG-Combo-ForeignPolicy-6.pdf)//BB>

These **[changes are not just theoretical]{.underline}**.
[In]{.underline} December 2006[, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
noted the increasing role of U.S. defense agencies in leading foreign
policy on the ground, and issued a stern warning]{.underline} in a
document entitled Embassies as Command Posts in the Anti-Terror Campaign
(S. Prt. 109-52): [It has traditionally been the military's mission to
take direct action against U.S. adversaries while the civilian agencies'
mission has been to pursue non-coercive measures through
diplomacy]{.underline}, international information programming, [and
foreign]{.underline} and economic [assistance]{.underline}. As a result
of inadequate funding for civilian programs, however, U.S. defense
agencies are increasingly being granted authority and funding to fill
perceived gaps. Such [**bleeding** of civilian responsibilities overseas
from civilian to military agencies risks **weakening the Secretary of
State's primacy** in setting the agenda for U.S. relations with foreign
countries]{.underline} and the Secretary of Defense's focus on war
fighting.

#### Even if both policies are [equally]{.underline} resourced, the Department of State will be pushed into the [supporting role]{.underline}

**Oakley 19**, Army strategist and currently serves as an assistant
professor at National Defense University's College of International
Security Affairs (David, "THE PROBLEMS OF A MILITARIZED FOREIGN POLICY
FOR AMERICA'S PREMIER INTELLIGENCE AGENCY," *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-problems-of-a-militarized-foreign-policy-for-americas-premier-intelligence-agency/>)//BB

Neither is Stavridis the first retired military leader to voice this
concern. In 2013, future secretary of defense James Mattis, then a
Marine Corps general, famously quipped, "[if you don't fund the State
Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition]{.underline}." In
2012, Karl Eikenberry, a retired lieutenant general and former
ambassador to Afghanistan, argued that [the militarization of U.S.
foreign policy and an unequal investment in the Defense Department over
other departments **result**]{.underline}ed [in the military becoming
the "**starting and relief pitcher** for a number of foreign policy
problems]{.underline}." In a speech at Kansas State University in 2010,
Michael Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
articulated his concern with the Defense Department's increasing role in
foreign policy: "My fear, quite frankly, is that we aren't moving fast
enough in this regard. U.S. foreign policy is still too dominated by the
military, too dependent upon the generals and admirals who lead our
major overseas commands. It's one thing to be able and willing to serve
as emergency responders; quite another to always have to be the fire
chief." In an earlier interview, Mullen described a vicious cycle of
policymakers turning to the military and increasing funding to the
Defense Department because they have greater trust in military
capability than in other agencies, and this greater funding in turn
makes the military even more capable relative to other national security
institutions. [Instead of correcting a significant imbalance in
resourcing national security capabilities, policymakers just turn to the
military to handle an increasing array of missions]{.underline}. [The
military then becomes the lead while other **organizations find
themselves in supporting roles**]{.underline}.

### AT DoD Tradeoff Links to CP

#### Security Cooperation is [exclusively funded]{.underline} by the Department of Defense, and Security Assistance is [exclusively]{.underline} Department of State funding.

**White 14**, Major, USMC, a Joint Doctrine Development Officer with the
Joint Staff J7 (Taylor, "Security Cooperation How It All Fits" *Joint
Forces Quarterly*,
https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/jfq/jfq-72/jfq-72_106-108_White.pdf?ver=2014-03-13-152407-220)

Department of Defense (DOD) [security cooperation
activities]{.underline} support or are combined with other assistance
programs and often are a part of nation assistance. This
[often]{.underline} occurs in a manner that may [appear
confusing]{.underline} or convoluted to the joint warfighter. This
article portrays how the programs and activities converge. Although the
various [terms]{.underline} and activities in show in the accompanying
figure appear to have simple names and meanings, they in fact [have
**strict definitions** based on funding **and**
authorities]{.underline}. While some of the activities directly support
one another, others have distinct boundaries between their definitions
and functions. The joint community is beginning to address the framework
of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication, Joint
Publication (JP) 3-XX, *Security Cooperation*. [It is important to
embark with clear definitions and understanding of the complex
relationship among these terms]{.underline} to facilitate understanding
by the joint force.

[Security cooperation is]{.underline} referred to in both joint
professional military education programs and joint staffs as [a
tool]{.underline} to be [employed by combatant commands.]{.underline}
However, in other settings, it is a set of programs managed by the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of joint doctrine
and policy reveals that the definition of *security cooperation* appears
to encompass these areas and more. After expanding our understanding of
security cooperation, other terms such as [*security force assistance,
foreign internal defense,* and **security assistance**]{.underline}
provide additional specificity for the tasks being conducted, yet some
of these actions [fall **outside security cooperation**]{.underline}.
Even though security cooperation spans the range of military operations
and is inclusive of large-scale operations conducted in support of
foreign nations, it is not all-encompassing of security related support
from U.S. agencies other than DOD.

[Nation assistance is support rendered by foreign forces within another
nation's territory]{.underline} based on mutual agreements.1 While this
term is used to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other
nations, the definition associated with nation assistance has two
limitations: it does not encompass support to regional organizations,
and it is only assistance by foreign forces. [A better, broader term is
*foreign assistance*, which is assistance to foreign nations ranging
from the sale of military equipment to donations of food and medical
supplies]{.underline} to aid survivors of natural and manmade
disasters.2 When examining the current definitions for *foreign
assistance* and *nation assistance*, we find significant overlap:

> *Foreign assistance to foreign nations* \[ranges\] *from the sale of
> military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
> survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign assistance
> takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance,
> and security assistance.3*

This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance
budget.

*Nation assistance---assistance rendered to a nation by foreign forces
within that nation's territory based on agreements mutually concluded
between nations.4*

The term nation assistance is not often used in policy or strategy. For
example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign
assistance three times but does not use the term nation assistance. The
first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term nation
assistance with foreign assistance in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0,
Joint Operations, and JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.

If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint
doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security
cooperation that falls outside the realm of nation assistance in
figure 1. Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security
cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. [Security
cooperation]{.underline} then [focuses **strictly on the DOD
contribution** to foreign assistance and encompasses all DOD
interactions with foreign defense establishments to build]{.underline}
both national and regional [defense relationships]{.underline} that
promote specific U.S. security interests, [develop allied and friendly
military capabilities for self-defense]{.underline} [and multinational
operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to host nations]{.underline}.5

Having addressed the larger constructs, it is possible to review and
clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that
occur within them. First is **[security assistance]{.underline}** with a
specific definition in relation to both DOD and State. It [refers to a
group of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline}
of 1961, as amended, [and the Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} of
1976, as amended. [These programs are **funded and authorized by
State**]{.underline} to be administered by DOD through the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency.6 This is the process by which the United
States provides defense articles, military training, and other
defense-related services. [That portion of security assistance **outside
of security cooperation**]{.underline} in figure 1 [reflects **State and
other civilian agency** involvement]{.underline}.

https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/)

[The current security assistance system contributes to the
militarization of U.S. foreign policy. Militarizing foreign policy
entails the increasing use of the military to solve foreign policy
challenges]{.underline} and results in a bloated DOD budget with more
resources and authority. [Researchers describe it as a phenomenon
whereby "the military more and more becomes the primary actor and face
of U.S. policy abroad," leading to a cycle in which the DOD]{.underline}
requires and receives significantly more resources than any other
foreign policy agency and [is]{.underline} thus [increasingly relied on
to solve U.S. foreign policy problems.]{.underline}62 There are several
elements of a militarized foreign policy in today's security assistance
system, but primarily, [the DOD's control of]{.underline} significantly
more [security assistance resources puts the **Pentagon**---**rather
than diplomats**---**in the driver's seat** in
policymaking]{.underline}. [The Pentagon's]{.underline} significant
[resources also distort the face of U.S. security assistance on the
ground]{.underline}. Gordon Adams, a former White House budget official,
warned, "**[Who owns the ball matters]{.underline}** here **[because it
colors the way the U.S. engages overseas]{.underline}**. [If American
engagement wears a uniform ... that's one form of interaction. If it
involves the ambassador]{.underline} and the \[U.S. Agency for
International Development\] and people doing governance work, [it's a
different set of missions and there's a **hugely different
perception**]{.underline}."63 [Recipient countries]{.underline} can
[utilize this to their advantage]{.underline}; [foreign
officials]{.underline} may more eagerly seek to follow through or [make
progress on DOD requests]{.underline} or priorities, such as going
through with a significant military exercise or a ship visit, [while
ignoring]{.underline} or slow-rolling [State Department
requests]{.underline} or priorities, such as releasing a dissident or
altering an economic regulation. [And if the interlocutor that matters
in relations with the United States is the military, the subject that
matters is defense]{.underline}. [The Pentagon's priorities can
therefore end up carrying more importance with partners than the State
Department's broader foreign policy concerns, making combatant commands
more powerful than any diplomat]{.underline}. When **[the State
Department is]{.underline}** deprived of resources, or **[cut
out]{.underline}** [of the decision-making process
entirely]{.underline}, diplomats cannot effectively weigh in on whether
a proposed sale or package makes sense given a range of other
nonmilitary concerns that may exist in a bilateral relationship. In
short, money is power, and the DOD has the money. [The net effect is
that U.S. foreign policy is less coherent]{.underline}, with Pentagon
policy more likely to be out of sync with broader foreign policy
concerns. For example, the DOD's U.S. Africa Command posture review is
being conducted with little to no coordination with the State
Department, and the rumored outcome is to call for reduced U.S. presence
and security investments in order to free up DOD resources to focus on
competition with Russia and China.64 Yet the United States still has
serious security and geopolitical interests in the continent that are
likely not reflected in traditional military-only decision-making.
Rachel Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center, warned that
[developing military-to-military security assistance programs
is]{.underline} "an [important]{.underline} relationship, one that
should be cultivated, but it is not separate from the diplomatic and
foreign policy relationships that have to be developed and take time.
[If you lose the foreign policy piece and just focus on the security
piece, **you're doing a disservice** to the larger strategic
objectives]{.underline}."65 [The siloed security assistance system leads
to **disjointed U.S. foreign policy**, **divorces security concerns**
from broader economic or diplomatic concerns, and can **end up promoting
militarized solutions**]{.underline}.

[The question of whether military aid and training programs should be
funded by the Defense Department or the State Department may seem, at
first glance, to be a subject more suited to civics textbooks than
public debate]{.underline}. [Yet the outcome of this debate will have a
**crucial bearing on how U.S. power is exercised and projected around
the world**]{.underline}. [Let's take a look at some examples from Latin
America]{.underline}. n In 2006-2007, the congressional foreign
operations subcommittees, which govern only State Department-funded
military aid, learned about killings of civilians and other human rights
violations by the Colombian army, which receives a annual military aid
package. Responding to the subcommittees' concerns, which invoked
conditions in the foreign aid law, the State Department was forced to
withhold temporarily \$110 million worth of aid and training. More
importantly, [the State Department had to ask the Colombian government
to take steps to curb killings of civilians by the army and to
increase]{.underline} so-far glacial [progress in investigating and
prosecuting members of the armed forces credibly alleged to have
committed crimes such as torture, murder, or collaborating with brutal
illegal paramilitary forces]{.underline}. Only 25% of State Department-
funded aid was subject to these conditions, so the overall aid program
was not strongly affected, but [human rights concerns played a more
prominent role in the U.S.-Colombian government dialogue]{.underline}.
[On the other hand, all military aid through the Defense Department
continued to flow]{.underline} during this time period, [and no visible
sign of any concern about human rights abuses emerged from]{.underline}
the Armed Services Committees or [Defense]{.underline} Appropriations
subcommittees, which govern the aid flowing through the Defense
Department. [Had most military aid and training flowed through the
defense bill, the U.S. government's voice on human rights would have
dropped to a whisper]{.underline}.4

#### The plan creates the perception of the US as a [military-focused]{.underline} hegemon, the counterplan promotes a more [peaceful]{.underline} [diplomatic-focused]{.underline} perception

**Withers 8**, WOLA Senior Fellow focused on human rights in Latin
America, et al (George, "Ready, Aim, Foreign Policy," WOLA,

[Why]{.underline}, one might ask, [shouldn't the military budget be the
source of U.S. military aid overseas? The short answer is that equipping
and training the world's armies is a **major foreign policy
decision**]{.underline}. For example, [The choice to train and equip
foreign militaries is perceived as a U.S. **endorsement** of those
militaries. The relative balance of economic and military aid to a
country affects perceptions about how the United States chooses to
project its power]{.underline}. Strengthening a military can affect the
balance of power within a geographic region, and within a country. [The
association of the United States with a particular military, especially
one engaged in human rights violations, affects the image of our
country. Instead of the]{.underline} regional and [diplomatic
considerations which concern the State Department, the Defense
Department's assigned mission requires it to adopt a **military focus**
on potential national security threats]{.underline}. [Military training
and aid decisions, as a significant part of foreign policy, should be
governed by the agency in charge of **foreign policy and
diplomacy**---**the State Department**]{.underline}. And they should be
overseen by the congressional committees whose jurisdiction is foreign
affairs.

[Militarization occurs when a state relies on the military to pursue

[militarized US foreign policy through its new authority to
build]{.underline} the [capacity for foreign military
forces]{.underline} to counter terrorism and support US military and

authority now given to DOD, not the State Department which is
responsible for US foreign assistance]{.underline} programs. [The
continuation of this authority]{.underline}, going on its sixth year and
already costing more than \$1.2 billion, [**shifts responsibility** away
from the State Department]{.underline}. [Secretary of Defense Gates even
warns of a "**creeping militarization**" of some aspects of American's
foreign policy when discussing the US military's increased involvement
in activities **previously done by civilian agencies**, and cautions
against an overreliance on military]{.underline} combat
[operations]{.underline}.4 [DOD involvement in foreign policy may
**undermine US foreign policy objectives**]{.underline}. [A shift in the
core functions away from the State Department may have **undesirable
effects** for several reasons]{.underline}. [First, it may **weaken the
State Department's role in implementing foreign policy**. The State
Department advances US interests in foreign countries and its authority
may be weakened if DOD is also making decisions that impact US foreign
policy. Second, it may weaken congressional oversight]{.underline},
particularly human rights protections, a large concern in many
developing countries around the world. Congress authorizes and funds
State Department-managed military assistance programs. State Department
support that goes through the regular foreign assistance budget process
is subject to conditions and closely scrutinized. In contrast, support
that goes through the defense budget may receive far less review by
foreign oversight committees. [Third]{.underline}, [it gives the
Pentagon a **greater diplomatic role** and **significant autonomy** over
support to foreign military forces]{.underline}, [which has the
potential to cause stronger military]{.underline}-to-military
[ties]{.underline} with a country **[than]{.underline}** existing
**[diplomatic ties]{.underline}**.5 [These effects may **harm US foreign
policy objectives**]{.underline}. However, DOD involvement in US foreign
assistance efforts is not without precedence.

#### Bleeding responsibilities to the DoD weakens State Department credibility

These [changes are not just theoretical]{.underline}. In December 2006,
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee noted the increasing role of U.S.
defense agencies in leading foreign policy on the ground, and issued a
stern warning in a document entitled Embassies as Command Posts in the
Anti-Terror Campaign (S. Prt. 109-52): [It has traditionally been the
military's mission to take direct action against U.S. adversaries while
the civilian agencies' mission has been to pursue non-coercive measures
through diplomacy, international information programming, and foreign
and economic assistance]{.underline}. As a result of inadequate funding
for civilian programs, however, [U.S. defense agencies are increasingly
being granted authority and funding]{.underline} to fill perceived gaps.
[Such bleeding of civilian responsibilities overseas from civilian to
military agencies risks **weakening the Secretary of State's primacy**
in setting the agenda for U.S. relations with foreign
countries]{.underline} and the Secretary of Defense's focus on war
fighting. Policy Recommendations 1. [The]{.underline} next
[administration should **reassert the State Department's control** over
foreign]{.underline} military training and [assistance
programs]{.underline} in its communication with the Congress, in
interagency discussions and, most importantly, in the budget it presents
for the State and Defense Departments.

No such transformation is possible without congressional resourcing and
executive sponsorship in the State Department. [With some changes and
investments, the State Department is well positioned to promulgate a
democratic digital agenda that is aligned with American values, and to
use investments in AI to transform its diplomatic and foreign
policymaking functions]{.underline}. When discussing AI and innovation
in government, it is common to fetishize technology and insist on its
centrality to transformation. However, [technological innovations should
come with accompanying culture change, and leaders across the department
should define and communicate the value of these innovations to the
**mission of diplomacy**]{.underline}. Skepticism towards technology is
as old as the diplomatic profession itself: Upon receiving his first
telegraph message in the 1860s, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston,
for example, exclaimed, "My God, this is the end of diplomacy!" Yet when
used properly, **[AI can empower]{.underline}** (rather than replace)
career **[diplomacy like never before]{.underline}**, [putting civilian
foreign policymakers **back into the driver's seat at home and

Stop the U.S. Pivot to Asia," *Bloomberg*,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-09/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-should-slow-not-stop-u-s-pivot-to-china)//BB>

Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal and unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine has upended this approach. Now Washington must deal with
revisionist great powers in two regions, while the Middle East also
continues to demand attention. The U.S. should continue a long-term
shift to Asia, but in a way that better balances resources and
engagements across the three strategic theaters. Paradoxically, Putin's
aggression demonstrates how this should be done. First, policy makers
should absorb the enduring strategic logic behind a pivot to Asia. China
combines the greatest capability and will to upend the international
order. The Indo-Pacific represents the primary, but not the only,
regional theater in which U.S.-China competition takes place. But a
sustainable pivot to Asia is possible only in the absence of serious
national security crises in Europe and the Middle East. No U.S.
president will ignore a Russian-induced emergency in Europe, a major
terrorist threat, or a nuclear and/or hegemonic Iran. America remains a
global and not a regional power. [The central challenge is allocating
national security resources **across**]{.underline} all three
**[regions]{.underline}**, [without]{.underline} either weakening vital
U.S. national interests in one or [imagining that **America can do
everything, everywhere**]{.underline}. [That problem is **most acute in
the military sphere**]{.underline}. An increase in defense spending will
be required, but how that money is spent is equally important. In the
Middle East, for example, regular troops should relieve the burden
placed on elite special operations forces in security cooperation
missions. Washington should move expensive military equipment --- like
F-35 and F-22 aircraft --- to the two arenas of great-power competition,
employing less-capable aircraft, including unmanned systems, for
counterterrorism missions. A combination of regional diplomacy and
continued deterrence could limit Iran\'s regional ambitions, freeing up
some of the forces that have deployed to the Middle East in recent years
to deter a potential Iran threat. In Europe, the U.S. should build on
its allies' newfound willingness to enhance their military capabilities
and deter further Russian aggression. This should involve moving
American troops currently stationed in Europe further east, to countries
such as Poland, Romania and the Baltics. Washington should also
capitalize on the recent increase in intelligence sharing -- including
to NATO non-members -- by eliminating barriers to sharing defense
technology with allies newly willing to invest. For the Indo-Pacific,
Washington should reserve the lion\'s share of military resources that
matter most, including smaller naval surface ships, long-range missiles
and next-generation fighter aircraft. Building on efforts like the Aukus
security arrangement with Australia and the U.K. would give regional
allies more leverage to strengthen their own defense, helping them
better deter China and serve as the frontline in daily competition with
it. **[Diplomatic resources are less zero-sum than military
power]{.underline}**, and economic engagement less still. [Intense
diplomatic work in Europe]{.underline} and the Middle East [could
**bolster the coalitions** in each that are willing and able to deal
with threats there, and potentially **reduce some of the threats
themselves**]{.underline}. Washington should couple this with an
affirmative economic agenda, beginning with re-entry to or renegotiation
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.

**Haass 20**, President of the Council on Foreign Relations (Richard,
"Revitalizing the State Department and American Diplomacy," *Council
Special Report* No. 89)//BB

[Diplomacy is a critical tool in a nation's foreign policy tool kit,
enabling a country to leverage its power and bring it to bear on
critical international issues]{.underline}. [The United States' most
enduring advantage over its rivals is]{.underline} its unprecedented
network of [alliances, and]{.underline} through consultations officials
and **[diplomats maintain these relationships and enlist allies in
common causes]{.underline}**. [Those representing the government are
tasked to negotiate treaties, dealing with issues from arms control to
climate change, and advance U.S. interests in international
organizations. They are the face of America overseas]{.underline},
representing the country around the world and providing critical
services to Americans traveling abroad. [Too often, however, **diplomacy
is neglected**]{.underline}. Sometimes serious diplomacy is sidelined in
favor of unrealistic calls for regime change or demands that the other
party cannot reasonably be expected to meet. A related problem, one
highlighted by former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, is that
American foreign policy has become over-militarized, with the military
asked to perform missions such as nation-building that it was never
intended to. While the Department of Defense receives record
appropriations, the Department of State struggles to have its
comparatively small budget approved. In this valuable and timely Council
Special Report, Jon Finer, an adjunct senior fellow for U.S. foreign
policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Uzra S. Zeya, the CEO
and president of the Alliance for Peacebuilding, propose policies for
revitalizing the State Department and American diplomacy. They rightly
assess that the Department of State "has fallen into a deep and
sustained period of crisis." They point out that the State Department is
currently enduring turbulence but, equally important, that many of its
problems are deep-seated and predate the Donald J. Trump administration.
They provide an array of policy proposals they believe the State
Department can and should implement to restore American diplomacy. The
list of proposals is long, and few readers will agree with all of them.
In some cases what is put forward will likely meet with bureaucratic or
congressional resistance. What is clear and inarguable, though, is that
[U.S. foreign policy needs to better recognize and reflect the unique
and valuable contributions of **diplomacy**]{.underline}. The State
Department needs to rethink its organization along with the role of
embassies and those who serve in them, attract individuals with more
diverse backgrounds, skill sets, and experience, and reimagine career
paths and training opportunities. The goal should be to attract the best
and brightest to the State Department, be it for a career or a stint,
and to invest in them so that those designing and carrying out American
foreign policy have the creativity and professionalism required to meet
the challenges and opportunities of a twenty-first-century world. All of
which is to say that **[revitalizing the State Department should be a
priority]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** next
**[administration]{.underline}** regardless of who occupies the Oval
Office.

#### Managing China's rise demands a shift to [non-military]{.underline} diplomatic leadership

**Burns 20**, William Burns, contributing writer at The Atlantic, the

[A]{.underline} third [vital priority is]{.underline} our greatest
geopolitical challenge: [managing competition with China]{.underline}.
In recent decades, undisciplined thinking led us to assume too much
about the benefits of engaging with China. Today, undisciplined thinking
of a different sort is causing us to assume too much about the
feasibility of decoupling and containment---and about the inevitability
of confrontation. [Our tendency]{.underline}, as it was during the
height of the Cold War, [is to]{.underline} overhype the threat,
over-prove our hawkish bona fides, [**over-militarize our approach**,
and reduce the political and diplomatic space required to manage
great-power competition]{.underline}. Preventing China's rise is beyond
America's capacity, and our economies are too entangled to decouple.
[The U.S. can]{.underline}, however, [shape the environment into which
China rises]{.underline}, taking advantage of the web of allies and
partners across the Indo-Pacific---from Japan and South Korea to a
rising India---who worry about China's ascendance. [That will require
working]{.underline} with them---and engaging Chinese leadership
directly---[to]{.underline} bound rivalry with Beijing, define the terms
for coexistence, [prevent competition from becoming a collision, and
preserve space for cooperation on global challenges]{.underline}.
Everything rides on developing a strategy that reinforces---rather than
trades against---these three interrelated priorities. China, obviously,
is not America's only geopolitical challenge, just by far the most
important. [We cannot ignore]{.underline} other regions where we have
enduring interests: [Europe]{.underline} remains a crucial partner, and
North America our natural strategic home base, despite the current
administration's rare diplomatic feat of alienating the Canadians. Nor
can we ignore the inevitable crises at home and abroad that so often
derail the neatest of strategies. [Armed with a clear sense of
priorities, the next administration will have to reinvent]{.underline}
U.S. alliances and [partnerships]{.underline} and make some hard---and
overdue---choices about America's tools and terms of engagement around
the world. And [it'll have to act with the discipline that so often
eluded the U.S. during its lazy post--Cold War dominance]{.underline}.
[If "America First" is again consigned to the scrap heap, we'll still
have demons to exorcise]{.underline}---our hubris, our imperiousness,
our indiscipline, our intolerance, our inattention to our domestic
health, and **[our fetish for military tools and disregard for
diplomacy]{.underline}**. But we'll also still have a chance to summon
our most exceptional national trait: our capacity for self-repair. And
we'll still have a chance to shape our future, before it gets shaped for
us by other players and forces.

### !\-\--Democracy

#### Diplomatic credibility is key to democracy

**Burns 20**, Goodman Family professor of the practice of diplomacy and

(Nicholas, "The Indispensable Power," *Harvard Magazine*,

MY EXPERIENCE in government has also taught me that [diplomacy
is]{.underline} most **[effective]{.underline}** when it is cemented in
American values and the rule of law. [That should lead us to stand up
for]{.underline} democracy when it is threatened in [NATO-allied
countries]{.underline} such as Turkey and Hungary, and when human rights
are assaulted in Russia and China. When I interviewed former Secretary
of Defense Jim Mattis a few months ago in Washington, he pointed to this
foundational American strength. The United States exercises two great
powers in the world, he said. The first is the "power of intimidation,"
through our first-class military. But America has a second and more
important power---the "power of inspiration" to the rest of the world,
reflecting our nation's democratic founding. A Harvard audience heard a
variation of this theme from Winston Churchill in Memorial Hall on
September 6, 1943, when he received an honorary doctorate of laws from
President James B. Conant. In a lyrical speech entitled, "The Gift of a
Common Tongue," Churchill urged his audience of deans, professors, and
dignitaries---and in later remarks in nearby Tercentenary Theatre, more
than 6,000 cadets training to go to war---to reject isolationism and
accept the mantle of world leadership. At a time when the United States
had surpassed the British empire as the most powerful global leader,
Churchill's speech was a metaphorical handing of a baton to the young
Americans on the front lines of World War II. "The price of greatness is
responsibility," he said. "One cannot rise to be in many ways the
leading community in the civilized world without being involved in its
problems, without being convulsed by its agonies and inspired by its
causes." Churchill's words at Harvard then are as vital and relevant to
Americans today. [Americans can author a better, more just, and peaceful
era if we recall our **responsibility to lead**]{.underline} and to be a
force, **[through diplomacy]{.underline}**, **[for democratic
values]{.underline}** [in an ever more complex and dangerous
world]{.underline}.

Instead of solely relying on military might, [the U.S. needs to expand

Burns was delivering the 2021 Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, Jr. Lecture on

However, [reducing the United States' emphasis on a values-driven
foreign policy is wrong, and contrary to the strategic interests of the
United States]{.underline}. **[Democracy promotion]{.underline}** [in
particular serves a **key role in safeguarding U.S.
interests**]{.underline} [and promoting global, long-term growth in ways
fundamentally compatible with U.S. strategic interests.]{.underline}
After all, **[democracies protect private property]{.underline}** [in
important ways, **invest in public goods**]{.underline}, [are more
politically stable, make for **more dependable allies**]{.underline},
[and empirically **do not go to war with one another**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, a world full of democratic governments is safer, more
prosperous, and more stable --- all states of being that the United
States has an interest in promoting.

[Democracy guarantees that the public has a stake in its own
institutions and government, which leads to **investor confidence and
growth**. Since elected politicians are accountable to property owners
and are held in check by an independent judiciary, democracies tend to
have better mechanisms for **protecting private property**]{.underline}
[than their autocratic counterparts. This makes democracies a
**particularly attractive type of country for investors** --- both
public and private --- because checks and balances make it difficult for
the state to nationalize industries]{.underline}. Further, [private
property rights protected by the legal system **encourage
entrepreneurship and small business development**]{.underline}, [both of
which are **key to a growing and modernizing economy**]{.underline}. As
a result, [democracies tend to be wealthier and more economically stable
than their autocratic counterparts.]{.underline} This is fundamentally
in the interest of the United States in that both private and public
investors have an interest in seeing returns on their investments,
[thereby potentially making **countries less willing to go to war if
that would require severing economic ties**]{.underline}. Democratic
institutions ensure that citizens with both economic and political power
are heard.

[Democracies also **invest in public goods at much higher rates than
autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [Because politicians must cater
to the median voter, they **approve policies that invest in public
education and healthcare**]{.underline}, [both of which promote
long-term growth and development]{.underline}. Public education invests
in a country's human capital, setting the stage for long-term
innovation, adaptability, and advancement. [Public healthcare,
meanwhile, has been shown to **increase overall societal productivity**
and well-being as people take fewer sick days, citizens are able to
afford their healthcare without going bankrupt, and ultimately, the
overall **costs of healthcare are driven down** as citizens become
healthier]{.underline}. Productive, innovative societies are also better
for the United States --- [innovation around the world improves global
quality of life, results in more educational and vocational
opportunities for Americans]{.underline} (both because other
universities and jobs become more attractive to Americans who want to go
abroad and because potential immigrants are more likely to want to stay
in their own country, opening up opportunities for U.S. citizens at
home), [and may reduce friction between countries over resources and
labor]{.underline}.

[Democracies are also generally more politically stable because regular
election cycles ensure an established process for the habitual and
peaceful removal of leaders from power.]{.underline} [Elections ensure
the non-violent transition of power and reduce the need for mass
protest, rioting, and revolution --- which **makes countries more
politically stable**]{.underline}. Further, when citizens are granted
rights and protections from government abuse, enforced by an independent
judiciary, they have fewer grievances against the government and are
thus less able to mobilize large numbers of people to violently
overthrow the regime. [Revolution, while not always violent, often leads
to political instability, challenges to growth, **increased incentives
for diversionary war and conflict**, and oftentimes civil
war]{.underline}. The externalities of civil war and international
conflict then put pressure on the United States to intervene, protect
human rights, and otherwise expend resources on other countries' issues.
[Further, civil wars are highly destructive to institutions, human
capital, and resources, and can have significant security spillover
effects, increasing global risk of political instability and **violent
extremism**]{.underline}.

[This political stability, in addition to institutional checks and
balances, makes **democracies better international partners and allies
in the long-term**]{.underline}. Treaties ratified by multiple branches
of government are more durable than executive agreements signed by a
single leader who may be replaced within a short period of time. [While
democracies may be more reluctant to commit to alliances and formal
security pacts, once a party to them, they are more dependable than
other states with concentrated power at the executive
level]{.underline}. **[These kind of durable commitments are of interest
to the United States as it seeks to preserve the liberal world
order]{.underline}**; [it is far more effective to ally with partners
whose institutions make withdrawal from the alliance
costly]{.underline}.

Finally, [it has been empirically observed that **democracies do not go
to war with one another**]{.underline}. While there is a robust debate
around the exact nature of the so-called "democratic peace," it [appears
that there are qualities particular to democracies that make war between
them particularly unlikely: a **dovish public constrains leaders'
ability to wage war**]{.underline}, [competitive elections and a free
press make it **easier to credibly communicate resolve to potential
adversaries**]{.underline}, [consolidated democracies tend to be **more
wealthy and economically interdependent**]{.underline}, [like-minded
people are more hesitant to wage war against one another, and so
on]{.underline}. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, however, a [world
of democracies is inherently safer, more prosperous, and less likely to
initiate a war against the United States --- a key factor in protecting
American security and interests]{.underline}.

#### Leading with diplomacy is key to [all facets]{.underline} of US power

One is that [American leadership and engagement matter. We're hearing
this now from our friends. They're glad we're back. Whether we like it
or not, the world does not organize itself. When the U.S. pulls
back]{.underline}, one of two things is likely to happen: [either
another country tries to take our place, but not in a way that advances
our interests and values; or, maybe just as bad, no one steps up, and
then we get chaos and all the dangers it creates]{.underline}. Either
way, [that's not good]{.underline} for America. Another enduring
principle is that [we need countries to cooperate, now more than
ever]{.underline}. [Not a single global challenge that affects your
lives can be met by any one nation acting alone]{.underline} -- not even
one as powerful as the United States. And there is no wall high enough
or strong enough to hold back the changes transforming our world. That's
where the institution I'm privileged to lead comes in. **[It's the role
of the State Department]{.underline}** -- [and America's
**diplomats**]{.underline} and development workers -- [to engage around
the world and build that cooperation]{.underline}. President [Biden has
pledged to **lead with diplomacy**]{.underline} because it's the best
way to deal with today's challenges. At the same time, we'll make sure
that we continue to have the world's most powerful armed forces. Our
ability to be effective diplomats depends in no small measure on the
strength of our military. And [in everything we do, we'll]{.underline}
look [not only]{.underline} to [make progress on short-term problems,
but also]{.underline} to [address]{.underline} their [**root causes**
and lay the groundwork for our **long-term strength**]{.underline}. As
the President says, to not only build back, but build back better.

Having vanquished both Nazism and Communism in the space of a lifetime,
American policymakers were all too eager to accept Francis Fukuyama's
declaration that history was over, even if they interpreted in different
ways the license this gave them to remake the world. From Bill Clinton's
"democratic enlargement," through George W. Bush's freedom agenda, to
Barack Obama's retreats, we have been too willing to believe that the
era of great power politics is over. [Our optimism encouraged our
interventions and excused our retreats]{.underline}. But **[geopolitical
competition has not disappeared]{.underline}**. **[Nor have our
adversaries]{.underline}**. [The world is now less
stable]{.underline}---and above all, less safe for American
interests---[than it was in 1991]{.underline}. [And disorder is rising
in **Europe**]{.underline}, in [the **Middle East**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} in **[Asia]{.underline}**. Today, nearly a generation
after the collapse of Soviet Communism and over fifteen years after the
9/11 attacks, it is undeniable that [Europe is at greater
risk]{.underline}, [the Gulf is more war-torn]{.underline}, [and the
Pacific less secure than]{.underline} they were eight or [eighteen
years]{.underline} [ago]{.underline}. We must arrest [these
trends]{.underline}, which [threaten the central purpose of American
foreign policy]{.underline}. The fact that they also threaten the
"liberal international order" that many claim has characterized part of
the world in the postwar era is merely an incidental fact, for it is our
efforts to defend our interests that played the central role in defining
that order. Today, [focusing on the order]{.underline}, not U.S.
interests, merely perpetuates a central fallacy of post--Cold War
foreign policy: it [emphasizes the waterwheel]{.underline}, not the
water that makes it move. We are committed to a leading, though not
dominating, American position in the world. But we also believe [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has **[dangerously
neglected]{.underline}** to [respect the limits on its vital role in the
world]{.underline}. To recognize a world increasingly in disorder is
obviously not to assert that all disorder threatens, or has the
potential to threaten, American interests. Just as importantly, we
recognize that we cannot live by postmortem. An obsessive focus on the
past---above all, on the Iraq war---risks paralyzing us today. Much like
the post--Vietnam War era, foreign policy is refracted through the prism
of Iraq and Afghanistan, and those on both sides who fought the
bureaucratic battles of fifteen years ago continue to be shaped by the
experience. [It is time to move on]{.underline}, however, [even as part
of the challenge ahead remains responding to the threats the wars were
designed to eliminate]{.underline}. Constructive conservative ideas will
come from leaders, and a generation, less personally fixated on 2003, or
on the post-1989 world, for that matter. If we are to understand what we
must do in the world, we must return to the realism of the American
political tradition, in which, as Washington put it, our interests are
guided by justice. Securing American Freedom To recover that tradition,
we should think again about the purpose of American foreign policy. Yes,
it is to preserve the sovereign and independent American union. Yes, it
is to protect our homeland. And yes, it is to keep us prosperous and at
peace. But these are not ends in themselves. They exist to allow
Americans, with due regard for the just laws of others when abroad, to
be free---free to preach, to trade, to study, to help, to work, whether
overseas or at home. That is how we conserve free America: by acting to
make sure that individual Americans are free to live their own lives.
The true purpose of U.S. foreign policy is to protect and promote the
freedom of individual Americans, who by their own actions are remaking
our world. We will enjoy that individual freedom more fully the more
nations embrace the principles of democratic sovereignty on which our
own union was founded. A world of unfree nations, a world divided into
spheres of influence controlled by the hostile or the unfree, would be a
world in which the freedom of Americans would be curtailed or, at worst,
would exist only on the sufferance of others. But freedom for the world
begins with freedom for America. The first, irreducible American
interest is the preservation of the sovereignty of the United States and
the political order of republican government under the Constitution. If
we lose those, our other interests will be irrelevant, because we will
not have the command of our own fortunes. No regime or idea that seeks
to traduce the sovereignty of democratic nations is our friend, because
our purposes cannot be realized in a world defined by the unfree. And we
should remember one more thing: states that reject democratic
sovereignty are implicitly rejecting our legitimacy. Indeed, our
challengers today---just as in 1776, or 1917, or 1941, or 1950---are
enemies of the sovereign democracies. In this most fundamental respect,
nothing has changed: from the American Revolution to today, our
challengers have always been imperialists, eager to claim the right to
rule without the democratic consent of the governed. We have faced
empires of power, of race, of class, and of religion---but empire, and
the imperial struggle for power, is the constant. The problem is not
that there are other great powers in the world with interests of their
own. It is inevitable that great powers will not accept neighbors who
threaten them; what is not acceptable is for great powers to interpret a
desire for independence and good relations with other nations as
inherently threatening. To do this is to claim the right to an imperial
sphere that is based on a rejection of national sovereignty. The United
States rejected one such claim in 1776. It has rejected many other,
similar claims in the succeeding centuries. The sovereign democratic
republic is not merely the freest form of government ever devised. It
also defines the international system into which the United States was
born, and on which its system of government is based. But today,
supranationalists contemn the nation-state and muse, in the words of the
president of the European Commission, that "borders were the worst
invention ever." Others are more malignant: Russia seeks to change
borders, or render them meaningless, in order to suborn and dominate its
neighbors; China seeks to impose an acceptance of its national interests
on its neighbors; and Iran is making its dream of regional dominance
into a reality---with the aid of Russia and the U.S.-brokered Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action. Worst of all, ISIS and al-Qaeda wish to
eradicate the sovereign state and replace it with a religious empire. We
need not be afraid of our competitors---or, indeed, of our enemies.
However, we do need to acknowledge that that is what they are, to take
them seriously, and to admit that they want a world organized in ways
that are fundamentally antithetical to our principles. At times, it may
be possible to find common interests with some of them. But we should
entertain no illusions. An example from the past makes the point: We
were not wrong to cooperate with Stalin to defeat Hitler. But we were
wrong to delude ourselves by calling him Uncle Joe. The Challenges to
and Importance of Our Alliances As Americans, we should know what it is
to live in a tough, competitive world, because it was the world our
nation was born into. That world endures, and no amount of post--Cold
War fantasizing will make it disappear. From the start, we made our way
in that world thanks to our alliances---for it was a military alliance
with France that helped us win our independence. Provided that we retain
the power to decide if we will fight---and we do---our alliances today
raise no questions of principle. After all, we claimed the right to
contract alliances in the Declaration of Independence itself. Nor are
our alliances an act of charity. First and foremost, they have mostly
been made with strategically important countries, traditionally those
that have been able to help uphold order in their regions. Today, there
is little disagreement in America that our allies should pay more, so as
to do more. Every president since Eisenhower has asked for that, and
with rare exceptions---such as Britain under Margaret Thatcher---they
have asked in vain. We cannot sustain our alliances unless the American
people believe that every member nation is making a fair contribution.
But the problem is not that our allies are free riding on us, for when
we cut our defenses, they do not increase theirs. It is that the
history, culture, and politics of our allies now make them unwilling to
accept that military strength is vital to diplomacy and deterrence
alike. They have profound incentives to minimize, dismiss, and ignore
threats---and hence not to spend enough on defense. For our European
allies and Japan, the demands of the social welfare state, mixed with an
understandably lingering horror at the memories of war, have combined
over decades to make unpalatable most discussion of hard power and the
need for martial readiness. The fear that returning to the world of
machtpolitik will put at risk all they have built since 1945 is
understandable, if unsuited to the current geopolitical environment. Yet
we should still appreciate what we have in our allies. Tens of thousands
of brave Americans gave their lives to create the alliances we have
today. The costs we pay now are maintenance expenses on the peace they
won. Of course, our allies benefit from this. But precisely because we
are on top, we benefit most from the world as it is today, even if our
complacency sometimes allows others to take advantage of the stability
we created for their own malignant purposes. Our democratic allies, who
wish---a little too hard---only to live in peace, feel the same way
about the status quo. That does not mean we need to excuse the failings
of our allies, indulge their supranational fantasies, outsource the
defense of our interests to them, or allow them to completely outsource
theirs to us. Instead, we need to have just as much realism about our
allies as we have about our enemies. That means recognizing that what
our allies lack is the luck that we in the United States enjoy.
[We]{.underline} are fortunate to [have Canada and Mexico as
neighbors]{.underline}; [our allies]{.underline}, unfortunately, [are
next door to China, Russia]{.underline}, autocrats, and Islamists. Given
our good fortune, and our strength, it is inevitable that [we are the
ones who are forward deployed]{.underline}, [because]{.underline}
[we]{.underline} are the ones who [have the **geopolitical freedom** to
help]{.underline}. But we should remember that our deployments defend
our place in the world---and the ability of Americans to be free in
it---just as much as they defend our allies. [Without our close
alliances and the forward yet benign deployment of our
forces]{.underline}, [we would look out onto an]{.underline}
**[unwelcoming Middle East]{.underline}** [and an **increasingly
troubled Asia**]{.underline}, where Americans would be seen simply as
outsiders, not as welcome partners by some. Moreover, the
[allies]{.underline} we have, such as the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan,
and South Korea, [are part of a global network of liberal societies and
economies that dynamically interact and add immeasurably to global
wealth]{.underline}, not least back in the United States. We cannot
avoid becoming involved merely by retreating from our allies.
[American]{.underline} indifference or **[perceived weakness can
engender instability]{.underline}** that is not in our interests, and
**[which forces us to consider more risky forms of
involvement]{.underline}**. For example, [China's buildup of forces in
the South China Sea]{.underline}, [and its efforts to dominate strategic
waterways]{.underline} and raise doubts about future freedom of
navigation, [occurred]{.underline} in part [due to its perception that
America's lack of active military alliances in Southeast Asia would make
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [unable to counter its
expansion]{.underline}. To China, America is an interloper in areas it
has traditionally dominated and considered part of its sphere of
influence; thus, [it believed that U.S. naval and air
forces]{.underline} (which currently can only be transiently present in
Southeast Asia), [were a **paper tiger**]{.underline} [and could be
intimidated into eventual withdrawal]{.underline}.
[Washington]{.underline}, indeed, has [struggled]{.underline} with
trying [to prove its credibility in keeping open vital sea lanes in the
South China Sea]{.underline}, without having bases from which it can
project a regular presence. That is why [offshore balancing]{.underline}
is an attractive concept in theory; [in the real world]{.underline}, it
[would be all offshore and no balancing]{.underline}, as our
[allies]{.underline} and others [would **doubt our
commitment**]{.underline} to play a meaningful role during a crisis,
[and as the costs of]{.underline} "[fighting our way back
in]{.underline}" [would be **politically unacceptable** at
home]{.underline}. Our alliances also help us in another way. Without
us, our [smaller]{.underline} yet strategic [allies would be unable to
defend themselves]{.underline}, and our larger
ones---[Japan]{.underline}, [Germany]{.underline}, [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, [and South Korea]{.underline}, to name
four---[would have to fend for themselves]{.underline}. [The cheapest
way to do that would be to **acquire nuclear weapons**]{.underline},
[which could lead to a **cascade of nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}. The [resulting regional environments would
be tense and **unstable**]{.underline}, [and future crises could well
**become violent**]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} therefore [need to
reassure our friends as we deter our enemies]{.underline}---[for the
sake of **greater stability** that reduces the chances of a **major
conflagration** in strategic areas **drawing in American
forces**]{.underline}. Happily, [our alliances]{.underline}, [backed by
our strength]{.underline}, [are a means for us to do both at
once]{.underline}. Part of the answer to the problems we face with our
allies is for the free world to stop doing the things that alienate its
publics and make it vulnerable to autocratic blandishments. Above all,
we must stop centralizing power in the hands of unaccountable experts,
an approach that, as the EU is belatedly discovering, only makes
rejecting democracy more appealing. Another part of the answer is for
the United States to make clear what side it is on. Starry-eyed "resets"
or "open hands" towards aggressive, repressive regimes only confuse
those who wish to rally beneath a flag of freedom and liberalism. Trying
to win over the whole world risks losing those already on our side.
Finally, our first choice should always be to deter trouble where it
matters most, not to fight it: the example of Western Europe after 1945
is proof of the value of resolutely holding the line. Thus, [the danger
in this competitive world]{.underline} is not that we will be too
strong. It [is our **weakness**]{.underline}, not our strength, [that is
provocative]{.underline}, [because American weakness makes our allies
fearful and **encourages our competitors to take chances**]{.underline}.
[Providing strong defenses is both necessary for peace and a charge laid
upon Congress by the Constitution]{.underline}. This charge must be
fulfilled. A Realist Approach to Expeditionary Power Yet America's
geostrategic position means that we will usually act far from our
shores, not least when we employ military power. [Being primarily an
expeditionary nation]{.underline} is not a limitation: it [is a strength
that allows us the **flexibility**]{.underline} [to intervene in ways
that respect the limits on our power]{.underline}. Going forward, we
must emphasize our expeditionary nature, while remaining willing to base
U.S. forces in strategic areas for reassurance and insurance purposes.
This means, above all, that [we must invest in **precision
airpower**]{.underline} [to inflict **substantial damage**,]{.underline}
[a **strong navy**]{.underline} [to project power while maintaining
freedom of the seas]{.underline}, [credible land combat power to deter
adversaries who threaten our allies]{.underline}, [and homeland
defense]{.underline}---[including]{.underline} the most advanced
[missile defenses]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [cyber
defenses]{.underline}. We face many perils, but in many cases, if we act
rightly, time is on our side. The only thing that could truly hurt the
United States in a way that would change us instantaneously and forever
is a WMD attack. We must prevent such a catastrophe by any means
necessary. But in defending ourselves, [we must not be led into rash
actions]{.underline}. President Trump is correct that our goal of peace
is best achieved by a "disciplined, deliberate, and consistent foreign
policy" backed by a strong America that understands that "caution and
restraint are really truly signs of strength." [The restraint
that]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline} [and]{.underline} many
of his [liberal opponents praise means that the era of indiscriminate
interventions]{.underline}, [especially in pursuit of humanitarian
objectives or to teach foreigners to elect good men]{.underline}, [is
over]{.underline}. [This means privileging the interests of the American
nation]{.underline}---and its people---over the larger, though fictive,
international community. The lessons of World War II and the Cold War
were too easily transmuted into the argument that our security policies
must always be undergirded by morality. Today, we place more emphasis on
the unquestioned evil of both Nazism and Communism than on the
existential threat their power posed to Western civilization. It follows
that for defenders of the supposed "liberal international order," U.S.
involvement in humanitarian crises or efforts at nation-building in
inhospitable climates becomes the true measure of the legitimacy and
wisdom of our foreign policy. When liberal states reveal their hypocrisy
by not intervening in such crises, this delegitimizes them, and thereby
makes it harder to advance arguments based on real national interests.
The greatest risk of all is that, when do-gooding dominates policy, the
American people are more likely to withdraw their support for defending
our overseas interests. The path to a sustainable and strong U.S. role
in the world does not rest in valorizing the "rules-based international
order": it rests in understanding the value and the limits of our power.
Believe what you will about Iraq or Syria. The fact is that [there is
**no public support** for]{.underline} such [interventions
today]{.underline}. [It would be an act of folly to press for actions
that]{.underline}, for [lack of that support]{.underline}, [cannot be
followed through to victory]{.underline}. It must be an ironclad rule
for the United States that we do not start a fight we do not intend to
finish. But this does not mean we give up the competitive struggle.
Instead, we must find new ways to wage it. While we should not use our
national strength to uphold a fictive international community, we should
recognize that our interests rest in advancing towards a freer world.
Thus, our goal has not changed: it is to help defend, and, where
possible, to advance prudently towards a world built on sovereign
democracies in which Americans can be safe and free. And the American
constitutional order---if we keep faith with it---has great long-run
strengths, which we can use in this struggle; it imposes limits on
centralized power and the competition it encourages. Principle and
prudence alike tell us that we must play the long game. Our method
should not be imposed regime change, except in cases of vital national
need: it should be the creation of leverage, the use of pressure, and
the imposition of costs to constrain our opponents. It is a great
mistake to believe that we must always meet our adversaries head on: for
example, the U.S. development of hydraulic fracturing, which reduces
world oil prices and thus damages the Russian economy, imposes costs on
Russia and decreases its strategic influence. Our goal should be to seek
out and use such indirect methods to encourage the buildup of opposing
forces within other systems, and---as Ronald Reagan did---to build
opportunities for negotiations to be conducted on our terms, not theirs.
And at times, in part with the aid of this strategy, change may come in
another way, preferably through peaceful transitions that reflect a
change in culture, and not just a struggle for power. Such a failure to
change the culture is why there was no revolution after the collapse of
the Soviet Union, but rather the more efficient reorganization of power
by a repressive clique. Yet autocracies are brittle: eventually they
crack, especially when the people living under them seek to emulate more
successful democracies. That is the great fear of the Chinese Communist
Party and the reason why it is repressing civil society today. We can
win this struggle not primarily through force of arms, but through
persistence and flexibility, backed by strength and the preservation of
our national power. [The greatest strategic challenge we face today
is]{.underline} not the strength of our main adversaries: it is [the
weakness of their neighbors]{.underline}, be they the smaller and
still-developing nations of Southeast Asia [vis-à-vis
China]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the [economically challenged and
militarily weak nations of Europe facing Russia]{.underline}. By various
means---[hybrid war]{.underline}, [political subversion]{.underline},
[or fear induced by threats]{.underline}---[these nations]{.underline},
some of them our allies, [are being suborned]{.underline} in ways that
we find hard to combat and are reluctant even to acknowledge. [A world
divided up into **spheres of influence**]{.underline}, [largely
controlled by our adversaries]{.underline}, [would be **neither stable
nor free**]{.underline}. While we cannot prevent powerful nations from
having spheres of particular interest, [it is not in our interest to
allow them to exercise **neo-imperial control** over their
neighbors]{.underline}. We are by instinct and by interest opposed to
empires. [If illiberal states dominate vital regions]{.underline}, such
as [East Asia or]{.underline} [Central Europe]{.underline}, [the result
will not be good for the freedom of Americans in the world]{.underline},
or the idea of republican self-government, or for our relative power. It
would thus be profoundly antithetical to the true purpose of our foreign
policy.

### !\-\--Counter-Terrorism

#### Diplomatic leadership is vital to effective counter-terrorism

[Engage in savvy diplomacy]{.underline} and holistic interagency
policymaking. Even a cursory look at the terrorist hot spots of the past
two decades reveals that [terrorist threats tend to emanate from complex
environments]{.underline}. Underlying conditions typically include
national or local government authorities struggling to provide basic
services or to exert control over their territory, as well as deeper
fragility issues, and terrorist groups exploit existing tribal, ethnic,
or religious conflicts. [Addressing terrorist threats]{.underline} in
places like Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, or Somalia
[requires]{.underline} not just establishing effective counterterrorism
programming but engaging in [savvy diplomacy to navigate both the
political forces within each country as well as the outside forces
trying to shape internal dynamics]{.underline}. And it requires an
integrated foreign policymaking process that harnesses capabilities from
across the U.S. government to address both the terrorist threat and the
underlying issues. Yet, too often during the past two decades,
counterterrorism has been treated as a standalone issue, with policy
made in a separate set of meetings, and with key officials, especially
those with development or deep regional expertise, absent from the
table. To be sure, there are times when counterterrorism policymaking
involves sensitive issues and limited participants -- the bin Laden
raid, for example. But in most cases, [addressing a terrorist threat
requires thinking **holistically** about the underlying
problems]{.underline} and the tools available to neutralize the
immediate threat, fortify partners against future threats, and develop
longer-term programming to address the drivers of violent extremism.
[It]{.underline} also [requires]{.underline} seasoned
**[diplomats]{.underline}** who can navigate inside the country and
externally. The Obama administration's approach to the counter-ISIS
campaign -- at least after the group swept across northern Iraq in its
shocking initial assaults -- provides a good example of what integrated
policymaking and savvy diplomacy can look like in action.
Counterterrorism and regional policy officials at the National Security
Council jointly chaired policymaking meetings focused on bringing a
range of resources to bear in the campaign and navigating tricky
geopolitical issues regarding Iran, the Kurds, Turkey, Syria, and
Russia. A dedicated special presidential envoy traveled the globe
building an unprecedented coalition to support a range of civilian and
military efforts. Top-notch diplomatic teams in the region successfully
navigated Iranian anxiety over U.S. operations, Turkish concerns over
U.S. work with the Kurds, and potential Syrian pushback on U.S.
operations in northeastern Syria. We saw what happened when this careful
approach was abandoned in the Trump administration. Tensions spiked with
Iran, Trump assented to a Turkish military offensive that betrayed our
Kurdish partners, U.S. forces had near misses with Russian forces, and
the Syrian regime began to extend its murderous reach into Eastern
Syria. The U.S. military also made advances against ISIS in the past
four years, but without the right mix of civilian expertise and savvy
diplomacy, those gains may well prove unsustainable. Further, while this
piece primarily focuses on approaches to jihadist terrorism, smart
[diplomacy will be just as important as the United States responds to a
rising wave of right-wing terrorism, often enabled by countries like
Russia]{.underline}. Overall, [integrated policymaking and **savvy
diplomacy**, both in response to specific terrorist groups and as part
of forging a renewed approach to multilateral counterterrorism, will
only be more important going forward]{.underline}, [as the
administration]{.underline} draws down the "forever wars" and [refocuses
on great power competition]{.underline}. With likely less focus on
counterterrorism at the National Security Council than in the Obama
administration, **[an empowered State Department will need to
proactively lead]{.underline}**. It will need to develop policies and
programs [to]{.underline} aid countries facing terrorist threats,
[sustain steady multinational efforts to address terrorism]{.underline},
and work directly with the Defense Department to ensure military
operations complement diplomatic strategies.

#### Overly militarized foreign policy fails to solve terrorism\-\--State Department leadership is key

[There are]{.underline}, of course, [many]{.underline} other [things
that the State Department can do to promote civilian approaches to
counterterrorism]{.underline}. For example, [its foreign terrorist
designations, work on sanctions, efforts to prevent the flows of foreign
fighters and repatriate them, coordination with homeland security
entities, and other functions are all critical]{.underline}. But
[addressing]{.underline} the bigger [changes]{.underline} described
above [would be first steps toward **putting diplomacy** and aid **at
the center** of U.S. counterterrorism policy. After nearly two decades
of militarized approaches to counterterrorism, the United States may
finally have the political will, leadership, and resources to fulfill
that vision]{.underline}.

#### Nuclear terror leads to extinction

To an increasing extent, [people are congregating in the world's great
urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million
individuals]{.underline}. At the same time, [advanced technology has
designed nuclear explosives of such small size they can be easily
transported in a car]{.underline}, small plane or boat [to the heart of
a city]{.underline}. We demonstrate here that [a single detonation in
the 15 kiloton range can produce urban fatalities approaching one
million]{.underline} in some cases, [and casualties exceeding one
million]{.underline}. Thousands of small weapons still exist in the
arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and there are at least six other
countries with substantial nuclear weapons inventories. In all,
thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts of highly enriched
uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives. A conflict between
any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with yields of 15 kt has
the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of the Second World
War. Moreover, [even a single surface nuclear explosion]{.underline}, or
an air burst in rainy conditions, [in a city center is likely to cause
the entire metropolitan area to be abandoned at least for
decades]{.underline} owing to infrastructure damage and radioactive
contamination. As the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in Louisiana
suggests, [the economic consequences of even a localized nuclear
catastrophe would most likely have severe national and **international
economic consequences**]{.underline}. Striking effects result even from
relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most
effective against city centers where business and social activity as
well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and **[terrorists
would be most likely to strike there]{.underline}**. Accordingly, an
organized [attack on the U.S. by a small nuclear state, or
terrorists]{.underline} supported by such a state, **[could generate
casualties comparable to those]{.underline}** once **[predicted for a
full-scale nuclear "counterforce" exchange in a superpower
conflict]{.underline}**. Remarkably, the [estimated quantities of smoke
generated by attacks totaling about one megaton of nuclear explosives
**could lead to significant global climate perturbations**]{.underline}
(Robock et al., 2007). While we did not extend our casualty and damage
predictions to include potential medical, social or economic impacts
following the initial explosions, such analyses have been performed in
the past for large-scale nuclear war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson,
1985). Such a study should be carried out as well for the present
scenarios and physical outcomes.

Conclusion

[Moving resources to the State Department to conduct security assistance
would result in more effective aid that is **less likely to be wasted**
or flow to abusive partners. It would also reduce **unnecessary
bureaucracy** from the current system.]{.underline} [This would be an
important step toward **undoing the militarization** of U.S. foreign
policy and would give an **important foreign policy tool back** to
American diplomats]{.underline}. [The new administration should
move]{.underline} quickly to consolidate [security assistance resources
under the State Department]{.underline}, with accompanying reforms to
the bureaucracy and workforce that handles these issues. [Congress
should support this realignment and transfer]{.underline} the necessary
[authorities and resources from the DOD to the **State**
Department]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--NATO

#### Achieving consensus at NATO requires [diplomatic]{.underline}, not military, efforts

**Burns 21**, Professor of Diplomacy and IR at Harvard (Nicholas, "A
Time for Diplomacy," *Belfer Center*,

**[Diplomacy]{.underline}** also **[works best]{.underline}** when
far-sighted leaders take charge of a crisis and point the way ahead.
[Think of]{.underline}: FDR and [Churchill's organization of a massive
global coalition]{.underline} to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
Helmut Kohl, Mikhail [Gorbachev]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} George
H.W. [Bush's negotiations to unite Germany in]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} Alliance and to end the Cold War. Nelson
[Mandela]{.underline} who used a four-year diplomatic negotiation to
dismantle and destroy the apartheid regime. Angela [Merkel]{.underline}
who led the world diplomatically in confronting and sanctioning Vladimir
Putin following Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Diplomacy
and negotiations, of course, do not always succeed. At its worst, if
diplomacy fails, war, lawlessness, and destruction ensue -- Vietnam,
Rwanda, and Iraq in the past. Syria, Tigray, Myanmar, and China's power
grab in the South China Sea in the present. That is one reason why it is
so important to integrate effectively the work of ambassadors and
Generals combined with the unique power of intelligence officers.
Foreign policy making in the U.S. Government is a team sport. It takes
coordination among all the country's actors to succeed. We diplomats
understand that our ability to succeed is often related directly to the
intelligence on which we depend and the military partners with whom we
share power. It has long been understood that diplomacy and defense are
inextricably tied to each other. [When I was U.S. Ambassador to NATO,
the majority of my staff was from the Pentagon]{.underline} -- both the
uniformed military and Defense Department civilians. [We thought hard
about aligning our diplomatic moves with our military
might]{.underline}. When we responded to the 9/11 attacks, we drew on
the resources of both diplomats and warriors. When NATO went into
Afghanistan, we thought of it as a combined military and diplomatic
mission. What has been missing in the U.S. government in recent years is
a strong, energetic, self-confident diplomatic corps. President
[Biden]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Secretary of State Tony [Blinken
have shown they appreciate the need to elevate diplomacy as a
first-order priority for the United States]{.underline}. From their
first days in office, they have emphasized their determination to
strengthen America's diplomatic power in the world. President Biden
chose the State Department as the site of his first foreign policy
speech. Some of his earliest and most notable appointments immediately
strengthened our diplomatic bench behind Secretary Tony Blinken --
Ambassadors Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Wendy Sherman, Victoria Nuland, and
Samantha Power, as well as an impressive and experienced NSC team led by
Jake Sullivan, Jon Finer, Kurt Campbell, Laura Rosenberger, Sumona Guha,
and many others. For President Biden's new emphasis on diplomacy to
succeed, however, the career Foreign Service, in particular, will need
to be strengthened dramatically. It is no secret that the Foreign and
Civil Service are at their lowest points in morale and effectiveness in
the memory of anyone listening today in this Zoom room. I began my
diplomatic career 41 years ago as an intern at our embassy in
Nouakchott, Mauritania in the Sahara Desert. I have witnessed many highs
and lows of American diplomacy since. Frankly, I have been shocked to
see the damage done to the career Foreign Service during the last four
years. The result is disastrously low morale, a lack of budgetary
support, the debilitating departure of some of our most senior career
diplomats, the sidelining of the Service for a time, and the resulting
lack of confidence in its future by a younger generation of diplomats
who will be most critical to its resurrection. President Biden and
Secretary Blinken have a rare opportunity to lead a radical overhaul at
[the State Department]{.underline}. Under their leadership, this [must
remain a first-order priority for the administration]{.underline}. In
November just following the Presidential election, two former American
Ambassadors, Marc Grossman, Marcie Ries, and I released a Harvard
Kennedy School report entitled, "A U.S. Diplomatic Service for the 21st
Century." Our goal was to recommend the fundamental steps necessary to
reform the Foreign Service and to reposition it for success in the
future. Based on conversations with over 200 people inside the U.S.
government and beyond in over 40 workshops during the past pandemic
year, we reported that the Foreign Service "is confronting one of the
most profound crises in its long and proud history." We recommended a
determined, bipartisan effort to revive and restructure it.
Specifically, we called for a new Foreign Service Act by Congress to set
a renewed mission and mandate for the 21st century diplomatic corps. The
last time Congress passed such an Act was in 1980 when the world was a
very different place with very different challenges. than it is now. We
advocated a "relentless focus on diversity" to counteract the woeful
lack of progress in the percentage of African Americans, women, Latinx
Americans, Asian Americans and other minorities in the senior ranks of
American diplomacy. We called for the creation of a new Diplomatic
Reserve Corps and a Mid-Level entry program to ensure the inclusion in
the diplomatic ranks of experienced citizens with specialized skills.
Given the proliferation of political appointee Ambassadors at the State
Department, we also recommended that, by 2025, 90 percent of Ambassadors
should be career appointees, not 70 percent as is the current practice.
We also recommended that 75 percent of the powerful Assistant Secretary
of State positions be held by career officers. During the Trump
Administration, not a single one of these Assistant Secretary positions
was led by a Senate-confirmed career officer. This was the first time in
memory that the Foreign Service had been entirely unrepresented at that
critical leadership level. Finally, we proposed to rename the "Foreign
Service of the United States" the "United States Diplomatic Service." We
believe it signals transformation and reinforces the vital role our
diplomats perform in service to our nation. This new title would begin
with the two words, of course, that are most important -- United States.
A reinforced career diplomatic corps would help President Biden and his
successors from either party to revive American leadership in the world.
President Biden's great insight has been to see our alliances as the
critical asset we have in this long-term battle for global power and the
future of democracy. [The NATO Alliance is fundamental to a long-term
peace in Europe. It has expanded a zone of security]{.underline} to
encompass the great majority of Europeans, East and West. It protects
all of us, particularly smaller countries, from the Russian Bear. [It
will be **largely a diplomatic task** to return the U.S. to **leadership
of the Alliance** and to maintain allied unity in containing Russia
power in the next few days, weeks, months, and years]{.underline}.

#### "Security Assistance" solves. It builds capacity in NATO to deter shared threats.

[The United States provides]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**
sector [**assistance** to foreign]{.underline} civilian and [military
forces]{.underline}, agencies, and institutions ranging from local law
enforcement and judicial systems to standing militaries. [This
assistance is intended to]{.underline} strengthen U.S. access to key
territories and facilities, [shape partners' national security
decision-making]{.underline} and governance, [and build their capacity
and capabilities for use against shared threats and
adversaries]{.underline}. [It also promotes]{.underline} the U.S.
defense industry via arms transfers, supports the [infrastructure and
operations of multilateral organizations **such as NATO**, and increases
military interoperability. The State Department implements
**assistance** across the entire security sector]{.underline},
**[including organizations responsible for defense]{.underline}**, law
enforcement, and security of key assets like ports and borders. [The
**Department of Defense** has a narrower mandate, and provides
assistance to partner militaries under the **umbrella of security
cooperation**]{.underline}. [The Pentagon]{.underline} also [engages
in]{.underline} a range of other [activities]{.underline} --- combined
exercises, staff talks, port visits, and officer exchanges --- [that
fall under **security cooperation**]{.underline} as well. We use the
term security sector assistance for simplicity, and distinguish where
these additional security cooperation activities are relevant. The U.S.
government does not typically define Foreign Military Sales as
assistance, but we believe it should, and that it ought to factor Direct
Commercial Sales into its assistance planning as well. Both types of
sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with a partner in the form
of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the purchased items.

#### The State department is [best]{.underline} for achieving successful multilateral diplomacy

**Powell 22**, career member of the United States Foreign Service who
served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Human
Resources, et al (Jo Ellen, "Bringing America's Multilateral Diplomacy
into the 21st Century," Academy of Diplomacy,
<https://www.academyofdiplomacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bringing-Americas-Multilateral-Diplomacy-into-the-21st-Century-FINAL.pdf)//BB>

In his February 4, 2021, address to the U.S. Department of State,
President Joseph R. Biden declared "[diplomacy is back at the center of
our foreign policy]{.underline}."1 The President called on the
Department of State [to meet accelerating global challenges, from the
pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation, by working in
common with other nations]{.underline}. He spoke of global diplomacy,
and global power, as America's inexhaustible source of strength and its
abiding advantage. Many perceive that advantage has eroded over the
years. Today, [the Department of State has a **singular opportunity** to
lead]{.underline} an interagency [collaboration]{.underline} to restore
that advantage, with the support of the Administration and other
interested agencies. [To achieve this, the State Department cannot
exclusively rely on]{.underline} its traditional model of [bilateral
diplomacy; **multilateral diplomacy** must become a greater focus of the
Department's efforts]{.underline}. To effectively address the global
challenges the President discussed, the Department must exert equal
effort in its multilateral and bilateral diplomacy. Although the U.S.
remains virtually unmatched in its economic and social influence and
power, the gap between it and the competition is narrowing. It is no
longer true (if it ever was) that the U.S. does not need a global range
of partners to address global crises. China is rapidly extending its
presence and influence in international organizations, including
international financial institutions, as are other countries, such as
Russia and India. [The U.S. must build strong and enduring
partnerships]{.underline} with countries beyond its traditional
alliances, particularly in Latin America and Africa. As political
dynamics and world powers shifted, the U.S. response was often to
disengage from multilateral diplomacy. Yet, disengagement did not lead
to resolution. We must set aside the notion that international
organizations excessively constrain or disproportionately burden the
United States. To manage the global issues we face today and for the
foreseeable future, we need to work with a global coalition of partners,
even when not all of them agree with the United States all the time. In
considering how to meet these challenges, it is useful to examine how
other countries have maximized their multilateral influence. Smaller
nations often see international organizations as the most effective way
to leverage their influence. The Nordic countries are an oft-cited
example of the smart application of multilateral diplomacy, but the
U.K., France, Japan, and Germany also give considerable weight and
attention to multilateral diplomacy, with highly effective results.
These successful practitioners of multilateral diplomacy have several
practices and approaches in common. Their diplomats' entry-level
training includes serious emphasis on multilateral diplomacy and
negotiation; their career paths often involve multiple assignments to or
within international organizations; and their foreign ministries are
actively engaged in recruitment and advocacy for placement in
international bodies of highly qualified applicants at all levels, from
interns to senior executives. Other characteristics they share that the
U.S. cannot easily adopt are greater ease of movement between their
Civil and Foreign Services and the absence of an "up or out" promotion
system. Both sets of characteristics enhance those countries'
flexibility to second personnel to international organizations, and the
latter somewhat offsets the nearly universal perception that secondments
are not helpful to one's career. [Effective multilateral diplomacy is
essential for the U.S. to achieve its foreign policy
objectives]{.underline} and effective bilateral engagement is arguably
the most critical element of successful multilateral diplomacy. [U.S.
diplomats **must set the standard**, not just throughout the U.S.
government, but worldwide, for **effective multilateral
diplomacy**]{.underline}. Our recommendations to achieve this fall into
three categories: policy, practice, and preparation.

[America faces a tidal wave of challenges wrought by]{.underline}
unprecedented and ubiquitous advances in [emerging
**tech**nologies]{.underline} and the rise of China as an
anti-democratic economic superpower. **[The State Department has a
leading role to play]{.underline}** in addressing both challenges.
Consolidating all technology issues under a single undersecretary would
significantly strengthen the department's hand in the interagency
policymaking process. [The department is **better positioned than its
interagency counterparts** to articulate a national emerging technology
policy that accounts for the full range of U.S. national interests, not
just those related to security]{.underline}. [Multidimensionality is the
State Department's core comparative advantage]{.underline}.
Consolidation would reinforce it. [**No other agency** has the mandate,
the expertise, and the credibility to compel consideration of that vital
perspective]{.underline}. [Without it, the United States risks
undermining its complex geostrategic interests with **over-securitized
responses**]{.underline} to rivalry with China and the related,

CDP \[[Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy]{.underline}\] [will have
three policy buckets: international cyber security, digital policy and
digital freedom]{.underline}. Each roughly corresponds to preexisting
competencies: the cyber coordinator office (created back in 2011), the
Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs and the Bureau of Democracy,
Human Rights and Labor, respectively. It will be run by a
yet-to-be-confirmed ambassador-at-large; in the meantime, career
diplomat Jennifer Bachus will run the team as principal deputy assistant
secretary. While the new bureau [will]{.underline} deal with the
day-to-day, a separate special envoy position will also [be created to
focus on]{.underline} more long-term issues around [emerging and
critical technologies like **AI**, **quantum** and
**biotechnology**]{.underline}. Missing in action no more? [The
"decision to stand up a new bureau is an indicator of how seriously
\[the Biden administration\] sees these threats]{.underline}," Eileen
Donahoe, a former U.S. ambassador who now runs the Stanford Global
Digital Policy Incubator, tells me. "[They understand the need for more
thought leadership and diplomatic capacity]{.underline}." One sign of
that seriousness is that both offices will, for at least a year, report
directly to Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the department's
number two official. This is a good thing, says Chris Painter, who was
the Obama administration's top diplomat on cyber issues. Sherman, he
says, has a long history with cyber issues and worked to integrate
technology issues at regional bureaus she ran earlier in her career. CDP
will need that high-level support. [The State Department is]{.underline}
playing catch up, I'm told, and [attempting to bring its expertise ---
diplomacy and knowledge of international relations --- to more technical
policymakers]{.underline} at the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and
other agencies. The implication is clear: [State's voice has been
missing]{.underline} in the interagency process and opportunities have
been missed both [at home and abroad]{.underline}. For example, as Nate
Picarsic and Emily de la Bruyère have written, the U.S. has been largely
absent from the politics of the intergovernmental organizations that are
quietly setting the global standards of technology. As a result the U.S.
has ceded ground to others, especially Russia and China, but even the
European Union, with massive implications for who controls the future of
technology. And as new international entities emerge, like the EU-U.S.
Trade and Technology Council or the Quad's technology working group,
[the State Department needs to be able to coordinate and
advise]{.underline}. Under the Trump administration, you "had good,
talented people," working these issues, Painter tells me, "but no one at
the leadership level \[able\] both to deal with the White House and
senior counterparts and foreign counterparts. \[[The new bureau\] helps
fill that gap]{.underline}." "[This is a real down payment by the
department]{.underline}," says Yll Bajraktari, a former national
security official who is now the CEO of Special Competitive Studies
Project, an AI advocacy group. "[Integrating the department's capacity
for cybersecurity, digital infrastructure and governance issues
including internet freedom will help create a coherent diplomatic
strategy]{.underline}."

The Devil Is in the Details, But [a Cyberspace Policy Bureau Is the
**Best Approach**]{.underline} The unfortunate political reality is that
reorganizing the State Department is hard. That alone is not a reason to
forgo reform, but it does introduce constraints on what may be feasible.
Any new office or bureau will need leaders, but current law strictly
limits the rank that they can hold. Creating a new under secretary, or
even a new assistant secretary, would require significant changes to the
State Department Basic Authorities Act, and there is limited political
momentum for that particular undertaking. The law currently authorizes
the appointment of 24 assistant secretaries and six under secretaries.
Although the Cyberspace Solarium Commission initially recommended
creating an assistant secretary position to lead a new cyber bureau ---
and although it has been clear for two decades that the State
Department's structure should be overhauled --- making such drastic
changes to the necessary legislation may be a nonstarter on Capitol Hill
for the foreseeable future. The Cyber Diplomacy Act provides the best
available work-around by placing an ambassador-at-large at the head of
the new bureau, ensuring that the position has the stature necessary for
effective leadership. The new bureau would also have to contend with the
challenges of prioritization. The Cyber Diplomacy Act lists a wide
variety of issues --- including internet access, internet freedom,
digital economy, cybercrime, deterrence, and international responses to
cyber threats --- that would become a cyberspace bureau's
responsibilities. Even without giving it emerging technology topics to
handle, consolidating just cyberspace policy issues will require careful
planning to determine which pieces get pulled from existing bureaus. To
allow a new bureau to adequately deal with digital economy matters, for
example, policymakers would need to decide which aspects of that issue
get moved from the purview of the Bureau of Economic and Business
Affairs. The new bureau would have a good case for inheriting
responsibility for portfolios like investment in information
communications technology infrastructure abroad, particularly as it
relates to cyber security capacity building, but there is a strong
argument for other pieces like e-commerce to remain in their existing
homes. The more bearing a particular team's work has on preserving an
open, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet, the more it should
be considered a strong candidate for incorporation into a new bureau.
Moving the responsibility for particular policy matters is not the only
tool available, however. The Cyber Diplomacy Act creates an avenue for
the new bureau's personnel to engage other State Department experts to
ensure that concerns like human rights, economic competitiveness, and
security have an influence on the development of U.S. cyber policy.
[The]{.underline} proposed Cyberspace Policy [Coordinating Committee
would ensure that officials at the assistant secretary level or higher
from across the department can weigh in on matters of concern for their
respective portfolios. With a new **cyberspace policy bureau**, a
coordinating committee, and enhancements to **emerging technology
capacity** in its existing regional and functional bureaus, the State
Department would be structured to **handle the digital age
effectively**]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Trust

#### Only [non-military]{.underline} assistance promotes the trust necessary for Security Assistance to succeed

**Stohl 16**, senior associate with the Managing Across Boundaries
Initiative at the Stimson Center (Rachel, "[The Pitfalls of the Pentagon
Taking the Lead on U.S. Security Assistance]{.underline}," World
Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/19963/the-pitfalls-of-the-pentagon-taking-the-lead-on-u-s-security-assistance)//BB

[Oversight and transparency over these myriad programs are often
extremely difficult.]{.underline} Numerous government accounts provide
this money, and depending on the program, different congressional
committees maintain oversight. [The stove-piped nature of U.S. military
assistance and the steadfast secrecy that surrounds decisions made for
reasons of "national security" often create an artificial division
between national security interests and foreign policy
ideals]{.underline}. [They also make it nearly impossible
to]{.underline} identify the exact amount of spending, to [evaluate the
effectiveness and impact of various programs, and to avoid duplicating
resources and efforts across different offices and
agencies]{.underline}. This tension between the State Department and the
Pentagon is not new. For decades, there have been contradictions between
advancing U.S. security interest and foreign policy goals, such as the
protection of human rights. Traditionally, the State Department was the
primary decision-maker that determined who received security assistance
and for what purpose. Yet all of that began to change after Sept. 11.
Before 9/11, Congress had already begun authorizing the Pentagon to
support foreign militaries in roles that had long been filled by the
State Department. Starting with anti-drug training in the Western
Hemisphere, the number and size of these programs has steadily grown
since. In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the purpose of "train and equip"
programs was altered to fill an expanding list of priorities to "build
partner capacity," known as BPC. A RAND Corporation study in 2013 found
that of 184 unique authorities that underwrite 165 BPC programs, at
least 70 are managed and can be utilized by the Pentagon to provide
security cooperation. The mandates of these programs are vast, ranging
from counterterrorism to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
After 9/11, the Defense Department created military assistance programs
to supplement traditional State Department ones. But from the outset,
the appropriated funds that support these programs were subject to fewer
restrictions than their State Department counterparts. For example, the
Pentagon's Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship Program was
originally created in 2002 with a mandate that critics claimed served
the same purpose as the State Department's International Military
Education and Training program. The Pentagon program provided nonlethal
counterterrorism training, but lethal training was made available two
years later. Beyond the lack of transparency and oversight, [a larger
and more philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become
militarized]{.underline}. Similarly, in 2006, the Pentagon was
authorized to use \$200 million of its Operation and Maintenance funds
to equip and train foreign militaries for counterterrorism operations.
In creating these parallel training authorities and
[funding]{.underline} them [through the defense budget]{.underline}, the
Pentagon [is]{.underline}, in effect, [able to implement]{.underline}
its [security assistance without applying Foreign Assistance Act
restrictions, which are intended to ensure that human rights and other
foreign policy concerns are taken into consideration when determining
the provision of security assistance]{.underline}. Experts have counted
a tripling of military assistance out of the Pentagon budget from 2008
to 2015. That money comes with greater influence. And although the State
Department can veto some programs, others are outside its authority, and
program planning is not always shared with State Department personnel.
After 9/11, the Pentagon gained a larger role, not just because it had
the money, but because it was believed that it had the experience and
means to react more quickly to changing situations and needs in an
expansive and fast growing war on terror. While many of the countries
receiving Pentagon military assistance are seen as national security
priorities, their behavior often raises foreign policy concerns that
make diplomatic engagement difficult. Providing arms to these countries
also increases the risk that U.S.-origin weapons could be used against
the United States, its soldiers, its allies and/or its interests. In
many cases, [military]{.underline} and security [assistance is provided
to achieve short-term security gains, which may **undermine** long-term
U.S foreign policy interests]{.underline}. These issues are compounded
by the fact that the Pentagon simply has more money and resources to
address these concerns, and it has become easier for it to simply foot
the bill. Pentagon spending on military assistance has totaled at least
\$122 billion since 2001, compared to approximately \$119 billion for
the State Department. The Security Assistance Monitor, a program of the
Center for International Policy that tracks U.S. security assistance to
countries around the world, has documented a tenfold increase in
Pentagon security aid programs since 2001---from \$1 billion in 2001 to
\$10.8 billion in 2015. State Department spending nearly doubled in that
time from \$4.6 billion to \$8.3 billion. However, it is not the dollar
figure that is worth comparing, but rather the meteoric rise of Pentagon
spending, as opposed to a more gradual increase from the State
Department. This increased spending has made some observers
apprehensive. A Congressional Research Service report last May raised
serious concerns about the roles of the State Department and the
Pentagon with regard to security assistance and reconciling foreign
policy objectives with security goals. It highlighted the lack of
reporting requirements for Pentagon programs compared to the State
Department and the resulting lack of oversight and accounting. In
addition, Pentagon programs are not subject to country-by-country public
reporting, making understanding a recipient country's priorities,
activities and funding impossible. At least 66 Pentagon programs do not
allow any specific country information to be made available at all.
Beyond this lack of transparency and oversight, a larger and more
philosophical concern is that foreign policy has become militarized.
Recipient countries and communities have the impression that help only
comes from the U.S. military, which changes the context of assistance
and the relationship with those receiving it. The mission and its
perception differ depending on whether the help comes from the U.S.
military, or instead from the U.S. Embassy, the United States Agency for
International Development or other civil servants from various U.S.
government agencies. Today, [American security assistance has become
unnecessarily military in nature, simply because there are additional
Pentagon]{.underline} funds and [programs]{.underline} that can quickly
move money. At a fundamental level, [when speaking with members of the
U.S. military]{.underline} involved in these types of missions, such as
building schools or bridges in African countries, [they have recognized
that they are simply there to complete their work and to strengthen
military-to-military relationships]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
often [don't worry about diplomatic aspects or the types of
relationships they are establishing.]{.underline} To be sure, developing
any relationship, particularly in countries with questionable and at
times poor records of democracy and human rights, is important, and
[military relationships may buy]{.underline} the [security]{.underline}
that is desired [in the short term. But in the long term, without
**deeper diplomatic relationships and nonmilitary engagement**, it will
be **impossible** to achieve larger strategic objectives and foster an
**environment of trust**]{.underline}.

Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress," *Congressional

[The use of military forces may also impede the advancement of foreign
policy goals]{.underline}. For instance, [the]{.underline} December 2006
[Senate Foreign Relations Committee report]{.underline}, Embassies as
Command Posts in the Anti-Terror Campaign, [viewed the use of DOD
personnel]{.underline} for counterterrorism programs [as an
**obstacle**]{.underline}: "In Latin America, especially, [military and
intelligence efforts are viewed with **suspicion**, making it
**difficult to pursue meaningful cooperation**]{.underline} on a
counterterrorism agenda."64 As pointed out in Appendix F on
counternarcotics cooperation, Mexico has resisted counternarcotics
assistance that would involve the U.S. military. One analyst claims that
"African [publics and governments have already begun to complain that
U.S. engagement is increasingly military]{.underline}."65

Start Footnote 63

63 2006 SFRC Report, op. cit., states that [there is evidence that some
host country nationals question "the increasingly military component of
America's profile overseas]{.underline}. In Uganda, a military civil
affairs team went to the northern part of the country to help local
communities build wells, erect schools and carry out other small
development projects to help mitigate the consequences of a long-running
regional conflict. Local NGOs questioned whether the military was there
to take sides in the conflict." p. 12.

#### Diplomats are [more likely]{.underline} to follow through on commitments 

**Casler 21**, Ph.D. Candidate, Political Science Department, Columbia
University (Don, "Credible To Whom? The Organizational Politics of
Credibility in International Relations," *Mershon Center Working
Papers*,
<https://mershoncenter.osu.edu/sites/default/files/2021-04/Casler_NWR_Draft.pdf>)//BB

Diplomats' conception of credibility derives from their wide range of
duties: translating between the home government and the world; providing
early warning of troubles and opportunities; building and fixing
relationships; and integrating the military, economic, and intelligence
tools of statecraft.53 [Diplomats are socialized to be experts in
communication, relationship management, and negotiation]{.underline} ---
whether [because they are]{.underline} career civil servants [steeped in
the art of diplomacy]{.underline} or because they enter government from
business or law, where such skills also receive special emphasis. As a
result, their self-image is as the first line of defense against
international strife,54 or the process-oriented analyst and reporter who
keeps the home government informed, represents its interests, and
cajoles others into doing what the home government wants. [Securing
others' trust is essential for each of these objectives, making
diplomats highly focused on the personal and behavioral dimensions of
cultivating relationships]{.underline}.55 [This means that diplomats
constantly and keenly observe how the home government is
perceived]{.underline} across a broad range of issues, events, and
commitments, which they see as tightly interconnected. [The wide scope
of diplomats' core mission inculcates a broad definition of national
interests]{.underline} and a capacious understanding of what the home
government's actions can indicate to international audiences.56 Since
their chief objective is to cultivate strong, durable impressions and
relationships that will persist over anticipated future interactions, I
argue that [diplomats conceive of credibility primarily in terms of
national interests and signaling reputation]{.underline} --- [in other
words, as the **willingness to keep commitments** and bear
costs]{.underline}. [Military officers' conception of
credibility]{.underline} stems from their military education, which
[limits the]{.underline} proper [role of military force in foreign
policy]{.underline} to traditional security goals such as protecting
territory, geostrategic positions, and allies.57 This experience
socializes military officials to be experts in managing violence through
specialized training in military operations, tactics, and logistics.58
As a result, their self-image is as the goal-oriented technician, taking
sober stock of a given task's hard capability requirements.59 Because
they are attentive to the nuts and bolts of military interventions as
well as all that can go wrong in war, military officials hold a
pessimistic professional viewpoint that typically demands maximum
capabilities to address any contingency.60 [This manifests in the
military ethic of "conservative realism,]{.underline}" stressing the
possession of ready forces to meet potential challenges and **[opposing
the extension of commitments]{.underline}** or issuance of threats
unless the capacity to follow through exists.61

### Solvency\-\--Evolution

#### [Only]{.underline} diplomats can [adapt]{.underline} to evolving circumstances to ensure overall mission success

**Toft 18**, Professor of International Politics and Director of the
Center for Strategic Studies at The Fletcher School (Monica, "THE
DANGEROUS RISE OF KINETIC DIPLOMACY," *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/05/the-dangerous-rise-of-kinetic-diplomacy/>)//BB

But the [difficulty is that the U.S. public, along with most of its
representatives in Congress, have no way of knowing whether these
deployments]{.underline} --- though no doubt ideal as compared to the
alternative of major conventional wars --- [are having a positive net
effect. In order to know that we would need]{.underline} a fully
functioning **[Department of State]{.underline}** whose [**diplomats**
on the ground could help **guide and inform** ongoing and future special
operations force deployments]{.underline}. The Trump administration's
[hollowing out of the State Department]{.underline} --- which is
historically unprecedented --- [makes it progressively difficult to deal
with the underlying causes of the violent extremist organization threat,
and to know whether kinetic diplomacy is **helping or hurting** U.S. and
allied interests]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT Leverage/Cooperation

#### Military assistance creates [reverse leverage]{.underline} that causes client-state aggression

**Sullivan 11**, et al, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill (Patricia L.
Sullivan, Brock Tessman, Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li,
PhD in Political Science from Stanford, "US Military Aid and Recipient
State Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, Number 7)//BB

In this model, [we anticipate a **paradoxical** effect of **military
aid** in which powerful donor states become dependent on the recipients
of their military aid]{.underline} (Mott 2002). [The United States gives
military aid to gain leverage and influence]{.underline}. But it is in a
competitive market for leverage through aid; it must compete with other
states to keep its influence over client states. At the same time, [we
can assume that the United States chooses to invest heavily]{.underline}
in training and equipping the military forces of other countries, with
all the attendant risks this entails, [because it needs something from
these states.]{.underline} Materially [weak states can exploit the fact
that a much stronger donor relies on them to provide some vital
good---and the threat of defection to an alternative supplier---to exert
influence over the donor]{.underline}. According to Mott (2002), during
the Cold War, [US security assistance recipients learned to **manipulate
the United States** ''by putting Moscow and Washington into an aid
competition, by diversifying across suppliers, and converting the
expected recipient dependence into a perverse sort of supplier
dependence'']{.underline} (8). Although the Cold War competition with
Moscow is no longer central to US foreign policy, other states and even
nonstate actors have stepped in to replace the Soviet Union as
alternative arms suppliers. Stokke (1995) observes that strong states
have typically used foreign aid ''as a lever to promote objectives set
by the donor, which the recipient government would not have otherwise
agreed to'' (12). But Singer (2003) argues that the increasingly
privatized military market ''fundamentally alters this patron-client
relationship'' (211). Since weaker states can now purchase weapons on
the open market, [the patron's ability to influence client behavior is
greatly diminished]{.underline}. [Generous US **military funding runs**
the risk of **creating militarily strong, assertive clients that become
more willing to ignore US interests**]{.underline} (Mott 2002).
[Recipient states should be **more likely to defy the United States** if
they believe that the United States will be unable or unwilling to
punish them for defection]{.underline} (Walt 2005). US dependence on
recipient states for oil, troop basing, over-flight permission,
counternarcotic and counterterrorism operations, etc... makes
withdrawing aid potentially more costly for the United States than for
the aid recipients. It may be easier for aid recipients to find
alternative suppliers than it would be for the United States to find an
equally valuable place to base its troops.

#### Military aid undermines cooperation with US efforts

**Sullivan 11**, et al, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill (Patricia L.
Sullivan, Brock Tessman, Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li,
PhD in Political Science from Stanford, "US Military Aid and Recipient
State Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, Number 7)//BB

Our research is relevant to larger academic debates about the utility
and limitations of foreign aid as a policy instrument. [We attempt to
evaluate the effectiveness of]{.underline} foreign aid, and [security
assistance]{.underline} more specifically, [in terms of its ability to
move recipients toward more cooperative foreign policies. We test the
conventional ''arms for influence'' explanation of military aid but find
that the relationship between US assistance and recipient state behavior
is considerably more complicated]{.underline}. In general, [we find that
**military aid does not lead to more cooperative behavior** on the part
of recipient states]{.underline}. With limited exceptions, [increasing
levels of US aid are linked to a **significant reduction in cooperative
foreign policy behavior with the United States**]{.underline}. US
reaction to recipient state behavior is also somewhat counterintuitive;
instead of using a carrot-and-stick approach to military aid
allocations, our results show that increased recipient state cooperation
is likely to lead to subsequent reductions in US military assistance.

#### Post-military aid, allies will work against US interests

**Sullivan 11**, et al, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill (Patricia L.
Sullivan, Brock Tessman, Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li,
PhD in Political Science from Stanford, "US Military Aid and Recipient
State Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, Number 7)//BB

In several ways, [the **Reverse Leverage** model was quite
**accurate**]{.underline}: (i) [states receiving military aid from the
United States exhibit lower levels of cooperation than states that do
not receive military aid]{.underline}, (ii) in the population of all
states, [higher levels of military aid appear to produce more defiant
behavior]{.underline}, and (iii) the United States does not punish
defiance with reductions in aid or reward greater cooperation with
increases in military aid. Together, these results suggest that US
military assistance is allocated for reasons that are largely
independent of overall recipient state behavior toward the United
States. The Reverse Leverage model contends that [military aid is
delivered to states that the United States depends on for security
reasons. Realizing their leverage over Washington, states that receive
high amounts of aid are actually more able to engage in uncooperative
behavior than are states that the United States does not depend so
heavily upon]{.underline}. We attempted to test for the effects of an
aid recipient's ''security value'' directly by comparing US allies to
nonallies. Consistent with the Reverse Leverage model, we find that
[states with a defensive alliance with the United States are more likely
to receive US military aid but less likely to respond to aid by
increasing their cooperation with American preferences]{.underline}.

#### The larger the military package, the more uncooperative the ally

**Sullivan 11**, et al, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill (Patricia L.
Sullivan, Brock Tessman, Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li,
PhD in Political Science from Stanford, "US Military Aid and Recipient
State Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, Number 7)//BB

Despite its limitations, our study offers a novel approach to the
foreign aid and influence puzzle. And our results uncover interesting
relationships that deserve greater theoretical and empirical attention
in future research. Clearly, [the relationship between US **military aid
and recipient state cooperation** is far from straightforward. The bulk
of]{.underline} our [evidence pens a **cautionary tale** for
policymakers; although military assistance may achieve the specific
goals for which it was allocated, it appears to **generate less
cooperative behavior** from recipient states overall]{.underline}. US
military aid levels may be more indicative of American dependence on
recipient states than of US influence over client states. [Contrary to
the vast majority of the existing literature on foreign aid, our results
suggest military aid]{.underline} is neither a carrot nor a stick; US
assistance [is given to countries that the United States depends on for
some foreign policy ''good'' and the United States will continue to
provide such aid as long as that ''good'' is valued in Washington. With
this knowledge, recipient state behavior is actually likely to be
**increasingly uncooperative** as levels of American
dependency]{.underline} (and subsequent aid packages)
[increase]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT DoD Key

#### DoD is [only]{.underline} key during wartime, they could follow-on later if a war breaks out

**Bergmann** and Schmitt **21**, \*senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, where he focuses on European security and U.S.-Russia
policy. From 2011 to 2017, he served in the U.S. Department of State in
a number of different positions, including as a member of the secretary
of state's policy planning staff, where he focused on political-military
affairs and nonproliferation; special assistant to the undersecretary
for arms control and international security; speechwriter to
then-Secretary of State John Kerry; and senior adviser to the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs. Prior to serving in
the State Department, he worked at CAP as a military and
nonproliferation policy analyst and at the National Security Network as
the deputy policy director. Bergmann received his master's degree from
the London School of Economics in comparative politics and his
bachelor's degree from Bates College, \*\*senior policy analyst on the
National Security and International Policy team at the Center. She
previously worked on U.S. foreign policy advocacy at Human Rights Watch
and received her Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School
(Max and Alexandra, "A Plan To Reform U.S. Security Assistance," *Center
for American Progress*,
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/)

While [there are times when it is appropriate for the DOD to have the
authority to directly provide assistance to a partner, these programs
**should be exclusive** to when the United States is at war and fighting
side by side with allied or partner forces]{.underline}. [In these
cases, such as in active combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, it may make
sense for the Pentagon to have its own authorities]{.underline} to
assist foreign partners. [But outside these wartime situations, and
especially in light of today's efforts to end the forever wars, the
State Department is **fully able to oversee** and
**manage**]{.underline} the bulk of [U.S. security assistance
programs]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT Military Articles

#### The DoS can work with defense agencies of foreign countries, and that's NOT security cooperation

**Tankel 20**, Stephen Tankel, associate professor at American
University, and an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New
American Security, and Tommy Ross, non-resident senior associate at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2020 (Stephen,
"RETOOLING U.S. SECURITY SECTOR ASSISTANCE," War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/10/reforming-u-s-security-sector-assistance-for-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[The United States provides]{.underline} security sector [assistance to
foreign civilian and military forces, agencies, and institutions ranging
from local law enforcement and judicial systems to standing
militaries]{.underline}. This assistance is intended to strengthen U.S.
access to key territories and facilities, shape partners' national
security decision-making and governance, and build their capacity and
capabilities for use against shared threats and adversaries. It also
promotes the U.S. defense industry via arms transfers, supports the
infrastructure and operations of multilateral organizations such as
NATO, and increases military interoperability. [The State Department
implements assistance across the entire security sector, **including
organizations responsible for defense**]{.underline}, law enforcement,
**[and security of key assets]{.underline}** like ports and borders.
[The **Department of Defense** has a narrower mandate, and provides
assistance to partner militaries under the **umbrella of security
cooperation**]{.underline}. [The Pentagon]{.underline} also [engages
in]{.underline} a range of other [activities]{.underline} --- combined
exercises, staff talks, port visits, and officer exchanges --- [that
fall under **security cooperation**]{.underline} as well. We use the
term security sector assistance for simplicity, and distinguish where
these additional security cooperation activities are relevant. The U.S.
government does not typically define Foreign Military Sales as
assistance, but we believe it should, and that it ought to factor Direct
Commercial Sales into its assistance planning as well. Both types of
sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with a partner in the form
of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the purchased items.

#### The counterplan is the DoS, but they are [still responsible]{.underline} for [military articles]{.underline}. And, that's [not]{.underline} Security Cooperation.

**McLaren 14**, US Air Force Captain (McKay, "Enhancing the Assessment
of the Costs and Benefits of International Pilot Training (IPT) Within
the U.S. Air Force: Is It Worth It?," RAND Dissertations)

[U.S. Code Title 22 provides congressional authority to conduct DoS
Security Assistance programs]{.underline}. The programs are carried out
through two basic laws, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA).24 AECA enacted congressional
legislative controls over export of defense articles and services. The
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs
Committee are responsible for foreign assistance and Security Assistance
program authorization legislation. The Senate and House Armed Services
Committees are responsible for defense programs authorization
legislation. [The term **security cooperation** is used within DoD,
whereas the term **security assistance** is used within the
DoS]{.underline}. It is important to note that these congressional
committees play a role only in FMS authorization. Although Congress
maintains legislative control over exports, FMS is a nonappropriated
program, external to the U.S. budget, and the president is charged with
signing off on spending for the program. Through Executive Order 11958,
as amended, the President delegates selected functions in the AECA to
the secretaries of State and Defense. They are required to provide
reports to Congress and obtain specific congressional approval on
certain exports or transfers. [The DoS has responsibilities relating to
**security assistance**, which include **managing the export of defense
articles, services, training, and military technology**]{.underline}.25
DoD has responsibilities relating to security cooperation, which include
activities to encourage and enable international partners to work with
the United States to achieve strategic objectives.26 The military
departments and other DoD agencies involved in managing FMS programs are
collectively called implementing agencies (IAs). The Army, Navy, and Air
Force usually have the responsibility of being the IA in the process of
FMS.27 The Air Force agency for all security cooperation programs is the
Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for International
Affairs (SAF/IA). The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Acquisition has oversight in the execution by virtue of having
responsibility for Air Force acquisition. SAF/IA is supported by the Air
Force Security Assistance Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
Ohio, for most FMS and other logistics functions. The Air Force Security
Assistance Training (AFSAT) squadron at Randolph Air Force Base (AFB),
Texas, is in charge of planning and, with AETC, managing the Air Force
international military training. It is organized under the authority of
AETC.

### Solvency\-\--AT DoS Atrophy

#### No workforce atrophy, and if there is, and it's self-correcting

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," Council Special Report No. 89)//BB

But this situation can be reversed. [The State Department's ranks are
still **among the most talented professional public servants anywhere in
the government**]{.underline}. When properly empowered and entrusted
with significant responsibilities, [American diplomats play essential
roles in consequential outcomes for the country]{.underline}---from the
Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord in the Barack Obama
administration to the Afghanistan peace process and the release of
American prisoners from various countries under President Trump. [And
its current predicament could make the State Department
itself,]{.underline} which has long resisted fundamental reform, more
[open to]{.underline} badly needed [changes]{.underline}. This report
does not speak to every challenge the State Department faces but rather
highlights the reform areas that we identified as reflecting greatest
need based on discussions with veteran diplomats and other experts.

#### The State Department is [highly capable]{.underline} and should have total control over foreign assistance

**Roberts 17**, Former Research Fellow For Economic Freedom and Growth
at Heritage (James, "America Needs a Stronger State Department, Not an
'Independent' Foreign Aid Agency," Heritage,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/america-needs-stronger-state-department-not-independent-foreign-aid-agency)//BB>

Just as is the case overseas, where the U.S. ambassador is the
senior-most official in an American embassy, [in Washington the
secretary of state should have **undisputed authority** over decisions
about allocating U.S. foreign assistance]{.underline}. [The State
Department---**highly competent**, **well-equipped**, **appropriately
staffed and resourced**---should include a foreign assistance component.
That is what countries such as Canada, Denmark, and Sweden already have
done]{.underline}.

## SOLVENCY\-\--CYBER

### Solvency\-\--Cyber

#### The State Department is [comparatively]{.underline} the best actor for leading cyber policy. They promote consensus with allies on [norms]{.underline}, [capacity building]{.underline}, [intel-sharing]{.underline} and [resilience]{.underline}

**Williams 21**, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for
Global Security Research (CGSR) at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (BK, et al, "US and Allied Cyber Security Cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific," *Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory*,
<https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1787217>)//BB

The workshop\'s penultimate panel stressed a renewal of innovation in
diplomatic practice. An [active cyber diplomacy holds the promise of
restoring stability to cyberspace]{.underline}, and, for the United
States, advocating for a free, interoperable, and secure internet
globally. [State Department retains the bureaucratic competencies and
personnel to enact forward-looking cyber diplomacy]{.underline}, but
they have much ground to cover on norm construction, capacity building,
and affirming that states follow international law in cyberspace.
[Diplomacy\'s most substantial roles are protecting]{.underline} an
on-line ecosystem where [human rights]{.underline} are respected,
[restoring stability by reducing incentives for states to act
maliciously, and demonstrating U.S. leadership in]{.underline} digital
rights and [emerging technology]{.underline}. [Cyber diplomats at the
State Department]{.underline} and DHS [cooperate with allies on publicly
attributing blame for aggressive cyber acts]{.underline} to
state-sponsored APTs. [State Department is active in]{.underline} the
UN\'s Group of Governmental Experts and Open-Ended Working Group,
[lobbying for an internet of information freedom rather than information
control by states]{.underline}. Thus far, as one panelist emphasized,
the State Department has not yet framed its cyber diplomacy efforts in
the realities of the cyber strategic environment. The State Department
can make strides in supporting Persistent Engagement by socializing
foreign service officers and diplomats, who are the face of diplomacy,
to the domain\'s competitive nature. [Shaping international discourse on
cybersecurity norms, responsible state behavior, and governance can be
best attained by]{.underline} a corps of **[diplomats]{.underline}** who
are unified with the United States\' cyber doctrine. [Norm construction
from the bottom up presents the best route to shape global norms.
Leveraging agile coalitions of allies to build norms represents a
workable solution]{.underline} to adversary intransigence at the UN.
Values, by themselves, do not have the power to influence norms against
concerted state pressures to assert authoritarian control over the
internet. Competitive [allied **cyber diplomacy can shape** the
standards and norms that determine the future of the
internet]{.underline}. [A competitive cyber diplomacy **relies on the
State Department\'s core competency** in creating]{.underline} bilateral
and [**multilateral agreements** for capacity building, threat
intelligence sharing, resilience measures, and to promote best practices
in a competitive cyber ecosystem]{.underline}. [Diplomats understand
countries\' strategic and political environments, and the State
Department has the capacity to scale]{.underline} Hunt Forward
[operations]{.underline}. USCC \[[US Cyber Command]{.underline}\]
**[encounters]{.underline}** **[limits]{.underline}** in growing Hunt
Forward. Collaboration between the State Department and USCC may present
the best avenue to consensually operate in other countries\' networks to
observe malicious actors. [The State Department will guide the United
States\' cyber diplomacy]{.underline}, **[not]{.underline}** USCC
\[**[US Cyber Command]{.underline}**\], [and]{.underline} integrating
cyber authorities [will]{.underline} create synergies for how the United
States can [restore stability in cyberspace and safeguard the United
States\' cybersecurity]{.underline}.

#### The State Department [best shapes]{.underline} global cyber policy. AND, their initiatives are followed by the DoD to keep cyber engagement below thresholds of armed conflict

**Goldman 20**, cyber strategist and cyber persistence subject-matter
expert at U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. From 2018
to 2019, she was cyber adviser to the director of policy planning at the
U.S. Department of State (Emily, "From Reaction to Action: Adopting a
Competitive Posture in Cyber Diplomacy," *Texas National Security
Review*, 3.4)//BB

[The Department of State should contribute more directly to efforts to
disrupt, degrade, and contest malicious cyberspace
behavior]{.underline}. I[t can do so by leveraging diplomatic channels
to increase routine and agile collaboration with]{.underline} partners
and [allies]{.underline} for continuous pressure against adversary
campaigns below the level of armed conflict. [The goal would be to
frustrate and thwart cyberspace aggression before it harms the United
States and its allies. This approach would allow the United States to be
more responsive to great-power competition, enable and sustain similar
efforts by the Department of Defense, and complement the cyber
deterrence initiative]{.underline}. Closer synergy between promoting
norms of responsible state behavior in international venues and
conducting persistent cyberspace operations that expose and contest
behavior inconsistent with such norms has the best chance of producing a
convergence of expectations (i.e., norms) on acceptable behavior.
[Mutually reinforcing efforts across the U.S. government to deter,
disrupt, expose, and contest malicious cyberspace behavior can produce
the synergy between defense and foreign policy needed for great-power
competition]{.underline}. **[This]{.underline}**, however,
**[requires]{.underline}** a reevaluation of **[cyber
diplomacy]{.underline}** priorities, activities, lines of effort, and
mindset.59 Cyber Diplomacy for Great-Power Competition: Seizing and
Sustaining Initiative Political conditions today favor an energetic U.S.
diplomatic campaign. Russia and China's aggressive information,
political, and economic warfare campaigns have highlighted the risks to
U.S. partners and allies.60 Those [allies are eager to improve their
cyberspace security and to work cooperatively with the United States.
The U.S. government can capitalize on this favorable environment by
forging agreements with foreign partners that encourage a deeper level
of interaction]{.underline}. The United States can build coalitions for
continuous pressure against adversary cyberspace campaigns outside of
armed conflict.61 [Such agreements and the joint efforts that follow
will normalize collaborative cyberspace operations for mutual
defense]{.underline}. Essentially, **[the State Department needs
to]{.underline}** operationalize the core objective of cyber
persistence: **[seiz]{.underline}**ing and sustaining
**[initiative]{.underline}**. [The State Department is uniquely
positioned to convene interagency discussions on defining boundaries of
acceptable behavior below the level of armed conflict, to **forge
consensus** with allies and partners on boundaries of acceptable
competition, and to **mobilize international coalitions** to enforce
those boundaries]{.underline}. [It can better enable the Department of
Defense to]{.underline} persistently [engage]{.underline} and defend
forward in cyberspace [below the level of armed conflict]{.underline}
--- a necessary ingredient for constructing norms through interaction.
[Diplomats should]{.underline} be well-versed in the full range of U.S.
cyber activities and explain them to U.S. partners in order to **[set
the international conditions]{.underline}** **[for the United
States]{.underline}** to compete in a globally interconnected domain.
With these goals in mind, the following recommendations are offered as a
roadmap for improving U.S. cyber diplomacy.

#### DoS solves cyber detection, deterrence and mitigation

**Fisher 21**, serves as a Portfolio Manager in the Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, Office of Global Programs and Initiatives at
the U.S. Department of State (Benjamin, "U.S. Diplomats Build Cyber
Defense and Cybersecurity Partnerships Worldwide," *Department of
State*,

[The Department of State]{.underline}'s Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs (PM) [works]{.underline} in partnership with the U.S. Department
of Defense [to strengthen U.S. allies and partners worldwide through
**training**, **equipment**, and **capacity building projects** that
allow us to work together more effectively to meet shared security
challenges]{.underline}. With the growth of malicious cyber activities
worldwide, including intrusions and ransomware attacks targeting
critical infrastructure, [U.S. diplomats have recognized the importance
of helping partners **enhance the governance of security institutions**,
and strengthening their capacity to **detect, deter, and rapidly
mitigate**, and respond to international cyber threats and
incidents]{.underline}. Cyber Advisors of the Global Defense Reform
Program Strong and effective security sector institutions are key to
strong security partnerships. The Global Defense Reform Program (GDRP),
managed by the PM Bureau's Office of Global Programs and Initiatives
(GPI) works with partners to develop and implement organizational
reforms to modernize their security institutions, enhance effectiveness
and accountability, and better align the security sector to the needs
and challenges of the partner nation and its citizens, in places like
Albania, Palau, and Kosovo. GDRP advisors assigned to Ecuador,
Argentina, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia work side-by-side with
counterparts in partner governments' ministries of defense (MOD) to
address cyber defense and cybersecurity challenges. Together, they are
working to draft national-level strategies, policies, and procedures;
streamlining coordination among agencies in their respective governments
involved in cyber issues; establishing effective "command and control";
and recruiting, training, sustaining, and retaining a skilled cyber
workforce. Beyond the knowledge these subject matter experts bring to
strategic-level cyber planning, these engagements bolster U.S. foreign
policy objectives related to cyber defense and cybersecurity. Ecuador
Following a series of incidents, including threats to election
platforms, data breaches, and coordinated malicious cyber activity
against Ecuador's government agencies, U.S. Embassy Quito seized the
opportunity to partner with the Government of Ecuador and its defense
ministry to address cyber defense issues in support of the country's
whole-of-government cyber strategy. In January 2021, the GDRP cyber
advisor, Gustavo Santiago, arrived in Ecuador and has played a vital
role in advising on national-level cyber policy, including by
facilitating inter-ministerial agreements on the roles and
responsibilities for cyber defense and for protecting Ecuador's critical
infrastructure, which are currently under review for approval. A retired
U.S. Army colonel, Gustavo has worked alongside his Ecuadorian
counterparts to establish a 10-year plan to build the Ministry of
Defense's cyber capacity -- an initiative that garnered the support of
Ecuador's previous and current government. Since his arrival, Gustavo
has shared his expertise with the Ecuadorian defense ministry to help
draft foundational documents to plan the development of its cyber
capabilities. This is broken out into four areas: (1) prepare the
Ecuadorian defense ministry for its assigned role under the National
Cybersecurity Policy---including to protect national digital critical
infrastructure; (2) increase the Ecuadorian defense ministry's
coordination with Computer Security Incident Response Teams to respond
to cyber incidents and mitigate the risk of future threats; (3) enhance
the Cyber Defense Command's cyber defense capabilities; and (4)
implement a cyber defense program for the Ministry of Defense in line
with the national cyber posture. This partnership between the United
States and Ecuador came at a critical moment when strategic competitors
were seeking to exert influence in the cyber domain. Gustavo continues
working to build connections and new relationships between the
Government of Ecuador and other U.S. government experts that work in the
cybersecurity arena. Argentina In the next few weeks, a Global Defense
Reform Program cyber advisor will arrive in Buenos Aires to join the
Ministry of Defense and assist the Joint Staff's Cyber Command (Comando
Conjunto de Ciberdefensa or CCCD) with identifying and addressing cyber
vulnerabilities and solutions. Argentina has had a robust national cyber
policy for several years, but its governmental agencies and military
services have observed how cyber security and policy issues can remain
within organizational silos. Like in the case of GDRP Ecuador, the GDRP
Argentina cyber advisor will focus on helping the Ministry of Defense
coordinate across organizational lines and ensure that the
ministerial-level cyber policies and strategies of the CCCD effectively
support the National Cybersecurity Strategy. The placement of the cyber
advisor within the Ministry of Defense is a notable development in the
U.S.-Argentina relationship, which will foster trust between the United
States and Argentina and reinforce the importance of partnerships and
cyber cooperation in our hemisphere. Bulgaria In Europe, the Global
Defense Reform Program is augmenting support to Central and Eastern
European countries seeking to defend against Russian influence and
malicious cyber activity. In early September, then-GDRP advisor to
Bulgaria, Rich Graham, accompanied Brigadier General Vasil Sabinski,
Commander of Communication Information Systems Cybersecurity Defense
Command, as an official delegate to the 140th anniversary ceremony to
commemorate the creation of the Bulgarian Naval Academy. To tackle
cybersecurity challenges, the military has launched a new cyber program
of instruction to prepare its next generation of cyber leaders. This
program will equip students with the practical and technical knowledge
needed to lead an effective cybersecurity operations center, modeled to
blend with the practices of the Bulgarian Ministry of Defense's Cyber
Defense Center. A key component of the GDRP advisor's work is to assist
with the transformation of this Center to deliver state-of-the-art cyber
support and help prepare and train the government's workforce for future
cyber challenges. Although still in the early stages, the GDRP advisor
has made progress in building relationships to set the conditions for
the success of the cyber partnership with Bulgaria. Former Bulgarian

Defence of North Macedonia) North Macedonia Since becoming the 30th
member of NATO in March 2020, North Macedonia is focused on developing
the cyber policies, infrastructure, and capabilities necessary to be an
active and ready member of the alliance. This engagement will assist
North Macedonia's defense ministry to transform cyber defense planning,
develop and implement a comprehensive cyber strategy to define the roles
and responsibilities of different agencies that play a role in
national-level cyber efforts. North Macedonian Defense Minister signs a
document "We take cybersecurity very seriously." -North Macedonian
Defense Minister Radmila Shekerinska. (Photo: NATO News) Finally, this
GDRP project will focus on building North Macedonia's expertise and
capacity in the cyber domain; promote good governance; increase
transparency, stability, and efficiency in cyber defense planning and
coordination; and enable the North Macedonia government to operate and
respond more responsibly and effectively to cyber requirements. [By
elevating the importance of cybersecurity at the strategic level, the
United States is helping countries deter, defend against, and respond to
malicious cyber activity and, ultimately, protect critical
infrastructure]{.underline} -- including election systems --- for
societies [around the world]{.underline}. PM Bureau's \[[Department of
State's]{.underline} Bureau of Political-Military Affairs\] [cyber
portfolio has grown rapidly in recent years to address this demand for
**strategic-level planning**, **policy**, and **cybersecurity
assistance** with defense partners]{.underline}.

#### Diplomacy is vital to allied cyber policy

**Williams 21**, PhD, postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for
Global Security Research (CGSR) at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (BK, et al, "US and Allied Cyber Security Cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific," *Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory*,
<https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1787217>)//BB

[Cooperation improves when threat perceptions converge and when the
United States exercises thoughtful leadership. It erodes when efforts to
promote convergence lapse, when tactical responses take precedence over
strategic trust building]{.underline}, and when the United States sets
aside the effort to promote cooperation. [U.S. leadership is
essential]{.underline}, as every U.S. ally faces real restraints and
limits [in improving cyber security]{.underline} on its own. [The United
States has an abundance of bureaucratic resources compared to its
allies, but it still lacks a clear vision on how to build a collective
and collaborative capacity in a domain centered on secrecy and rapid
response]{.underline}. [Leadership must be built on meaningful
engagement]{.underline} and consultation on all these matters and an
appropriate modesty about our collective capacity to meet the challenges
ahead. Looking to the future of cybersecurity cooperation among the
United States and its Indo- Pacific allies, it is easy to identify
numerous challenges, usually arising from frictions over threat
assessments, desired end-states, doctrine, language, and the different
public-private sector relationships in each country. But these
challenges also represent opportunities, places where concrete progress
can be made and where frictions lend themselves to concerted action.
Progress in working one will reinforce progress in working the others.
Unity of command may be a bridge too far, near-unity of action is
attainable. An achievable goal is to a place where the US and its allies
can convey to an adversary that \"to beat any one of us, you to have to
beat all of us.\" China\'s strategy is comprehensive in nature, designed
to contest what it perceives a capable, sophisticated, and belligerent
cyber adversary in the United States. It begins with defining a central
place for cyber in China\'s development process and military
modernization. In the military domain, China pursues improved defenses
and the opportunistic pursuit of information dominance. In the economic
domain, it prioritizes reduced reliance on externally-sourced
technologies and components alongside incentivizing developing countries
to purchase Chinese companies\' affordable cyber and surveillance
products. In the political domain, domestically it pursues deep social
control, while internationally it conducts political campaigns to stake
its claim to the moral high ground of global governance. The further
development of strategic thought about the ends and means of conflict in
cyber space and with cyber tools is hostage to the vocabulary and
concepts imported from other domains and not yet well tailored for the
realities of cyber competition and conflict. This is 2 most evident in
the use of the vocabulary and concepts of nuclear deterrence to try to
elaborate a strategy to compete effectively in cyber space and reduce or
otherwise manage cyber risks. In a strategy of persistent engagement
below the lethal threshold, deterrence concepts have little value and
the failure to prevent or adequately respond to events only erodes the
perception that deterrence or compellence is possible in this arena.
We\'ve learned enough to try to set aside misleading concepts but not
enough to have consensus around more useful ones. In the long-term,
[**diplomacy is as important** for cyber security as deterrence and
defense]{.underline}. [Diplomacy determines the realm of the possible
for political cooperation and the realm of the necessary for global
governance and a global ecosystem supporting U.S. and allied values. It
is the means by which best practices are shared, norms constructed, and
oversteps identified and acted upon]{.underline}. But [the United States
must refresh and renew its approaches. In doing so, it should be
**guided by the ambition for a much more competitive cyber
diplomacy**]{.underline}.

#### DoS should lead cyber policy

to 2019, she was cyber adviser to the director of policy planning at the
U.S. Department of State (Emily, "From Reaction to Action: Adopting a

Review*, 3.4)//BB

[The U.S. government needs to reach]{.underline} an interagency
[consensus on the preferred boundaries of acceptable behavior outside of
armed conflict and promote them in international fora. **The State
Department is the natural leader for these efforts**]{.underline}.
Interagency discussions should proceed in tandem with consultations with
the private sector. Currently, discussions with private sector entities
all too often are isolated within individual agencies, with little
coordination between agencies --- even between the State Department and
USAID. Agreed-upon conventions can then be reinforced by the actions of
all departments and agencies. [Working]{.underline} bilaterally,
[multilaterally]{.underline}, and [through international institutions,
the United States --- **led by the State Department** --- can influence
and message what behaviors it views as unacceptable]{.underline}. [This
can help reduce the ambiguity that adversaries exploit, enhance the
ability to build coalitions to support the U.S. view, and enable the
United States to more effectively secure commitments from like-minded
countries to impose consequences on those whose actions are counter to
the principles]{.underline}.

#### State Department assistance facilitates consensus among allies

to 2019, she was cyber adviser to the director of policy planning at the
U.S. Department of State (Emily, "From Reaction to Action: Adopting a
Competitive Posture in Cyber Diplomacy," *Texas National Security
Review*, 3.4)//BB

[The State Department's foreign service officers forward-deployed as
"cyber diplomats" can **strengthen consensus among allies and partners**
on the nature of the cyber security problem and on the need for action
to address it]{.underline}. To do so, they should be conversant with the
U.S. government's efforts to address cyber competition and armed with
information to speak authoritatively about them. [The State Department
has long promoted a framework for responsible state behavior in
cyberspace. The key elements of that framework include]{.underline}: (1)
[affirmation]{.underline} that established principles [of international
law]{.underline} apply to state behavior in cyberspace;62 (2) [adherence
to]{.underline} certain non-binding [norms of state behavior in
cyberspace]{.underline} during peacetime; [and]{.underline} (3)
consideration, development, and implementation of practical
[confidence-building measures to reduce the risk of conflict in
cyberspace]{.underline}. Since not all states share American views on
responsible behavior in cyberspace, the United States is working with
partners and allies on collective attribution and imposition of
consequences. These initiatives are now being complemented by the
Department of Defense's strategy of defend forward and U.S. Cyber
Command's operational approach of persistent engagement. [The State
Department]{.underline} and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) officers in missions around the world [need
to]{.underline} be well-versed in these other efforts and prepared to
[explain]{.underline} them [to foreign partners on a routine
basis]{.underline}. [America's partners want to understand U.S.
government strategy and policies]{.underline}.63 [It is U.S. policy that
cross-domain responses to cyber aggression should be complemented
with]{.underline} steady and sustained [activities to make networks more
resilient, to defend them]{.underline} as far forward as practicable,
[and to contest the most dangerous adversaries]{.underline}.64 [Every
diplomatic engagement that includes cyber issues would be an opportunity
to build support for these mutually reinforcing approaches]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Cyber\-\--Norms

#### State Department leadership is vital to effective norm-creation

**Schaffer** 4-4-20**22** (Aaron, "It's a big day at the State
Department for U.S. cyberdiplomacy," *Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/04/its-big-day-state-department-us-cyberdiplomacy/>)//BB

"[Now more than ever]{.underline}, I think [we **need** to have State
Department leadership in dealing with all of the many different issues
and threats we're facing in cyberspace]{.underline}; particularly, what
we're seeing with ransomware, but also what we've seen with Ukraine, or
the potential of what might happen with Ukraine," Chris Painter, the
Obama administration's top cyber diplomat, told me. Painter added that
the new structure, resources and prioritization for [the cyber bureau
"sends a strong message to both our friends and even our adversaries
that this is something we care about deeply]{.underline}." (The Biden
administration has requested \$37 million for the bureau.) Lawmakers
also want Congress to pass legislation called the Cyber Diplomacy Act.
The bill, which passed the House last year, would put similar changes
into law. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission also recommended a similar
bureau be created. Cyber workforce The new bureau also means that the
list of federal cyber officials is getting longer. Jennifer Bachus, a
career diplomat who was most recently a top official at the U.S. Embassy
in the Czech Republic, will lead the bureau until the Senate confirms an
ambassador at large. Looking ahead [The bureau]{.underline} will have to
hit the ground running. It[**'ll** play a **key role** in testy
international talks about rules in cyberspace]{.underline}, diplomacy
about 5G telecommunications equipment made by Chinese tech giant Huawei,
talks about the spread of ransomware and Internet governance issues. It
also comes as the U.S. government jockeys for an American candidate,
Doreen Bogdan-Martin, to lead the U.N. telecommunications agency. It's
"the most important agency you've never heard of, setting rules for
global tech like 5G," U.S. Agency for International Development
Administrator Samantha Power wrote last year. The bureau has support
among lawmakers and experts. Advertisement "The State Department has
taken a huge step toward making cybersecurity a core priority of U.S.
foreign policy," said Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), the co-chair of the
Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus. "[As the threat of cyber incidents
escalates in severity and frequency, **we need a strong diplomatic
presence on the world stage** to develop and implement norms of
responsible state behavior in cyberspace]{.underline}."

### Solvency\-\--Cyber\-\--I-Law

#### The State Department action [best demonstrates]{.underline} the US stance on applicability of I-Law to the cyber domain

**Goldman 20**, cyber strategist and cyber persistence subject-matter
expert at U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. From 2018
to 2019, she was cyber adviser to the director of policy planning at the
U.S. Department of State (Emily, "From Reaction to Action: Adopting a
Competitive Posture in Cyber Diplomacy," *Texas National Security
Review*, 3.4)//BB

The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have officially declared their
respective positions and they have polar opposite views on this core
question. Moreover, Estonia, Australia, and the United States have
officially articulated their positions on [the applicability of
international law to cyber operations]{.underline} yet have not weighed
in on this particular issue. Gary Corn considers this range of positions
"prima facie evidence of the unsettled nature of the question."85 [The
United States needs to **seize the diplomatic initiative**]{.underline}
[and publicly articulate its stance on this issue to help influence the
court of world opinion]{.underline}. The most explicit official U.S.
statement comes from the Department of Defense general counsel: For
cyber operations that would not constitute a prohibited intervention or
use-of-force, the Department believes there is not sufficiently
widespread and consistent State practice resulting from a sense of legal
obligation to conclude that customary international law generally
prohibits such non-consensual cyber operations in another State's
territory. This proposition is recognized in the Department's adoption
of the "defend forward" strategy: "We will defend forward to disrupt or
halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that
falls below the level of armed conflict." The Department's commitment to
defend forward including to counter foreign cyber activity targeting the
United States --- comports with our obligations under international law
and our commitment to the rules-based international order.86 [This is an
area **where the State Department should be leading** internationally if
the United States hopes to **persuade others** to adopt its preferred
norms, particularly as allies wrestle with legal ambiguities surrounding
cyber operations]{.underline}.87

### Solvency\-\--Cyber\-\--AT DoD Key

#### New DoS-led cyber initiatives make [existing]{.underline} DoD cyber efforts more effective. That solves.

[The U.S. National Cyber Strategy's guidance to promote a framework of
responsible state behavior in cyberspace, one that ensures there are
consequences for irresponsible behavior, is a key objective for the
United States]{.underline}. To succeed, this framework should be pursued
in tandem with an active approach to stem ongoing adversary cyberspace
campaigns outside of armed conflict. The Department of Defense is now
defending forward, outside its existing networks, to mitigate threats
before they reach the United States. **[It is time for the State
Department to join in]{.underline}** these efforts. [An informal
division of labor currently exists between the departments of State and
Defense, whereby the former promotes norms in traditional diplomatic
channels while the latter pursues defend forward through military
channels]{.underline}. Yet this leaves several problems unresolved.
Parallel communication increases the risk of messaging fratricide across
military and diplomatic channels in partner nations. Military cyber
operations may engage foreign policy sensitivities that the State
Department is better equipped to address. On the other hand, State
Department desk officers may throw a wrench into planning because they
do not understand Defense Department strategy. [The United States needs
to operate continuously alongside allies and partners]{.underline}.
[**Leadership from the State Department** can increase the speed,
agility, and scale of defend forward activities and operations by
working through diplomatic channels to set the conditions for the United
States to operate by, with, and through foreign partners and their
networks in order to expose, contest, and defend against adversary cyber
aggression]{.underline}. **[Sustained diplomacy]{.underline}**
[can]{.underline} help [institutionalize these operational partnerships
and make **defend forward more anticipatory and
effective**]{.underline}. [Institutionalized cooperation,
including]{.underline} the conduct of joint and [coalition
operations]{.underline} and the development of agreed-upon legal and
policy frameworks, [is essential to prevail in long-term strategic
competition]{.underline}. [The State Department can set the conditions
for consensual foreign partner-enabled discovery operations]{.underline}
(i.e., "hunt forward" operations) through bilateral engagements.68 These
operations enable the United States and its partners to understand an
adversary's tactics, techniques, and procedures. [This will]{.underline}
in turn [enable network defense of U.S. partners, improve anticipatory
resilience of U.S. and partner networks, and thwart cyberspace
aggressio]{.underline}n. **[The State Department can scale the process
of]{.underline}** explaining the [Defense Department's]{.underline}
defend forward [strategy]{.underline}, enabling the United States to
proactively set the conditions for "hunt forward" operations. [The State
Department can also **actively ensure Defense Department cyber teams**
receive support from U.S. embassy country teams and benefit from
insights about foreign partner networks gained through State and
USAID-led cyber security capacity-building programs]{.underline}.

## SOLVENCY\-\--AI

### Solvency\-\--AI

#### State Department should be the central hub for [all]{.underline} AI foreign policy

**Dukeman 20**, senior fellow at FP21 and a Ph.D. student at Princeton
University, where he researches institutional reform in U.S. foreign
policy agencies. He previously helped found the U.S. State Department's
Center for Analytics (Ryan, "WINNING THE AI REVOLUTION FOR AMERICAN
DIPLOMACY," *War on the Rocks*,
https://warontherocks.com/2020/11/winning-the-ai-revolution-for-american-diplomacy/)//BB

**[The State Department Should Lead on AI]{.underline}**

[Why is diplomacy]{.underline} --- **[rather than defense]{.underline}**
or industrial policy --- [the right venue]{.underline} for advancing a
digital democracy agenda, or something like it**[?]{.underline}**
[Simply put, the multidimensional and transnational nature of AI
requires an integrated, strategic approach, and **diplomats are uniquely
skilled** in making policy across these issues more than the sum of
their piecemeal parts]{.underline}. To channel former French Prime
Minister Georges Clemenceau, [AI is too important to be left to the
generals]{.underline} --- or the technologists --- [alone]{.underline}.
So far, most of the government's focus on AI has been through research
and development investments at [the Defense Department]{.underline}, or
through White House Office of Science and Technology Policy efforts to
capitalize on it as an innovative economic windfall. Unfortunately, this
[approach]{.underline} --- including leaving much of the
intergovernmental norm-setting on AI to peer-to-peer military
discussions --- [misses the strategic forest for the tactical
trees]{.underline}. Issue-specific approaches that target global AI only
as a military tool or an economic boon have two dangerous flaws: [They
largely ignore AI as a human rights issue, and forsake the potential for
alliances and issue-linkage across policy areas]{.underline}. [For
example]{.underline}, existing [efforts]{.underline} have
**[fail]{.underline}**ed to leverage U.S. technological leadership to
advance global norms aligned with Western values, or [to use foreign
assistance to promote inclusive digital development at
scale]{.underline}. [The State Department's diplomats maintain a
**comparative advantage** over interagency peers in remedying exactly
these flaws. Diplomats are skilled in dealing with crosscutting global
problems, and well suited to play a leading, orchestrating role in
advancing a concerted American vision for AI across its economic,
security, and human rights aspects]{.underline}. In Washington, at their
posts, and [in multilateral organizations, diplomats spend much of their
days integrating peer agencies' competing perspectives to advance a
concerted U.S. agenda; leveraging instruments of national power such
as]{.underline} foreign aid, **[military assistance]{.underline}**, or
visa regulations [to advance disparate goals across different issues;
and negotiating in bilateral and multilateral fora on economic,
political, human rights, and military matters]{.underline}. [The State
Department's sustained leadership in international organizations, which
will play a major role in digital technology governance, is an
additional underutilized advantage]{.underline}. [The White House is
wrong not to include the State Department as a "**key agency**" in its
strategy on AI]{.underline}. In fact, [the department may be **the**
keystone agency]{.underline} --- [linking disparate, issue-specific
efforts together so the result is more than the sum of its
parts]{.underline}.

#### State Department leadership on AI solves before it can outpace restriction

**Burns 19**, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace and the author of The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy
and the Case for Its Renewal (Random House, 2019), from which portions
of this essay are adapted. He was a career diplomat in the U.S. State
Department for 33 years, serving as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State from
2011 to 2014. (William, "The Lost Art of American Diplomacy," *Foreign
Affairs*,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-03-27/lost-art-american-diplomacy)//BB

Reaffirming the foundations of American diplomacy is necessary but not
sufficient to make it effective for a new and demanding era. [The State
Department will also have to adapt]{.underline} in ways it never before
has, making sure that it is positioned to tackle the consequential tests
of tomorrow and not just the policy fads of today. It can begin by
taking a cue from the U.S. military's introspective bent. The Pentagon
has long embraced the value of case studies and after-action reports,
and it has formalized a culture of professional education. Career
diplomats, by contrast, have tended to pride themselves more on their
ability to adjust quickly to shifting circumstances than on paying
systematic attention to lessons learned and long-term thinking. As part
of a post-Trump reinvention of diplomacy, then, the State Department
ought to place a new emphasis on the craft, rediscovering diplomatic
history, sharpening negotiation skills, and making the lessons of
negotiations---both successful and unsuccessful---accessible to
practitioners. That means fully realizing the potential of new
initiatives such as the Foreign Service Institute's Center for the Study
of the Conduct of Diplomacy, where diplomats examine recent case
studies. [The U.S. government will]{.underline} also [have to update its
diplomatic capacity when it comes to the issues that matter to
twenty-first-century foreign
policy]{.underline}---[particularly]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**nology, economics, energy, and the climate. My
generation and its predecessor had plenty of specialists in nuclear arms
control and conventional energy issues; missile throw-weights and
oil-pricing mechanisms were not alien concepts. During my last few years
in government, however, I spent too much time sitting in meetings on the
seventh floor of the State Department and in the White House Situation
Room with smart, dedicated colleagues, all of us collectively faking it
on the intricacies of cyberwarfare or the geopolitics of data. [The pace
of advances in]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, machine learning, and synthetic biology
**[will]{.underline}** only **[increase]{.underline}** in the years
ahead, [outstripping the ability of states]{.underline} and societies
[to]{.underline} devise ways to maximize their benefits, minimize their
downsides, and [create workable international rules of the road. To
address these threats, the State Department **will have to take the
lead**]{.underline}---just as it did during the nuclear age---[building
legal and normative frameworks and ensuring that every new officer is
versed in these complex issues]{.underline}.

is a need for the AI triad of data, talent (to develop algorithms) and
computing power even to negotiate and represent national interest.

Department]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} **[plays a crucial role in
AI development and deployment]{.underline}**, [has provided policy
guidance to implement trustworthy AI programmes]{.underline} through the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) AI Policy
Observatory, a forum established in February 2021.

### Solvency\-\--AI Wars

#### State Department-led assistance solves AI [rules-for-engagement]{.underline} and escalation

**Blinken 21**, US Secretary of State ("Secretary Antony J. Blinken at
the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence's (NSCAI)
Global Emerging Technology Summit,"
<https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-the-national-security-commission-on-artificial-intelligences-nscai-global-emerging-technology-summit/)//BB>

We're moving quickly, because we want to ensure that as [AI]{.underline}
and related [technologies transform how we live]{.underline}, how we
work, how we compete, [how we defend ourselves]{.underline}, that
**[we're staying ahead of change]{.underline}**, indeed that we are
shaping change and, critically, making sure it delivers for our people.
My colleagues, I think, have very capably covered the administration's
work on these issues as it relates to our domestic renewal, our economy,
and our defense. So what I'd like to do today is to focus on the [State
Department's distinct role]{.underline}, because diplomacy **[will be
critical]{.underline}**. [Working with partners and allies to develop
and deploy technology is going to help us tackle the most urgent
challenges we face]{.underline}, from pandemics to the climate crisis.
[Diplomacy will]{.underline} also **[be essential]{.underline}** to
mitigating risks, [from preventing cyber attacks that target our
businesses, to regulating technology that threatens our privacy, to
defending our democratic values and way of life]{.underline}. And let me
just pause for a second on that last point, because I think it deserves
emphasis. It's fundamentally what's at stake here. More than anything
else, our task is to put forth and carry out a compelling vision for how
to use technology in a way that serves our people, protects our
interests and upholds our democratic values. It's not enough to
highlight the horrors of techno-authoritarianism, to point to what
countries like China and Russia are doing, and say that it's wrong and
dangerous, even as it is. [We've also got to make the positive case for
our own approach, and then we've got to deliver. That is the challenge
before us]{.underline}. [We need]{.underline} the United States and we
need its **[partners]{.underline}** to remain the world's innovative
leaders and standard setters, [to ensure that universal rights and
democratic values remain at the center of all the innovation that's to
come, and that it delivers real benefits in people's lives]{.underline}.
That fundamentally is the test that we have to pass, and it's a test I
think you've heard President Biden allude to. In short, [democracies
have to pass the tech test together]{.underline}. And
**[diplomacy]{.underline}**, I believe, **[has a big role to play in
that]{.underline}**. Now, any time you hear someone from the **[State
Department]{.underline}** talking, we're likely to throw in
**[pillars]{.underline}** and frameworks and tranches, so I can't be any
different today. We have to have our pillars, so let me walk you through
six of them -- (laughter) -- that cover the approach to these issues. I
know you'd be disappointed without it. [The]{.underline} first is
[reducing the national security risks posed by malicious cyber
activities and emerging technologies]{.underline}. This is the most
basic thing our diplomacy has to do: protect our people, protect our
networks, prevent conflict, and establish standards of responsible
conduct in cyberspace. Already, we've brought countries together around
an approach that recognizes international law to make it clear that
countries are governed in cyberspace just like they are offline and that
defines norms that apply not only in wartime but in peacetime too,
because we're now dealing with significant cyber incidents outside the
context of war. We've also called for practical confidence-building
measures; for example, steps as simple as establishing points of
contact, so that in the event of a major cyber incident we actually know
who to call. Under American leadership, UN member-states have come
together repeatedly to reaffirm this basic framework. Now [we're working
to bring allies and partners along to respond collectively]{.underline}
when others engage in malicious cyber activity. [That's what happened
after the SolarWinds intrusion]{.underline}. We attributed it to Russia;
22 countries, the European Union, **[NATO quickly supported that
conclusion]{.underline}**. **[And that's important]{.underline}**,
because when we speak with one voice, we can more effectively deter
future bad acts. Last month, as some of you will have noted, at the NATO
summit, NATO reaffirmed that a cyber attack could trigger Article V --
"an attack on one is an attack on all" -- and that's an important step
too in deterring those attacks and protecting our national security in
the cyber age. [We're also treating ransomware not only as a law
enforcement issue but also as a national security issue]{.underline}.
Ransomware and other cyber crimes affect all of us -- our businesses,
local governments; our most critical infrastructure, from power grids to
hospitals. As you know, one in four Americans has been the victim of a
cyber crime, at a cost of more than \$4 billion every single year.
That's a direct threat to the safety, to the well-being of our people,
and so it's at the top of our diplomatic agenda. And it's also why we're
elevating ransomware in our engagements with Russia. [Our message is
clear: Countries that harbor cyber criminals have a responsibility to
take action.]{.underline} [If they don't, we will]{.underline}. We're
**[strengthen]{.underline}**ing our diplomatic and **[foreign assistance
tools]{.underline}** to fight transnational cyber criminals, and we're
working to expand membership in the global cyber crime treaty known as
the Budapest Convention. We'll launch similar efforts **[on
AI]{.underline}** and other emerging technologies. If they're going to
be used as part of our national defense, [we want the world to have a
shared understanding of how to do that responsibly, in the same way that
we've hammered out rules for how to use conventional and nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. [That's how we **reduce the risk of
proliferation**. It's how we prevent **escalation or unintended
incidents**]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Military Bad\-\--Private Involvement

#### Military-based AI cooperation fails. Public opposition and major private firms will refuse to cooperation.

Lin-**Greenberg 20**, postdoctoral fellow at the University of
Pennsylvania's Perry World House (Erik, "Allies and Artificial
Intelligence: Obstacles to Operations and Decision-Making," *Texas
National Security Review*, 3.2)//BB

[Tepid public support at home and abroad can stymie **alliance military
operations**]{.underline} in two ways. First, [public opposition to the
use of AI among allied populations may lead policymakers to restrict the
use of AI-enabled technologies for military operations]{.underline}. In
the event of future hostilities, for example, the South Korean or
[German governments might oppose an ally's use of
AI-enabled]{.underline} lethal weapon [systems]{.underline} on their
territory.60 Indeed, advocacy from the public and activist groups has
led a growing number of states --- including U.S. allies like Pakistan
and Jordan --- to call for bans on the use of lethal autonomous weapon
systems.61 Second, [civilian engineers and researchers that develop AI
technology may refuse to work on **military AI contracts**. Disruptions
to AI development can hinder the fielding of new capabilities and
generate mistrust between the government and civilian firms. Google
employees]{.underline}, for instance, [protested]{.underline} their
[involvement in]{.underline} Project Maven, a **[Defense
Department]{.underline}** program that uses **[AI]{.underline}** to
analyze video collected by military drones.62 In a letter to their CEO,
the employees argued that "Google should not be in the business of war,"
explaining that the company should not "outsource the moral
responsibility of \[its\] technologies to third parties," and that work
on Defense Department-backed AI would "irreparably damage Google's
brand."63 [The resistance ultimately led Google to **terminate** its
involvement in the contract and generated public criticism of the
Defense Department's AI efforts]{.underline}.64

## SOLVENCY\-\--BIOTECH

### Solvency\-\--Biotech

#### State Department leadership on advanced biotech solves

**Burns 19**, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace and the author of The Back Channel: A Memoir of American Diplomacy
and the Case for Its Renewal (Random House, 2019), from which portions
of this essay are adapted. He was a career diplomat in the U.S. State
Department for 33 years, serving as U.S. Deputy Secretary of State from
2011 to 2014. (William, "The Lost Art of American Diplomacy," *Foreign
Affairs*,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-03-27/lost-art-american-diplomacy)//BB

Reaffirming the foundations of American diplomacy is necessary but not
sufficient to make it effective for a new and demanding era. [The State
Department will also have to adapt]{.underline} in ways it never before
has, making sure that it is positioned to tackle the consequential tests
of tomorrow and not just the policy fads of today. It can begin by
taking a cue from the U.S. military's introspective bent. The Pentagon
has long embraced the value of case studies and after-action reports,
and it has formalized a culture of professional education. Career
diplomats, by contrast, have tended to pride themselves more on their
ability to adjust quickly to shifting circumstances than on paying
systematic attention to lessons learned and long-term thinking. As part
of a post-Trump reinvention of diplomacy, then, the State Department
ought to place a new emphasis on the craft, rediscovering diplomatic
history, sharpening negotiation skills, and making the lessons of
negotiations---both successful and unsuccessful---accessible to
practitioners. That means fully realizing the potential of new
initiatives such as the Foreign Service Institute's Center for the Study
of the Conduct of Diplomacy, where diplomats examine recent case
studies. [The U.S. government will]{.underline} also [have to update its
diplomatic capacity when it comes to the issues that matter to
twenty-first-century foreign
policy]{.underline}---[particularly]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**nology, economics, energy, and the climate. My
generation and its predecessor had plenty of specialists in nuclear arms
control and conventional energy issues; missile throw-weights and
oil-pricing mechanisms were not alien concepts. During my last few years
in government, however, I spent too much time sitting in meetings on the
seventh floor of the State Department and in the White House Situation
Room with smart, dedicated colleagues, all of us collectively faking it
on the intricacies of cyberwarfare or the geopolitics of data. [The pace
of advances in]{.underline} artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and **[synthetic biology will]{.underline}** only
**[increase]{.underline}** in the years ahead, [outstripping the ability
of states]{.underline} and societies [to]{.underline} devise ways to
maximize their benefits, minimize their downsides, and [create workable
international rules of the road. To address these threats, the State
Department **will have to take the lead**]{.underline}---just as it did
during the nuclear age---[building legal and normative frameworks and
ensuring that every new officer is versed in these complex
issues]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Biotech\-\--Expertise

#### The State Department has the expertise and leadership to promote biotech diplomacy

**Bade 22**, tech and policy analyst @ Eurasia Group (Scott, "Digital
diplomacy gets a reboot," Tech Crunch,
<https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/08/digital-diplomacy-gets-a-reboot/>)//BB

CDP \[[Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy]{.underline}\] [will have
three policy buckets: international cyber security, digital policy and
digital freedom]{.underline}. Each roughly corresponds to preexisting
competencies: the cyber coordinator office (created back in 2011), the
Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs and the Bureau of Democracy,
Human Rights and Labor, respectively. It will be run by a
yet-to-be-confirmed ambassador-at-large; in the meantime, career
diplomat Jennifer Bachus will run the team as principal deputy assistant
secretary. While the new bureau [will]{.underline} deal with the
day-to-day, a separate special envoy position will also [be created to
focus on]{.underline} more long-term issues around [emerging and
critical technologies like]{.underline} AI, quantum and
**[biotechnology]{.underline}**. Missing in action no more? [The
"decision to stand up a new bureau is an indicator of how seriously
\[the Biden administration\] sees these threats]{.underline}," Eileen
Donahoe, a former U.S. ambassador who now runs the Stanford Global
Digital Policy Incubator, tells me. "[They understand the need for more
thought leadership and diplomatic capacity]{.underline}." One sign of
that seriousness is that both offices will, for at least a year, report
directly to Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the department's
number two official. This is a good thing, says Chris Painter, who was
the Obama administration's top diplomat on cyber issues. Sherman, he
says, has a long history with cyber issues and worked to integrate
technology issues at regional bureaus she ran earlier in her career. CDP
will need that high-level support. [The State Department is]{.underline}
playing catch up, I'm told, and [attempting to bring its expertise ---
diplomacy and knowledge of international relations --- to more technical
policymakers]{.underline} at the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and
other agencies. The implication is clear: [State's voice has been
missing]{.underline} in the interagency process and opportunities have
been missed both [at home and abroad]{.underline}. For example, as Nate
Picarsic and Emily de la Bruyère have written, the U.S. has been largely
absent from the politics of the intergovernmental organizations that are
quietly setting the global standards of technology. As a result the U.S.
has ceded ground to others, especially Russia and China, but even the
European Union, with massive implications for who controls the future of
technology. And as new international entities emerge, like the EU-U.S.
Trade and Technology Council or the Quad's technology working group,
[the State Department needs to be able to coordinate and
advise]{.underline}. Under the Trump administration, you "had good,
talented people," working these issues, Painter tells me, "but no one at
the leadership level \[able\] both to deal with the White House and
senior counterparts and foreign counterparts. \[[**The new bureau**\]
helps fill that gap]{.underline}." "[This is a real down payment by the
department]{.underline}," says Yll Bajraktari, a former national
security official who is now the CEO of Special Competitive Studies
Project, an AI advocacy group. "[Integrating the department's capacity
for cybersecurity, digital infrastructure and governance issues
including internet freedom will help create a coherent diplomatic
strategy]{.underline}."

### Solvency\-\--Biotech\-\--Norms/Cooperation

#### State Department leadership solves biosecurity norms and cooperation

**Jenkins 22**, US Ambassador, UNDER SECRETARY FOR ARMS CONTROL AND
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY (Denise, "Priorities Regarding the New and
Emerging Challenges to International Security," Department of State,
<https://www.state.gov/priorities-regarding-the-new-and-emerging-challenges-to-international-security/>)

Last Spring, Secretary [Blinken set out the]{.underline}
[Biden]{.underline}-Harris Administration's [vision of a foreign policy
that **leads with diplomacy**]{.underline}, revitalizes our global
network of alliances to meet emerging global challenges, and delivers
for the American people. It is a vison, as the Secretary noted, that
springs from two fundamental principles: that American leadership and
engagement matters, and those countries need to engage and cooperate,
now more than ever. [It is the role of the State Department]{.underline}
-- and America's diplomats and development workers --
**[to]{.underline}** engage around the world and **[build]{.underline}**
that **[cooperation]{.underline}**. Today, I am happy to be here to
present my priorities as Under Secretary of Arms Control and
International Security; known inside of the State Department as 'T.' The
ideas I list today are in light of the many changes that we see in the
international security landscape. I chose today to present my
priorities, just as we mark the 50th Anniversary of the signing of the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) in 1972. To me, it is a
humbling reminder that even as we face monumental international security
challenges today, our predecessors prevailed through the power of
diplomacy. In everything we do, we will look not only to make progress
on short-term problems, but also to address their root causes and lay
the groundwork for our long-term strength. I should note that while I am
presenting these ideas, adjustments will be made as we continue to
better understand the changes that are taking place and the security
environment around us settles. Little did we know last year at the
beginning of the Biden Administration that Putin would invade Ukraine.
Things are continuing to change on a large scale. Some of today's arms
control and international security landscape remains the same, such as
the DPRK's insistence on advancing its unlawful weapons of mass
destruction and ballistic missile programs and refusing to engage in
diplomacy. The future of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
still the most viable option to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear
weapon, remains unclear. We remain strongly committed to our efforts
regarding both the DPRK and the JCPOA. In the meantime, there are other
changes -- like Russia's brutal and unprovoked war in Ukraine and the
growing challenges posed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) -- that
present us with many more questions than answers. Now is the time to
consider a new way to address what are new challenges. Russia's
unprovoked invasion has led us to consider what gaps now exist. What
does the new landscape mean for us and the issues within T such as arms
control, deterrence, nonproliferation, security assistance, and emerging
technologies? The People's Republic of China is also posing new
challenges in many areas of our responsibility. How do we address those
challenges? Technology is advancing, as are the opportunities and
challenges posed by an increased interest in space, while at the same
time, climate change and resource limitations can lead to conflict if
not addressed. We need to focus on the headlines of today, while keeping
an eye on the trendlines for the challenges to come. The T Family is
comprised of three Bureaus: The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification,
and Compliance, the Bureau of International Security and
Nonproliferation, and the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It is my
honor to lead these Bureaus and work closely with their leadership to
use our diplomatic engagements and programs and when needed, sanctions
and other pressure, working with the interagency, to implement these
priorities of mine. Let me give you a preview. I have nine priorities.
They are as follows: Fortify Arms Control, Nonproliferation,
Disarmament, and Related Activities Reimagine Security Sector Governance
(SSG) and Security Assistance Address Emerging Technologies from a
National Security Perspective Protect and promote the U.S. and Allies
Technological, Military, and Economic Advantages Promote, protect, and
advance the U.S. Civil -- Nuclear Industry Strengthen Existing Alliances
and Partnerships and Establish New Partnerships Building the "T Family
Brain Trust" to Address New and Emerging Challenges to International
Security Examine "New" Areas of Conflict in International Security
Strengthen and Amplify the T Bureaus The three T Bureaus are developing
or will develop a way forward on these priorities, including new
priorities I have asked them to incorporate. While these are my
priorities, I note that all of the work of the Bureaus are important to
the U.S. and to international security. Priority One: Fortify Arms
Control, Nonproliferation, Disarmament, and Related Activities The T
Family will continue to engage the international community in
strengthening existing arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament
regimes, and related activities, including in light of recent challenges
to those regimes. This includes, where possible, meaningful engagements
and dialogues with Russia and the People's Republic of China. I have
worked in the areas of arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament
for 30 years and I can say that arms control remains as important today
as it ever was. While there have certainly been challenges to and
violations of international arms control agreements by a handful of
countries, arms control is not dead as some would like you to believe.
Arms control remains an important means to increase allied and global
security by reducing risk and enhancing stability. The importance of
arms control will also grow as we face competitors pursuing reckless and
destabilizing buildups of their nuclear forces combined with opaque,
nontransparent nuclear use doctrines. However, progress can only be made
in a situation of de-escalation, not escalation. In all cases, we need
willing partners sitting across and around the table. We remain
committed to the implementation of New START and eventually getting back
to the table to continue the dialogue on laying the groundwork for
future arms control and to the pursuit of follow-on measures to the New
START treaty. As you know, following Russia's unprovoked and brutal war
of aggression against Ukraine, we have suspended our Strategic Stability
Dialogue (SSD). That said, the issues that have been laid out prior to
Russia's further invasion of Ukraine are even more important now. In
that respect, we want to sustain limits on the Russian systems covered
under New START beyond 2026, limit the new kinds of nuclear weapons
Russia has fielded or is developing, and address all nuclear weapons
including Russian non-strategic nuclear weapons. We must also be
flexible as we consider the ways in which we pursue risk reduction and
future arms control measures. We will be looking at the different types
of forms these efforts can take, including but not be limited to a
traditional approach of focusing on negotiating treaties. The way
forward in this new international security landscape may be in the form
of initiatives like the U.S. voluntary commitment not to conduct
destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing recently
announced by Vice President Harris, or codes of conduct, or best
practices. We can see from the current crisis that the security
environment remains complex and is becoming more complex. There is no
single, elegant solution to managing nuclear or other 21st century
risks. The U.S. is prepared to be creative in finding ways forward and
partnering with others to make the world safer. That is what being a
leader in arms control is about. On nuclear disarmament, we remain
committed to a world without nuclear weapons in the context of enhancing
international security overall. While our concerns about the ability of
the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) to achieve its
goals have not changed, we remain committed to engaging in pragmatic
efforts to pursue effective measures related to nuclear disarmament.
This includes work conducted by the International Partnership for
Nuclear Disarmament Verification (IPNDV), the Creating an Environment
for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND), the Stockholm Initiative for Nuclear
Disarmament, and the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI),
with whom we work closely. We support the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) and will work to achieve its entry force while maintaining
our moratorium on nuclear explosive testing. We also continue to seek
negotiations on a cut-off in the production of fissile material for use
in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and call on all
relevant countries to join us in declaring and maintaining a moratorium
on such production. We will also continue to work with our P5
colleagues, circumstances permitting, to strengthen the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and its three pillars. The U.S. assumes
coordination of the P5 Process in June, and we hope to build on previous
efforts. The recent P5 statement on the prevention of nuclear war is a
good example of the important work we can do together; we must hold each
other to those commitments. We will put renewed focus on these efforts
and now that travel restrictions have lifted, we are looking at when we
can meet face to face with partners in these forums and discuss ways to
move ahead, especially taking into account how the Kremlin's further
invasion of Ukraine has impacted the landscape of that work. Indeed,
Russia's nuclear saber-rattling only underscores the importance of
preserving the record of non-use of nuclear weapons. Our Bureaus will
also continue to lead efforts to maximize support for enhanced
verification capabilities throughout the U.S. government by partnering
with the interagency, academia, the scientific community,
non-Governmental Organizations, private industry, and others. There are
other new challenges that require continued attention. The People's
Republic of China (PRC) is rapidly building up a larger, more diverse
nuclear arsenal. The accelerating pace of the PRC's nuclear expansion
may enable it to have up to 700 nuclear warheads by 2027. The PRC likely
intends to have at least 1,000 warheads by 2030, exceeding the estimated
size that the United States projected just two years ago in 2020. As I
noted in my speech last year at the NATO Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMD) Conference, and it remains true to this day, the U.S. continues to
request that the PRC be more transparent about the purpose and direction
of its nuclear strategy. There is currently no formal dialogue between
our governments on this subject, and limited tools are available to
mitigate risk and prevent crisis escalation with the PRC. We will
continue to seek engagement with appropriate PRC officials on risk
reduction. As you know, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Review
Conference, or NPT RevCon, will at long last take place in August in New
York. With the Russian government's reckless and destabilizing rhetoric,
it is more important now than ever for all States Parties to reaffirm
the importance of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and recommit to
its goals. The August NPT RevCon provides an opportunity to do that.
While the U.S. recognizes the challenges that Russia's actions pose to
the NPT, we will emphasize practical actions responsible nuclear powers
can take to reduce nuclear risks and pursue a realistic path on arms
control and disarmament, and to ensure that all NPT Parties can realize
its full benefits. The RevCon presents an opportunity to reflect both on
how much has been accomplished and on what can and must be done to
preserve and extend that progress. The NPT remains instrumental in
limiting the risk of nuclear war by avoiding a cascade of nuclear
proliferation and laying the groundwork for progress on disarmament. The
U.S. will use the Review Conference to promote its objectives in all
three of the NPT's pillars -- the areas of nonproliferation and
strengthened safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and nuclear
disarmament. We plan to find areas of common ground on measures to
reduce the risks of nuclear war and a positive dialogue among Nuclear
Weapons States (NWS) and Non-Nuclear Weapons States (NNWS). The U.S. is
also committed to the third pillar of the NPT -- the peaceful uses of
nuclear energy, science, and technology. In that respect, the U.S. and
the UK have co-led an effort to build a multilateral deliverable, called
the "Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful Uses," to promote peaceful uses of
nuclear energy, science, and technology. The Sustained Dialogue aims to
integrate non-traditional stakeholders in the NPT process to promote
broader acceptance of peaceful uses as a solution to development
challenges and to create a lasting framework that better captures
peaceful use assistance as a dividend of the NPT. It provides a benefit
of the NPT that often gets overshadowed by political debates on nuclear
disarmament and nonproliferation. Here, I want to thank my colleagues,
Ambassador Adam Scheinman, Special Representative of the President for
Nuclear Nonproliferation, for his leadership as we prepare for the NPT
Review Conference, and for the work that former Assistant Secretary Tom
Countryman has accomplished since he agreed to return to us and assist
in this process. We also see the Review Conference as an opportunity to
recognize the continued need for a strong International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) and its work on safeguards, safety, and security. The IAEA
has been doing significant work in the area of peaceful uses as well as
in other areas of concern, including convening the recent first Review
Conference of the Amended Convention on the Physical Protection of
Nuclear Materials, its work on cybersecurity, on nuclear law, and in
other areas. Strong U.S. leadership on nonproliferation will also
involve continuing to promote the combination of an IAEA Comprehensive
Safeguards Agreement and an Additional Protocol (AP) as the de facto
international standard for verifying that nuclear material is not
diverted from peaceful uses. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the
AP, and so now is the time to reinvigorate our efforts in support of its
universal adoption. We will also reiterate our support for the
negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) and for all
states to halt production of fissile material for use in nuclear
weapons. Moving on to the other important areas in priority one, [there
is a renewed focus on]{.underline} the **[Biological]{.underline}**
**[Weapons]{.underline}** Convention (BWC). As I noted at the Conference
on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva last year, for the past two decades,
efforts to strengthen the Convention have been treading water. States
Parties have been unable to agree to significant action. We face a
biological weapons threat that is real and, in many respects, growing.
Some states continue to possess sophisticated, well-established
biological weapons programs, while non-state actors have shown
continuing interest in acquiring biological weapons capabilities.
Additionally, the widespread availability of sophisticated scientific
and technological tools and methods is gradually eroding barriers to the
development of biological weapons. COVID-19 is a wake-up call for all of
us. The astonishing human toll of the pandemic has illustrated our
shared vulnerability to novel pathogens. In Geneva, I noted a
two-pronged approach. [The]{.underline} Review [Conference should take
near-term, concrete action]{.underline} to strengthen the Convention and
benefit States Parties. These actions include further
**[operationalizing assistance]{.underline}** under Article VII;
**[establishing a voluntary fund for technical
cooperation]{.underline}**; **[creating a mechanism to review advances
in science and technology]{.underline}**; **[deepening collaborations on
biosafety and biosecurity]{.underline}**; [staffing the Implementation
Support Unit to carry out these roles]{.underline}; [and enabling more
agile decision making]{.underline}. The second way forward is for the
Review Conference to take steps to address the harder issues. It should
establish a new expert working group to examine possible measures to
strengthen implementation of the Convention, increase transparency, and
enhance assurance of compliance. I was very happy this year to appoint a
new BWC Special Representative and Deputy Special Representative to lead
the government's engagements on the BWC. I am pleased that the States
Parties reached consensus to delay the Review Conference until November,
which allows time for the newly nominated RevCon President to prepare
for the meeting. Our Special Representative Ken Ward will spend the next
few months working closely with allies and like-minded countries as we
turn our broad concepts into specific proposals. [Along with this effort
is work by my team to enhance biosafety and biosecurity norms,
practices, tools, and resources to bolster cooperation]{.underline} in
forums such as the BWC, Global Partnership, and the Global Health
Security Agenda. We will work to ensure the tools needed to address
these challenges have the attention and resources needed to confront
biological challenges. We will work to build national capacity to
mitigate biological threats. Regarding the Chemical Weapons Convention
or CWC, the United States is on track to complete destruction of its
chemical weapons by September 2023, and we have destroyed over 97
percent of our fully declared stockpile. Given the potential chemical
weapons threat to Ukraine, the United States is again leading and
working closely with allies and partners. I am proud of the bilateral
security assistance that the United States has provided to Ukraine,
including over \$100 million in life-saving protective and detection
equipment and related medical countermeasures, in addition to funds
provided to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) that will be used to assist Ukraine to protect against the threat
of chemical weapons. [The Bureau]{.underline} of Arms Control,
Verification, and Compliance is also continuing to work with the OPCW to
hold Russia and Syria accountable for their past chemical weapons use
and to deter further use. We look forward to additional OPCW reports
this summer from its Investigation and Identification Team that will
identify those responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. The
Bureau will continue to make advances in chemical forensics to improve
the ability of the United States, allies, partners, and the OPCW to
attribute the use of chemical weapons. The CWC States Parties Review
Conference in 2023 is another opportunity for States Parties to reaffirm
their commitment to the CWC and its implementation. We are now
considering our goals for the Review Conference to advance its work. In
all our work, we will continue to combat disinformation against U.S.
activities and engagements. The U.S. [has been a leader in the
development of conventional arms control instruments]{.underline},
including the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the
Vienna Document on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures. Despite
Russia's war on Ukraine, we continue to see a role for conventional arms
control in the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond. This kind of arms
control can enhance mutual confidence and transparency among states and
reduce the risk of conflict. The Bureau of Arms Control, Verification,
and Compliance continues to support full compliance with existing
conventional arms control agreements and the development of new ideas
for future confidence- and security-building mechanisms, including the
modernization of the Vienna Document to reflect the new
political-military realities in Europe. It is important to have a base
of existing conventional arms control instruments that we can build on
to restore a more enduring peace. Moving on to fortifying related
activities as I also noted in this priority, we will enhance the role of
export controls and counter proliferation measures in preventing the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems,
destabilizing advanced conventional weapons, and related technologies.
The multilateral export control regimes -- Missile Technology Control
Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement, and Australia
Group -- remain important bodies through which we work with our allies
and partners to address proliferation challenges. The regimes protect
nonproliferation imperatives while providing predictability for
exporters and are the basis for preventing advanced technologies from
falling into adversarial competitors. These regimes and institutions
must adjust to the challenges in the international security landscape.
[We will enhance U.S. leadership in these regimes and institutions and
advance novel approaches to the challenges each regime
face]{.underline}. We will also support the important work of [the
Bureau of International Security]{.underline} and Nonproliferation's
programmatic [offices]{.underline} that [promote adherence to the
regimes' guidance]{.underline} and updates to the control lists among
non-member countries, [thereby expanding the reach of nonproliferation
norms]{.underline}. In that respect, I commend you to go online and
learn more about the extensive programmatic work of the T Bureaus.

## AFFIRMATIVE

### Perm Do Both

#### Military assistance [does not]{.underline} trade off with State Department involvement

**Early 11**, Lt Col, USAF (Billie, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," *Air War College*,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf>)//BB

When the three indicators of militarization are applied to DOD's
security assistance efforts, results indicate that [the United States
relies **heavily** on DOD to pursue foreign policy objectives, but **not
at the expense** of State Department responsibilities. DOD uses security
cooperation to build relationships with partner nations and respond to
humanitarian efforts, and uses security assistance as a flexible tool to
build the capacity of foreign military forces so they can respond to
threats in their regions before conditions require a greater US military
response]{.underline}. Whenever possible, [DOD proactively shapes the
global security environment promoting US interests. DOD has the option
to use its new Section 1206 authority to respond to urgent and emerging
threats based on regional command priorities, or to influence
longer-term State Department programs in support of country
requirements]{.underline}. Also, [DOD's considerable force presence and
commander influence can sway security assistance decisions favorably
toward US interests. However, the State Department maintains a **high
degree of direct involvement** and oversight in all security assistance
decisions]{.underline}.

#### Close collaboration is good

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[A key aspect of the success of the security cooperation enterprise is
the **collaboration** among and within the Department, most notably
DoD's close **collaboration** with the State Department ensures that
programs are designed and executed with broader national security
interests in mind]{.underline}. Internal to the Department of Defense,
we recently reorganized -- bringing the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency under the umbrella of Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities in the
Office of the Secretary of the Defense for Policy to facilitate better
collaboration and coordination. Success requires teamwork, and I can
assure you that our entire team is focused on embracing it.

### Perm Do CP

#### Security cooperation includes the DOS

MAJ Nicholas R. **Simontis, 13** - U.S. Army School of Advanced Military
Studies United States Army Command and General Staff College Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas "SECURITY COOPERATION: AN OLD PRACTICE FOR NEW
TIMES" <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA589722.pdf>

How we deal with our adversaries is changing in response to these
developments in the security environment. How we deal with our
international allies and partners also should change. [For many years,
the term "security cooperation" referred to efforts by the]{.underline}
Department of Defense [(DOD) to promote U.S. security]{.underline}
interests through the interaction with and development of friendly and
allied security capabilities.2 [This definition is
evolving]{.underline}, however, [as illustrated by recent strategic
documents and statements by the President and Secretary of
Defense.]{.underline}3 [The term as used recently includes synchronized
efforts by the whole-of-government to build the security
capacity]{.underline} of U.S. friends and allies, [including the
development of economic and political capabilities]{.underline}. The
most recent strategic guidance calls for increased emphasis on an
interagency and interorganizational approach to building partner
capacity and capability, focused on promoting stability and preventing
conflict before it begins, all within a framework that emphasizes
governance and rule of law. Put another way, recent strategic guidance
advocates a whole-of-government approach as the means for translating
national security objectives into the outcome of increased partner
capacity. This change represents recognition that a wide variety of
skill sets is necessary to address these changes in the security
environment. Unfortunately, this change presents challenges for current
security cooperation practices.

The current structure of security cooperation, that is, the
infrastructure of government agencies that participate in security
cooperation activities, does not readily support this new guidance. The
current security cooperation organization originated in the aftermath of
World War II, and continued to evolve through the Cold War. Although the
Department of State ([DOS) has responsibility for planning and executing
security cooperation]{.underline}, the system primarily addresses the
military component of security in terms of equipment and training. The
DOD, under the auspices of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) executes these portions of U.S. Security cooperation endeavors,
which constitute the preponderance of efforts, both in terms of labor
and fund allocation. Furthermore, the DOD's share has grown considerably
in the past five years as Congress significantly increased funding
authorities in order to facilitate stabilization in Iraq and
Afghanistan.4 **[The key issue]{.underline}**, then, [is how to shift
the emphasis from the Department of Defense to efforts shared among
Defense, State, USAID, and other agencies]{.underline} as needed.

#### State [controls]{.underline} security cooperation -- all DOD SC is carried out through embassies under [direct]{.underline} supervision of State

Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Who Conducts Security Cooperation]{.underline}

The following paragraphs describe the key participants and stakeholders
for planning and

managing SC activities at both the strategic, operational, and tactical
levels.

Strategic / National Level

The National Security Council (NSC) generally provides the initial
guidance and translation of national-level decisions pertaining to FID,
SA, and SC. The Department of [State]{.underline} (DoS) [is]{.underline}
generally [the lead]{.underline} government [agency for U.S.
international affairs]{.underline}. The Secretary of State advises the
President in forming foreign policy, including the national FID effort.
The DoS assists the NSC in building national FID related policies and
priorities, and is the lead government agency to carry out these
policies. [The DoS Policy Planning Staff, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs]{.underline} ([PM)]{.underline}, and the new Bureau of Conflict
and Stabilization Operations (CSO) [are the most involved with
interagency planning for]{.underline} FID, [SA, and SC.]{.underline} The
Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security is
the principal advisor and focal point for SA matters within DoS; control
and coordination of SA extends from this office to the Assistant
Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. At the national
level, the PM is the principal channel of liaison between DoS and DoD.
Generally, [DoS directs the overall U.S. Government]{.underline} (USG)
[SA program and DoD executes via SC programs and
activities]{.underline}.

DoD Directive 5132.03, Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, dated October 24, 2008, establishes DoD policy and assigns
responsibilities under the GEF, which provides SC guidance to the GCCs,
and titles 10 and 22 of the United States Code (USC), and statutory
authorities, executive orders, and policies relating to the
administration of SC, including SA programs authorized by the FAA and
AECA, as amended. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy USD(P)
serves as the principal staff assistant and advisor to the Secretary of
Defense on all SC matters. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Global
Security Affairs) establishes SA policy and supervises SA programs
through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The Secretaries
of the Military Departments (MILDEPs) coordinate on SC policy guidance,
campaign plans, and allocate resources to achieve SC objectives. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) provides implementation
guidance for U.S. military plans and programs and provides the Secretary
of Defense with military advice concerning SC.15

Operational and Tactical Level

The Director, DSCA, under the authority, direction, and control of the
USD(P), directs,

administers, and provides DoD-wide guidance to the DoD Components and
DoD representatives

to U.S. missions, for the execution of DoD SC programs for which DSCA
has responsibility.

Other security SC programs are managed by other Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the

GCCs, or MILDEPs. Specifically, GCCs develop campaign plans to conduct
SC programs and

activities in accordance with the GEF, and complete campaign plan and
campaign support plan

assessments.16

[The U.S. diplomatic mission to a host nation includes representatives
of all U.S. departments and agencies physically present in a
country]{.underline}. [The President gives the Chief of
Mission]{.underline} (COM), normally **[an ambassador]{.underline}**,
[full responsibility for the direction, coordination, and supervision of
**all** USG executive branch employees in country]{.underline}. The COM
has authority over all USG executive branch employees within the mission
and host country except for employees under the command of a U.S.
military commander (Title 22, USC, Section 3927).17 [The Senior Defense
Official]{.underline} (SDO) or Defense Attaché (DATT) [is the principal
DoD official in a U.S. embassy]{.underline}, as designated by the
Secretary of Defense. The SDO or DATT is the COM's principal military
advisor on defense and national security issues, the senior
diplomatically accredited DoD military officer assigned to a diplomatic
mission, and the single point of contact for all DoD matters involving
the embassy or DoD elements assigned to or working from the embassy. In
addition to being the diplomatically accredited DATT, [the SDO is the
chief of the Security Cooperation Organization]{.underline} (SCO)
[within the Country Team. The SCO includes all DoD elements located in a
foreign country with assigned responsibilities for carrying out SA and
SC management functions]{.underline} under titles 22 and 10 USC. SCOs
typically include military assistance advisory groups, military missions
and groups, offices of defense and military cooperation, liaison groups,
and defense attaché personnel designated to perform security
assistance/cooperation functions.18

#### Substantial security cooperation is funded and controlled by State

Lieutenant Colonel Toney **Filostrat and** Lieutenant Colonel Elizabeth
A. **Medina,** United States Army, **12** -- paper written for the
Harvard Kennedy School of Government National Security Fellowship
Program ("SMART TOOLS: Integrating Security Cooperation and Foreign
Assistance in a Period of Constrained Resources"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA568436.pdf> **SC = Security
Cooperation. SA = Security Assistance. FID = Foreign Internal Defense
assistance**

[Significant portions of U.S. military security cooperation are funded
as foreign assistance activities managed by the Department of
State]{.underline}, and appropriated by Congress. With the amount of
funding in the Defense appropriations bills, [it's not common knowledge
that these military programs are funded under DoS budget
authorities]{.underline}. The State Department has always taken its lead
role on foreign assistance seriously, as a significant foreign policy
tool. Over the past ten years, DoS focused on substantial internal
reforms including foreign assistance planning and implementation. The
U.S. government struggles to prepare for a future of persistent conflict
and budget constraints. It is important to solidify reforms and
institutionalize the integrating actions planned in the Quadrennial
Diplomacy and Development Review and the 3D Planning Framework to
implement effective and efficient foreign assistance activities.

### No Solvency\-\--Top-Shelf

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

### No Solvency\-\--Risk Aversion/Resources

#### Benghazi created excessive risk aversion

**Hartig 21**, Executive Editor of Just Security. He is also Executive
Director of National Journal\'s Network Science Initiative and Fellow,
International Security Program at New America. Former Senior Director
for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council, former Deputy
Director for Counterterrorism Operations in the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (Luke, "Letting Diplomacy Lead US Counterterrorism: What
Would That Look Like?," Just Security,
<https://www.justsecurity.org/75046/letting-diplomacy-lead-us-counterterrorism-what-would-that-look-like/)//BB>

But [State Department management]{.underline} -- and the broader U.S.
government leadership -- [has]{.underline} at times [**struggled** with
how to effectively manage risk. Much of this is because of the highly
politicized environment the department found itself in after the
September 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya]{.underline}. To be sure,
[**Benghazi** exposed shortcomings]{.underline}, particularly in how the
State Department's security professionals plugged into policy
discussions. But it also spurred much-needed changes to how the
department trains its personnel and evaluates risks overseas. Yet, [as
Republicans used the attacks to launch escalating political attacks, the
U.S. government seemed to **retreat into a bunker
mentality**]{.underline}.

#### That, combined with understaffing, decimates solvency

**David**, Acosta and Krohley **21**, Colonel Arnel P. David is a US
Army strategist assigned to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. First
Sergeant Sean A. Acosta is a civil affairs noncommissioned officer, and
was the US Army's 2018 NCO of the year. Dr. Nicholas Krohley is the
principal of FrontLine Advisory. ("GETTING COMPETITION WRONG: THE US
MILITARY'S LOOMING FAILURE," *Modern War Institute*,
<https://mwi.usma.edu/getting-competition-wrong-the-us-militarys-looming-failure/>)//BB

At present, [we are engaged in global competition with China
(and]{.underline}, to a much lesser extent, [Russia]{.underline}). We
are engaged in a regional contest with Iran. Global jihadist networks
remain a potent threat. That said, we do ourselves a devastating
disservice when we approach the rest of the world on the basis of its
utility in these contests. American policy in Ukraine is downstream of
our rivalry with Russia. The same is true for our engagement in Iraq
with respect to Iran, and across much of the Global South vis-à-vis
China. We instrumentalize bilateral relationships with smaller powers in
pursuit of advantage against our rivals, while neglecting the local
details that define the strategic landscape. This instrumentalization is
readily apparent to those on the receiving end, provoking cynicism and
frustration from Kyiv to Baghdad and beyond. Ultimately, it is
exploitative and self-defeating---just as it was during the Cold War,
when this same mentality led us to disaster from Vietnam to Nicaragua.
[The new great game will be won or lost based, above all else, on
contextual understanding, partnerships, and alliances]{.underline}. It
is not America's responsibility to solve intractable problems in distant
lands. However, we absolutely must understand said problems (as we have
demonstrably failed to do over the past twenty years), so that we might
manage our entanglements and the expenditure of finite resources.
[Across much of the globe, this task falls to the US
**military**]{.underline}. [The Department of State is **understaffed**,
and **isolated** from ground truth by]{.underline} crippling **[risk
aversion]{.underline}**. The intelligence community's priorities lie
elsewhere. From sub-Saharan Africa to the South China Sea, [the military
is]{.underline} often [our **principal point** of contact with contested
terrain]{.underline}.

#### The military doesn't suffer from the same resource shortages that the State Department does 

**Serafino 8**, Coordinator and International Affairs Specialist at CRS
(Nina, "The Department of Defense Role in Foreign Assistance:
Background, Major Issues, and Options for Congress," Congressional
Research Service, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA493001.pdf>)//BB

[In addition to its regional advantage, DOD enjoys two other advantages:
**greater planning and execution capabilities**, and substantially
**greater budgetary resources**. DOD can muster more \[hu\]manpower than
any other agency]{.underline}. [While U.S. military personnel may be
stretched in wartime, there still exist substantial reserves of
personnel that can be tapped to plan and carry out activities. The
combatant commands enjoy considerably more personnel than do individual
embassies, and their personnel are oriented toward planning activities,
whereas State Department personnel are oriented toward collecting
information and furthering U.S. policy through diplomacy, such as
person-to-person contact]{.underline}. Despite waging a war in Iraq,
CENTCOM created a new Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa (CJT-HOA)
of roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel (the number fluctuates
regularly) to plan and carry out efforts in the Horn of Africa that
include much foreign assistance activity. In Iraq, DOD temporarily
provided military personnel to fill about 100 State Department PRT
posts, until the State Department could contract persons with the needed
expertise to fill them.

### No Solvency\-\--Political Backlash

#### Diplomatic assistance causes [political backlash]{.underline}\-\--that wrecks solvency

**Kralev 20**, Executive Director @ WIDA, The Washington International
Diplomatic Academy (WIDA) is an independent organization that provides
practical professional training in diplomacy and international affairs
--- both in person and online --- to students, recent graduates and
professionals in government, NGOs and the private sector (Nicholas, "Why
Politicians Don't Trust Diplomats," Washington International Diplomatic
Academy,
<https://diplomaticacademy.us/2020/06/14/kralev-why-politicians-dont-trust-diplomats/)//BB>

[So politicians' lack of trust in the Foreign Service is based on
perceptions that are largely divorced from reality]{.underline}. Like
most Americans, [they know very little about our diplomats]{.underline}.
In a challenge to such a conclusion, previous administrations have often
pointed to entrusting a few senior Foreign Service officers, including
William J. Burns and Thomas R. Pickering, with top State Department
posts as an example of the respective president's reliance on
professionals. That may speak of these officers' capabilities, but it
doesn't make up for sidelining or ignoring the service as an
institution. At least Bush and Obama understood that having held a
prominent position under an administration of the other party is also a
part of a career diplomat's job. For example, Bush appointed R. Nicholas
Burns ambassador to NATO and later undersecretary of state, even though
Burns had been State Department spokesman under Clinton. And Obama
appointed Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state despite her
earlier role as a close adviser to Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.
In contrast, Trump has retaliated against officers who held key
positions during the Obama administration. [Politicians' **decades-long
distrust** of the Foreign Service has significantly undermined the
authority of the **professionals and ultimately weakened U.S. diplomacy
globally**]{.underline}. [The very real danger that there won't be
enough properly trained diplomats to **restore America's clout in the
future worries us**]{.underline} at the independent Washington
International Diplomatic Academy. So much so that, although we were set
up to offer short-term courses, we've decided to start a one-year
post-graduate practical training program for people who aspire to become
diplomats --- the first such effort outside government. Our instructors,
all former senior Foreign Service officers, have a lot to teach.

### No Solvency\-\--Trust

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### The DoD is best for improving strong relationships with host countries

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[Our relationships provide us with a reservoir of strength. They allow
us to operate by, with, and through our allies and partners to meet
shared security challenges]{.underline}. The degree of partnership
should not be measured by the quantity of security cooperation programs,
but rather by their quality. [The Department of Defense has learned from
large-scale assistance programs that for lasting impact, a comprehensive
engagement plan involves more than training and equipping. Importantly,
we are building a culture of **learning and adaptation**, drawing on
lessons from program successes, as well as, from programs that did not
have the desired impact. We are building a learning agenda and
integrating it into decision processes, and measure program impact in a
way that assesses real change, rather than counting our own inputs into
programs as successes in themselves]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} seek
to [learn]{.underline} lessons and avoid the fallacy of sunk costs [by
ruthlessly prioritizing programs that are strategic, and setting
appropriate expectations for programs that provide more of a tactical
advantage. Through this approach, we can unlock the **comparative
advantages our allies and partners** bring as we **collectively work**
together to meet our shared objectives]{.underline}.

#### Military diplomacy builds trust and relations

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/>)//BB

Moreover, [in places where the U.S. military has maintained a long-term
presence]{.underline} (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Germany), [we see that
military interoperability enhances regions economically---directly
through commercial contracting and the resulting employment,
servicemember contributions through commerce, and in some cases,
contributions of military gear and equipment through foreign military
sales or otherwise]{.underline}. [The resulting "military diplomacy,"
also referred to as "defense diplomacy," "**soft power**," "military
public diplomacy," and "strategic communication," allows the military to
have a **direct impact** on foreign policy through other means. Although
not diplomacy in the traditional sense of a State Department mission,
**military relationships between countries build**]{.underline} a
foundation on which [**further connections** between
nations]{.underline} are developed.

### No Solvency\-\--AT Bergmann

#### State Department assistance fails

**Sadler 21**, Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology
at Heritage, and Janae Diaz, Fall 2020 member of the Young Leaders
Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," *The Heritage Foundation*,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department)//BB>

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs, but the results do not match the
investment]{.underline}. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for
American Progress recently proposed consolidating **all** these programs
within the State Department]{.underline}. [**That would be a big
mistake**, because it would minimize the Pentagon's role in shaping and
directing security assistance and, ultimately, the program's military
objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and humanitarian
programs. Those are not the values by which such security assistance
programs should be solely judged. [Security sector assistance programs
deliver arms, military training, and other defense-related services to
allies and partner nation governments]{.underline} via grants, loans,
credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these programs
**should** prioritize national security. To this end, reforms should
enhance joint State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in
terms of America's national strategic goals]{.underline}.

#### Even Bergmann admits structural reforms in the DoS would be necessary for solvency

**1NC Bergmann** and Schmitt **21**, \*senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, where he focuses on European security and U.S.-Russia
policy. From 2011 to 2017, he served in the U.S. Department of State in
a number of different positions, including as a member of the secretary
of state's policy planning staff, where he focused on political-military
affairs and nonproliferation; special assistant to the undersecretary
for arms control and international security; speechwriter to
then-Secretary of State John Kerry; and senior adviser to the assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs. Prior to serving in
the State Department, he worked at CAP as a military and
nonproliferation policy analyst and at the National Security Network as
the deputy policy director. Bergmann received his master's degree from
the London School of Economics in comparative politics and his
bachelor's degree from Bates College, \*\*senior policy analyst on the
National Security and International Policy team at the Center. She
previously worked on U.S. foreign policy advocacy at Human Rights Watch
and received her Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School
(Max and Alexandra, "A Plan To Reform U.S. Security Assistance," *Center
for American Progress*,
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/plan-reform-u-s-security-assistance/)//BB

Moreover, [due to **personnel and resource shortages**, former U.S.
officials found that the State Department is "**not equipped** to
coordinate across the increasingly complex and unwieldy" security
assistance system]{.underline}.80 [Senior policymakers, who often lack
adequate staff or extensive training on security assistance, are not
well equipped to effectively guide the bureaucracy on who should receive
security assistance and how it fits into broader foreign policy
decision-making]{.underline}.81 The State Department's lack of resources
also naturally hampers dual-key provisions that seek to fix coordination
gaps between the State Department and the DOD. This leads to a system
where security assistance policy varies country by country, depending on
the personnel in place and the agency that takes charge. [The added
bureaucracy can make efficient, cost-conscious decisions impossible, and
it opens the process up to political influence]{.underline}.

### AT HR Solvency Deficit

#### The Department of Defense uses Security Cooperation to protect and promote human rights

**Karlin 22**, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities (Mara, "Examining U.S. Security Cooperation and
Assistance," Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)//BB

[We continue to invest in the professionalization of our security
cooperation workforce by **requiring increasingly rigorous training**.
We are investing in the concept of institutionalizing the defense
diplomacy role the Department's representatives in embassies play,
ensuring that the partnerships they promote are consistent with our
national security interests and values]{.underline}. [What]{.underline}
ultimately [sets apart the United States in an environment of strategic
competition are the values we represent. Our ability to maintain and
continue to **set a high bar for human rights,** humanitarian affairs,
and rule of law---including our civilian oversight of the military---is
a **critical** tool]{.underline} we can leverage to help our partners
meet their goals and advance those shared values. [Doing so is both a
moral and strategic imperative. We also take our responsibility in the
humanitarian sector very seriously, as we play an important supporting
role in the interagency in supporting civil authorities in countries
facing crises]{.underline}. Whether it is managing crisis response
capacity building under the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, Assistance
and Civic Aid (OHDACA) account, employing Foreign Disaster Relief, or
maintaining Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA), the [Department is committed
to supporting our partners' efforts to provide **humanitarian services**
to their civilian populace]{.underline}. [During our recent
reorganization within the Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense]{.underline} (Policy), [we]{.underline} have
[merged]{.underline} the [offices of Stability and Humanitarian Affairs
and Security Cooperation to form a new Office of the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Global Partnerships. This shift **deliberately
integrated humanitarian assistance**, disaster relief, and **human
rights** with the existing processes **related to security cooperation**
to emphasize the centrality of these areas of defense cooperation that
benefit allies and partners in need. Women, Peace and Security; civilian
protection; and respect for the rule of law also fall into this issue
set]{.underline}. [This integration will help us look more holistically
at the needs and challenges our partners and their diverse populations
face]{.underline}, particularly when those needs can spiral into crises
that spill outside the country's borders.

### AT Diplomatic Cred N-B\-\--Non-Unique

#### The military already controls the vast majority of US foreign policy

**Quainton 17**, Distinguished Diplomat in Residence at American
University (Anthony, "Militarization and Marginalization of American
Diplomacy and Foreign Policy," American Diplomacy,
<https://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2018/03/militarization-and-marginalization-of-american-diplomacy-and-foreign-policy/)//BB>

The issue of [militarization of foreign policy is]{.underline} a
**[common]{.underline}** theme. One of the New York Times 100 notable
books of 2016 was Rosa Brooks How Everything became War and the Military
Became Everything. In the spring of 2016 Georgetown University Press
published a collection of essays entitled Mission Creep designed to
explore the Militarization of US Foreign Policy. As far back as 2003
Dana Priest, a journalist for the Washington Post, wrote a book entitled
The Mission which asserted that American diplomacy was being outgunned
by the military and that the United States was becoming increasingly
dependent on the military to manage its role in world affairs. She
claimed that "on (president Bill) Clinton's watch the military slowly,
without public scrutiny or debate came to surpass its civilian leaders
in resources and influence around the world". Specifically she
identified the regional combatant commanders. (In Europe the Supreme
Allied Commander Europe---SACEUR) as sources of increasing diplomatic
influence. In the introduction to her book she assets that "U.S. leaders
have been turning more and more to the military to solve problems that
are often, at their root, political and economic." [This
shift]{.underline} she argues "[has been going on for more than a
decade]{.underline} without much public discussion or debate." Ms.
Priest describes a world in which [four star generals and admirals fly
around the world in large jet aircraft, accompanied by substantial
staffs to engage in diplomatic contacts not just with ministers of
defense and force commanders but with heads of state and government as
well]{.underline}. She asserts that **[they]{.underline}** were
**[eclips]{.underline}**ing [the role of hapless Ambassadors who lacked
both **resources and access**]{.underline}.

### AT Diplomatic Cred N-B\-\--Military Solves

#### Military diplomacy promotes soft power

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Since military people know better than anyone the true cost of waging
war, the U.S. military has a **vested interest** in working to **build
capabilities and partnerships** to maintain **worldwide peace and
stability**. Although the lines between what are doctrinally military or
diplomatic missions may blur, it is to the advantage of both the State
Department and the military to capitalize on any opportunity to advance
the policy and security of the United States. The military, known as a
hard-power tool, can also be used as a soft-power one. Military members
serving overseas in any capacity are already often the forefront of
American diplomacy, moving their mission set beyond traditional
warfighting]{.underline} to an extended role in support of the National
Security Strategy of the United States, [with great
success]{.underline}. The fact that China is increasingly involved in
regions like Africa and Latin America---giving Beijing influence
there---is further reason for the United States to take a more active
approach and mitigate vulnerabilities. [China has learned from our
greatest strategic achievement, the Marshall Plan, and has formulated a
long-term strategy to, among other things, **undermine U.S. influence**.
We need a coordinated, long-term plan **of military
diplomacy**]{.underline} and economic support [in response]{.underline}.

### AT Diplomatic Cred N-B\-\--Militarization Good

#### [Military-first]{.underline} should be the objective for all security assistance

**Sadler 21**, Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology
at Heritage, and Janae Diaz, Fall 2020 member of the Young Leaders
Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," The Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department)//BB>

[Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance]{.underline} in the
Middle East [should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to
military effects]{.underline}. However, the report's recommendations are
limited to counterterrorism activities and a strategy of deprioritizing
the Middle East in favor of the Indo-Pacific. If limiting security
assistance to [**military** **purpose**]{.underline}s would make
programs more effective in a region of waning emphasis, it stands to
reason that this [**should be the formative basis** for all security
assistance programs, especially when strategy calls for increased
investment in the security capacities of partner nations]{.underline}.
[Reforms to security assistance should push the agencies in this
direction, encouraging---or compelling---State to design its programs in
closer **coordination with the Pentagon** and in support of Defense
Department's operational needs, such as improving military forward
presence, wartime resilience and interoperability]{.underline}.

[As the United States looks ahead, the country is sure to follow the
tradition in defense strategy that prioritizes enabling partners through
training and equipping their forces]{.underline}. Over the last 15
years, the number of status of forces agreements (SOFAs) increased from
40 to 117. This is due, in part, to the fact that while administrations
may change, [fundamental U.S. interests]{.underline} have not. These
[include]{.underline}: [protecting the US homeland from catastrophic
attack, sustaining a global system marked by open lines of communication
to facilitate commerce, promoting international security, and preventing
powers hostile to the United States from being able to dominate
important areas of the world]{.underline}.\[4\] [The United States
aspires to create true partners]{.underline} who can confront their own
threats to internal stability, which organized crime, violent actors,
and regional rivals exploit. Known as the "indirect approach," [the U.S.
helps countries fill security deficits that exist when a country cannot
independently protect its own national security]{.underline}. American
generosity helps explain this, but U.S. national security benefits too.
For example, by providing radars and surveillance technology, Central
American countries can control their airspace and can interdict
drug-filled planes bound for the US; by providing logistic support,
Pakistan can lead a maritime coalition promoting maritime security in
the Indian Ocean; and by selling AEGIS destroyers, Japan can counter
North Korean missiles and provide early warning of missile threats to
the United States. [Through **security cooperation**
programs]{.underline} like these, [the United States helps other
countries meet their immediate national security needs, but there is
also an effort to foster independence so states can contribute to global
security]{.underline}. This is most visible in a program such as the
Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative that trains and equips foreign
militaries to participate in peacekeeping operations. While the United
States does not want to deploy ground forces under the United Nations
flag, it does play a key role in peacekeeping by training and equipping
over 250,000 peacekeepers since 2005. Programs like GPOI enabled
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda to participate in an African Union
peacekeeping mission in Somalia. An officer from Chad seemed to capture
the rationale for other countries' efforts to contribute to global
security: "[When your neighbor's house is burning, you have to put it
out, because if not, yours is next]{.underline}."\[5\] [U.S. **security
cooperation** often provides the tools countries need when their
national security demands exceed their security capacities]{.underline}.

#### Militarized foreign policy solves a variety of non-military threats

[The preventive and cooperative approach to foreign policy is visible in
today's military]{.underline}, which has undergone dramatic change over
the last three decades. [Defense strategy embraces the notion that the
U.S. military does much more than fight wars]{.underline}. The military
trains, equips, and deploys peacekeepers; provides humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief; and supports other militaries to reduce
security deficits throughout the world. With national security focused
on weak states and regional challengers, [the U.S. military has been
evolving from a **force of confrontation to one of
cooperation**]{.underline}. [The rationale for security cooperation has
been based on the assumption that instability breeds chaos, which would
make it more likely that the US or the international community would
face pressure to intervene in the future]{.underline}. Given America's
global foreign policy, [many countries have large expectations for
assistance from the United States, but the US also derives benefits from
security cooperation. Among these are]{.underline}: Obtaining base
access as a quid pro quo Augmenting U.S. force structure by providing
logistics and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support to
coalition partners in the Middle East Promoting a favorable balance of
power by selling weapon systems and training programs to Gulf
Cooperation Council countries to balance Iran [Harmonizing areas of
cooperation]{.underline} by working with Japan and Israel on missile
defense Promoting self-defense through the Georgia Train and Equip
program [Reinforcing sovereignty]{.underline} through programs like Plan
Colombia and the Merida Initiative with Mexico Supporting the US
industrial base and creating interoperable air forces through the F-35
program As these reasons suggest, [security cooperation is much bigger
than train and equip forces in combat zones]{.underline}. Given the
scope of these programs and diversity of the partners, one can develop
[measurable objectives]{.underline}. These [include]{.underline}: the
strength of regional security agreements, the types of regional
cooperation (e.g., participation in U.S.-led air, maritime, or land
operations), willingness of foreign governments to counter threats the
U.S. identifies (e.g. terrorism), and the relative receptivity of U.S.
forces within the partner country. Internal to countries, one can
measure how well partners combat security challenges, the strength of
civil--military relations, and the levels of respect for human rights.
Measurement can include [the extent to which international commerce
flows freely, levels of cooperation between **military** and
international relief organizations, and support for international
initiatives to combat disease, illicit activity, and weapons
proliferation]{.underline}.

### AT Democracy Impact

#### Democracy's [net less peaceful]{.underline}\-\--they have [no advantage]{.underline} over autocracies but have a [propensity to go to war]{.underline} with autocracies.

**Bakker '17** (Femke; is an assistant professor at the Institute of
Political Science @ University of Leiden; *Do liberal norms matter? A
cross-regime experimental investigation of the normative explanation of
the democratic peace in China and the Netherlands*;
[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/74424/Bakker_2017.pdf?sequence=1](about:blank);
accessed 7/21/19; MSCOTT)

Concluding discussion

Democratic peace theory posits that individuals of liberal-democracies
are socialized with liberal norms that nurture a peaceful attitude
towards other democracies. Furthermore, it postulates that individuals
in autocracies lack this socialization process and will consequently be
more war prone towards all regime-types. Previous studies into this
mechanism at microlevel found that democratic individuals are indeed
more peaceful towards democracies during an interstate conflict.
However, [these studies have focused their research on democratic
individuals only, and moreover have assumed the presence of liberal
norms rather than measuring these]{.underline}. This research extends to
those studies by measuring the level of liberal norms among democratic
and autocratic individuals and compare the effect these norms have on
the support for war within an experimental setting.

Indeed, [the democratic experimental group showed to be more peaceful
towards other democracies, just like previous studies
showed]{.underline}. However, the comparative perspective brought a new
insight: [because the autocratic citizens were overall more peaceful
towards all regime-types the comparison showed that actually
the]{.underline} **[democratic participants were not more peaceful
towards other democracies, but rather more war-prone towards
autocracies]{.underline}**. [These 22 findings are important in the
light of theoretical refinement, and show that we cannot simply assume
autocratic individuals to be war prone, as democratic peace theory
does]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett 1993, Russett 1993, p.35, Weart
1998, pp.81-83, Rousseau 2005, pp.27-28).

[Secondly, the measuring of liberal norms showed that also **autocratic
individuals posses a level of liberal norms**]{.underline}. [The average
of the autocratic group was indeed significantly lower than the
democratic group, but the difference was small and had a small effect
size]{.underline}. Most important contribution of this measurement is
that **[liberal norms cannot be assumed to be absent within autocracies,
as democratic peace theory does]{.underline}**. Moreover, [liberal norms
showed to have only an effect within the democratic group: **those with
a higher level of liberal norms were more inclined to attack an
autocracy over a democracy**]{.underline}. Within the autocratic group,
the level of liberal norms did not have any influence on the support for
war.

[These results show how important it is to indeed measure liberal norms
and not simply assume these to be present or absent]{.underline}.
Furthermore, these finding raise many questions that further research
might be inspired by. If these results would hold when the experiment
would be replicated for different samples of democratic and autocratic
individuals, in other words: if democratic individuals show in new
studies also to be triggered by autocracy to become more war prone, in
particular when they endorse liberal norms more highly, we might have
found more evidence for the argument that Western political rhetoric has
molded democratic peace theory into a self-fulfilling prophecy, as was
argued by several authors (Ish-Shalom 2006, Risse-Kappen 1995, Houghton
2007, Houghton 2009).

Another important extension to earlier studies is that this research has
controlled for the threat of the conflict, after all, if a threat is not
perceived as severe, why would anyone want to attack any other country?
[The results of that test showed actually more variance than initially
anticipated, in other words: it had to be considered within the analyses
of the data]{.underline}. Because a test showed that **[there was no
relation between the perception of threat and the treatment of
regime-type]{.underline}**, [perception of threat was taken into
consideration as an independent variable. And **threat
matters**]{.underline}, [strongly]{.underline}. Within a multivariate
test of all theorized indicators, [perception of threat shows to be the
**most important indicator** why democratic and autocratic individuals
alike support war.]{.underline} [It was actually so strong that the
effect of regime-type and liberal norms that showed in the descriptive
results, was **faded out**]{.underline}.

### AT Hegemony Impact

#### No leadership impact. 

**Fettweis 20**, Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University. (Christopher J., 6-3-2020, \"Delusions of Danger:
Geopolitical Fear and Indispensability in U.S. Foreign Policy\", *A
Dangerous World? Threat Perception and U.S. National Security*,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/publications/delusions-danger-geopolitical-fear-indispensability-us-foreign-policy>)

Like many believers, [proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on **faith alone**]{.underline}.41 [There is **precious
little evidence** to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline} the [pacific trends]{.underline} that have swept across
the system. In fact, [the world remained **equally
peaceful**]{.underline}, relatively speaking, [while the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cut its forces throughout the
1990s, as well as while it **doubled** its military spending in the
first decade of the new century]{.underline}.42 **[Complex statistical
methods]{.underline}** should not be needed to [demonstrate that levels
of U.S. military spending have been essentially **unrelated** to global
stability.]{.underline}

Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go way beyond the absence of simple
correlations to support them, however. [The theory's supporters have
**never been able to explain adequately** how precisely **5 percent** of
the world's population could **force** peace on the other **95
percent**]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world was
simply not intent on fighting. [Most states are quite free to go to war
without U.S. involvement but **choose not to**]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially
after Iraq, to **steer well clear** of most civil wars and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal [violence
in]{.underline}, say, [most of Africa would be unlikely to attract
serious attention of the world's policeman, much less
**intervention**]{.underline}. [The continent is, **nevertheless**,
**more peaceful today** than at **any other time** in its
history]{.underline}, [something for which U.S. hegemony **cannot take
credit**]{.underline}.43 [Stability exists today in **many such places**
to which U.S. hegemony **simply does not extend**.]{.underline}

Overall, [proponents of the **stabilizing power** of U.S. hegemony
should keep in mind one of the most **basic observations** from
**cognitive psychology**]{.underline}: [**rarely** are our actions as
important to others' calculations as we **perceive them to
be**]{.underline}.44 [The]{.underline} so‐​called **[egocentric
bias]{.underline}**, which is essentially ubiquitous in human
interaction, [suggests that although it may be **natural** for U.S.
policymakers to interpret their role as crucial in the maintenance of
world peace, they are **almost certainly overestimating their own
importance**]{.underline}. [Washington is probably not as central to the
**myriad decisions** in foreign capitals that help maintain
international stability as it thinks it is.]{.underline}

[The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple of
factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [Americans have long been
**exceptional** in their **exceptionalism**]{.underline}.45 [The short
history of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can
easily be read as an almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story
of success, [has led to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it
is **morally, culturally**, and **politically superior** to other,
lesser countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional
state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the
world.

[Americans have always combined that feeling of **divine providence**
with a sense of mission to spread their ideals around the world and
**battle evil**]{.underline} wherever it lurks. It is that sense of
destiny, of being the object of history's call, that most obviously
separates the United States from other countries. Only an American
president would claim that by entering World War I, "America had the
infinite privilege of fulfilling her destiny and saving the world."46

Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no other
seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in quite
the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants everybody to
be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I believe. And
that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine Albright called
the United States the "indispensable nation," she was reflecting a
traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48 Exceptional
nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to assist the
merely average.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the United States comes a sense of great responsibility:
to serve and protect humanity, to drive history in positive directions.
More than any other single factor, the people of the United States tend
to believe that they are indispensable because they are powerful, and
power tends to blind states to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 [It is quite likely that the world **does not need the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to enforce
peace]{.underline}**. In fact, [if **virtually any** of the overlapping
and mutually reinforcing explanations for the current stability are
correct, the trends in international security may well prove **difficult
to reverse**]{.underline}. [**None** of the **contributing factors**
that are commonly suggested]{.underline} ([**economic development**,
complex **interdependence**, **nuclear weapons**, international
**institutions**, **democracy**, **shifting global norms** on
war]{.underline}) [seem **poised to disappear** any time
soon]{.underline}.50 [The world will probably **continue**]{.underline}
its [peace]{.underline}ful ways for the near future, at the very least,
[**no matter what** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded while
pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in
foreign capitals, "It is very unlikely that pulling off the American
security blanket would lead to thoughts of war."51 The United States
will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in other
words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to
the contrary.

#### Heg is [unsustainable]{.underline}\-\--retrenchment is [gradual]{.underline} now, but recommitting makes it [violent]{.underline} and [forced]{.underline}.

Who Is President\", *Foreign Policy*,

[As the Trump era]{.underline} potentially [comes to an end,
many]{.underline} foreign-policy voices in the United States and abroad
**[relish]{.underline}** [the prospect of the country's **roaring
return**]{.underline} [to the global stage. But attempting a **full-on
comeback** would be a **mistake. If anything**]{.underline}, [the
**strategic pullback**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** [has initiated **needs to
continue**]{.underline}---albeit in a more coherent and judicious
manner.

Much of the debate surrounding the next administration's foreign policy
has focused on boldly reasserting U.S. leadership in the world. And it's
true: Global interdependence and upheaval do require steady U.S.
leadership and engagement. [What's been]{.underline} largely
**[missing]{.underline}** from this debate, however, [are the challenges
facing the next president when it comes to **right-sizing U.S.
engagement abroad**]{.underline}---[especially **military
involvement**]{.underline}---[and bringing the nation's **strategic
commitments** back into line with it **means** and
**purposes**.]{.underline}

[The American electorate has turned **sharply inward**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [response to **military overreach** in the **Middle
East**]{.underline}, [the **economic dislocations**]{.underline}
[brought about by **innovation** and **globalization**]{.underline},
[and the **national calamity** caused by **COVID**]{.underline}-19. [The
nation's **next president** would]{.underline} be wise to take
note---and [craft a brand of global statecraft that is **effective** but
also]{.underline} politically **[sustainable]{.underline}**. [Otherwise,
the **strategic pullback** that needs to take place will occur **by
default rather than by design**]{.underline}, [risking]{.underline} that
**[U.S. overreach]{.underline}** could turn into even more dangerous
underreach. Indeed, that's what's been happening during Trump's
presidency. He seems to have understood the need to retrench. But his
troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Germany have been
haphazard, making a hash of the effort. Retrenchment cannot be done by
tweet, in unpredictable fits and starts, and couched in an abrasive
"America first" unilateralism that has alienated allies and set the
world on edge.

Democratic candidate Joe [**Biden** is]{.underline} far better [suited
to restore an **equilibrium**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} the
nation's [**foreign policy** and]{.underline} its **[political
will]{.underline}**. [Throughout his career, he has been a **pragmatic**
and **prudent internationalist**]{.underline}; [looking forward,
pragmatism and prudence will require a more **selective** and
**discriminating internationalism**]{.underline}, **[not]{.underline}**
**[restoration of the s]{.underline}**tatus **[quo]{.underline}** ante.
Three-quarters of the American public want U.S. troops to leave
Afghanistan and Iraq---[it is time to downsize the U.S. footprint in the
Middle East. U.S. foreign policy has become
**over-militarized**]{.underline}---[the next administration should
**reallocate priorities** and **resources**]{.underline}, [putting more
emphasis on **diplomacy**]{.underline}, cybersecurity, global public
health, and climate change. Washington should also return to being a
team player if it is to lighten its load; [**retrenchment** and
**multilateral engagement** go hand in hand. Meeting the threat posed by
**China**]{.underline}, managing international **[trade]{.underline}**
and finance, [preventing]{.underline} nuclear
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [addressing]{.underline}
**[pandemics]{.underline}**---[these]{.underline} and other urgent
challenges [all require broad **international
coop**eration]{.underline}. [And as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[pulls back]{.underline}** from its role as
global policeman, [it will want **like-minded partners** to help **fill
the gap**]{.underline}. These partnerships become stronger through
diplomacy and teamwork.

[The **top priorities** of the next president will be **at home**:
**taming the pandemic**, **repairing the economy**, and reviving
**democratic institutions**]{.underline} and norms. Only if the
country's democratic lights come back on can it effectively deal with
the rest of the world. In the meantime, [the next
admin]{.underline}istration [needs to **continue Trump's effort** to
**downsize** the nation's foreign **entanglements**]{.underline}---but
[in a **smart** and **measured** way]{.underline}. The United States
needs to step back without stepping away. "Build back better" applies
abroad just as much as it does at home.
