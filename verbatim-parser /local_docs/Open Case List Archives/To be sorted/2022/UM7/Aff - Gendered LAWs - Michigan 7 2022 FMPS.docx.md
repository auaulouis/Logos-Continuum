### File Navigation + Strategy Tips

Pro-tips:

- Make sure you integrate the applicable cards from various feminist IR
  files. For example, most of the link cards in those files can serve as
  Ks of disads for this aff.

- You should also integrate generic cards from other files. We've done
  this for most other relevant files, but there may be other useful
  cards we missed. For example, a lot of the ethical AI aff/neg cards
  will be useful.

## \*\*1AC Toolbox\*\*

### 1AC -- Plan

#### Two options, depending on your preference:

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its artificial intelligence armament prohibitions with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to prohibit artificial intelligence in lethal autonomous weapons systems. 

### 1AC -- Inherency

#### Lethal autonomous weapons are here [now]{.underline}- a multilateral response is necessary to prevent runaway proliferation.

Systems Are Here---and We Need to Regulate Them\",

Swarms of robots with the ability to kill humans are no longer only the
stuff of science fiction[. Lethal autonomous weapons systems
([LAWS]{.mark}) [are **here**]{.mark}. I]{.underline}n Ukraine, Moscow
has allegedly deployed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled
Kalashnikov ZALA Aero KUB-BLA loitering munition, while Kyiv has used
Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones, which have some autonomous
capabilities. Although it's always hard to determine whether a weapon's
autonomous mode is used, [these [tech]{.mark}nologies have reportedly
been [employed in]{.mark} at least one [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}:
Last year, a [United Nations report suggested [Turkey used autonomous
firin]{.mark}g by its Kargu-2 drones to hunt **fleeing** soldiers [in
Libya's **civil** war]{.mark}]{.underline} (though the CEO of the
Turkish company that produced the drone denies it is capable of this).
[Unlike traditional drones, these systems have the ability to [navigate
on their own, and some can **select** targets]{.mark}. Although
a]{.underline} human controller can still decide whether or not to
strike, such weapons are acquiring ever more autonomous capabilities.
[Now that militaries and paramilitaries worldwide have taken note,
[these technologies are **poised** to spread
**widely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The world today stands at the very
moment before much more advanced versions of these technologies become
ubiquitous. [So far, at least [Israel]{.mark}, [Russia]{.mark}, [South
Korea,]{.mark} and [Turkey]{.mark} have reportedly deployed weapons with
autonomous capabilities---though whether this mode was active is
disputed---and [Australia, Britain, China]{.mark}, and [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates are investing heavily [in **developing**
LAWS]{.mark} [with]{.mark} an ever-[expanding range of sizes and
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Already, some [LAWS can
loiter in an area to find targets that machine-learning algorithms have
trained them to recognize, including enemy radar systems, tanks, ships,
and even specific individuals]{.underline}. These weapons can look
vastly different: [For instance, the Turkish Kargu-2 drone, which was
introduced in 2020 and used in Libya's war, is 2 feet long, weighs
around 15 pounds, and can swarm in groups.]{.underline} Autonomous
systems can also be much larger, [such as unmanned AI-driven fighter
jets like the modified L-39 Albatros, and much smaller, such as
rudimentary commercial drones repurposed with autonomous
software]{.underline}. Once these technologies have spread widely, they
will be difficult to control. [The world thus urgently needs a new
approach to LAWS. So far, the international community has done nothing
more than agree that the issue needs to be discussed. But what it really
needs to do is take a page from the nuclear playbook and establish a
[nonproliferation **regime** for LAWS]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 1AC -- Advantage

#### LAWS are the [ultimate form]{.underline} of dehumanization. [Algorithmic biases]{.underline} ensure discriminatory targeting along gendered and racial lines, which guarantees the deaths of marginalized communities.

[[A]{.mark}utonomous [w]{.mark}eapons are being **[developed]{.mark}**
in the context of the established norms of [**gender** and
**power**.]{.mark} These norms can and do affect how we think about
weapons, war, and violence]{.underline}. Throughout history, we have
seen that [weapons symbolise power]{.underline}. The association of
[weapons with power comes from a dominant understanding of
masculinit]{.underline}y, in which ideas like strength, courage, and
protection are equated with violence. This is not to say that all [men
agree with or perpetuate this idea, but that this is widely considered
the norm or standard for masculinity. I]{.underline}t is a masculinity
in which the capacity and willingness to use weapons, engage in combat,
and kill other human beings is seen as essential to being "a real man".
Turning men (and women) into [warfighters has tended to require breaking
down their sense of ethics and morals and building up a violent
masculinity]{.underline} that is lacking in [empathy and glorifies
strength as violence and physical domination over others portrayed as
weake]{.underline}r[. Autonomous weapons would be the pinnacle of a
fighting force stripped of the empathy, conscience, or emotion that
might hold a human soldier back]{.underline}. While armed drones are on
this trajectory towards mechanised violence, autonomous weapons would
complete the separation of the body and mind from the battlefield and
[the process of dehumanisation of warfare. This process of
dehumanisation also often includes sexual -- or other kinds of
gender-based violence]{.underline}. Some people who support the
development of killer robots have argued that these weapons will be
better than human soldiers because they will not rape. This is a myth.
[An autonomous weapon could be programmed to inflict terror on a
population through sexual violence, which is already ordered by states
and armed groups using human soldier]{.underline}s. An autonomous
weapon, if programmed to rape, would not hesitate to do so. It is also
important to consider the broader culture of rape in relation to weapons
and war. Rape and sexual violence are used as weapons in conflict, and
is also heightened during and after conflict. [[War
**destabilises**]{.mark} communities and [exacerbates already
**existing** gender inequalities a]{.mark}nd oppression of
women]{.underline}, LGBTQ+ people, and [others [who **do not conform to
societies'**]{.mark} standards of gender **norms**]{.underline}. 8 of 14
A WILPF GUIDE TO: KILLER ROBOTS WILPF is also concerned about the
development of autonomous weapons programmed [with \"[target profiles\"
and **algorithmic bias in terms**]{.mark} [of gender, race,
socioeconomic status, ability, and]{.mark} sexual
[orientation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Facial recognition software
struggles to **recognise people of colour; voice recognition struggles
to respond to women's voices or non-North American
accents**]{.underline}; photos of anyone standing in a kitchen are
labelled as women; [people's bail is denied because a [**program**
decided that a woman of colour was more likely to reoffend]{.mark} than
[a]{.mark} white woman; trans people are surveilled on the basis of the
clothing they wear]{.underline}. Imagine this [[kind of **bias** being
programmed into a weapon]{.mark} system [designed to **target and
fire**]{.mark} **upon targets** without any meaningful human control,
without any human judgment to counteract that bias.]{.underline} Or,
imagine that bias being deliberately programmed into the killer robot,
[to **[kill all people of a certain ethnicity, religion, or
sex]{.mark}**. In this way, an autonomous weapon contributes [to further
dehumanising people by turning them into target profiles]{.mark} and
expendable targets]{.underline}. A good example of this is how already
in conflict, civilian men are often targeted---or counted in casualty
recordings---as militants only because they are men of a certain age.
[While men are not necessarily targeted only because they are men,
taking sex as a key signifier as identity and exacting harm on that
basis constitutes gender-based violence.]{.underline} This erodes the
protection that civilians should be afforded in conflict and violates
many human rights, including the right to life and due process. It [also
has broader [implications in the reinforcement of gender norms]{.mark},
including violent [masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Assuming all
military-age men to be potential or actual militants or combatants
entrenches the idea that men are violent and thus
targetable.]{.underline} This devalues male life---it suggests men are
relatively more expendable than women. It increases the vulnerability of
men, exacerbating other risks adult civilian men face such as forced
recruitment, arbitrary detention, and summary execution. [The gendered
culture of violent masculinities that surrounds the development of
autonomous weapons, likely to be embedded within the technology and its
use, will create new challenges for preventing violence]{.underline},
protecting civilians, [and breaking down gender essentialisms or
discrimination.]{.underline} Understanding how autonomous weapons [are
likely to be perceived in a gendered way by their developers, operators,
and their victims is crucial to developing policies that can help break
the cycle of violence]{.underline}. This could include an understanding
that the operation of weapons without meaningful human control, weapons
programmed to target and kill based on pre-programmed algorithms of who
is considered to pose a threat, used without consent in foreign lands or
in the streets of local cities, will result in civilian casualties,
psychological harm, and destruction of civilian infrastructure. [That
this in turn will result in a [violent **masculine** response from
affected **communities**]{.mark}, reinforcing [gender **inequalities and
oppressio**]{.mark}**ns.**]{.underline} Such understandings should have
[[significant **implications** for our thinking about and approach to
the development of autonomous weapon]{.mark}s]{.underline}. We can think
about how this kind of analysis and argumentation could help tech
workers and policy experts see the need for meaningful human control
over weapon systems. [We can also see how [autonomous weapon systems
could facilitate the profiling, targeting, **dehumanisation**, and death
of various marginalised communities and as well as activists or others
confronting power.]{.mark}]{.underline} In a context where weapons are
treated as tools of power, violence, and subordination of others,
increasing the remoteness and abstraction of violence is not the answer.
Dealing with violence and conflict as a social institution, rather than
a technical challenge to be "solved" with new weapons technology, is
imperative. [Understanding these dimensions of both violence and
technology could help contextualise our work against weapons in a
broader context of social justice.]{.underline}

#### Lethal autonomous weapons are [profoundly gendered]{.underline}. They reinforce [patriarchal structures]{.underline} by identifying men as potential combatants while running the risk of [unchecked sexual violence]{.underline} against women and nonbinary people.

[[Killer robots **reinforce**]{.mark} violence [**patriarchal**
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have sustained a long and
terrible legacy of [[targeting]{.mark} violence in [gendered
ways]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [usage of [killer robots raises a host of
**concerns**]{.mark} as to how [they might **target** innocent men as
potential **combatants**]{.mark}, as well as [increase **sexualised**
violence against women, girls, and non-binary
**people**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many [[international
**regulations**]{.mark} have been developed [to protect people from
gender]{.mark}-[based violence]{.mark}, and yet, [there is no
**accountability** structure for weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} that
operate [completely autonomously, meaning these [killer robots could
commit **unchecked** violence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Combatants
or Civilians? Under the administration of President Obama, during which
drone strikes became a critical act of US military intervention and
targeted killing, [the [criteria for distinguishing between a]{.mark}
civilian and a militant or terrorist [was blurred]{.mark} to the point
of non-distinction]{.underline}. The CIA counted all military-age males
who were in a strike zone as combatants "unless there \[was\] explicit
intelligence posthumously proving them innocent" (Becker and Shane,
2012). The reasoning behind this (il)logic was that if people are
spending time around known terrorist hotspots, then they would likely be
up to "no good". This resulted in incredibly low reported rates of
[civilian Gender-Based Violence and Accountability casualties, as almost
all men killed were considered to be combatants]{.underline}. This is
but one example of how [[profiling based on]{.mark} gender, or any
[social category]{.mark} for that matter, can [be twisted in a
way]{.mark} that creates a [tangible threat for
people]{.mark}]{.underline} who simply share the gender of the target
profile. Given the lack of clarity as to how combatants are defined,
there is a high risk of false positives and targeting of innocent
civilians. Developing sound regulations and processes that would
guarantee the safety of civilians is an incredibly challenging, and
probably impossible, task (Moyes, 2019). Attempts to do so would also
place the burden of navigating legal obligations onto AI, a technology
which does not have the capacity to make the kind of judgement calls
humans are capable of. [[Killer **robots**]{.mark} would not be able to
identify nuances within a [target **profile**]{.mark}, and without
meaningful human **intervention**, [would always result in the use of
force]{.mark}, therefore risking the death of innocent
peopl]{.underline}e (Moyes, 2019). Sexualised Violence Gender-based
[violence also [manifests in **sexualised** violence]{.mark}, including
**the rape, forced pregnancy, slavery, and torture** of women, girls,
and non-binary people.]{.underline} While proponents for killer robots
have argued that such machinery would reduce sexualised violence, [the
**uncomfortable** truth is that the opposite is likely]{.underline}
(Sandvik and Lohne, 2015). [Acts of this nature are [often]{.mark} used
[purposefully in conflict **scenarios** as a mechanism to **instill
fear, humiliation, and shame**, or for purposes of ethnic
**cleansin**]{.mark}**g**]{.underline}. A killer robot, with no
[conscience or ability **to reject unethical instructions**, would
execute orders based upon **whatever** programming it received,
including orders to commit **sexualised** violence]{.underline}
(Sharkey, 2020). The assumption that new technology would function
precisely as it "should" without consideration of the context in which
it's developed, as well as the motives of the user, is a reckless
presumption (Sandvik and Lohne, 2015). United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1820 (2008) takes a specific focus on the use of sexualised
violence as a weapon of war and war crime, unilaterally condemning it in
alignment with the Rome Statute of the International Court and the
Geneva Convention (UN General Assembly, 1998; International Committee of
the Red Cross, 1949). However, [should these weapons [commit such
**atrocities**,]{.mark} their distance from [human intervention begs the
question of legal **accountability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Killer robots
themselves [cannot be tried for crimes]{.underline}. So who, then,
should bear that responsibility (Acheson, 2020)? Ultimately, [human
intent and system **performance** can never be fully consistent when it
comes [to **killer** robots]{.mark}.]{.underline} This misalignment is
of grave concern to a FFP framework. As gender equality and protecting
vulnerable populations is of central concern **[to]{.underline}** FFP,
the potential for gender-based violence should killer robots be
developed is simply too great a risk to take[. The margin of error of
these weapons results in the death of **innocent** people, a risk that
should be considered too great to consider this technology
usable]{.underline}.

#### These weapons cannot be disentangled from inherent biases in artificial intelligence. They'll [inevitably]{.underline} kill the wrong person. 

**Sharkey 18** Noel Sharkey Emeritus, 8-28-2018, \"The impact of gender
and race bias in AI,\" Humanitarian Law & Policy Blog,
<https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2018/08/28/impact-gender-race-bias-ai//mb24>

[Automated decision algorithms are currently **propagating gender and
race discrimination** throughout our global community]{.underline}. The
[major culprits are machine learning with **big data.**]{.underline}
Drawing on the lessons learned, the question asked here is, can we take
away meaningful human control and put our trust in artificial
intelligence (AI) to select targets and attack them with violent force?
To answer this, we take a journey into less deadly application domains
where the biases of such systems are clear to see. En route we'll
examine the causes of bias inherent in the use of machine learning with
big data and why a lack of transparency makes the bias problem difficult
to fix. Finally, similar problems of bias in the use of automated face
recognition are discussed in relation to target acquisition. Much of the
recent discussions about a[utonomous weapons systems (AWS) have focused
on careful military planning, on maintaining wider loops for human
control and on human oversight.]{.underline} While conventional military
planning is important, we must consider the stark reality of other ways
that the technology may be used. Modern armed conflict is rarely about
high densities of military personnel meeting on a battlefield with the
aim of killing as many of their opponents as they can. It [is replete
with un-uniformed combatants moving through and hiding among civilian
populations. Some believe that AWS will be able to pick out specific
people or classes of people who may be legitimate targets of attack
(setting aside the plethora of international human rights issues). But
is this a **humanitarian disaster waiting in the wings? Bias in decision
algorithms**]{.underline} The acceleration in the commercialisation of
AI has largely been the product of two main factors (i) an increase in
power, memory and speed of computers and (ii) the availability of large
quantities of data about so many aspects of our lives. These factors
have enabled the use of machine learning tools in an unprecedented way
for innovative commercial applications. These include algorithms being
delegated with decisions that impact on people's lives in the belief
that algorithms will make more objective and hence fairer and less
biased decisions than error prone and biased humans Unfortunately, it is
becoming alarmingly clear from a growing body of evidence that decision
algorithms are perpetuating injustice for many. Many cases are emerging
that postcode, ethnicity, gender, associations and poverty negatively
bias the decisions being delegated to machines. Tech giants such as
Google and Microsoft openly admit that there are bias problems and they
have been doing their best, unsuccessfully so far, to find solutions.
Areas of injustice coming to light include: Insurance risk, mortgage
loan decisions, shortlisting, hiring and interviewing for jobs, job
advertising, bail and recidivism risk, assessment, custodial sentencing,
airport security and predictive policing. One of the common causes of
decision biases arises from ethnicity or gender biases, often
unconscious, of the programmer or of those classifying the data samples.
[Another major cause is the application of machine learning algorithms,
such as deep learning, and the way in which they are trained. I will
cover two of the inherent causes below and then explain why lack of
transparency makes them difficult to fix.]{.underline} How [machine
learning can ignore minorities]{.underline} One of the benefits of using
machine learning systems in an engineering context is that they reduce
or remove the impact of outliers (examples outside of the norms in the
data) in the training data. For example, shaky arm movements of a robot
can be turned into smooth movements by training with machine learning.
However, [in the context of a decision algorithm, the 'outliers' can be
the minority groups in the data.]{.underline} These may be [people from
different ethnic groups or a low represented gender. Google]{.underline}
[illustrates this problem by training a system with drawings of shoes.
Most of the sample are the plain shoes or trainers drawn by the majority
of people. But some people drew high-heels. Because this was a minority,
the post training tests misclassified high heels as 'not
shoes'.]{.underline} This is a simple example where the
[misclassification can be clearly seen]{.underline}. In a targeting
context there would be no way of knowing which minorities could
mistakenly fall into the category of legitimate targets. And **[in
conflict it is rarely possible to get clear information about casualties
and whether or not they were legitimate targets or collateral
damage.]{.underline}** Bias problems in the data Our societal values and
norms are constantly evolving with massive changes over the last 50
years in what is acceptable to say in the media or in the workplace and
also as to what are discriminatory practices. However, it appears that
most of the [old values are locked into the internet where much of the
training data for machine learning algorithms are derived]{.underline}.
Studies have demonstrated that, for example, '[**man'** is associated
with boss, president, leader and director, whereas '**woman'** is
associated with helper, assistant, employee and aide]{.underline}.
Google searches for black names like Leroy and Keisha yield ads
associated with crime, whereas white names like Brad and Katie yield
sites with contact details. Searches for professional hair yield images
of white women whereas for unprofessional hair we get images of
well-groomed black women. Then there are latent biases in data created
by frequency of occurrence---e.g., searching on Google images for
pictures of great physicists yields mostly pictures of men. The societal
push towards greater fairness and justice is being held back by
historical values about poverty, gender and ethnicity that are ossified
in big data. There is no reason to believe that bias in targeting data
would be any different or any easier to find. [Lack of transparency and
explanation]{.underline} In the Google shoe classification example
described above---amplification through filtering---the data may contain
flat soles, small heels, high heels, laces, no laces, strips, shiny
material etc. When the [algorithm has completed learning, it would be
difficult or perhaps impossible to work out which features of the
drawing had been selected to trigger the shoe/non-shoe decision. This
lack of transparency is because the end result of learning is large
matrices of numbers that are used to generate the
decisions.]{.underline} No one has, as yet, found a general means to
probe the matrices to find out what features of the data it has assigned
to the decision. This means that no explanation can be given for why a
particular decision has been made. [Imagine the dangers that this poses
for targeting decisions where we cannot tell what features are
responsible for classifying a person or object as a legitimate target.
This is the dark recess where bias lives. **The consequences of bias in
armed conflict**]{.underline} All of this injustice is happening in the
civilian domain where there has been plenty of time to test, scrutinize
and construct these systems. It emphasises the problems of
accountability and responsibility in the automation of weaponry that we
have been discussing for years. When it comes to armed conflict[, data
management will be considerably more difficult. If there is bias in
civil society, just imagine the kinds of bias that will be built into
algorithms being delegated with life and death decisions in conflict
zones where we have little or no proper understanding of the cultures
involved]{.underline}. Given the enormous challenges we are already
facing in trying to develop fair and just AI systems, the chances of
justice in civilian laden conflict zones is vanishingly small. [There is
even bias in **automated face recognition**]{.underline} Proponents of
autonomous weapons systems might still argue that automated face
recognition could form an objective and unbiased basis for automating
kill decisions in urban warfare. They may even suggest that it is the
ideal tool to track down and kill 'high value targets'. After all, it
has been shown to be accurate in laboratories and it has been developed
and sold by the major tech companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.
But there are problems. First, [the NGO, Big Brother Watch used freedom
of information requests to obtain accuracy data on the UK police force's
use of NEC's NeoFace Watch to find criminal faces among
crowds.]{.underline} The results of their ensuing report were shocking.
The **[average false face recognition was 95%.]{.underline}** Yes, that
means that only 5% of those identified were that person. The worst
results were the metropolitan police force's use of the technology at
the big Afro-Caribbean Notting Hill Carnival with only 2% correct
recognition accuracy over a weekend. Just imagine the humanitarian
consequences if that had been an AWS selecting targets [Second, the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) conducted a range of tests with
Amazon's Rekognition system that is becoming popular among U.S. police
departments. One of their tests matched photographs of members of the
U.S. Congress against a database of 25,000 publicly available 'mug
shots' of criminals. **The system incorrectly matched 28 members of
Congress with people who had been arrested**.]{.underline} This has led
U.S. lawmakers to raise questions about the police use of the technology
and both Amazon and Microsoft (who make their own facial recognition
software) have called for new regulations. From the perspective of bias,
it is important to note that the ACLU test showed that a
disproportionate number of African-American and Latino members of
Congress were misidentified as criminals. The [best results reported for
face recognition are for white males and that has been the conclusion of
a number of academic studies. Gender, age and shade of skin really do
matter to automated face recognition.]{.underline} Joy Buolamwini from
MIT, tells the story of how her research on using a computer avatar was
hampered because the face recognition software could not even find her
face, never mind recognise it---the missing face problem. She had to
wear a white mask to be seen. Buolamwini then conducted a comprehensive
research study on three major commercial face recognition systems for
gender classification: IBM Watson Visual Recognition, Microsoft Face
Detect and Face++. The face pictures were of parliamentarians from three
northern European countries and three African countries. A range of skin
shades were represented. **[The result was that all systems perform
better on males versus females and the lighter the skin the more
accurate the result. All performed worst on darker female faces with
error rates from 20.8% to 34.7%.]{.underline}**

#### AI reproduces the [subjectivity]{.underline} of the people that create it\-\--statistically that is white, male, and wealthy. 

**Roff, 16** \[Heather M. Roff works for the global security imitative

This brings us full circle to the problem of which objects and concepts
get represented in the dataset. If the
[[programmers]{.underline}]{.mark}, who are [[**predominantly** white,
male, upper-middle]{.mark} [class]{.mark} and
[academic]{.mark},]{.underline} equip an AI with [these
perspectives]{.underline}, then it is not difficult to see how
[[gendered constructions will reproduce]{.mark} themselves]{.underline}
(AAUW 2015). A particular [[masculinity]{.mark} might be
[**reproduced**, or a particular view of femininity]{.mark} may not be
**[modeled]{.mark}** at all]{.underline} (Adam 1998, 23). In either
case, [the [AI is clearly **not** "gender neutral]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Sub-symbolic systems fare no better. In these "bottom--up" systems, the
[AIs are left to figure things out on their own]{.underline}. The AI is
a blank slate, where programmers envision creating an intelligence on
par with a child's brain.20 By [emulating the learning processes of a
child, from adolescence through adulthood, one is able to create a
generally intelligent]{.underline} AI (Storrs Hall 2007, 137). Aside
from the [ethical considerations about an AI-baby]{.underline}, there
are other technological limitations and hazards about bottom--up
systems. In particular, because there are [no preprogrammed
constraint]{.underline}s (e.g. do not kill noncombatants) [and it is a
learning system]{.underline}, it has the potential to learn the "wrong
thing" (Wallach and Allen 2009, 110). Programmers acknowledge the
potential for such "bad behavior" and have taken seriously the AI-baby
approach where a programmer oversees the "education" of the AI. Yet this
does not assuage fears of a gendered AI. In fact, [[it would almost
guarantee not only a masculinist AI, but would also pervert the very
nature of learning]{.underline}]{.mark}. The AI [would have very limited
social interaction]{.underline}: it lives in a lab, does not go to
school, interacts with one type of person and [[is limited to whatever
interaction its "caregiver" decides to give]{.mark} it]{.underline}
(Weber 2014). This is not to say that there are no women in robotics or
AI labs, but that [the [culture **permeating** computer science and
robotics is **predominantly** masculine]{.mark}, and that the
[women]{.mark} have [**consistently** remained a mere quarter of the
population of computer scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} since 1960
(Burleigh 2015; AAUW 2015). Finally, [[the statistical approach
will]{.mark} also [produce gendered AI. It works off of basic
probabilistic mathematical models of how the world operates]{.mark}.
T]{.underline}he statistical approaches will utilize certain kinds of
modeling, such as Bayesian inference or networks. In a Bayesian
inference, the model will predict with x probability that a statement is
true, whereas a Bayesian network is a graph "whose nodes represent
statements or measurements," and the "links between the statements or
measurements correspond to the Bayesian-inference steps with the
appropriate probabilistic models" (Storrs Hall 2007, 156). Of course
much depends on the model, the available data and the scope of the
problem to solve. For the machine to solve a problem requires "taking
enough statistics from enough evaluations" to first form the model, and
thus requires either interacting many times in a particular situation or
a large enough data set from which it could draw to be prepared to act
with any reliability in a new context.

#### Lethal autonomous weapons are the newest instantiation of hegemonic masculinity. This imposes new [gender hierarchies in warfare]{.underline}, which increases the risk of war and conflict.

However, one [[cannot]{.mark} disregard the [**utilitarian** element
that **gendered** arguments]{.mark}]{.underline} can lend to [militarism
and war]{.underline}. Given the [gender **[hierarchy]{.mark}** socially
[imposed]{.mark} by hegemonic **[masculinity]{.mark}**, masculinised
ideals]{.underline} [can also be [imported to societal element]{.mark}s
and institutions]{.underline} to give them legitimacy and survival. 46
It is within this scenario that feminist literature propels forward the
argument that militarism/militarisation and hegemonic masculinity are
made closely intertwined. Feminist literature explains this interplay
with two main points. First, it is argued that [**[gendered]{.mark}**
arguments [help war and **militarism**]{.mark}]{.underline} tobe
[[perceived]{.mark} as [legitimate and **acceptable** social
practice]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. Secondly,
[[transformations]{.mark} in the way in which [**warfare** is conducted
can produce new **insights**]{.mark} on gender, [as masculinity needs
to]{.mark} [respond]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [**requirements** of the war
machine]{.mark} to maintain male dominance]{.underline}. These new
insights on gender allow for the continued acceptability of new methods
of warfare by incorporating them as novel outlooks onideals of hegemonic
masculinity. Within this context, [international relations scholar
Kimberly Hutchings explains how **idealised** masculine **military**
archetypes vary throughout time and **space**]{.underline}, 50 as in the
examples of the chivalrous just warrior in the Middle Ages to the
technologically skilled nuclear intellectual analysed by Carol Cohn. In
order to understand how these [war **[transformations]{.mark}** can
[both use gendered **discourses**]{.mark} as a tool of **legitimacy**
and have [**transformative** implications]{.mark}]{.underline} on
masculinised [ideals]{.underline}, it is necessary to comprehend how
these war transformations first come about. For the purposes of this
study's focus on robotic warfare, the account brought by defence scholar
MikkelVedby Rasmussen on its development is particularly useful as the
author explains at length how these new technologies serve the needs of
the contemporary risk society. Specifically within the context of the
U.S military, [the author [analyses]{.mark} how the [revolution in
**military** affairs]{.mark} (RMA) and [the development of robotic
**technologies**]{.mark} in warfare emerge]{.underline} as a response
[to the diminished number of conscripts after Vietnam, 53 as well as the
increasing concern in minimising risks at war]{.underline}. Robotic
warfare then emerged as an [effective, precise and apparent "risk-free"
alternative,]{.underline} and the added value of its pre-emptive
character and [[future **capacities** meets the yearnings of U.S
security concerns after 9/11]{.underline}]{.mark}. Within this context
where risk to the lives of citizens is to be avoided at all costs,
feminist literature emphasises how gendered assertions are being used
andtransformed to enhance the acceptability of robotic technologies in
military operations. Scholars such as Mary Manjikian and Lorraine B. de
Volo, for instance, examine how gendered speech reframes [these
technological activities as masculine]{.underline}, by associating [the
idea of the "**[cyberwarrior]{.mark}**" with that of an [enhanced
super-]{.mark}**male**:]{.underline} stronger, more efficient and able
to operate in offensives for a longer time.56 On the other hand,
[[robotic warfare also "**recalibrates**" gender by]{.mark} inserting
new [**qualities** such as]{.mark}]{.underline} [„[technical
prowess]{.underline}]{.mark} [and manual dexterity]{.underline}‟ into
[the idea of hegemonic **masculinity**, therefore helping validate
**robotic** usage]{.underline}. This increased association of drones to
a „[**[techno-modernised]{.mark}**‟ version of masculinity [then
re-asserts and re-establishes masculine **authenticity**]{.mark} into
robotic warfare, with the aim of **validating** it as a useful response
to the new risk-averse mentality in warfare.]{.underline} At this point,
it is interesting to note how the [traditional masculinised "protector"
role is shifted from the individual soldier to the nation.]{.underline}
Rasmussen, for example, investigates how the robotic RMA is construed as
a means for the U.S. military to get its soldiers out of danger, and de
Volo underscores how the logic of U.S. acting as a patriarchal masculine
protector to both its population and soldiers is strengthened by robotic
usage. 59However, the discourse of the „masculine protector‟ used by the
country willing to deploy robotic technology in its warfare efforts also
has other consequences. As explained by de Volo, „one person's masculine
protector is another's masculine predator‟, and the nation willing to
employ robotic usage can project itself as a dominant predator weakening
the countries it targets. When a nation cannot protect their own
territory against a drone attack, the attacker arises as a global
patriarch and its over-powering aggressiveness de-masculinises the
country that hosts the offensive.61As a result, [this creates a gendered
divide among nations -- [the „**masculine**‟ predator countries]{.mark}
that [can use robotic technology]{.mark} in their war efforts, and the
„[feminised‟ ones that are "**penetrated**]{.mark}]{.underline}" by the
such robotic [military enterprise]{.underline}s. From the considerations
above, it is possible to observe that robotic warfare has been
considered to reinforce rather than rewrite gender hierarchies.[63It has
been seen to perpetuate the [mutually **constitutive** link
between]{.mark} militarisation and **[masculinity]{.mark}**]{.underline}
through a continual [renewing of notions of [hegemonic
masculinity]{.mark}. At]{.underline} the same time, it has been regarded
to import gendered tropes to enhance the acceptability of a "risk-free"
warfare project, by imprinting a protector/predator imagery to the
nation willing to use such type of technology.

#### Maintaining lethal autonomous weapons causes a tradeoff of [priorities.]{.underline} Killer robots won't create peace, but they do sustain a system where [military dominance]{.underline} must come at the cost of human security.

FFP [addresses the [root **causes** of violence]{.mark}]{.underline} and
insecurity by calling for an [[**institutional** overhaul]{.mark} of
foreign policy and national **security**]{.underline}. Our world is
structured around the patriarchy and naturally, its systems and power
hierarchies will be reflected in the weapons we produce. This report
will highlight some of the issues revealed when a feminist lens is
turned onto killer robots. In Chapter 1, militarisation and masculinity
will be explored, including how ideas about masculinity influence a
militarised approach to national security. In Chapter 2, gender-based
violence and the question of accountability are discussed. The
distinction between combatant and civilian are blurred within a
patriarchal and racist context, and the ability for killer robots to
commit sexualised violence is highlighted. Lastly, in Chapter 3, racism
and imperialism is analysed, with a look at how existing societal biases
are built into any new technology we would produce. Finally, the report
concludes with a summary of the policy recommendations included
throughout each of the three chapters. For decades, feminists have
campaigned against the violent patriarchal structures that sustain
conflict and keep an elite few in power. By building societal
hierarchies so that only a small and specific group of people have
access to the top - which often in Western countries means straight
white men - particular ideas about who is best suited to lead become
intrinsically linked to gender and gendered traits. This means the lens
through which foreign policy is often conducted has its roots in
stereotypical masculine characteristics that have historically been
accepted as best for policymaking. These traits include things like
being rational, strong, and assertive, while avoiding more
feminine-coded traits like emotion or empathy. [[These ideas about
**gender** feed directly into how national security is understood as
a]{.underline} militarised [space]{.underline}]{.mark} (Cohn, 2018).
Gender (referring to someone's identity as a man, woman, or gender
non-conforming) and gendered traits (referring to concepts about
masculinity and femininity) are overlapping but not entirely synonymous.
Reference to masculinity here is done so with the understanding that it
is a social construct based upon stereotypes to fuel a patriarchal
hierarchy of power. The ability to exercise such traits, however, is not
exclusive to men, and this report is not interested in reinforcing dated
and static ideas of men as masculine and women as feminine. As bell
hooks notes, "Black women are very likely to feel strongly that white
women have been quite violent, militaristic in their support and
maintenance of racism" (hooks, 1995). [Anyone is capable of expressing a
wide variety of characteristics]{.underline}. Furthermore, including
other social categories like race or class into this consideration
likewise continues to reveal a complicated system of power dynamics
based around identity that play out both between individuals as well as
states. The power dynamics found in much of today's foreign and security
policy are framed around realism, an ideology that understands state
relationships through the lens of power optimisation. Part of this
process means developing new weapons technology in order to continually
seek military dominance. Killer robots [fit in well with this strategy,
and sustain a system that **values**]{.underline}
[**[maintaining]{.underline}** [**power** and security through military
**dominance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The means of keeping peace, then,
rests upon the ability to threaten or inflict violence (Conway, 2016;
Starr, 2020[). [Military domination becomes an easily justifiable form
of **peacekeepin**]{.mark}**g**]{.underline}, and masculine-coded traits
like aggression and dominance are seen [not just as fundamental to
**security** policy, but taken as objective truth within **security**
policy]{.underline}. In this sense, masculinity is systematised by
associating ideas about [[manliness with the **willingness** to
exercise]{.mark} [violence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cohn, 1993). By
centring masculine traits as [preferential in security policy, "**[human
bodies and their vulnerability]{.mark}**, human lives and their
subjectivity - [all of which are marked as **feminine**]{.mark} in the
binary dichotomies of gender discourse]{.underline}" (Cohn, 1992), get
left out. By making it clear that ideas or traits that are coded as
feminine are not legitimate, alternative ideas and approaches to
security policy are silenced. However, an FFP framework is interested
specifically in these silenced ideas, both to explore the fresh
perspective they offer and to understand why they were silenced in the
first place. A [[feminist framing of **security** also takes a step back
from the realist and **masculine** lens]{.mark} through which much of
security policy is developed, and instead is interested in what makes
the average person secure and safe]{.underline}. Much more immediate
needs must be met when security is reframed with the average individual,
rather than the state, in mind. Access to safe housing, healthy food, a
good education, and affordable healthcare become some of the most
prominent indicators of someone's health and wellness. The ability to
lead a life free from discrimination due to gender, race, class,
sexuality, or ability are also much better indicators for how
sustainability peaceful a society is (Hudson, 2014). A strong military
and extravagant weapons arsenal falls low on the lit of priorities in
comparison. An FFP would then call for investment not into weapons
technology and the military, but instead into the infrastructure of a
society and programs to increase equality. As long as militarisation is
the lens through which security policy is developed, and gendered traits
remain driving factors behind ideas about security, sustainable peace is
not possible. By investing in new weapons technology, we are continuing
down a path that guarantees violence rather than challenges it. [[Killer
robots will **not contribute to peace**]{.mark}**,** but sustain a
[system]{.mark} where a [narrow]{.mark} and **[patriarchal understanding
of security is supported]{.mark}**, continuing to leave [many vulnerable
and at risk of violence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The negative's evidence will *almost assuredly* be structured through a Western [epistemological frame]{.underline} that marginalizes oppressed bodies. Any "LAWS good" argument must fully account for the [epistemic privilege]{.underline} required to reach such conclusion.

[[**Epistemologically** privileged claims]{.mark} are [present
within]{.mark} **engineering** and [technology literature on
**LAWS**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some are highly personal: "As a former
fighter pilot for the US Navy, but also as a professor of robotics \..."
writes Cummings, going on to decry "debates filled with emotional
rhetoric, often made worse by media and activist organizations" (2019,
20). [This common [**rhetorical** device]{.mark}---[discredit]{.mark}
[opponents as **emotional**]{.mark} and thus not fully
**rational**---and [claiming of]{.mark} personal [**epistemological
privilege** via **credentials**]{.mark} goes much deeper,
though]{.underline}. Technological and engineering writing reinforces
LAWS' ostensible virtues in unemotionally calculating [legal compliance,
creating a "meaningful human" that is, ironically, so [**hyper-Western**
as to be more machine-like]{.mark} than hum]{.underline}an. This section
focuses on how this technological trope works to close down debates
about "meaningful humans" and then points toward how efforts to
empirically establish ethical bases for assessing MHC ought not to be
done. [That leads to a fifth and final research agenda
item---decentering [**Western technological history** and ideas of
**progress**]{.mark}, and [the **gendered** and racialized
**assumptions** they contain]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rationalistic ideals
ascribed to LAWS are already critiqued for their gender stereotypes:
rational, utilitarian, detached, logical (read "male") LAWS are superior
to emotional, illogical, and impulsive (read "female") humans. MHC
deploys a masculine stereotype of the "fully" human person that, in the
face of technological advances, no human can now fulfill: "all humans
become subordinated as weak, incapable and emotional; that is,
feminized" (Roff 2016b, 11). "[[**Technology** is not going to free
us]{.mark} from gendered practices and hierarchies \... [but will
instead **reify** those]{.mark} very practices and power
relationships]{.underline}. \... \[C\]reating gendered autonomous
machines \... will solidify a version of hegemonic masculinity, and
further factionalize and subordinate all other masculinities and
femininities" (Roff 2016b, 12). The tragic irony of ascribing [Western
masculine [characteristics]{.mark} used for [centuries to **oppress**
women and **non-Western**]{.mark} men to potentially sideline all humans
in decision-[making]{.mark} about whether]{.underline}, when, and how to
kill humans is seemingly lost. Jones (2018) develops xenofeminist
critiques of LAWS (and other technologies), blurring categories between
human and technology, and "hacking" AI development based on unspoken
paradigms of white, Western, heteronormative masculinity to reorientate
technology to advance feminist outcomes. This provides analytical and
normative purchase on AI. [Challenging [the **epistemological** location
of dominant **LAWS debate**]{.mark} by the two-step move of
[posthumanism and]{.mark} xenofeminism establishes [that apparently
taken-for-granted]{.mark} [assumptions]{.mark} in [**LAWS**
debates]{.mark} should be destabilized]{.underline}. Taking seriously
what it means to be human and what it means to look at technology from a
marginalized perspective is invaluable. Contra Cummings (2019, 21), MHC
cannot be reduced to, "a discussion about role allocation between humans
and autonomous systems" where good decision-making is defined
algorithmically (e.g., Arkin 2009) as the application of a specific set
of rules in a context where the immediate utilitarian maximization of
desirable outcomes and the minimization of undesirable harms is the
standard of judgment. Killing the "right" people or destroying the
permitted material objects, lends itself to quantification and a
data-processing epistemology commonplace in the engineering and
technology approach. AI can process more data from a wider array of
inputs faster than any human or team of humans, so let AI make the
decisions, especially in high-pressure, time-critical environments
(Cummings 2019). MHC may even become unnecessary, especially at the
point of target engagement, if operational simulations validate
carefully designed and tested systems. This is Cummings' (2019) notion
of "meaningful human certification," reflecting technological
determinism and algorithmic approaches to decision-making found
elsewhere in engineering and technology discussions of autonomous
processes in increasingly technologically mediated military functions
(e.g., Li, Huai, and Wang 2017). If ethics and law are programmable
problem sets solvable through algorithmic processing of large-scale data
and machine learning, and in need of insulation from "emotion" or
similar pollutants, then the case for LAWS makes itself (Arkin 2010).
The benefits of autonomous systems that "help prevent injuries or death,
as is the case with advanced driver assistance [systems increasingly
found in automobiles," are apparent to "most reasonable people"
(Kirkpatrick 2016, 27). This analogy with cars (see also Nyholm 2018)
[reinforces the idea that "**reasonableness**]{.mark}" derives [from a
particular **epistemology**]{.mark}. Reductions of harms such as
[**death or injury** through technological
**innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, arising from a capitalist mode of
production, [speak to a [**utilitarianism** that is **universalizing**
]{.mark}**in its assumptions** a[nd hostile to accounts of **ethical
relationships**]{.mark} to **[other humans,]{.mark} to [the natural
world, or]{.mark} to ideas of [spirituality and the
divine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These [are not calculable, so, by
inference, not "**[reasonable" in thinking about
LAWS]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The "meaningful human" in this paradigm is
abstracted from specific social, political, economic, cultural, and
historical circumstances. Yet, in reality, the idealized conditions of
post-enlightenment Western modernity are inextricable from the account
of reasonableness: the rational, sovereign, liberal, rights-holding
subject within a modern project. Particularly [pernicious here, however,
is that this **subjectivity is trivialized through the analogy with
civilian technologi**es, such as autonomous cars, negating the moral
distinctions between peace and war via their ethical codes and systems,
and the virtues they demand]{.underline} (e.g., Walzer 2006).
[Technologically [**rendering violence against the non-Western**
"ordinary]{.mark}," a part of the everyday and the everywhere, and
[imposing a subjectivity onto non-Western peoples]{.mark}
that]{.underline} confers permission to kill has been a trend in the use
of drone warfare (e.g., Gregory 2011a; Shaw and Akhter 2012; Niva 2013;
Williams 2015b; Agius 2017; Gregory 2017; Hurd 2017). This [[technology
**prefigures**]{.mark} many of the **potential [uses of LAWS]{.mark}**
[and displays a track record whereby]{.mark} control over drones has
[been moved away from public scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline} or
engagement, [even by citizens of Western **democracies**]{.underline},
and certainly from the citizens and governments of the places where
drone use is most extensive (e.g., Niva 2013). MHC [via the engineering
and technology processes and principles that drive AI-based autonomy has
no room for people who see their relationship to]{.underline} others and
their place in the world differently. Disciplinary forgetfulness about
racial and colonial legacies manifests here, too. [The role of
[**technological** and engineering]{.mark} sophistication in
constructing "**[barbarians]{.mark}**" and "savages" in [the "standard
of civilization" is set asid]{.mark}e.]{.underline} Bourke (2017)
reveals how the language of overt civilizational hierarchy that
characterized technological discussions of weapons development in the
past has been sublimated and replaced by euphemism. [Outcomes, though,
are similar: "[their" "**irrationality**" and "**unreasonableness**"
are]{.mark} reasons [why LAWS should be developed]{.mark} and deployed
to **protect** "us" [from violence **stemming** from]{.mark} their
[failure to adopt "our" **subjectivity**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Te[chnology\'s centrality to the history of colonial and post-colonial
violence]{.underline}, from the civilian bombing strategies of World War
II, the conduct of the Vietnam War, to collusion in contemporary
conflicts such as Yemen, to pick from an immense list, is glossed over.
[The human victims of increasingly **technologically** mediated,
amplified, and justified violence count for little; their perspective as
"meaningful humans" counts for less]{.underline}. [As with
**[IR]{.mark}** and security studies, and [law and **ethics**,
destabilizing historical mythmaking]{.mark} of Western civilizational
superiority in this literature is an important agenda]{.underline} item.
[This [dehumanization]{.mark} of [non-Western subjectivities]{.mark} in
engineering and technology literature, and [trivializing
LAWS]{.mark}]{.underline} via analogy to ot[her autonomous technologies,
misses another key aspect of how [LAWS will
**develop**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Jones effectively highlights and
also discussed in the critical literature on drones (e.g., Williams
2011; Gregory 2011b), [the human--AI interface and the development of
technologically **augmented** human combatants make issues of human
control and human--machine interconnection increasingly
complex.]{.underline} The point in the design, development, deployment,
and operational use of LAWS at which "control" occurs is complex and
noted in GGE discussions as being a point of concern (e.g., Group of
Governmental Experts on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal
Autonomous Weapons System 2021, para. 7--12). However, [technological
augmentation and increasing [AI are not **confined**]{.mark} to
human--technological [**assemblages** of drones and other weapons
**platforms**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The direct technological
augmentation of human beings is a near-future prospect, as systems such
as exoskeletons to augment human strength, speed, and endurance move
from laboratories to operational deployment. [LAWS, as]{.underline}
Nyholm (2018) discusses, although in a very different way and rooted in
the problematic analogy with driverless cars, will [most likely operate
as parts of systems where human **[agents are present and
acting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Nyholm addresses the ostensible
"accountability gap" LAWS create, following Jones, I show how this opens
the door to alternative epistemological perspectives. Jones (2018, 2019)
shows how posthumanism asks questions about the nature of
(technologically augmented) human agency. Is the MHC concept applicable
to a weapon system that includes both human and machine components?
Inclusion could be via direct technological augmentation of human
decision-making capacities: for example, information gathering,
processing, and analyzing, through to partial decision-making. This
echoes worries about "on the loop" MHC falling prey to well-established
human tendencies to defer to normally accurate and reliable
technological systems, even when those systems recommend actions other
information challenges (e.g., Roff and Danks 2018, 9). However, the
argument goes further---are technologically augmented humans still
"humans"? Is their control "human" control? The "X human Y" debate again
fails to grapple with the contestable "human" at its center.
Robillard\'s certainty about the binary nature of agency looks doubtful
when the human and machine blend. The assumption of LAWS as substitutes
for humans falls when they are inextricably entangled elements of a
single system. Picking up the discussion of relationality from section
"Grounding MHC", posthumanism points to the possibility that
relationality will encompass technology, or, at least, technologically
enhanced humans. There has been, up to now, a Western-centrism in key
applications of posthumanism, such as xenofeminism (Jones 2019, 131). So
the agenda here is also one that can benefit from non-Western
engagement, decentering Western historical experience and intellectual
assumptions to enrich debate about "meaningful humans." [[These
**epistemological** debates are]{.mark}, though, absent in the
engineering and [technology policy literature considered]{.mark} here.
Instead, [**epistemological** questions are ducked th]{.mark}rough
appeals to resolution via [public **opinion** research]{.mark} and
([invariably Western]{.mark}) "experts]{.underline}." Why these are
definitive sources of valid knowledge about LAWS is never, in the
sources surveyed, properly explained. Verdiesen, Santoni de Sio, and
Dignum (2019) instantiate how empirical evidence of public opinion is
used to ostensibly validate ethical ideas about LAWS. "[We have
identified several values that people associate with Autonomous Weapons
Systems \... derived from both validated ethical theories \[all Western
in origin\] and from experts \... in the debate on Autonomous Weapons
System]{.underline}s or \[who\] work in the military domain" (Verdiesen,
Santoni de Sio, and Dignum 2019, 42). While they recognize exploring
non-Western perspectives on LAWS is an issue for further research (2019,
42--43), we can, it seems, get a good-enough sense from surveying
Western public opinion and military personnel, and thus empirically
determine "correct" ethical positions. Horowitz (2016b) does much the
same to challenge claims that public opinion polling shows opposition to
LAWS (Human Rights Watch 2016, 16--17), but without the caveats about
needing to ask non-Westerners (or, even, non-Americans) in the future.
Seemingly, only US public opinion matters as the US public\'s
perspective can stand as universal. Morgan et al. (2020, 100--117) [also
focus public opinion research on the United States, showing "in
principle" objections to [LAWS decline]{.mark} when contextualized in
relation to the United States [**securing** victory against LAWS-using
enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the absence of public opinion data,
[technologists appeal to nonengineering expertise on the [**potential**

[retired Western [military personnel, most commonly from the United
States]{.mark}, or in think tanks closely connected to the
military]{.underline} (e.g., Kirkpatrick 2016, 28--29). The
[[**epistemological** closure through **privileging** Western
public]{.mark} and "[expert" opinion and specific accounts]{.mark} of
Western [**technological** development and progress]{.mark}, typically
[sanitized of its **colonial** and **racist** episodes, goes

[Affirming the principle of meaningful human control via a preemptive
ban]{.underline} This [matter of whether autonomous weapons are
ethically acceptable lies at the core of the debate over
them]{.underline}. The fundamental question is not technological, but
philosophical: "[Will machines be given the power and authority to kill
a human being?"]{.underline} History has shown that for some [weapons
that significantly threaten non-combatants, including poison gas,
biological weapons, chemical weapons, blinding lasers, antipersonnel
mines, and cluster munitions, responsible governments have found it
necessary to supplement the limits already in the international legal
framework]{.underline}. **[Fully autonomous weapons have the potential
to raise a comparable level of humanitarian concern]{.underline}**.
Based on current and foreseeable technology, the [ICRC says there are
serious doubts about the ability of autonomous weapon systems to comply
with IHL]{.underline} "in all but the narrowest of scenarios and the
simplest of environments." Because of this, the ICRC says "it seems
evident that overall human control over the selection of, and use of
force against, will continue to be required." The [Campaign to Stop
Killer Robots fundamentally objects to autonomous weapons because it
rejects the notion that a machine should be permitted to take a human
life on the battlefield or in policing, border control, or any
circumstances]{.underline}. It seeks to affirm the positive principle
that weapons systems, military attacks, and the use of violent force in
policing should always be kept under meaningful human control. [In order
to do that, the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots calls on states and
others to endorse its call for a preemptive ban on the development,
production, and use of fully autonomous weapons systems.]{.underline}
The global coalition of non-governmental organizations does not oppose
military use of autonomy and technologies relating to artificial
intelligence, but it draws the line at the development of machines that
could select and fire on targets without human intervention. Research
and development activities should be banned if they are directed at
technology that can be used exclusively for fully autonomous weapons or
that is explicitly intended for use in such weapons. **[A preemptive
prohibition is both possible and desirable.]{.underline}** **[The
Convention on Conventional Weapons Protocol IV banning blinding lasers
provides precedent for the creation of a protocol on lethal autonomous
weapons systems.]{.underline}** The [campaign has urged that states ban
rather than regulate fully autonomous weapons because a co**mplete
prohibition is clearer and easier to enforce than partial regulations or
restrictions and eliminates room for different
interpretations**.]{.underline} A [complete prohibition creates greater
stigma against the weapons and discourages their proliferation. Mere
regulation would still allow governments to obtain them, and be tempted
to use them illegally.]{.underline} The [serious international security
and proliferation concerns relating to fully autonomous weapons include
the real danger that if even one nation acquires these weapons, others
may feel they have to follow suit in order to defend themselves and to
avoid falling behind in a robotic arms race.]{.underline} There is also
the prospect that fully autonomous weapons could be acquired by
repressive regimes or non-state armed groups with little regard for the
law. These weapons could be perfect tools of repression and terror for
autocrats. Another proliferation concern is that such weapons would
increase the likelihood of armed attacks, [making resort to war more
likely]{.underline}, as decision-makers would not have the same concerns
about loss of soldiers' lives. This could have a destabilizing effect on
international security. [Since 2013, a broad range of individuals,
organizations, and states have come forward to endorse the call for a
preemptive ban on fully autonomous weapons systems,
including:]{.underline} • [Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Ghana, The
Holy See, Pakistan, State of Palestine, and Zimbabwe.]{.underline} •
[The European Parliament]{.underline}, which adopted a resolution by a
vote of 534--49 calling for a ban on "development, production and use of
fully autonomous weapons which enable strikes to be carried out without
human intervention." • [Twenty-one Nobel Peace Laureates]{.underline},
who expressed concern that "leaving the killing to machines might make
going to war easier." • [More than 120 religious leaders and
organizations of various denominations]{.underline}, who view the
weapons as "an affront to human dignity and to the sacredness of life."
• More than 270 scientists in 37 countries, who warned how interactions
by devices controlled by complex algorithms "could create unstable and
unpredictable behavior ... that could initiate or escalate conflicts, or
cause unjustifiable harm to civilian populations." • More than 3,000
artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics experts, who said they have
"no interest in building AI weapons and do not want others to tarnish
their field by doing so, potentially creating a major public backlash
against AI that curtails its future societal benefits." • [Canadian
technology company]{.underline} Clearpath Robotics, which said it had
"chosen to value our ethics over potential future revenue" by pledging
not to manufacture "weaponized robots that remove humans from the loop."
• The [ethics council of the \$830 billion Norwegian government pension
fund]{.underline}, which is looking at whether investments in companies
making lethal autonomous weapons systems would violate the fund's
fundamental humanitarian principles. • The [UN Special Rapporteur on
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special
Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of
association, who in a report recommended, "Autonomous weapons systems
that require no meaningful human control should be
prohibited."]{.underline} Finding the way forward, faster toward an
outcome In May 2013, states first deliberated on autonomous weapons in a
multilateral forum when a UN special rapporteur presented a report to
the Human Rights Council that called for an immediate moratorium on the
weapons. At the Convention on Conventional Weapons, also in Geneva,
representatives from more than 85 countries met in May 2014 and April
2015 for a total of nine days to discuss lethal autonomous weapons
systems, while a third meeting took place in April 2016. [Various UN
agencies, international organizations, the Red Cross, and civil society
groups coordinated by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots are also
participating throughout these deliberations and other
meetings]{.underline}, which have helped sharpen the focus on lethal
autonomous weapons systems and the concerns raised by them. The process
is helping to establish a common base of knowledge from which some
nascent norms or principles are finding broad agreement, most notably
the notion that human control must be retained over the operation of
weapons systems. However, the informal talks are being criticized for
"treading water" as they lack ambition, demonstrate no sense of urgency,
and reflect the CCW's usual "go slow and aim low" approach. The Campaign
to Stop Killer Robots calls on states to agree to a more formal and
substantive process, with up to four weeks of work dedicated in 2017,
when they decide on the way forward at the end of the year. The CCW
Review Conference in December 2016 should agree to begin formal
negotiations and aim to complete them within one or two years by
producing a preemptive prohibition on lethal autonomous weapons systems.
Pakistan---the first and probably most ardent supporter of the call for
a ban---will serve as president of the CCW Review Conference, where
states must take crucial decisions on the process going forward and
desired outcome. Sustained and substantive national campaigning is
required to make any headway reining in autonomous weapons, including
legislative scrutiny in the form of debate, questions, and inquiries,
and new legislation to ban the weapons. As Canada's new Minister of
Defense Harjit Sajjan commented to the Halifax Security Forum,
legislative oversight is required as technology advances so that the
burden of deciding on ethical dilemmas associated with their use is not
placed on service men and women. The US is the only country with a
detailed written policy guiding it on fully autonomous weapons, which it
says "neither encourages nor prohibits" development of lethal autonomous
weapons systems." [The US has described fully autonomous weapons as a
potential "force multiplier." Recent media interviews with top Pentagon
officials provide some disturbing signs that the five-year policy may
soon be replaced by guidelines allowing acquisition of
human-out-of-the-loop weapons systems.]{.underline} However, officials
also express support for retaining human control by stating, for
example, that "we will not delegate lethal authority to a machine to
make a decision." Israel has also spoken about the desirability and
potential benefits of autonomous weapons systems, urging other countries
to "keep an open mind" because it is "difficult" to foresee how
developments may look in 10-30 years from now." No other state has
publicly expressed interest in pursuing such systems and several have
explicitly stated that they are not developing such systems and that
have no plans to do so. But there have been extensive discussions about
the potential benefits of such weapons, and many states are concerned
that potential enemies will acquire fully autonomous weapons, making
their continued development inevitable. The trend toward ever-greater
autonomy in warfare has been accelerating greatly in recent years, at an
ever-faster pace. **[A strong, inclusive, and unified effort is needed
now to prevent the unconstrained development of fully autonomous weapons
systems.]{.underline}**

What about NATO? In our 7 June blog we called upon Canada to take a
strong position at the then upcoming [**[NATO]{.mark}** Summit [in
support of a ban on the development and use of fully autonomous weapons
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NATO Communiqué at paragraph 36 makes
only one specific reference to autonomous weapons technologies, stating
that: [Through [NATO-**supported** multinational cooperation
projects]{.mark}, Allies are **committed** to working together to
develop or acquire new capabilities in key areas such as
...**autonomous** systems]{.underline}.... Paragraph 37 contains one
positive, albeit passive, reference to regulation of emerging disruptive
technologies (EDTs), which would include lethal autonomous systems, with
the following statement: This strategy [outlines a clear
approach]{.underline} for identifying, developing, and [adopting EDTs at
the speed of relevance, guided by principles of responsible use, in
accordance with international law,]{.underline} and [taking into account
discussions in relevant international fora.]{.underline} \[emphasis
added\] In the view of Ian Davis of NATO Watch: E[xactly where the
alliance falls on the spectrum between permitting AI-powered military
technology in some applications and regulating or [banning]{.mark} it in
others is expected [to be part of the Strategic Concept
debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 2021 NATO Summit formally launched work
on the new Strategic Concept, to replace that developed in 2010. It is
to be approved at the next summit in 2022. (See Communiqué paragraph 6.)
Reminding us of the UN Secretary-General's support for a total
prohibition on "morally repugnant" weapons that could, by themselves,
target and attack human beings, Davis outlines [the critical role that
NATO can and should play to that end: [With NATO **leadership** such
weapons could be banned]{.mark} by a [treaty **similar** to the
initiatives that **successfully** prohibited]{.mark} **antipersonnel**
[landmines]{.mark} in 1997 [and cluster **munitions**]{.mark} in
2008]{.underline}. Preserving meaningful human control over the use of
force is an [[**ethical** imperative and a legal
**necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The dev[elopment of [a new NATO
Strategic Concept is an opportunity for **member** states to lead by
example in the **global** effort to ban killer robots]{.mark} and to
develop new norms guiding the use of artificial intelligence for defence
purposes.]{.underline} In the view of the Rideau Institute: This would
be a tangible demonstration by NATO members [of their oft-proclaimed
**declaratory** [commitment to strengthening the rules-based
international order.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The first pillar considers **NATO's role in the evolution of ethical
and values-driven AI.** One]{.underline} ongoing debate regarding [AI as
a military technology is the ethical implications and baseline values
the Allies, and others, want infused in the development and adoption
of]{.underline} AI. The [Allies themselves lack uniform consensus on
numerous, substantial ethical questions on the use of AI,]{.underline}
as most clearly [seen in the]{.underline} adjacent [area of the ethics
of autonomy in]{.underline} weapons systems including [lethal autonomous
weapon systems (LAWS]{.underline}). In this discussion, we **[spotlight
NATO's role in facilitating and shaping ethical harmonization as an
operational requirement to ensure successful future
missions.]{.underline}** The second pillar examines legal norms as a
domain wherein legal uncertainty regarding AI has tangible implications
for Allied legal interoperability, a subset of larger coalition
interoperability. Thus far, the legal debate regarding AI has been
largely fixed on the issue of a treaty banning the use of LAWS. In this
section, we advocate for a more nuanced legal picture in [which NATO can
facilitate legal coordination and tackle some of the foundational legal
issues which will prevent successful legal interoperability in future
operations.]{.underline} The third pillar identifies safety and security
of AI systems as prerequisite to trustworthy and responsible AI in any
context, but especially so for the conduct of military activity. At the
NATO level, Allied forces must ensure their systems interoperate safely
and predictably both to ensure effective command and control (C2)
internally, and to prevent disruptions from attacks. It is a
foundational facet of coordination that shows the overlap between NATO
interests in military effectiveness and incentivization for responsible
innovation. Ethics and values One of the vital aspects of AI which has
garnered significant global attention is the ethical implications of
artificial intelligence as a military technology---an issue that has
divided much of the global community, including NATO member states. As a
starting point, researchers and analysts have considered the
implications of emerging military technology in terms of ethical
responsibility and regulation, especially as states and organizations
continue to release AI ethical principles, guidelines, and standards.55
We explore how [**NATO can operationalize the debate around ethics and
values of military AI to garner coordination and continue progress of
EDT harmonization among partners**. Building on the theoretical
discussion from STS and military innovation literature above, the
adoption of technologies that reinforce values serves the strategic
interest of NATO to **shape technological innovation against current
waves of illiberalism.**]{.underline} Additionally, [infusing AI
development with certain ethical principles and values can have
operational advantages and benefits, and NATO can, in particular,
promote the ethical principles as operational standards for the
Allies.]{.underline} [A common critique]{.underline} within the ethics
debate [is that approaching new technology with an ethical]{.underline}
or democratic values-[driven perspective translates into comparative
military disadvantage.]{.underline} Essentially, if your adversary
develops technology without the constraints of ethical principles then
there will be diminished effectiveness on the battlefield.56 We find
[this critique unfounded because it assumes there is a false trade-off
between ethics and effectiveness; instead, we argue ethical foundations
are built into the architecture of modern warfare.]{.underline}57 As
such, ethics is a background condition for battlefield effectiveness,
which is already infused in military decision-making and helping to
guide the boundaries of international humanitarian law. As such[,
ethical guidelines do not have to detract from a military's capacity or
competency to devise means and methods of warfare that will serve their
national or coalition interest.]{.underline}58 If anything, a
first-mover advantage can incentivize an ethical and values-driven AI to
establish the threshold of technological standards globally.59 The
[political dimension of the Alliance rests on the bedrock of a shared
commitment to the "principles of democracy, individual liberty and the
rule of law," as enshrined in the foundational North Atlantic Treaty of
1949.60 **Shared values are important for NATO operations because they
help constitute their legitimacy.**]{.underline} In addition to the
North Atlantic Council e[xerting civilian oversight over NATO
operations, legitimacy also includes respect for international legal
principles including the core principles of international humanitarian
law, or the laws of armed conflict, distinction, proportionality, and
necessity. Without political oversight and legitimacy, NATO's military
power would be less effective at shaping norms and promoting stability
in the international system. The introduction of AI means that NATO has
the moral and strategic imperative to adopt technologies that confer
legitimacy and responsible innovation.]{.underline}61 Acting on a shared
commitment to democratic values is vital to the political cohesion of
the NATO Alliance, just as much as it is a determinant of military
effectiveness in a predictable security environment. Put simply, shared
values are important to both political and operational coherence between
Allies. In its 2018 Framework for Future Alliance Operations, the
strategic command Allied Command Transformation urged discussion of the
legal and ethical dimensions of technological advancement to both know
how it would impact NATO decision-making and how the Alliance would be
prepared to address adversaries who do not share in that vision.62 As
such, [NATO is contending with the ways that ethical AI impacts its own
cohesion internally and how differences between allies may project
outward in the face of competitors whose ethical frameworks and
commitment to the rule of law differ. Internally, there is a strong
national government commitment to responsible AI. Recently,
**transatlantic cooperation has initiated partnerships of largely NATO
states committed to advancing responsible AI with goals towards data
sharing and future interoperability.63 AI defense partnerships are not
restricted to military innovation but rather aim to facilitate civilian
innovation cooperation for defense purposes.**]{.underline} Externally,
as AI-enabled autonomous systems enter the arsenals of more
technologically advanced countries, uncoordinated ethical frameworks
between Allies could pose operational risks. Without wider alignment, AI
systems will have "varying technical specifications based on the legal
and policy decisions made by individual governments when answering the
key questions."64 Further, although one motivation of autonomous systems
is the increased safety of military personnel by removing them from
dangerous situations, the lack of alignment could lead some Allies to
perceive other capitals' deployments of unmanned forces as a lack of
commitment to put lives on the line, therein posing credibility risks
for Allies to assure one another.65 [These credibility risks can be
mitigated by accountability and verification standards and procedures
that NATO can implement for multinational operations, and efforts to
institutionalize these procedures for AI are underway]{.underline}.66
While the [NATO AI Strategy is expected to create a common foundation
for the Alliance's pursuit of AI, it is the implementation of principles
for safe, ethical, legal, and interoperable AI that will reveal how
coherent different national perspectives are]{.underline}. As of August
2021, only the United States and France have publicly issued their
military AI strategies.67 Other allies, including Canada and the United
Kingdom, have emerging views on responsible military AI, but little
official information about how they implement their ethical risk
assessments is publicly available.68 [**NATO's influence** in the
functioning of joint operations and multinational military operations
situates the Alliance to coordinate **between how Allies implement
ethical principles** in their own national AI development]{.underline}.
Specifically, **[NATO is well-situated to advocate for transparency,
accountability, and data governance, which are also adoption factors
that can translate into operational benefits, among other
values]{.underline}**.69 For example, these factors can promote
coordination among Allies on ethical guidelines on the development and
use of AI, as this will be a necessary foundation in any future joint
operation that uses this technology. "The transatlantic partnership must
focus on coordinating these core principles and systematic governance to
ensure AI systems development aligns with the rule of law and democracy.
In particular, this must ensure answering questions about human dignity,
human control, and accountability ... NATO remains the organization that
can bring these two (U.S. and EU) together and establishes the ethical
bottom line."70 The issues of transparency and accountability will
define the scope of future implementation. Many remaining questions and
uncertainty will be addressed in NATO's forthcoming AI ethical
principles guidelines. But the guidelines adopted in 2021 do not address
every ethical dilemma. Regarding accountability, especially, likely
major questions will continue to affect the Alliance. As Assistant
Secretary-General for Emerging Security Challenges David van Weel
recently clarified, NATO will offer a framework of responsible use for
the Allies---but the question of accountability for member states, as
opposed to civilian technology manufacturers for example, is one
principle that will not have an easy solution.71 International legal
norms In certain respects, the legal debate mirrors much of the ethical
debate surrounding AI as the two address many of the same issues.
International law is a values-based system embedded in certain
principles and practices agreed-upon within the international system.
This section certainly identifies the complementarity of the ethical
discussion surrounding AI, but it also illustrates where the legal
debate can depart from the ethical considerations to address different
sorts of legal challenges that face the Alliance. Lawyers, researchers,
and civil society grapple with existing legal regimes relevant to
military operations and the uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding
automated decision-making, particularly in lethal decision-making. Thus
far, the legal dialogue has been heavily anchored in the applicability
of international humanitarian law (IHL), and other relevant legal
regimes, to lethal autonomous weapons systems.72 IHL, also known as the
laws of war or the laws of armed conflict, regulate the means and
methods of warfare and, as such, is pivotal to the emergence of military
technology and how existing legal structures are disrupted. [The legal
debate often revolves around the **prospect of a "treaty ban" of
LAWS.**73]{.underline} But the legal debate is much more nuanced than
the likelihood of international treaties banning any particular weapon
system. Especially because NATO is not a regulatory body, it cannot
institute measures to regulate emerging technology for the Allies.
Instead, [NATO's function in the legal domain may be more effective
outside the traditional legal debates around emerging military
technology and more embedded in fostering cooperation and coordination
among military partners.]{.underline} Other avenues of legal regulation
may fall short of an international convention or prohibition, but
nevertheless [factor significantly in regulating and/or delineating
state policies.]{.underline} Additionally, non-lethal applications of
AI, as well as applications of AI that do not figure into autonomous
systems, also raise important legal questions under international law.
Arguably, norms around non-lethal applications are more urgent as their
development is more advanced, harder to define, and less controversial
in integration.74 Ultimately[**, NATO's facilitative power can help
ensure that integration of EDTs like AI into military capabilities and
into multinational coalition operations is consistent with member
states' legal obligations.** One **vital and unique contribution for
NATO** is facilitating **legal interoperability** among the Allies to
resolve some of the most pressing legal barriers for AI implementation
in future Allied operations.]{.underline} Legal interoperability, a
subset of larger coalition interoperability, [refers to the operational
coordination around partner legal obligations and
interpretatio]{.underline}ns.75 It ensures "[that within a military
alliance, military operations can be conducted effectively consistent
with the legal obligations of each nation]{.underline}."76 Legal
interoperability is a **[critical component of multilateral
operations]{.underline}** that has thus far been under-examined, despite
its centrality to successful military operations. This is largely
because "legal factors have a bearing on everything in alliances and
coalition operations---from determining basic 'troop-to-task'
considerations to decisions regarding the targets to be engaged---and
the types of ordinances that may be used."77 To enhance legal
interoperability, [NATO can exert its influence on how Allies can
develop and deploy AI consistent with their legal
obligation]{.underline}s through its unique standardization capacities.
Historically, NATO has taken significant steps to bridge the legal gap
between Allies on critical procedures that bridge responsible state
behavior with such "troop-to-task" considerations. One instructive
example from past operations is detention policies in non-international
armed conflicts.78 The promulgation of detention standards illustrates
the operational significance of NATO's common legal procedures, even for
coalitions of the willing that formally operate outside NATO structures.
By way of background, the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan had internal
debates regarding the 96-hour security detention time period.79 The
United States advocated extending the 96-hour rule, where coalition
partners insisted adhering to the NATO standard, even though it was not
a NATO operation.80 Generally the detention example illustrates NATO
legal standards providing clarity to non-NATO operations; in some cases,
Allies adopt NATO standards as accepted thresholds that continue to
inform coalition policies beyond NATO structures and operations.
Implementing AI in future military operations will almost certainly
complicate legal interoperability as there is a lack of uniform
standards, as in the detention example. Even some of the more basic
implementation measures will garner legal uncertainty and Allies will
inevitably navigate with minimal legal clarity and no standard
procedures. Despite the roots of the legal debate stemming from the
question of lethality, the most pressing (and urgent) legal issues will
address the integration of necessary AI-enablers, such as data gathering
and sharing. Furthermore, [NATO has coordinated initiatives to promote
awareness of Allies' legal obligations and has a dedicated office
focusing on legality.]{.underline} This centralizes the institutional
capacity to focus on alignment not only between the policies of NATO
Allies, but coherence with the international community more broadly.
Among others, the NATO Legal Practitioners' Workshop and
inter-organizational dialogue between NATO, the UN, and the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the latter of which has
a delegation to NATO that provides legal training and education to
practitioners.81 The NATO Office of Legal Affairs (OLA) itself can also
play a central role in navigating the challenges to legal
interoperability. As the example of detention standards illustrates,
NATO has been successful in implementing legal standards which
translated into operational clarity and coalition policy outside NATO
operations. As part of its focus on responsibility in its EDT agenda,
[NATO has opportunities to facilitate AI legal standard-setting and
coalition policies to ensure safer and responsible use of AI in Allied
operations.]{.underline} Safety and security For humans to meet ethical
and legal commitments when developing and deploying AI, the systems
themselves must be safe, secure, and reliable. More simply put, if
humans and institutions interacting with AI do not have confidence that
the systems will perform as expected, then they cannot assure that its
development and deployment are responsible. This makes safety and
security a key pillar of responsible AI governance for any actor.82 As
this section explores for NATO in particular, safety and security are
indispensable to the Alliance's stated goals to focus its approach to
EDTs in the areas of "deterrence and defense, capability development,
legal and ethical norms, and arms control aspects."83 Politically,
democratic militaries using AI cannot be accountable to their
citizenries nor their coalition partners if they lack mechanisms to
trace and explain how their systems are reliable. Accidents and
interference with AI systems could likewise create political risks for
the Alliance. For example, if deepfakes and micro-targeted information
attacks compromise confidence in the integrity of information used to
build a common operating picture, then the operational difficulties
could also erode political trust between Allies in a few key ways. In
the North Atlantic Council, disagreement about the integrity of
information could slow the decision-making body's ability to react to
fast-changing operational realities.84 Further, compromised AI systems
may not only make it harder for forces to prevent harm to
non-combatants, but also to prevent friendly fire. In this way,
coalition forces arguably face even higher obligations to coordinate on
the reliability of their systems, relative to adversaries and near-peer
competitors that tend to operate alone. As such, responsible AI
governance is not purely technical; policy alignment and strategic
planning are likewise necessary to draw attention to risk management
above the tactical level. Even without being attacked, governability of
AI in a NATO context also means understanding how AI-enabled and
autonomous systems developed by the 30 Allies---and other
partners---will interact with one another. NATO has expressed interest
in governability as a principle of AI "to disengage or deactivate in
case of unintended behavior,"85 which echoes the U.S. Department of
Defense definition of governable AI.86 Disengaging adversaries is
important to maintain de-escalation measures in conflict. For NATO,
interoperability between systems also relates to governable AI because
allies must also consider how the interactions between the 30 Allies'
own AI-enabled and autonomous systems may result in unintended or
emergent behavior.87 This means that NATO has a responsibility to
coordinate activities---be they technical exchanges, standardization
efforts, or training and exercises---to build confidence that the
systems perform as humans intend.88 Without this coordination, the lack
of interoperability of allied systems could lead to accidents, and
separately, the potential loss of operational effectiveness also
presents vulnerabilities for adversaries to exploit. In addition to
governability, NATO and its Allies are assessing the risks that bias,
attacks, and lack of interpretability can introduce in relation to the
anticipated uses of a given AI system.89 In security and defense, new
and heightened risks include poisoning of the information environment,
deception systems and techniques, uncertainty about the performance of
systems in new and unknown environments, and the possibility that
tensions or accidents escalate at a faster tempo than humans and
institutions can process, among others. These risks can manifest either
in motivated attacks or unintentional failure modes.90 In both cases,
assuring and certifying that military assets are safe and secure is
important given the inherently high risk in operational environments.
These operational environments include the presumption that an adversary
is disrupting one's own systems, be it by directly attacking the AI
systems themselves, or disrupting the broader command, control, and
communications systems under which the AI systems are operating.91
Mitigating these types of risks is typically done in testing,
evaluation, validation and verification (TEVV) and in experimentation
activities.92 Yet AI cannot be validated and verified the way
traditional software systems are because there is no guarantee that an
AI system will perform in the real world as it does in a testing
environment, and because lifelong-learning systems will perform
differently over their lifecycle. Having robust assurance and TEVV
processes in place are also important for operators to build trust in
the systems they are meant to use, as well as for citizenries and
coalition partners at large to see that accountability procedures still
apply. As such, building institutional procedures to govern AI safety
and security is necessary to build trust in the use of the
technology---as well as to develop countermeasures and defensive systems
that protect against adversarial threats. NATO thus has an institutional
responsibility to prevent and mitigate these intentional and
unintentional failures if using AI in operations and mission support.93
As Table 69.1 shows, the Alliance also has a range of relevant entities
to coordinate national approaches to AI safety and security, as well as
facilitate safety measures as part of responsible use in the
Alliance-wide ecosystem. NATO has an important role to play in military
standardization and Allied policy planning for safe, secure, and
interoperable AI. This includes the coordinating role of the Conference
of National Armaments Directors and the Command, Control and
Consultation Board to implement complementary acquisition processes that
fuse AI adoption measures with safety responsibilities. Furthermore,
entities including STO and NSO have a significant role setting the
technical baseline and promulgating materiel standards that provide the
technical framework for safety and security. Although their staffs are
themselves small, they both convene hundreds, if not thousands, of
subject matter experts in working groups. As such they both offer unique
technical networks to help shape safety and security in a way that
minimize risk in operations. **[NATO's resources and leadership are
vital to using standards and coalition policy to instill safe and secure
technological development, a necessary condition to interoperable and
successful future operations.]{.underline}**

Some studies that focus on assessing the success of gender mainstreaming
practices at the level of the European Union point to a similar
phenomenon of \"adding other goals,\" as happened in the Message to the
Committee of Ministers to Steering Committees of the Council of Europe
on Gender Mainstreaming. In Hafner-Burton and Pollack\'s analysis (2000)
of five areas (structural funds, employment and social affairs,
development, competition and science, research and development), the
accent is on explaining cross-sectional variety within the European
Commission in the start and the implementation of gender mainstreaming.
They show how important it has been that political opportunities in
Europe have widened and increased over the course of the last decade,
for instance as a result of the entrance of the Nordic countries. They
also show how important lobbying and modernization have been, for
instance the lobbying of WISE (the European organization for women\'s
studies) in the case of gender mainstreaming in science, research, and
development. In assessing the success of gender mainstreaming, they
refer to classical power mechanisms that are at the heart of social
movement theory: political opportunities and mobilizing. In the context
of this article, the most interesting part of their analysis is their
use of the concept of strategical framing, another power mechanism
conceptualized in social movement theory. Strategical framing is a
dynamic concept that enables us to see how [[different actors
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark} existing [[policy frames to
pursue]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[prospective
goals]{.underline}.]{.mark} Strategical framing is defined as attempting
to construct a fit between existing frames, or networks of meaning, and
the frames of a change agent. Hafner-Burton and Pollack show that
[[gender]{.mark}]{.underline} mainstreaming [[is \"sold\" as
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n effective [[means to the
ends]{.mark}]{.underline} pursued by the European Commission, [[rather
than as an overt challenge to those ends]{.mark}.]{.underline} They
argue that the [gender mainstreaming efforts, because of [this
strategical framing, might turn into]{.mark} an integrationist approach,
[integrating ]{.mark}]{.underline}women and [[gender issues
into]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [[regular policies rather than
rethinking]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[fundamental
aims]{.underline}]{.mark} of the European Union [[from a gender
perspective]{.underline}.]{.mark} Especially since the European Union is
one of the most successful implementers of gender mainstreaming so far,
[[this threatens]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[transformative
potential]{.underline}]{.mark} of gender mainstreaming, they say. \[End
Page 358\] Mary Braithwaite\'s work on gender mainstreaming in the
structural funds (1999) corroborates these findings. She finds that
because of the absence of precise objectives on reducing gender
inequalities, [[gender is]{.mark} easily located within and has been
[subjected to other goals]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [such as]{.underline}
]{.mark}employment creation, [[economic growth,]{.mark} or
poverty]{.underline} reduction. This is not to say that these are abject
goals, just to stress that they are not synonymous with gender equality.
Braithwaite concludes that gender equity suffers from the dominance of
efficiency and effectiveness in gender mainstreaming practices in the
structural funds. Strategical Framing and Power The studies presented
point out that \"success,\" in the sense of starting a process of gender
mainstreaming, seems to be connected to the \"stretching\" of the goal
of gender equality, to strategical framing, and they also show that the
actual goal of gender mainstreaming is not articulated clearly. In the
last section of this article, I will therefore take a closer look at
framing processes, at the politics of framing. What happens in processes
of strategical framing? Why would it be that integration rather than
transformation is the inevitable result of strategical framing
processes? Strategical framing refers to a process of linking a feminist
goal, such as gender equality, to some major goal of an organization
that should engage or is engaging in gender mainstreaming, thereby
securing the allegiance of these organizations to gender mainstreaming.
In technical terms, this means that until now strategical framing in
gender mainstreaming practices has usually involved framing bridging or
frame extension6 (Benford and Snow 2000). The strategies chosen do not
challenge the other, mainstream goals of policy makers, but provide for
a link by \"stretching\" the gender equality goal. This means that [[the
dual agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} that is mostly present in gender
mainstreaming ([[of the feminist goal and some other goal]{.underline})
[is presented as]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibility of [[a
win-win]{.mark} situation. In such conceptualizations[, power seems to
evaporate; ]{.mark}]{.underline}it is [[put between
brackets.]{.underline}]{.mark} Gender mainstreaming is presented as a
harmonious process, certainly in the Council of Europe report. The state
is also mostly conceptualized as \"friendly,\" probably connected to the
fact that Sweden and the Netherlands have been among its pioneers,
countries that to some extent have been \"friendly\" states in the past.
Yet, if gender inequality is about power and privileges, then gender
mainstreaming should be about abolishing privileges, and if gender
mainstreaming is about [eliminating gender bias in policy making, then
the state should be problematized]{.underline}. Why then is a process of
abolishing privileges and gender bias conceptualized as harmony? The
answer provided in the studies discussed earlier is that it helps in
organizing acceptance of gender mainstreaming, by making it less \[End
Page 359\] threatening. The consequence of this avoidance of struggle is
the exclusion of opposing voices, including radical feminist voices. The
[\"Beyond Armchair Feminism\" volume of Organization (2000) is one of
the few studies analyzing the bad results of such a dual agenda: the
disappearance of a gender focus altogether]{.underline}. Coleman and
Rippin (2000) conclude, after having tried such a process of harmonious
change, that [there needs to be more challenge and less agreement in
such change]{.underline} processes, even if trust is a crucial
component. The presentation of harmony, used to help smooth the process
of change, is counterproductive in the end. In Hearn\'s (2000)
reflection on the project, not only organizations are gendered (in the
Acker 1990 definition), but also models of organizational or societal
change are gendered, as well as embodying other forms of social division
and domination. Following this analysis, [[change
processes]{.underline}]{.mark} and hence gender mainstreaming processes
and activities [[should be conceptualized as]{.underline}]{.mark}
necessarily [[riddled with power]{.mark},]{.underline} subject to
mechanisms of power, and best understood in terms of power. Looking at
processes of strategical framing as connected to power relations through
a Foucauldian lens shows the logic of the dual agenda as a mix of
enabling and constraining processes. The main enabling part is the
opening generated by the bridging of frames. Yet, in this logic that
juxtaposes two sets of goals, some options are repressed. Exposing the
\"organization\" goal as not neutral, but already gendered, or
positioning the \"feminist\" goal as an organization goal in its own
right, will be difficult. As organizations tend to have a self-image of
gender neutrality, the gender bias in their existing goals will not
easily be recognized. And as [[both goals will
hardly]{.underline}]{.mark} ever [[be backed by equal power resources,
the feminist goal will be watered down]{.underline}]{.mark} much more,
or much more easily than the organization goal. [Moreover, in the
process of convincing organizations or people to start a process of
gender mainstreaming[, there will ]{.mark}]{.underline}already [[be a
tendency to select]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[\"acceptable\" feminist
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}. Also, the feminists or femocrats involved in
these efforts will necessarily have some kind of acceptance by the
(gender-biased) organization[[, leading to further]{.mark}]{.underline}
selection and [[exclusion of radical or marginalized
voices]{.underline}.]{.mark} The logic of [[the dual
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[leads first to an opening for a
feminist agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[then to a
narrowing]{.underline}]{.mark} down [[of the feminist focus
and]{.underline}]{.mark} feminist [[voices, to]{.underline}]{.mark}
eventually [[losing the focus on gender]{.mark} and gender equality
[altogether.]{.mark}]{.underline} This logic functions through
mechanisms of power. Both goals are not equally powerful, as they have
unequal support and resources within the regular organizations that are
the relevant context of gender mainstreaming. Especially when gender
mainstreaming is conceptualized in a technocratic way, less external
pressure or mobilization of feminist groups is to be expected. \[End
Page 360\] Moreover, this inequality of support and resources hinders a
clear articulation of a feminist goal, or the expression of particular
feminist goals that are seen as more radical, while such radical goals
would be needed in view of the watering-down mechanisms. [Mainstream
liberal feminism hence has an advantage, while a goal that is
articulated as a need to displace gender will meet
resistance.]{.underline} Finally, [within feminism there are hegemonic
processes as well that are not recognized and that lead to the exclusion
of certain feminist voices.]{.underline}

#### You should refuse debate's constant urge to prevent incalculable future threats and recognize the urgency of gendered violence.

Hill, 'Geography and Ethics I: Waiting and Urgency,' Progress in Human

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that [[the body
is]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly set [[at odds with larger scale
ethical concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially [[large-scale future
events of]{.underline}]{.mark} forecasted
[[suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}. Emergency planning is a particularly
good example in which the large-scale threats of future suffering can
distort moral reasoning. Žižek (2006) lightly develops this point in the
context of the war on terror, where in the presence of fictitious and
real ticking clocks and warning systems, [[the urgent body must be
bypassed because there are bigger scales to worry about: What does
this]{.mark}]{.underline} all-pervasive sense of urgency [[mean
ethically? The pressure of events is so overbearing, the stakes are so
high, that they necessitate a suspension of ordinary ethical
concerns]{.mark}. After all, displaying moral qualms when the lives of
millions are at stake plays into the hands of the enemy.]{.underline}
(Žižek, 2006)¶ [[In the presence of large-scale future emergency, the
urgency to secure the state]{.mark}, the citizenry, the economy, or the
climate [creates new scales and ]{.mark}]{.underline}new [[temporal
orders of response]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Anderson, 2010; Baldwin,
2012; Dalby, 2013; Morrissey, 2012), [many of which treat the urgent
body as impulsive and thus requiring management]{.underline}. McDonald's
(2013) analysis of three interconnected discourses of 'climate security'
illustrates how bodily urgency in climate change is also recast as a
menacing impulse that might require exclusion from moral reckoning. The
logics of climate security, especially those related to national
security, 'can encourage perverse political responses that not only fail
to respond effectively to climate change but may present victims of it
as a threat' (McDonald, 2013: 49). [**[Bodies that are currently
suffering cannot be urgent, because they are excluded from the potential
collectivity that could be suffering everywhere in some future
time]{.mark}**. Similar bypassing of existing bodily urgency is echoed
in writing about violent securitization, such as drone
warfare]{.underline} (Shaw and Akhter, 2012), [and also in intimate
scales like the street and the school, especially in relation to
race]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2009; Young et al., 2014).¶ [As large-scale
urgent concerns are institutionalized, the urgent body is increasingly
obscured through technical planning and coordination]{.underline}
(Anderson and Adey, 2012). [The predominant characteristic of this
institutionalization of large-scale emergency is a 'built-in bias for
action']{.underline} (Wuthnow, 2010: 212) [that circumvents
contingencies.]{.underline} [[The urgent body is at best an assumed
eventuality]{.mark}, one that will likely require another state of
waiting]{.underline}, such as triage (e.g. Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin
(2013) cautions that in much of the West, governmental need to provide
evidence of laissez-faire governing on the one hand, and assurance of
strength in facing a threatening future on the other, produces
'just-in-case preparedness' (Amin, 2013: 151) of neoliberal risk
management policies. In the US, 'personal ingenuity' is built into
emergency response at the expense of the poor and vulnerable for whom
'\[t\]he difference between abjection and bearable survival' (Amin,
2013: 153) will not be determined by emergency planning, but in the
material infrastructure of the city.¶ In short, [[the urgencies of the
body provide justifications for social exclusion of the most
marginalized based on impulse and perceived threat, while large-scale
future emergencies effectively absorb the deliberative power of urgency
into the institutions of preparedness and risk
avoidance.]{.underline}]{.mark} Žižek references Arendt's (2006)
analysis of the banality of evil to explain the current state of ethical
reasoning under the war on terror, noting that people who perform
morally reprehensible actions under the conditions of urgency assume a
'tragic-ethic grandeur' (Žižek, 2006) by sacrificing their own morality
for the good of the state. But his analysis fails to note that
[bodies]{.underline} are [today]{.underline} so [rarely legitimate sites
for claiming urgency.]{.underline} [In the context of the assumed
priority of the large-scale future emergency, the urgent body becomes
literally nonsense,]{.underline} a non sequitur within societies,
[states and worlds that will always be more urgent.¶]{.underline} [If
the important ethical work of urgency has been to identify that which
must not wait, then the capture of the power and persuasiveness of
urgency by large-scale future emergencies has consequences for the kinds
of normative arguments we can raise on behalf of urgent
bodies.]{.underline} How, then, might waiting compare as a normative
description and critique in our own urgent time? [Waiting]{.underline}
can be categorized according to its purpose or outcome (see Corbridge,
2004; Gray, 2011), but it also [modifies the place of the individual in
society and her importance.]{.underline} As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes,
'[[waiting ... produces hierarchies which segregate people and places
into those which matter and those which do not']{.underline}]{.mark}.
The segregation of waiting might produce effects that counteract
suffering, however, and Jeffery (2008: 957) explains that though the
'politics of waiting' can be repressive, it can also engender creative
political engagement. In his research with educated unemployed Jat youth
who spend days and years waiting for desired employment, Jeffery finds
that 'the temporal suffering and sense of ambivalence experienced by
young men can generate cultural and political experiments that, in turn,
have marked social and spatial effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though
this is not the same as claiming normative neutrality for waiting, it
does suggest that waiting is more ethically ambivalent and open than
urgency.¶ In other contexts, however, our descriptions of waiting
indicate a strong condemnation of its effects upon the subjects of
study. Waiting can demobilize radical reform, depoliticizing 'the
insurrectionary possibilities of the present by delaying the
revolutionary imperative to a future moment that is forever drifting
towards infinity' (Springer, 2014: 407). Yonucu's (2011) analysis of the
self-destructive activities of disrespected working-class youth in
Istanbul suggests that this sense of infinite waiting can lead not only
to depoliticization, but also to a disbelief in the possibility of a
future self of any value. Waiting, like urgency, can undermine the
possibility of self-care two-fold, first by making people wait for
essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting is '\[s\]omething
to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as evidence of
indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a signal to
exclude' (Bauman, 2004: 109). This is why Auyero (2012) suggests that
waiting creates an ideal state subject, providing 'temporal processes in
and through which political subordination is produced' (Auyero, 2012:
loc. 90; see also Secor, 2007). Furthermore, Auyero notes, it is not
only political subordination, but the subjective effect of waiting that
secures domination, as citizens and non-citizens find themselves
'waiting hopefully and then frustratedly for others to make decisions,
and in effect surrendering to the authority of others' (Auyero, 2012:
loc. 123).¶ Waiting can therefore function as a potentially important
spatial technology of the elite and powerful, mobilized not only for the
purpose of governing individuals, but also to retain claims over moral
urgency. But there is growing resistance to the capture of claims of
urgency by the elite, and it is important to note that even in cases
where the material conditions of containment are currently impenetrable,
arguments based on human value are at the forefront of reclaiming
urgency for the body. In detention centers, clandestine prisons, state
borders and refugee camps, geographers point to ongoing struggles
against the ethical impossibility of bodily urgency and a rejection of
states of waiting (see Conlon, 2011; Darling, 2009, 2011; Garmany, 2012;
Mountz et al., 2013; Schuster, 2011). Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of
a Delhi resettlement colony and Shewly's (2013) discussion of the
enclave between India and Bangladesh describe people who refuse to give
up their own status as legitimately urgent, even in the context of
larger scale politics. Similarly, Tyler's (2013) account of desperate
female detainees stripping off their clothes to expose their humanness
and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in the UK
suggests that demands for recognition are not just about politics, but
also about the acknowledgement of humanness and the irrevocable
possibility of being that which cannot wait. The continued existence of
places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions in the USA nonetheless
points to the challenge of exposing the urgent body as a moral priority
when it is so easily hidden from view, and also reminds us that our
research can help to explain the relationships between normative
dimensions and the political and social conditions of struggle.¶ In
closing, geographic depictions of waiting do seem to evocatively
describe otherwise obscured suffering (e.g. Bennett, 2011), but it is
striking how rarely these descriptions also use the language of urgency.
Given the discussion above, what might be accomplished -- and risked --
by incorporating urgency more overtly and deliberately into our
discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned bodies? Urgency can
clarify the implicit but understated ethical consequences and
normativity associated with waiting, and encourage explicit discussion
about harmful suffering. Waiting can be productive or unproductive for
radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires response. Geographers
could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical work of urgency in ways
that leave it open for critique, clarifying common spatial
misunderstandings and representations. There is good reason to be
thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards inhumanity can
itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human, dividing up
'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those whose lives
and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives at all'
(Butler, 2009: 50). But when [the urgent body is rendered as only
waiting, both materially and discursively, it is just as easily cast as
impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline} (see also McKittrick,
2006). [[Feminist theory insists that the urgent
body,]{.underline}]{.mark} whose [[encounters of violence]{.mark} are
'usually framed as private, apolitical and mundane']{.underline} (Pain,
2014: 8), [[are as deeply political, public, and exceptional as other
forms of violence]{.underline}]{.mark} (Phillips, 2008; Pratt, 2005).
Insisting that a suffering body, now, is that which cannot wait, has the
ethical effect of drawing it into consideration alongside the political,
public and exceptional scope of large-scale futures. It may help us
insist on the body, both as a single unit and a plurality, as a
legitimate scale of normative priority and social care.¶ In this report,
I have explored old and new reflections on the ethical work of urgency
and waiting. Geographic research suggests a contemporary popular bias
towards the urgency of large-scale futures, institutionalized in ways
that further obscure and discredit the urgencies of the body. This bias
also justifies the production of new waiting places in our material
landscape, places like the detention center and the waiting room. In
some cases, waiting is normatively neutral, even providing opportunities
for alternative politics. In others, the technologies of waiting serve
to manage potentially problematic bodies, leading to suspended suffering
and even to extermination (e.g. Wright, 2013). One of my aims has been
to suggest that moral reasoning is important both because it exposes
normative biases against subjugated people, and because it potentially
provides routes toward struggle where claims to urgency seem to
foreclose the possibilities of alleviation of suffering. [Saving the
world still should require a debate about whose world is being saved,
when, and at what cost -- and this requires a debate about what really
cannot wait]{.underline}. My next report will extend some of these
concerns by reviewing how feelings of urgency, as well as hope, fear,
and other emotions, have played a role in geography and ethical
reasoning.¶ I conclude, however, by pulling together past and present.
In 1972, Gilbert White asked why geographers were not engaging 'the
truly urgent questions' (1972: 101) such as racial repression, decaying
cities, economic inequality, and global environmental destruction. His
question highlights just how much the discipline has changed, but it is
also unnerving in its echoes of our contemporary problems. Since White's
writing, our moral reasoning has been stretched to consider the future
body and the more-than-human, alongside the presently urgent body --
topics and concerns that I have not taken up in this review but which
will provide their own new possibilities for urgent concerns. My own
hope presently is drawn from an acknowledgement that the temporal
characteristics of contemporary capitalism can be interrupted in
creative ways (Sharma, 2014), with the possibility of squaring the
urgent body with our large-scale future concerns. Temporal alternatives
already exist in ongoing and emerging revolutions and the disruption of
claims of cycles and circular political processes (e.g. Lombard, 2013;
Reyes, 2012). Though calls for urgency will certainly be used to obscure
evasion of responsibility (e.g. Gilmore, 2008: 56, fn 6), they may also
serve as fertile ground for radical critique, a truly fierce urgency for
now[.]{.underline}

#### The drive to prevent extinction is a form of [masculine survivalism]{.underline} where gendered bodies become the unwilling tools to sustain humanity. You should refuse the obsession with patriarchal reproduction.

**[The reproduction of survival/ the survival of
reproduction]{.underline}**

[Extinction is almost always understood against the horizon of survival
and the imperative to sustain it -- at least for life forms deemed to be
of value to humans.]{.underline} In many cases, this imperative takes
the form of deliberate strategies for enforcing existence. Donna
Haraway's influential book When Species Meet devotes considerable
attention to the logics, practices and politics of Species Survival
Plans. These plans monitor and enforce reproduction amongst 'endangered'
species, not least by collecting data on populations, genetic profiles
and genetic materials to enable selective breeding. [This strategy
assumes that all organisms can, should, and can be made to exercise
their reproductive capacities in order to resist extinction, and it
actively mobilizes members of 'endangered species']{.underline} into
this project. In so doing, **[it helps to entrench norms regarding
gender, sexuality and reproductive labour]{.underline}** that are deeply
entrenched in modern, Western human cultures. Attention to these
programmes **[highlights an important way in which extinction is
gendered in dominant scientific and policy frameworks]{.underline}**.
Specifically, [strategic breeding programmes share in the belief that
reproduction is an imperative for those capable of reproducing if 'the
species' is at risk']{.underline}. **[This belief is directly related to
Western norms of the reproductive imperative for women]{.underline}**.
Indeed, Haraway points out that it [is precisely "'woman's' putative
self-defining responsibility to 'the species' as this singular and
typological female is reduced to her reproductive
function]{.underline}". In a similar sense, within SSPs and other
strategies of enforced survival, entire life forms are reduced to their
reproductive capacities. Moreover, programmes of enforced survival can,
in the context of sexual reproduction, disproportionately burden female
organisms with the task of avoiding extinction. [This logic is
particularly fraught in discussions of the possibility of human
extinction, in which female fertility (captured in the standard policy
language of 'births per woman') is framed simultaneously as a threat to
survival, and the only hope for escaping extinction (]{.underline}see,
for instance, Alan Weisman's comments on this). In these ways, **[the
securitization of survival entrenches the intersectional categories of
gender, species and race]{.underline}** discussed above. [Dominant
discourses of extinction and conservation also entrench and privilege
sexual reproduction, in ways that entrench heteronormative assumptions
and norms]{.underline}. This is reflected in the way that the subjects
of extinction and conservation are framed. The standard object of
conservation is the biological 'species', a term which is defined by the
ability of organisms to reproduce sexually. As Myra Hird has pointed
out, this conception of 'species' makes it appear as if sexual
reproduction is the 'best' means of sustaining the existence of a life
form. However, Hird's work demonstrates that Earthly life forms actually
engage in myriad forms of reproduction, from the free exchange of DNA
between bacteria to the hermaphroditic practices of some fish. The
upshot of these arguments is that Earthly life is sustained through a
huge variety of reproductive activities that do not conform to
biological understandings of life processes or species. Crucially, Hird
argues that there is no necessary hierarchy between forms of
reproduction. In Darwinian terms, all species that manage to survive are
equally successful. However, [by conflating survival with sexual
reproduction**, existing discourses of extinction embed hetero-normative
frameworks that devalue other forms of reproduction**. They also reduce
reproduction to the imperative to survive, ignoring the myriad cultural,
political, aesthetic, sensual and other dimensions of
reproduction.]{.underline}

#### The panic over potential threats to the nation is a form of [masculine futurity]{.underline} which allows reproductive bodies to be regulated. Claims of utilitarianism justify the endless sacrifice of reproductive freedom in the name of the "greatest good."

Cultural theorist Ruth McElroy suggests, "Women's belonging to nations
is indissoluble from their reproductive biology" (325). For all that
motherhood may be conceived as a private choice occurring in the
supposedly private sphere, reproduction and motherhood are nonetheless
public and political as well, and thoroughly entangled with women's
status as members of their nation. By virtue of their reproduction (or
even lack thereof!), women can be constructed in cultural narratives and
political scripts as contributors to society or threats to the national
good, caretakers of the future who merit protection and support or
wayward parents who must be disciplined back into the national fold,
national maternal ideals or outsiders within. The state's identification
of and response to women as reproducers reflects the continuous
processes of the politics of belonging, which "involve not only the
maintenance and reproduction of the boundaries of the community of
belonging by the hegemonic political powers\...but also by their
contestation, challenge and resistance by other political agents"
(Yuval-Davis 20). [We see these politics of belonging manifested not
only discursively, but also in the policies and laws that protect or
privilege some mothers and not others, some children, but not
all.]{.underline} When anthropologists Faye Ginsburg and Rayna Rapp ask,
"who defines the body of the nation into which the next generation is
recruited? Who is considered to be in that national body, who is out of
it?" (3), therefore, there is no one answer; rather, this is the
question perpetually being asked and answered by political discourse and
practice infused with the logic of futurity. [[The hopes and fears of
the present]{.mark}]{.underline} political moment [[and the imaginative
desires for the future are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[continually
projected upon the bodies of women and their procreative
capacities]{.underline}. [Futurity]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} I
suggest in this project, as a possibly inevitable perspective or
worldview[, [allows]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[the state to focus on
women as reproductive beings in a way that it does not for
men]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following from Foucault's explication of
biopower, the modern state takes an interest in the workings and
ostensible health of its populations, creating new knowledges and
indices for the normal as it counts up the characteristics of its
citizenry and sets goals for demographic management. While Foucault
tends not to focus on the reproductive elements of the state's
biopolitical interest---for instance, the setting of ideal rates of
fertility, health expectations for women and children, creation of
access to the medical, economic, and social resources needed for
reproduction---these are, I would argue, operations of the state that
have potential for tremendous impacts upon women particularly. The other
biopolitical interests of the state---appropriate number of workers,
manageable immigration rates, proper ratio of elderly to young, and so
on---are also all implicated in the procreative behaviors of women,
which would seem to intensify the state's interest in them. Brought into
the broader framework of women's political status and national
belonging, [reproduction in this context seems poised to function as an
axis upon which the dispensation of women's citizenship can pivot, with
particular regard to her racial, economic, and social demographic and
the state's assessment of her (and her children's) value to the national
future]{.underline}. Penelope Deutscher suggests that through the
emergence of biopower: Women would later assume a status as a
reproductive threshold of the future and health of nations, populations
and peoples. But [[the condition for this role for women and maternal
reproductivity was the very possibility of reproduction being associated
with]{.mark} a shifting field of possible substances, telos, outcomes
and obligations:]{.underline} **[[the overall good, the general
happiness, the future]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the nation, the
**[[health of the nation, the competitiveness of the nation,]{.mark} the
future of the people, individual flourishing or freedom, individual
rights,]{.underline}** domestic happiness, the family unit as building
block of the nation, the transmission of the bloodline, the family name,
transmission of property or family or genealogical transmission,
[reproduction of the labour force]{.underline}, etc. [That reproduction
be plausibly thought of in such terms at all was a precondition of it
becoming associated with women's role as threshold of futurity.
(]{.underline}Deutscher 129) **[[The state's biopolitical management of
women's reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}** may thus **[[allow it to
approach women primarily as reproductive beings, an
essentalist]{.mark}]{.underline}** or even **[[utilitarian collapse
that]{.mark}]{.underline}** may **[[make it easier to intervene upon
their bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}** and perhaps **[[reflects a deeply
ingrained discomfort with the notion that women have tremendous
potential power to impact the composition of the
future]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this project, I am proposing [[a
framework of futurity that]{.mark} is in operation, characterized by
discursive and eugenic aspects, that [uses women as the vehicle for
future world-building and nation-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
futurity [[aims to enact]{.mark}]{.underline} particular [[visions of
the future via changes in the present]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly
[[through the management of women's reproduction in the
present]{.underline}]{.mark} such that the future population comports
with present desires. [When this futurity framework is picked up by the
state in its various capacities,]{.underline} I suggest [there are
significant consequences for women's citizenship as women because they
are so intrinsically linked in the cultural and political imaginary with
reproduction.]{.underline} In the process of grappling with these
concepts, this project asks how the logic of futurity functions to
organize the terms of women's social or political belonging in
reproductive terms. How does the state pick up and extend this logic to
women, and how might that impact the meaningfulness of women's
citizenship or national belonging? Does the logic of futurity, the
constant pressure of the forward vision combined with the imaginative
limitations of the present, insist upon women's citizenship being or
becoming something fundamentally different from men's by virtue of
reproductive capacity and association? Exploring these questions brings
this project into several disciplinary contexts, including feminist
theory and philosophy, political theory, disability theory (eugenics),
and even the sphere of economics. In connecting these concepts to
ongoing conversations about women and citizenship in the contemporary
United States, this project is ultimately working to tie together
disparate fields and illuminate how they interact with respect to a
model of futurity that I theorize as containing discursive and eugenic
aspects. It may be that state-based discourses and practices related to
women's reproduction and citizenship are not so much causes as they are
effects of the logic of futurity.

[Because risk assessment is based on statistical measures of risk,
policymakers view it as an accurate and objective tool in establishing
environmental standards]{.underline}. n275 The scientific process used
to assess risk purports to focus single-mindedly on only one feature of
a potential injury: the objective probability of its occurrence. n276
Risk assessors, who consider most value judgments irrelevant in
determining statistical risk, seek to banish them at every stage. n277
As a result, [the [language of risk assessment]{.mark} \--]{.underline}
and of related environmental safety standards \-- often carry an air of
irrebuttable precision and certainty. The EPA, for example, defines the
standard acceptable level of risk under Superfund as \"10\<-6\>\" \--
that is, the probability that one person in a million would develop
cancer due to exposure to site contamination. n278 \[\*76\] Feminism
challenges this model of scientific risk assessment on at least three
levels. First, feminism questions the assumption that scientific inquiry
is value-neutral, that is, free of societal bias or prejudice. n279
Indeed, as many have pointed out, one\'s perspective unavoidably
influences the practice of science. n280 Western science may be infused
with its own ideology, perpetuating, in the view of the ecofeminists,
cycles of discrimination, domination, and exploitation. n281 Second,
even if scientific inquiry by itself were value-neutral, environmental
regulation based on such inquiry would still contain subjective
elements. Environmental regulation, like any other product of democracy,
inevitably reflects elements of subjectivity, compromise, and
self-interest. The technocratic language of regulation [[serves]{.mark}
only [to \"mask]{.mark}, not eliminate, political and [social
considerations]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" n282 We have already seen how
[the subjective decision to prefer white men as subjects for
epidemiological study can skew risk assessments against the interests of
women and people of color]{.underline}. [The focus]{.underline} of many
assessments [on]{.underline} the risk of [cancer deaths, but not, say,
the risks of birth defects]{.underline} or miscarriages, [is yet another
example of how a policymaker\'s subjective decision of what to look for
can influence what is ultimately seen]{.underline}. n283 Once risk data
are collected and placed in a statistical form, the ultimate translation
of that information into rules and standards of conduct once again
reflects value judgments. A safety threshold of one in a million or a
preference for \"best conventional technology\" does not spring from the
periodic table, but rather evolves from the application \[\*77\] of
human experience and judgment to scientific information. [Whose
experience? Whose judgment? Which information?]{.underline} These are
the questions that feminism prompts, and they will be discussed shortly.
Finally, feminists would argue that [[questions involving]{.mark} the
[risk of death]{.mark} and disease [should not]{.mark} even [aspire to
value neutrality.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Such decisions \-- which affect
not only today\'s generations, but those of the future \-- should be
made with all related political and moral considerations plainly on the
table]{.underline}. n284 In addition, [[policymakers should look
to]{.mark} all perspectives, especially those of [society\'s most
vulnerable]{.mark} members, to develop as complete a picture of the
moral issues as possible]{.underline}. Debates about scientific risk
assessment and public values often appear as a tug of war between the
\"technicians,\" who would apply only value-neutral criteria to set
regulatory standards, and the \"public,\" who demand that psychological
perceptions and contextual factors also be considered. n285
Environmental justice advocates, strongly concerned with the practical
experiences of threatened communities, argue convincingly for the latter
position. n286 A feminist critique of the issue, however, suggests that
the debate is much richer and more complicated than a bipolar view
allows. For feminists, the notion of value neutrality simply does not
exist. The debate between technicians and the public, according to
feminists, is not merely a contest between science and feelings, but a
broader discussion about the sets of methods, values, and attitudes to
which each group subscribes. Furthermore, feminists might argue, the
parties to this discussion divide into more than two categories. Because
one\'s world view is premised on many things, including personal
experience, one might expect that subgroups within either category might
differ in significant ways from other subgroups. Therefore, feminists
would anticipate a broad spectrum of views concerning scientific risk
assessment and public values. Intuitively, this makes sense. Certainly
scientists disagree among themselves about the hazards of nuclear waste,
ozone depletion, and global warming. n287 Many critics have argued that
scientists, despite their allegiance \[\*78\] to rational method, are
nonetheless influenced by personal and political views. n288 Similarly,
members of the public are a widely divergent group. One would not be
surprised to see politicians, land developers, and blue-collar workers
disagreeing about environmental standards for essentially non-scientific
reasons. [Politicians]{.underline} and bureaucrats are two sets of the
non-scientific community that affect environmental standards in
fundamental ways. Their [adherence to vocal]{.underline}, though not
always broadly representative, [constituencies may lead them to disfavor
less advantaged socioeconomic groups when addressing environmental
concerns]{.underline}. n289 In order to understand a diversity of risk
perception and to see how attitudes and social status affect the risk
assessment process, we must return to the feminist inquiry that explores
the relationship between attitudes and identity. 1. The Diversity of
Risk Perception [[A]{.mark} recent [national
survey]{.mark}]{.underline}, conducted by James Flynn, Paul Slovic, and
C.K. Mertz, [[measured]{.mark} the [risk perceptions]{.mark} of a
group]{.underline} of 1512 people that included numbers of men, women,
whites, and non-whites proportional to their ratios in society. n290
Respondents answered questions about [the health risks of twenty-five
environmental,]{.underline} technological, and \"life-style\"
[hazards]{.underline}, including such hazards as ozone depletion,
chemical waste, and cigarette smoking. n291 The researchers asked them
to rate each hazard as posing \"almost no health risk,\" a \"slight
health risk,\" a \"moderate health risk,\" or a \"high health risk.\"
The researchers then analyzed \[\*79\] the responses to determine
whether the randomly selected groups of white men, white women,
non-white men, and non-white women differed in any way. The researchers
found that [perceptions of risk generally differed on the lines of
gender and race.]{.underline} Women, for instance, perceived greater
risk from most hazards than did men. n292 Furthermore, non-whites as a
group perceived greater risk from most hazards than did whites. n293 Yet
[the most striking results appeared when the researchers considered
differences in gender and race together.]{.underline} They found that
\"[white males]{.underline} tended to differ from everyone else in their
attitudes and perceptions \-- on average, they [perceived risks as much
smaller and much more acceptable than did other people]{.underline}.\"
n294 Indeed, [without exception]{.underline}, the pool of white men
perceived each of the twenty-five hazards as less risky than did
non-white men, white women, or non-white women. n295 Wary that other
factors associated with gender or race could be influencing their
findings, [the [researchers]{.mark} later [conducted]{.mark} several
multiple [regression analyses]{.mark} to correct for
differences]{.underline} in income, education, political orientation,
the presence of children in the home, and age, among others. Yet [[even
after]{.mark} all [corrections,]{.mark} \"gender, race, and [\'white
male\' \[status\] remained]{.mark} highly [significant]{.mark}
predictors\" of perceptions of risk]{.underline}. n296 2. Explaining the
Diversity From a feminist perspective, these findings are important
because they suggest that [risk assessors, [politicians]{.mark}, and
bureaucrats \-- the large [majority of whom are white
men]{.mark}]{.underline} n297 \-- [may be acting on attitudes about
security and risk that women and people of color do not widely
share.]{.underline} If this is so, [white men, as the \"measurers of all
things,\" have [crafted a system of]{.mark} environmental
[protection]{.mark} that is [biased toward their]{.mark} subjective
[understandings]{.mark} of the world.]{.underline} n298 \[\*80\] Flynn,
Slovic, and Mertz speculate that white men\'s perceptions of risk may
differ from those of others because in many ways [women and [people of
color]{.mark} are \"more vulnerable, because]{.underline} they benefit
less from many of \[society\'s\] technologies and institutions, and
because [they [have less]{.mark} power and
[control]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" n299 Although Flynn, Slovic, and Mertz
are careful to acknowledge that they have not yet tested this hypothesis
empirically, their explanation appears consistent with the life
experiences of less empowered groups and comports with previous
understandings about the roles of control and risk perception. n300
Women and people of color, for instance, are more vulnerable to
environmental threat in several ways. Such groups are sometimes more
biologically vulnerable than are white men. n301 People of color are
more likely to live near hazardous waste sites, to breathe dirty air in
urban communities, and to be otherwise exposed to environmental harm.
n302 Women, because of their traditional role as primary caretakers, are
more likely to be aware of the vulnerabilities of their children. n303
It makes sense that such vulnerabilities would give rise to increased
fear about risk. It is also very likely that women and people of color
believe they benefit less from the technical institutions that create
toxic byproducts. n304 Further, people may be more likely to discount
risk if they feel somehow compensated for the activity. n305 For this
reason, Americans worry relatively little about driving automobiles, an
activity with enormous advantages in our large country but one that
claims tens of thousands of lives per year. The researchers\' final
hypothesis \-- that differences in perception can be explained by the
lack of \"power and control\" exercised by women and people of color \--
suggests the importance that such factors as voluntariness and control
over risk play in shaping perceptions. \[\*81\] Risk perception research
frequently emphasizes the significance of voluntariness in evaluating
risk. Thus, a person may view water-skiing as less risky than breathing
polluted air because the former is accepted voluntarily. n306 Voluntary
risks are viewed as more acceptable in part because they are products of
autonomous choice. n307 A risk accepted voluntarily is also one from
which a person is more likely to derive an individual benefit and one
over which a person is more likely to retain some kind of control. n308
Some studies have found that people prefer voluntary risks to
involuntary risks by a factor of 1000 to 1. n309 Although environmental
risks are generally viewed as involuntary risks to a certain degree,
choice plays a role in assuming risks. White men are still more likely
to exercise some degree of choice in assuming environmental risks than
other groups. Communities of color face greater difficulty in avoiding
the placement of hazardous facilities in their neighborhoods and are
more likely to live in areas with polluted air and lead contamination.
n310 Families of color wishing to buy their way out of such polluted
neighborhoods often find their mobility limited by housing
discrimination, redlining by banks, and residential segregation. n311
The workplace similarly presents workers exposed to toxic hazards (a
disproportionate number of whom are minorities) n312 with impossible
choices between health and work, or between sterilization and demotion.
n313 Just as marginalized groups have less choice in determining the
degree of risk they will assume, they may feel less control over the
risks they face. \"Whether or not the risk is assumed voluntarily,
people have greater \[\*82\] fear of activities with risks that appear
to be outside their individual control.\" n314 For this reason, people
often fear flying in an airplane more than driving a car, even though
flying is statistically safer. n315 [If [white men are more complacent
about public risks]{.mark}, it is perhaps [because they]{.mark} are more
likely to have their hands on the steering wheel]{.underline} when such
risks are imposed. [White men still [contro]{.mark}l the major political
and business [institutions]{.mark} in this country]{.underline}. n316
[They also [dominat]{.mark}e the [sciences]{.mark}]{.underline} n317 and
make up the vast majority of management staff at environmental agencies.
n318 Women and people of color see this disparity and often lament their
back-seat role in shaping environmental policy. n319 Thus, many people
of color in the environmental justice movement believe that
environmental laws work to their disadvantage by design. n320 \[\*83\]
The toxic rivers of Mississippi\'s \"Cancer Alley,\" n321 the extensive
poisoning of rural Indian land, n322 and the mismanaged cleanup of the
weapons manufacturing site in Hanford, Washington n323 only promote the
feeling that environmental policy in the United States sacrifices the
weak for the benefit of the strong. In addition, the catastrophic
potential that groups other than white men associate with a risk may
explain the perception gap between those groups and white males. Studies
of risk perception show that, in general, [[individuals harbor]{.mark}
particularly great [fears of catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}. n324 [For
this reason, earthquakes, terrorist bombings, and other disasters in
which high concentrations of people are killed or injured prove
particularly disturbing]{.underline} to the lay public.
[[Local]{.underline}]{.mark} environmental
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} involving toxic dumps, aging smelters, or
poisoned wells also [[produce high concentrations of localized harm
that]{.mark} can [appear catastrophic to those
involved]{.mark}]{.underline}. n325 Some commentators contend that [the
catastrophic potential of a risk should influence risk assessment in
only minimal ways.]{.underline} n326 [Considering public fear of
[catastrophes]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue, [will [irrationally lead
policymakers to battle]{.mark} more [dramatic but statistically less
threatening hazards, while accepting more harmful but]{.mark} more
[mundane hazards]{.mark}]{.underline}. n327 \[\*84\] At least [two
reasons explain why the catastrophic potential of environmental hazards
must be given weight in risk assessment]{.underline}. First,
[concentrated and [localized]{.mark} environmental [hazards]{.mark} do
not simply harm individuals, they [erode]{.mark} family ties and
[community]{.mark} relationships]{.underline}. [An onslaught of
miscarriages or birth defects in a neighborhood,]{.underline} for
instance, [will create community-wide stress that will debilitate the
neighborhood in emotional, sociological, and economic ways]{.underline}.
n328 [[To ignore]{.mark} this [communal harm is to underestimate]{.mark}
severely the [true risk involved]{.mark}]{.underline}. n329
[[Second,]{.underline} [because]{.underline}]{.mark} [concentrated and
[localized]{.mark} environmental [hazards tend to be unevenly
distributed on the basis of race and income]{.mark} level]{.underline},
[any resulting mass [injury]{.mark} to a threatened population [takes on
profound moral character]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this reason, Native
Americans often characterize the military\'s poisoning of Indian land as
genocide. n330 \[\*85\] 3. Understanding Through Diversity [Flynn,
Slovic, and Mertz challenge the traditional, static view of statistical
risk with a richer, more vibrant image involving relationships of power,
status, and trust]{.underline}. n331 \"In short, [\'[risk]{.mark}iness\'
[means more]{.mark} to people [than \'expected]{.mark} number of
[fatalities]{.mark}]{.underline}.\'\" n332 These findings affirm the
feminist claim that [public policy must consider both logic and local
experience in addressing a problem]{.underline}**.** n333 Current
attempts to \"re-educate\" fearful communities with only risk
assessments and scientific seminars are, therefore, destined to fail.
n334 By the same token, [even dual approaches that combine science and
experience will fall short if the appeal to experience does not track
local priorities and values]{.underline}. Cynthia Hamilton illustrates
these points in her inspiring account of how a South Central Los Angeles
community group, consisting mainly of working-class women, battled a
proposed solid waste incinerator. n335 At one point, the state sent out
consultants and environmental experts to put the community\'s fears into
perspective. The consultants first appealed to the community\'s
practical, experience-based side, by explaining how the new incinerator
would bring needed employment to the area and by offering \$ 2 million
in community development. n336 But the community group found the promise
of \"real development\" unrealistic and the cash gift insulting. n337
When experts then turned to quantifying the risks \"scientifically\"
their attempts backfired again. Hamilton reports that \"expert assurance
that health risks associated with dioxin exposure were less than those
associated with \'eating peanut butter\' unleashed a flurry of dissent.
All of the women, young and old, working-class and professional, had
made peanut butter sandwiches for years.\" n338 The sandwich analogy,
even assuming its statistical validity, could not convince the women
because it did not consider other valid risk factors (voluntariness,
dread, and so on) and because it did not appear plausible in the group
members\' experience. In the end, Hamilton explains that the superficial
explanations and sarcastic responses of the male \"experts\" left the
women even more united and convinced that \"working-class women\'s
\[\*86\] concerns cannot be dismissed.\" n339 Thus even [the \"science\"
of risk assessment, if it is to serve]{.underline} effectively, [must
include the voices of those typically excluded from its
practice]{.underline}.

#### The aff is an act of [feminist foreign policy]{.underline} that reshapes how nations operate through an ethics of care. Rather than adopt traditional methods of decision-making, you should employ empathetic understandings of human security. 

**Aggestam et al 18**

**(Karin Aggestam, Annika Bergman Rosamond and Annica Kronsell, Lund
University, Theorising feminist foreign policy, International Relations
2019, Vol. 33(1) 23--39, JKS)**

While feminist IR theory remains alert to and critical of the structural
underpinnings of world politics, the ontological relationality of [the
ethics of care provides a key contribution because it takes stock of the
experiences of the people at the receiving end of feminist foreign
policy. In contrast with orthodox foreign policy practice and theory,
which tends to disregard the lived histories of women and colonial
subjects, an ethics of care approach would actively seek to uncover
their stories to enable intersectional and situated analyses of foreign
policy.]{.underline} [This involves investigating whether states and
other actors actually employ care and empathy as a normative ideal in
their pursuit of foreign, security, defence and development
policies]{.underline}. **[States tend to vary in their commitment to
such dialogue, but this does not mean that a global ethics of care
should be dismissed in the context of foreign and security policy
analysis]{.underline}**. Instead a critical analysis of [feminist-
oriented foreign policy should seek to address the ethical question how
our view of security in global politics would change o]{.underline}nce
we recognize and accept \... the ways responsibilities and practices of
care grow out of relations of dependence and vulnerability of people in
the context of complex webs of relations of responsibility.63 [This
entails exploring to what extent the makers of feminist foreign policy
take note of 'the everyday' a]{.underline}nd whether Robison's notion of
'a feminist ethics of security' which centres on 'marginalised sites'
has some resonance with actual policy-making.64 [Ethics of care as
foreign policy conduct is often expressed in notions of gender-just
protection of such marginalised groups, in particular, the protection of
women and children from gendered violence and
discrimination.]{.underline} Here ethics of care scholar Joan Tronto
highlights the shift in global relations from what previously was a
'right to intervene' and sovereign-based logic to 'the responsibility to
protect' and an ethics of global care.65 We propose here that
protection, though at times requiring military means, should always rest
on the act of listening to marginalised voices -- a diplomatic tool that
is key to the successful conduct of feminist foreign policy. [A foreign
policy, which builds on the ethics of care as its foundation, rests on
the idea of inclusive and ethical dialogues as well as acts of listening
across borders and intersectional confines]{.underline}. Virginia Held
holds that [emotions, such as empathy, sensitivity and responsiveness,
are sentiments that need to be cultivated as a significant element when
**making moral decisions**.6]{.underline}6 [Central to the analysis of
feminist foreign policy then is the extent to which care, the act of
listening and dialogical engagement **really are key norms in the
implementation of gender-just external relations**?]{.underline} Here we
find Christine Sylvester's67 concept of empathetic cooperation
particularly useful and closely associ- ated with the ethics of care.68
[Empathetic cooperation challenges sovereign rights and national
interests as the sole platforms for international interactions in favour
of empathy across intersectional and ethical boundaries]{.underline}.
Laura Sjoberg also suggests that [emphatic cooperation is a fruitful
platform for the development of a feminist international security ethic,
which pays attention to care and justice as well as the gendered
structures that have led to the marginalisation of vulnerable
groups]{.underline} across international society.69 It may also lead to
'a form of knowledge of other persons that draws explicitly on the
commonalty of feelings and experiences to enrich one's understanding of
another in his or her own right'.70 If empathy is an expressed
willingness and ability to appreciate the other then empathetic
cooperation is 'a process of positional slippage that occurs when one
listens seriously to the concerns, fears and agendas of those one is
unaccustomed to hearing'.71 In short, we argue that [empathetic
cooperation,]{.underline} as part of the making of a feminist for- eign
policy, [may be a way of opening up for a global ethic and concrete
expressions of politics, which do not privilege statist interests and
notions of security]{.underline}. Moreover, [it moves the agenda towards
human security while respecting cultural difference.]{.underline}72
Thus, to explore the presence of empathetic cooperation in the conduct
of feminist and gender- based foreign policy is key to the analysis of
feminist foreign policy and to ethical inves- tigations into ethically
minded foreign policy more broadly.

### 2AC -- LAWS = Hegemonic Masculinity

#### Autonomous weapons reaffirm the idea that men are more desirable than women -- they represent masculinity in its most ideal form

Finally, we could frame a cyborg narrative to theorize about long-term
gender effects as a result of the introduction of the Human Universal
Load Carriage (or HULC), a type of prosthetic armor in development for
use by able-bodied soldiers (Chavez 2011). Thompson describes the
exoskeleton as 'a robotic device the soldier wears like a full body
suit. It would enhance Soldier performance, increasing strength without
losing agility' (Hames 2008). Both implants and the exoskeleton thus
create a situation where technology is not merely something used by the
warrior, but rather part of who he or she is. The cyborg narrative
suggests that an exoskeleton could level the playing field through
increasing the ability of women warriors to lift heavy loads through
augmenting their upper body strength. In an article on the official
Army.mil website, a developer notes that 'this is absolutely focused on
the American Warfighter and all of the jobs he or she will have to do'
(emphasis added)7. A woman interviewed in the same article notes as well
that 'this will magnify human strength while on the battlefield' (Chavez
2011). [Harnessing of robotic technology thus holds the promise that
women soldiers may more successfully enter combat, since physical
requirements are replaced by requirements for mental acuity and
reflexes. Indeed, increased use of new technologies of this type might
affect the gender makeup of the military in the long term as many
different types of people might be drawn to the military as a career,
including more women.]{.underline} In addition, [many new autonomous
technologies are focused on the areas of tracking and communications,
again invoking the language of the cyborg]{.underline}, as planners
explain how in the future the military unit will be linked together
through two-way blue force tracking capabilities which provide GPS
coordinates for individual soldiers to be shared among a unit, thus
providing info on where the friendly unit is located and who the
friendly unit is, as well as info on status and intent (Sweeney 2008).
Using these technologies, [each member can be aware of the physical
position, physical health and intent of all members of the
unit]{.underline}. In this way, the unit could in the future behave more
like a hive or a swarm (or the Borg of the Star Trek canon). [Leadership
would thus rest not on a traditional, hierarchical unit but rather on a
network in which members interact not only with the leadership but also
laterally with each other. Such a development could go far towards
destabilizing traditional hierarchical leadership forms in the military,
which are often coded as male instead of creating a more cooperative
mode of war fighting]{.underline}. Once again, these technologies might
thus represent a step towards the [destabilization of the traditional
gendered regime of women\'s jobs and men\'s jobs. While new developments
thus appear to give feminists much reason for optimism, in reality a new
narrative has arisen which describes how robotic technologies will
create not a cyborg but a 'super soldier'.]{.underline} In this
narrative, the [human operator is not seen]{.underline} or described [as
dependent upon or merged with technolog]{.underline}y. Rather
[he]{.underline} (or she) [is seen as controlling the
technology]{.underline}, subduing it in the ways in which man has
traditionally utilized and subdued nature and thus, in [this way
reinforcing a binary distinction between that which dominates and that
which is dominated]{.underline} (Kaplan 1994). This narrative appears in
[guidelines developed by military planners and passed to organizations
of defense contractors who create new technologies]{.underline}.
Designers are encouraged to expropriate features of the animal kingdom
in [creating weaponized bugs and animals]{.underline}, thus [replicating
the way in which scientists previously expropriated women\'s bodies
through taking technological control of the reproductive
process]{.underline} (Wajcman 1991). [Designers expropriate nature to
create new weapo]{.underline}ns, or they harvest and harness features
from the animal kingdom to create a new type of supersoldier or
superwarrior; one with better eyesight, better hearing and other
technologically enhanced features as he either wears the technology or
has it surgically implanted in his own body. Both developers and those
who hire them often refer to Darwin, suggesting both that the new
soldier represents a higher stage of evolution, as well as the fact that
(in Hobbesian or Realist terms) survival of the fittest is still the
rule when it comes to warfare. [Robotic technology, thus, becomes an
adjunct of the warfighter, who is coded as male and, instead of
eliminating gender differences, technological advances create a new
soldier who is a **more virile and a more deadly male**.]{.underline} In
this narrative, technology does not protect the soldier but instead
enhances the soldier. The new 'super soldier' is described in the 2009
report Future Soldier 2030 Initiative (US Army Natick Soldier RD and E
Center 2009). In addition, when a drone or robot acts to protect a
warfighter or carries out an act of combat, the narrative is often
adjusted to suggest that the activities which occur are not the
achievement of the robot, but are instead achievements of the (usually
male) designers of the technology. Thus, Major Ray Maher, Assistant
Product Manager for the Air Warrior Product Office, notes that 'the
formula is soldiers helping soldiers helping soldiers' -- referring to
the way that soldiers act as weapons testers assisting engineers who
create technology for defending soldiers (Siniard 2011). In this way,
soldiers are seen not as being aided by technology, but rather by
engineers. In both of these situations, the US military\'s reading of
the ways in which technology enhances gender contradicts Haraway\'s
narrative. **[Reliance on new technologies becomes not a weakening or a
form of dependence but rather the ultimate male
enhancement]{.underline}**. Here, we can consider the naming of the
exoskeleton as the 'HULC' and the intertextual reference to the
masculine comic book hero The Incredible Hulk who represents a sort of
supermale. [New technologies are thus described as creating a 'super
soldier' who is more male, more lethal and more dominant than previous
human alone soldier, thus reinforcing what Peterson (2010: 26) calls the
**valorization of hypermasculinity**.]{.underline} In addition,
Haraway\'s cyborg narrative rests on the assumption that robotics will
be available to all individuals or all soldiers and, thus, a blurring of
the lines between human and machine, female and male as well as disabled
and able will occur. However, strict, hierarchical access regimes for
new body-enhancing technologies currently exist. Within the Marine
Corps, Blue Force Tracking systems are only available to Special
Operations Forces and Other Government Agency (OGA) personnel, as are
Personnel Recovery (PR) BFT systems. And within the Army, Blue Force
Tracking Technology is available only to combat units (Schwerin 2011)
from which women are still excluded. Thus, [women have been
systematically excluded from using these two technologies,]{.underline}
just as Berg and Lie suggest that women have been denied access to other
technological capabilities and equipment in the past (Berg and Lie 1995:
340). In this way, new body-enhancing and communications technologies
access regimes [threaten to create a new type of digital divide -- not
between the poor and the wealthy based on who can afford technology, but
between male and female, **as technology is presented as being created
for men to enjoy and use and often in ways that demean
women.**]{.underline}8 Thus, rather than flattening gender differences
through the use of new technology, instead a new hierarchy will emerge
between enhanced and non-enhanced soldiers. Indeed, one can imagine a
new hierarchy in which 'supermales' -- with superior hearing, eyesight
(including the ability to see in the dark), the ability to heal
themselves when injured, and to go without sleep and food -- dominate
over both 'regular men' and women.9 Again, robotic technology would thus
reinforce hegemonic masculinity rather than eliminating it. AUTONOMOUS
TECHNOLOGY AND THE GENDER CONSTRUCT OF WARFARE Thus far, we [have
illustrated how social constructs of the technology of autonomous
warfare have successfully contained and limited its revolutionary or
emancipatory effects -- showing how the military has successfully
created a **narrative which reframes technological activity as
masculine**,]{.underline} as well as the one which reframes
technological dependence as technological enhancement. However, we still
need to consider the question of distance from the battlefield. In what
ways does the fact that men and women now fight virtually from the
comfort of home change our understanding of combat as a gendered
phenomenon? Clearly, the ability to fight virtually has allowed for more
women soldiers to participate in 'combat'. Data indicates that 17 per
cent of those assigned to drone activities at Creech Air Force Base in
Nevada are female (Singer 2012). But does the participation in war
activity from a remote location where one is not actually at risk of
death change how we think about war as an activity? Presently, the US
military\'s answer to these questions is simply that there is no
distinction between remote combat and close-range combat. In the words
of Colonel Chris Chambliss of Creech Air Base: 'I don\'t think we\'re
7500 miles away at all. I think if you walk out the hangar and you go
into one of the ground control stations, you\'re in the fight' (Sixty
Minutes 2009). The military also reinforces a distinction between home
activity and combat activity through mandating that drone operators not
take phone calls from home while on duty, and that they wear the same
uniforms as those engaged in air combat. Studies on the prevalence of
PTSD in drone operators indicate that adopting a 'combat mindset' can be
just as wearing emotionally regardless of the location where one is
while engaged in combat. Thus far, the military strategy of equating
virtual and real tasks, regarding virtual assistance as enhancement
rather than weakness, and simply ignoring the distances from the
battlefield, has been quite effective. The debate about the changed
meaning of combat simply is not present in the military community. Thus,
[developments in the field of autonomous warfare provide fodder for the
constructivist position that technological developments do not
necessarily lead to social progress or change]{.underline}. In the SCOT
school, analysts argue that **[technology\'s meaning is largely dictated
by the environment and by the usage regimes imposed by those who control
the technology]{.underline}**. According to this view, technological
inventions alone can never force a change in social structures, though,
in certain instances, technological developments might help to support
social changes being carried out by the users (Pinch and Bijker 1984;
LaTour 2005; Oldenziel and Zachmann 2009). As Grint and Woolgar suggest:
The gender of a technology does not lie encased in the fabric of the
material. It is instead a temporary contingent upshot of ongoing
interpretation by designers, sellers and users. The politics and values
of technology result from the gaze of the human; they do not lie in the
gauze of the machine. (Grint and Woolgar 1995: 305) Thus, so far it
appears that the military has been able to 'hold the line', introducing
new technologies while simultaneously dictating to their designers and
their end-users what they will mean and how they will be used. In this
instance, it, thus, appears possible to introduce revolutionary
technologies without necessarily leading to a significant change in the
activity of a warfighter, the role of a warfighter or the overall
meaning of warfare. The emancipatory potential of autonomous technology,
thus, might exist but has not so far been realized.

### 2AC -- LAWS -\> Racist

#### LAWs will increase racial discrimination 

**Conway 20 --** Marissa Conway is the CEO of United Nations Association

As noted throughout this report, the current state of foreign policy,
and in particular national security, is rooted in deeply patriarchal
values. [This can be seen perhaps none more acutely than when we turn an
anti-racist lens to conflict, where violence is sanctioned to reinforce
specific ideas about imperial power and white supremacy.]{.underline} As
killer robots would use technology that carries existing biases[,
developing these weapons would only further reinforce violence and
discrimination against Low Income Countries (LICs) and against people of
colour.]{.underline} In Western states, people of colour are
traditionally underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) fields. [Technology is a field still dominated by
white men, which means that it will also reflect a specific set of
biases that privilege white men]{.underline}. Target profiles are an
excellent example of how this plays out in practice. In the context of
killer robots, developing weapons technology that can select and fire
upon targets independent of human involvement guarantees that people of
colour will disproportionately suffer violence. [In a recent study from
the US government, it was demonstrated facial recognition technology
does in fact reflect racism in dangerous ways. In the case of one-to-one
matching, or when an algorithm matches two photos of the same person,
Black and Asian faces were falsely matched between ten to 100 times more
than white faces]{.underline}. And in instances of one-to-many matching,
where one photo is compared to many others in a database, Black women
were more likely to be misidentified (Facial Recognition Fails on Race,
Study Says, 2019). In the UK, a report from Big Brother Watch showed
that the facial recognition technology the London Metropolitan Police
used at the 2017 Notting Hill Carnival, a street parade celebrating
Caribbean music and culture, misidentified people at a rate of 98% (Big
Brother Watch, 2018). These are only two examples of how racism is
inevitably built into and reflected in our technology. [For these exact
reasons, facial recognition software is being abandoned by developers,
like IBM, and banned by users, like the city of San
Francisco.]{.underline} In the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matter
protests after the murder of George Floyd by police officers, newfound
scrutiny has been given to facial recognition technology, resulting in
growing widespread agreement that it is too dangerous to use. Timnit
Gebru, for example, who is one of Google's ethical artificial
intelligence team leads, recently went on the record to confirm the
risks of facial recognition technology, arguing that it's too dangerous
to be used for law enforcement purposes (Ovide, 2020). [It is clear that
the algorithms and AI that killer robots would be programmed with are
not capable of eliminating the risk of wrongful death without human
intervention. Should violence become automated, "power disparities based
on racial and other hierarchies" would cause "irreparable harm to
targeted communities"]{.underline} (Ramsay-Jones, 2020). And while
facial recognition software is an apt example used throughout this
report, it is not a standalone example of a poorly programmed algorithm
or a piece of problematic technology[. The reflection of systemic racism
across all current technology makes it clear that self-governing weapons
like killer robots would only increase violence against people of
colour]{.underline}. Attempts to counter the bias built into technology
can only be done through meaningful human intervention in the deployment
and use of weapons. The fully autonomous nature of killer robots would
render such a process impossible, guaranteeing that communities of
colour would suffer increased violence. [The imperialist patterns of the
global hierarchy must be likewise taken into account. As it currently
stands, the technology for killer robots is concentrated in just a
handful of powerful, mostly Western states that have ample resources to
spend on developing AI]{.underline} (Haner and Garcia, 2019). These
countries, which tend to be led by white men, use weapons and the threat
of violence to maintain "peace" to keep other states in line with their
wishes. [Killer robots would reinforce these hierarchies]{.underline},
and would be developed by High Income Countries (HICs) to be used in
LICs. It would be a case of HICs using killer robots to maintain their
status within the global hierarchy, as well using it against their own
people to maintain specific power hierarchies within their own borders
(Reaching Critical Will, 2018). As Joy Buolamwini argues, ["\[w\]e have
a responsibility to think about how we create equitable and accountable
systems, and sometimes what that means is you don't create the
tool"]{.underline} (Wood, 2020). People of colour and people in LICs
have been historically excluded from decision making spaces, yet
experience the consequences of those decisions regardless. [In the case
of killer robots, and in parallel with a long history of using people of
colour as test subjects for new science developments, it is unlikely
that killer robots will do anything but amplify violence]{.underline}
(Ramsay-Jones, 2020). Simply put, they should not exist.

[A GENDER ANALYSIS OF TECHNOLOGY AND]{.underline} AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS
[Autonomous weapons are being developed in the context of the
aforementioned norms of gender and power]{.underline}. Scholars of
gender and technology have long argued that [gender relations are
"materialized in technology]{.underline}". That is, the meaning and
[character (the norms) of masculinity and femininity are "embedded" in
machines]{.underline}. These scholars argue that [technological products
bear their creators mark. If technology is developed and utilized
primarily by men operating within a framework of violent masculinity,
their creations will be instilled with that framework of thought,
knowledge, language, and interpretation.]{.underline} Erin Hunt of Mines
Action Canada has noted that "[human biases are baked into the
algorithms and the data we use to train a machine learning program often
reflects our own patriarchal society with its class and race
issues."]{.underline} She argues, "One thing to keep in mind is that
only around 0.0004% of global population has the skills and education
needed to create \[artificial intelligence\] programing and most of
those people were born into pretty privileged circumstances. Similarly,
a recent estimate done by WIRED with Element AI found that [only 12% of
leading machine learning researchers were women."]{.underline} In this
context, [autonomous weapons, as tools of violence and of war, will
likely have specific characteristics that may simultaneously reinforce
and undermine hegemonic gender norms.]{.underline} This in turn [may
have implications for the notion of men as expendable and vulnerable, as
predators and protectors, and pose serious challenges for breaking down
gender essentialisms or achieving gender equality or gender justice in a
broader context.]{.underline} PROJECTING "POWER WITHOUT VULNERABILITY"
If we look at how [armed drones are used and thought about]{.underline}
now, we can see that the development of [fully autonomous weapons
present similar risk]{.underline}s. The argument for these weapons is
similar: drones and autonomous weapons are [described as weapons that
can limit casualties for the deploying force]{.underline}, and that can
limit civilian casualties in areas where they are used because they will
be more precise. It is [a typical argument from the perspective of
violent masculinity: those using the weapon can deploy violence without
fear of facing physical danger themselves; and in turn argue that it
will actually result in less violence.]{.underline} Yet as we have seen
with drones, this---at least, the later argument---is far from the case.
The tools and procedures used for determining targets for "signature
strikes"---attacks based on "producing packages of information that
become icons for killable bodies on the basis of behavior analysis and a
logic of preemption" 1 ---have resulted in hundreds of civilian
casualties in drone strikes. The same risks apply to fully autonomous
weapons. If weapons without meaningful human control are deployed on the
battlefield or a policing situation, programmed to target and engage
people on the basis of software and sensors, [the risks of mistaken
identity or unlawful engagement run high. It is not at all clear to tech
workers, scientists, academics, or other experts that weaponized robots
will be able to comply with international humanitarian law or other
rules of engagement.2]{.underline} In addition to these concerns[, there
is also the risk of bias in those software and sensors. If we look at
bias in programming algorithms, it's easy to be concerned. Bias in terms
of gender, race, socioeconomic status, ability, and sexual orientation
can be programmed into machines, including "**Bias in terms of gender,
race, socioeconomic status, ability, and sexual orientation can be
programmed into** machines, including **autonomous weapons."**. **Facial
recognition software struggles to recognize people of colour; voice
recognition struggles to respond to women's voices or non-North American
accents**;]{.underline} photos of anyone standing in a kitchen are
labeled as women; people's bail is denied because a program decided that
a woman of colour was more likely to reoffend than a white woman.3
[**Imagine this kind of bias being programmed into a weapon system
designed to target and fire upon targets without any meaningful human
contro**l, without any human judgment to counteract that bias. It's not
a pretty picture.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Ban Key 

#### Banning LAWs is a key step in preventing the proliferation of patriarchal military violence

University of Sheffield and was an EPSRC Senior Media Fellow

https://www.forbes.com/sites/noelsharkey/2020/03/08/a-feminist-future-begins-by-banning-killer-robots/?sh=7daa61541fd8KK

On International Women's Day, weapons development won't be the first
thing that springs to mind for achieving global gender equality. [But
banning autonomous weapons systems AKA "killer robots" is needed to
strengthen global peace, advance human security and ensure a feminist
future.]{.underline} [Technology could be a benevolent force in our
increasingly integrated society. The potential benefits of innovative
advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, and
machine learning could secure our future.]{.underline} As United Nations
Secretary General Antonio Guterres said: \"...these new capacities can
help us to lift millions of people out of poverty, achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals and enable developing countries to
leap‑frog into a better future.\" [But that assumes that proper
safeguards are in place. They are not.]{.underline} Without them
technology has the power to harm and disrupt societal values and norms.
[It is becoming alarmingly clear from a growing body of evidence that
automated decision algorithms are propagating gender and race
discrimination throughout our global community and perpetrating
injustices on the poor, the vulnerable and people with disabilities. But
perhaps the greatest concern is the application of algorithmic bias in
the control to targeting with autonomous weapons systems.]{.underline}
Autonomous weapons systems work entirely without human intervention once
they have been launched. They select and engage targets on the basis of
sensor inputs. [There is no meaningful human control to determine the
appropriateness or legitimacy of targets]{.underline}. That means
[decisions about what to attack and when to fire would be delegated to
inanimate machines rather than being made directly by qualified humans.
So what does this have to do with gender equality? Quite a lot. For
starters, they will carry the same bias baggage as other decision
algorithms. And there is much more that I have learned from attending
powerful feminist events at the United Nations]{.underline} (like the
one shown in the opening picture). [Many feminist humanitarian
disarmament organisations such as Women's International League for Peace
and Freedom (WILPF) are concerned that **killer robots would lack
empathy, conscience, emotion and understanding of human rights and human
dignity**--aspects of human judgment that are **crucial for
decision-making in war**. Delegating life and death decision making to
machines would **dehumanise warfare** and killing and **perpetuate
patriarchal structures of military violence**. Because they would select
and fire on the basis of target profiles, fully autonomous weapons raise
the risk of gender-based violence.]{.underline} Target profiling based
on perceived gender or pattern of behaviour could increase risks to
men--who are more likely to be assumed to be potential or active
combatants--but could also pose risks to any group whose gender identity
has been included in a target profile. [Despite claims to the contrary
by some men**, killer robots would not end sexual violence in armed
conflict**. Rape and sexual violence are often used as weapons, and are
already ordered by states and armed groups as a means of inflicting
terror. Autonomous weapons systems would not question an order to round
up women to be raped. Unlike human soldiers **they entirely lack the
conscience and empathy that would make honorable humans
disobey**]{.underline}. In short, [**autonomous weapons systems** could
contribute to or **exacerbate notions of militarized masculinity**, be
used to commit acts of **gender-based violence**, **or increase
inequality as a result of algorithmic bias** or target
profiling.]{.underline} But **[these weapons are not inevitable, and we
have the ability to prevent them from ever being used.]{.underline}**
[The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a global coalition of more than
**150 non-governmental organizations in over 60 countries**, is urging
states to immediately launch negotiations on an international treaty to
retain meaningful human control over targeting and attack decisions by
prohibiting the development, production, and use of autonomous weapons
and to have a positive obligation for the meaningful human control of
all weapons systems. A treaty banning fully autonomous weapons would
support feminist foreign policy goals by focusing on human security and
preventing militarisation of emerging technology and technological
advancements.]{.underline} This International Women's Day, the Campaign
to Stop Killer Robots has called for political leadership in the
movement to ban autonomous weapons systems. [True equality cannot be
achieved through the further dehumanisation of conflict. A feminist
future starts now, with a ban on killer robots.]{.underline}

### 2AC - LAWS -\> War 

#### LAWS increase the risk of war and encourages militaries to kill civilians

**Payne 16**

**(This CRS report was written by Thomas B. Payne, U.S. Air Force
Fellow. 4-14-2016, Congressional Research Service, \"Lethal Autonomous
Weapon Systems: Issues for Congress,\"
https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44466.html#\_Toc448405890//mb24)**

**[Likelihood of War/Jus Ad Bellum]{.underline}** A common concern
r[egarding the development of LAWS is that it will **encourage
inappropriate aggression**]{.underline}**.**86 The justification for
initiating armed conflict is generally described by the [concept of jus
ad bellum, or Just War theory]{.underline}.87 However, although
sometimes couched as such, the concern that LAWS will lead to more
warfare is not actually a legal one, since use of LAWS does not affect
the legal evaluation of the propriety of war initiation.88 Rather, the
argument is that [LAWS would create a moral hazard for national
leadership. This presupposes that current or future leaders are willing
and desire to engage in unlawful war-making but are inhibited by the
likelihood that it will result in military casualties, either for moral
reasons or because of spin-off effects of those
casualties.]{.underline}89 If these suppositions are accurate, then LAWS
would appear to increase the likelihood that leaders would [engage in
unlawful aggression since it would minimize these casualties.
S]{.underline}ome argue, however, that this objection seems excessively
generic.90 They contend that any weapon system that minimizes
casualties, or gives a substantial advantage to one side in armed
conflict, would trigger this same moral hazard.91 Uncontrolled Arms Race
Another potential risk to the development of [LAWS]{.underline} that has
been noted is that it will [trigger wider arms races]{.underline}.92
This argument takes two forms. First, that b[ecause of the tremendous
tactical advantage associated with the development of LAWS, peer and
near-peer competitors will be forced to develop autonomous capabilities
for their own weapon systems.]{.underline}93 [Second]{.underline},
asymmetric competitors, such as international [terrorist
organizations]{.underline}, would [have access to the technology once it
becomes widely used in warfar]{.underline}e.94 For both of these
versions of an \"arms race,\" one harm contemplated, in addition to the
inherent instability associated with arms race dynamics95, is that
competitors will have either less incentive or less capacity to control
the behavior of LAWS, resulting in development or fielding of LAWS that
fail to comply with the laws of war (generally, this is conceived as
competitors developing indiscriminate LAWS, since automation is far
easier to accomplish than discrimination or ethical decision-making).96
A number of counterpoints have been presented to this risk. First, many
contend that [an arms race is already in progress,]{.underline} with
peer and near-peer competitors currently developing autonomous weapon
systems---regardless of U.S. development of these systems.97 It is
argued these [nations would refuse to adopt, or successfully evade
enforcement of, any potential multilateral ban]{.underline}.98 Second,
it is argued that asymmetric competitors may be capable of taking
advantage of technological development, particularly civilian sector
advancements, even if not actively developed for military purposes by
nation-states.99 Under this argument, once the basics of autonomy in
machines are developed for civilian purposes, weaponization of these
autonomous systems is relatively trivial.100 Asymmetric Warfare [Another
risk associated by some with the development of LAWS is an **increased
likelihood of attacks on civilian targets**]{.underline}, particularly
in the United States itself.101 The argument is that the [development of
LAWS will result in the absence of U.S. soldiers from the war
zone]{.underline}. Enemies of the United States, it is argued, will see
no political/strategic benefit in attempting to fight, or carry out
attacks on autonomous weapon systems if the United States is not
suffering human casualties. The [opponent, under this argument, is
therefore incentivized to carry out attacks on civilian rather than
military targets.]{.underline}102 Counter-arguments presented by others
include at least one made against the discussion in the \"Likelihood of
War/Jus Ad Bellum\" section above, in that any generic technological
advantage that makes U.S. service-members less susceptible to enemy
attack appears to create the same risk.103 In the same vein, a DOD
analyst has noted that this argument essentially \"blames the victim,\"
by discouraging protection of soldiers because of the enemy\'s presumed
willingness to violate the laws of war by assaulting civilians.104
Finally, it has been pointed out[, considering the history of nuclear
strategy as well as terrorist targeting, that both peers and asymmetric
opponents are not **generally reluctant to place civilians in jeopardy
if it serves strategic ends**]{.underline}**,** and therefore the
presence or absence of U.S. casualties away from the battlefield is
irrelevant.105

### 2AC - AT: "Robots Don't Rape"

#### Lethal autonomous [weapons]{.underline} will be used to carry out structural sexual [violence]{.underline} against [civilians]{.underline}.

**Sanvik and Lohne, 15** \[Kristin B. Sandvik is Research Professor in
Humanitarian, Kjersti Lohne is a Postdoctoral Reseracher,University of
Oslo, August 13, 2015, accessed on 6-21-2022, "Lethal Autonomous
Weapons: Killing the 'Robots-don't-Rape' Argument"\]/ISEE

Thus, [in thinking **critically** about the nature of the **progress**
narrative of which the 'Robots don't rape' argument is part, we make
three **observations**]{.underline}: First, the politics of rape
denunciation are now also becoming the politics of lobbyists, vendors
and military manufacturers seeking access to new customers and markets.
[The recognition of [**wartime** rape as a fundamental
**violation**]{.mark} of [international]{.mark} [law]{.mark} has been a
[hard fought victory.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Moving rape from the
realm of silence, shame and mutedness and into the public domain has
taken enormous effort. The denunciation of sexual violence as one of the
worst features of armed conflict is thus welcome. However[, this should
not blur our view from recognizing how the struggle against rape has
attained moral currency, a moral currency that may be useful when
someone is trying to legitimate a particular set of past actions or
political choices]{.underline}, or when someone is trying to prepare the
ground for a future project. Second, this instrumentalization of the
'Very Worst Sex Crimes' is nothing new: the scourge of online child
pornography has for a long time been used to legitimate widespread
government censorship and surveillance in cyberspace. What Paul Amar
(2013) calls 'gendered cultural rescue' is by now an established [form
of securitization of gender and sexuality, legitimating intervention for
the 'protection' of (female) civilians.]{.underline} It should therefore
be noted that there is not only commercial interest; there is government
interest too. Third, [this type of argument belongs to a [**broader**
category of technological **utopianism**]{.mark},]{.underline}
signifying the belief that [emergent military technologies create better
wars not only because they are pre[-programmed and remotely
controlle]{.mark}d, but because the technology in question is assumed to
always function as intended:]{.underline} The surgical precision
argument in drone warfare and its attendant claims for 'humane warfare'
because drones (allegedly) limit collateral damage, should be familiar
by now. Similarly, [commentators argue that Cyberwarfare is preferable
to conventional war because it is presumed to make war less
bloody]{.underline}. Following the same type of transformative logic,
[autonomous robots are portrayed as the vehicles for perfect legality
and perfect soldiering, which in combination will produce 'perfect
combat'.]{.underline} This third argument brings the normative crowd of
law and ethics professors into the project. In sum, [the deployment of
the robots-don't-rape argument can be understood as an attempt to build
a moral economy; an environment in which social expectations, cultural
transactions, and emotional investments collectively create a shared
understanding between the participants in an economic exchange.
Leveraging the argument that robots don't rap]{.underline}e---and doing
so through market-based, governance and ethical discourses---can
therefore be interpreted as an attempt to create this type of moral
economy out of which robot soldiers are supposed to emerge. If this is
the case, and the progress narrative is indeed one of strategy as
indicated here, how may we respond? In an excellent posting at Duck of
Minerva last year, Charlie Carpenter lamented the fact that a recurrent
argument at the first Convention of Conventional Weapons (CCW) experts
meeting in Geneva in May 2014 was the idea that, unlike human soldiers,
autonomous weapons would never commit rape. She noted that [this
argument was a subset of the more general argument that killer robots
would be good for human security, since they are assumed better at
keeping to the norms of the laws of war]{.underline} (as argued by
Ronald Arkin and others). Carpenter also observed that the 1998
definition of rape in international law, as codified in the Rome Statute
for the International Criminal court is a broad one, according to which
rape is not reducible to forcible penetration of women committed by men.
Rather, rape occurs when the perpetrator invaded the body of a person by
conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the
body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the
anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part
of the body. Carpenter suggests that this conceptualization of rape is
accompanied by an implicit understanding of motivation and rationale:
[that rapes in war are spontaneous and unplanned and thus a breach of
discipline.]{.underline} Contrary to widespread assumptions[, [sexual
violence is not the male soldier's **appropriation**]{.mark} of his 'war
dividend';]{.underline} rather, as the research on [[sexual violence as
a **weapon** of war has showed us]{.mark}, sexual violence is often
**[strategically used against civilians]{.mark}. If**]{.underline} [LAWS
are programmed to kill, [they may also be programmed to do **other forms
of violence, including rape**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Carpenter's eloquent
rejection of the rape argument on account of factual inaccuracy (wrong
definition of rape; [**[killer robots could technically be programmed to
carry out rape]{.mark}**) along with misleading [assumptions about the
uses of rape in conflict i]{.mark}s one that we should prepare ourselves
to repeat.]{.underline} As often as necessary. [Not least as the cost of
accepting the '[Robots don't rape' **argument risk undermining
hard-fought gender battles**]{.mark},]{.underline} reducing wartime rape
to an issue of uncontrolled/uncontrollable male sexuality and penis
penetration of predominantly female victims instead of recognizing it
primarily as an act of violence, and one which may or may not be
deliberate, intentional, and programmed.

### 2AC - AT: LAWS More Ethical

#### LAWs lacking emotion is an aff argument -- that makes them unethical because they lack the empathy to decide whether or not they should kill. 

Kenneth **Anderson** (Contact Author), 2-28-20**17**, \"Debating
Autonomous Weapon Systems, Their Ethics, and Their Regulation Under
International Law,\" No Publication,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2978359

In the foreseeable future, we will be turning over more and more
functions with life or death implications to machines---such as
driverless cars or automated robot surgery technologies---not simply
because they are more convenient but because they prove to be
safer---and our basic notions about machine and human decisionmaking
will evolve. Aworld that comes, if it does, to accept self-driving
autonomous cars may also be one in which people expect those
technologies to be applied to weapons and the battlefeld as a matter of
course, precisely because it regards them as better (and indeed might
fnd the failure to use them morally objectionable). Te second argument
is that [AWS should be banned because machine learning and AI will never
reach the point of being capable of satisfying the requirements of LOAC,
law, and ethics]{.underline}. Te underlying premise here is that
machines will not be capable, now or in the future, of the [requisite
intuition, cognition, and judgment to comply with legal and ethical
requirements]{.underline}---especially amid the fog of war. Tis is a
core conviction held by many who favour a complete ban on autonomous
lethal weapons. They generally [deny that]{.underline}, even over time
and, indeed, no matter how much time or technological progress takes
place, [machine systems will ever manage to reach the point of
satisfying legal and ethical codes and principles applicable in
war.]{.underline} Tat is because, they believe, [no machine system will
ever be able to make appropriate judgments in the infnitely complex
situations of warfare, or because no machine will ever have the
capability, through its programming, to exhibit key elements of human
emotion and affect that make human beings irreplaceable in making lethal
decisions on the battlefeld---compassion, empathy, and sympathy for
other human beings]{.underline} (Losing Humanity 2012: 4). Tese
assessments are mostly empirical. Although many who embrace them might
also fnally rest upon moral premises denying in principle that a machine
has the moral agency or moral psychology to make lethal decisions, they
are framed here as distinct factual claims about the future evolution of
technology. Te argument rests on assumptions about how machine
technology will actually evolve over decades or longer or, more frankly,
how it will not evolve, as well as beliefs about the special nature of
human beings and their emotional and afective abilities on the
battlefeld that no machine could ever exhibit, even over the course of
technological evolution. It is as if to say that [no autonomous lethal
weapon system could ever pass an 'ethical Turing Test']{.underline}
under which, hypothetically, were a human and a machine hidden behind a
veil, an objective observer could not tell which was which on the basis
of their behaviours. It is of course quite possible that fully
autonomous weapons will never achieve the ability to meet the required
standards, even far into the future. Yet, the radical scepticism that
underlies the argument that they never will is unjustifed. Research into
the possibilities of autonomous machine decision-making, not just in
weapons but across many human activities, is only a couple of decades

This article is a first step in understanding the future of robotic
warfare. The [US **[military's]{.mark}** push for
**[a]{.mark}utonomous** [w]{.mark}eapons [s]{.mark}ystems]{.underline},
in conjunction [with DARPA's move to [create **humanoid**]{.mark}

ignored]{.underline}. Scholars have only looked to the arguments about
whether [autonomous weapons will be capable of upholding the principles
of [**proportionality** and **distinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
even these arguments are dependent on an antecedent question: how a
machine might be programmed to do so. As I have argued elsewhere (Roff
2014b), the level of programming necessary for a warbot requires an
autonomous learning AI. This conclusion, however, is not a sufficient
answer. AI is not a monolithic and neutral entity. It is dependent on
what gets included in the software, which concepts and ideas and "facts"
are data. [[AIs are **biased**]{.mark} as much as, or perhaps
[more]{.mark} [than,]{.mark} their [creators]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
conclusion, presses us to [question not merely the purposes of these

us to [[**examine** the values, practices]{.mark} and ideals we assume

https://spectrum.ieee.org/lethal-autonomous-weapons-exist-they-must-be-banned\]/ISEE

A chilling future that some had said might not arrive for many years to
come is, in fact, already here. According to a recent UN report, a drone
airstrike in Libya from the spring of 2020---made against Libyan
National Army forces by Turkish-made STM Kargu-2 drones on behalf of
Libya\'s Government of National Accord---was conducted by weapons
systems with no known humans "in the loop.\" In so many words, the red
line of autonomous targeting of humans has now been crossed. To the best
of our knowledge, this official United Nations reporting marks the first
documented use case of a lethal autonomous weapon system akin to what
has elsewhere been called a "Slaughterbot.\" We believe this is a
landmark moment. Civil society organizations, such as ours, have
previously advocated for a preemptive treaty prohibiting the development
and use of lethal autonomous weapons, much as blinding weapons were
preemptively banned in 1998. The window for preemption has now passed,
but the need for a treaty is more urgent than ever. The STM Kargu-2 is a
flying quadcopter that weighs a mere 7 kg, is being mass-produced, is
capable of fully autonomous targeting, can form swarms, remains fully
operational when GPS and radio links are jammed, and is equipped with
facial recognition software to target humans. In other words, it\'s a
Slaughterbot. The UN report notes: "Logistics convoys and retreating
\[Haftar Affiliated Forces\] were subsequently hunted down and remotely
engaged by the unmanned combat aerial vehicles or the lethal autonomous
weapons systems such as the STM Kargu-2 (see Annex 30) and other
loitering munitions. The lethal autonomous weapons systems were
programmed to attack targets without requiring data connectivity between
the operator and the munition.\" Annex 30 of the report depicts
photographic evidence of the downed STM Kargu-2 system. In a previous
effort to identify consensus areas for prohibition, we brought together
experts with a range of views on [lethal autonomous weapons to
brainstorm a way forward]{.underline}. We published the agreed findings
in "A Path Towards Reasonable Autonomous Weapons Regulation,\" [which
[suggested a "**time-limited moratorium on the development,
deployment**]{.mark}**, [transfer]{.mark},** and use of anti-[personnel
lethal **autonomous** weapon systems]{.mark}\" as a first, and absolute
minimum, [step for **regulation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A recent
position statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross on
autonomous weapons systems concurs. It states that "[use of autonomous
weapon systems to target human beings should be ruled out]{.underline}.
This would best be achieved [through [a **prohibition** on autonomous
weapon systems that are designed or used to]{.mark} apply force
**against** persons.\"]{.underline} This sentiment is shared by many
civil society organizations, such as the UK-based advocacy organization
Article 36, which recommends that "An effective structure for
international legal regulation would prohibit certain
configurations---such as systems that target people.\" The
"Slaughterbots\" Question In 2017, the Future of Life Institute, which
we represent, released a nearly eight-minute-long video titled
"Slaughterbots\"---which was viewed by an estimated 75 million people
online---dramatizing the dangers of lethal autonomous weapons. At the
time of release, the video received both praise and criticism. Paul
Scharre\'s Dec. 2017 IEEE Spectrum article "Why You Shouldn\'t Fear
Slaughterbots\" argued that "Slaughterbots\" was "very much science
fiction\" and a "piece of propaganda.\" At a Nov. 2017 meeting about
lethal autonomous weapons in Geneva, Switzerland, the Russian ambassador
to the UN also reportedly dismissed it, saying that such concerns were
25 or 30 years in the future. We addressed these critiques in our
piece---also for Spectrum--- titled "Why You Should Fear
Slaughterbots--A Response.\" Now, less than four years later, reality
has made the case for us: The age of Slaughterbots appears to have
begun. [The first step must be an [immediate **moratorium** on the
develop]{.mark}ment, deployment, and use of lethal autonomous weapons
that target persons, [combined with a commitment to negotiate a
permanent treat]{.mark}y]{.underline}. We produced "Slaughterbots\" to
educate the public and policymakers alike about the potential imminent
dangers of small, cheap, and ubiquitous lethal autonomous weapons
systems. Beyond the moral issue of handing over decisions over life and
death to algorithms, [the video pointed out that [autonomous weapons
will, inevitably, turn into weapons of mass destruction]{.mark},
precisely because they require no human supervision and can therefore be
deployed in vast numbers]{.underline}. (A related point, concerning the
tactical agility of such weapons platforms, was made in Spectrum last
month in an article by Natasha Bajema.) Furthermore, like small arms,
autonomous weaponized drones will proliferate easily on the
international arms market. As the "Slaughterbots\" video\'s epilogue
explained, all [[the component **technologies** were already
available]{.mark}, and we expected [militaries]{.mark} to start
deploying such weapons very soon. [That prediction was essentially
correct.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC - AT: ILAW Bad

#### International law [needs]{.underline} to be [engaged]{.underline} with any other method cedes ILAW. 

**Sen, 22** \[Rohini Sen is an Assistant Professor at the Jindal Global
Law School, 10-3-2022, accessed on 6-24-2022, Voelkerrechtsblog, \"We
Must All Engage with Feminist Approaches to International Law\",
https://voelkerrechtsblog.org/we-must-all-engage-with-feminist-approaches-to-international-law/\]/ISEE

In course of the last few weeks, my Twitter feed displayed three
different trending news with varying degrees of urgency: Ukrainian
responses to the Russian armed attack, a record complaint of rape and
sexual assault in the United Kingdom and Wales, and growing tensions
between state and private interest in tribal lands of central India. Any
contemporary account of international law is likely to read these as
three separate and recurrent patterns of how international law
'happens'. The first is a pattern of state-centric territorial dispute
with emphasis on securitization-based responses. The second is a data
driven account of legal subject making -- vulnerable objects of violence
with a focus on sexual violence. And the third, nestled under
transnational corporate legality, is the story of regulating land
ownership in the language of private capital. Each of these, despite
their [seemingly [separate **spheres** of operation in international
law]{.mark}, are deeply entangled [in **fundamental**]{.mark}
ways]{.underline}. The relationships between [legal [subjects]{.mark}
and **institutions** of international law have been [**subjected** to
critique and]{.mark} analysis through various discourses of power
before.]{.underline} However, Feminist Approaches to International Law
(FtAIL), [oscillating between the prescriptive and the analytic, enables
a very different, enmeshed mode of relational engagement with these
institutions and subjects.]{.underline} One that is rooted in
discomfort, self-awareness and affect. In the following sections I
discuss two significant turns in FtAIL; the ways in which these turns
have engendered the production of particular feminist pedagogical
approaches, and some ways of 'doing' of them. What are Feminist
Approaches to International Law? Old Question, New Answers Revisiting
this old question is necessary not to attempt to provide a definition,
but to indicate shifts in [FtAIL's perception in the mainstream
writings]{.underline}. Some of these approaches include conversations on
feminist pedagogy and the visibility of scholars such as myself who
espouse a [distinct ambivalence towards international law's masculine
format of [**academe** and 'expertise']{.mark}]{.underline}. Earlier
iterations of FtAIL, through Chinkin, Charlesworth and Wright's now
classic intervention have been around international law's treatment of
the 'woman question'. [From [liberal feminisms]{.mark} essentializing to
radical feminism's [restructuring,]{.mark} the questions asked were
centered around the absence of women in international law and how to
best intercept this figure as an [essentialized legal
subject.]{.mark}]{.underline} This narrative took a turn for a certain
form of contingency with transnational and post-colonial feminism
calling attention to extremely differential conditions and forms of
alliances for women of the Global South. Their interactions led to two
things. The first was the formation of an ensemble feminism that seems
to espouse some characteristics of post-colonial criticality while
reposing faith in liberal feminism and mainstream international law in a
particular way. Pedagogically, I call this the turn of didactic
discomfort. The second has been a contemporary and assertive call to
center feminisms that emerged parallelly, marginally and somewhat
apposite to the mainstream narrative of feminism and previous feminist
positions in international law. In this account, [if 'woman' was a
multifaceted, socially produced category, then FtAIL became a structural
(and structured) critique of international law's institutions and
practices with special focus on questions of labour, land ownership, and
legal subjecthood as sites of analytical and prescriptive
enquirie]{.underline}s. [This approach uses female subjecthood and
subjection to analyse the ways in which international law produces and
sustains structural inequalities]{.underline} and ways to [subvert
them]{.underline}. In moving away from the gender question to the
colonial gendering question FtAIL became a heuristic that implicates and
benefits everything and everyone rather than the previously
presumed"women speaking about women"paradigm. This, I note as the
pedagogical turn to entanglements. While the turn to didactic discomfort
has led to academic deconstructions of the category of women and an
effort to provincialize dominant feminist approaches, the turn to
entanglements have led to epistemological questions around structures
and praxis of international law and its knowledge systems. Both of these
can be presented through ideas of relationship politics and relationship
making where we give form to discomforts and epistemic alterities by
examining relationships between institutions, others and selves. In the
following section, I employ these [two pedagogical approaches to think
about international law differently, as an idea of relational politics
through a) its teaching and b) knowledge production and sites of
knowledge.]{.underline} Some ways of doing FtAIL: Relational Politics
and Relationship Making in International law There are many ways to do
feminisms and FtAIL and [none of them are/should be prescriptive in an
inflexible way.]{.underline} The ones I discuss below centre academia
and teaching as sites of dialogic praxis. Using the two pedagogical
turns stated above, I [offer certain [feminist interventions that ask us
to turn]{.mark} the gaze on ourselves as agents of [international law
and]{.mark} then, to contemplate it as [a project, where we
co-constitu]{.mark}te its elements and (are compelled to) [move as an
interconnected unit]{.mark} rather than disparate features and
systems.]{.underline} A unit, where excesses are coded into structures
that sustain inequalities and imbalances. FtAIL as a relational project
in teaching Through this approach[, teaching is foregrounded as a social
process with social actors, where the teaching and teachers of
international law embody differential politics as well]{.underline}. The
core requirement is twofold -- first, to turn [the gaze on ourselves as
[knowledge interlocutors occupying striated positions]{.mark}, so that
[we can recognize where we are placed in relation to]{.mark}
institutional [knowledge]{.mark} making.]{.underline} Accordingly, [we
locate ourselves as social actors in the process of teaching
international law where we may or may not find ourselves reflected in
the discipline.]{.underline} And second, [we subject the teaching itself
to [uncover similar relational arrangements.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moving
away from the mainstream international law's traditional depiction of
itself as 'regulations that govern states', this feminist approach is
grounded in identifying and teaching the various relationships that
under-gird the international legal project. In contradistinction to the
theories of statehood and sources of law, the basis of this approach is
drawing out and examining the different forms of relationships in
international law. For instance, is there a relationship of continuity
between Eurocentric sovereignty and post-colonial sovereignty? What is
the arrangement of power between the sovereign states and its various
subjects? What are the linkages between human rights and the neoliberal
market? Are sources of international law distinct from the states that
make them? Let us unpack two such arrangements transversally and
conceptually. Transversal, in this instance, is apprehending existing
ideas of international law with critique but not disregarding them.
Teaching a feminist account of sovereignty could entail a relational
study of how the European sovereign state (and its post-colonial
successor) securitize law to set normative notions of heterosexual
relationships and family. For instance, the Women Peace and Security
Resolution 1325 can be taught through exploring the forms and roles of
womanhood it assumes in relation to the roles played by women in public
and private places. Its emphasis on sexual vulnerability can also be
contemplated in relation to other forms of gendered structural
vulnerabilities such as labour, land ownership, recognition that do not
feature in the 'woman question'. [The relationship between
[securitization]{.mark} and other forms of non-state [interventions to
address crisis can also be examined in relation]{.mark} to this
[paradigm]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly, the [teaching of sources of
international law could be approached by analyzing how the colonial
distinction is written into formal and informal sources of customary
international law]{.underline}. Once [the coding is made visible, we are
also able to notice how the binaries of formal and informal sources are
identical to feminist analysis of international law's false binary of
public and private distinctions;]{.underline} a relationship between who
is erasing and what is erased.

### 2AC - NATO Say Yes

#### NATO wants to set AI standards\-\--US is the last holdout. 

**Heikkilä, 21** \[Melissa Heikkilä, 3-29-2021, accessed on 6-24-2022,
POLITICO, \"NATO wants to set AI standards. If only its members agreed
on the basics.\",
[https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/\]/ISEE](https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/%5d/ISEE)

On paper, NATO is the ideal organization to go about setting standards
for military applications of artificial intelligence. But the widely
divergent priorities and budgets of its 30 members could get in the way.
The Western military alliance has identified artificial intelligence as
a key technology needed to maintain an edge over adversaries, and it
wants to lead the way in establishing common ground rules for its use.
"We need each other more than ever. No country alone or no continent
alone can compete in this era of great power competition," NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the alliance's second in command, said
in an interview with POLITICO. [The standard-setting effort comes as
China is pressing ahead with AI applications in the military largely
free of democratic oversight]{.underline}. David van Weel, NATO's
assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, said
Beijing\'s lack of concern with the tech\'s ethical implications has
sped along the integration of AI into the military apparatus. \"I\'m
\... not sure that they\'re having the same debates on principles of
responsible use or they\'re definitely not applying our democratic
values to these technologies," he said. Meanwhile, the EU --- which has
pledged to roll out the world\'s first binding rules on AI in coming
weeks --- is seeking closer collaboration with Washington to oversee
emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. But those
efforts have been slow in getting off the ground. For Geoană, that
collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working closely with the
European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on "high risk"
applications. The pitch NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a
standard, it becomes in terms of defensive security the gold standard in
that respective field," Geoană said. The alliance\'s own AI strategy, to
be released before the summer, will identify ways to operate AI systems
responsibly, identify military applications for the technology, and
provide a "platform for allies to test their AI to see whether it\'s up
to NATO standards," van Weel said. The strategy will also set ethical
guidelines around how to govern AI systems, for example by ensuring
systems can be shut down by a human at all times, and to maintain
accountability by ensuring a human is responsible for the actions of AI
systems. "If an adversary would use autonomous AI powered systems in a
way that is not compatible with our values and morals, it would still
have defense implications because we would need to defend and deter
against those systems," van Weel said. "We need to be aware of that and
we need to flag legislators when we feel that our restrictions are
coming into the realm of \[being detrimental to\] our defense and
deterrence," he continued. Mission impossible? The problem is that
NATO\'s members are at very different stages when it comes to thinking
about AI in the military context. [The [U.S.,]{.mark} the world\'s
biggest military spender, [has prioritized the use of AI]{.mark} in the
defense realm.]{.underline} But in Europe, most countries --- France and
the Netherlands excepting --- barely mention the technology's defense
and military implications in their national AI strategies[. "It's
absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy before
it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it exactly the
other way aroun]{.underline}d,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy
fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: That echoes
familiar transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S. President
Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also
highlights the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly. [The
EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The [U.S., which tends to be **light** on
regulation]{.mark} and **keen** on defense, sees things differently.
There are also [**divergences** over what technologies the alliance
ought]{.mark} to [develop, including **l**]{.mark}**ethal
[a]{.mark}utonomous [w]{.mark}eapons [s]{.mark}ystem**s --- often dubbed
"killer robots"]{.underline} --- programmed to identify and destroy
targets without human control. Powerful NATO members including France,
the U.K., and [[the U.S. have **developed** these technologies and
oppose a **treaty** on these weapons,]{.mark} while **others** like
[Belgium and Germany have **expressed serious concerns** about the
technology]{.mark}. These weapons systems have also faced fierce public
opposition from civil society and human rights group]{.underline}s,
including from United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in
2018 called for a ban. Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous
weapon systems as part of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that
its upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical use of the
technology without "stifling innovation." Staying relevant These issues
threaten to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting drive. \"[I think
[there's]{.mark} a certain danger that [if NATO doesn't take this on as
a real challenge,]{.mark} that it may be marginalized by other such
efforts]{.underline}," Franke said. She pointed to the U.S.-led AI
Partnership for Defense, which consists of 13 countries from Europe and
Asia to collaborate on AI use in the military context --- a forum which
could supplant NATO as the standard-setting body. That could have
consequences for human rights, too. "[[NATO]{.mark}... [is a great place
to responsibly]{.mark} think about how to [harness the good
par]{.mark}ts of this technology and how to prohibit the parts that
would be [catastrophic for humanitarian]{.mark} law and human rights
law, and people at the end of the day,"]{.underline} said Verity Coyle,
a senior adviser at Amnesty International, which is part of the Stop
Killer Robots campaign. "[[Without oversight mechanisms to ensure
ethical standards]{.mark} and measures, which would guarantee that this
technology will operate under meaningful human control" [NATO's strategy
could head into an "ethical vacuum]{.mark},"]{.underline} Coyle said.
Franke said it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the basics, like
increased data sharing to develop and train military AI and cooperating
on using artificial intelligence in logistics. ["If [NATO countries were
to cooperate]{.mark} on that, [that could create good procedures and set
precedents]{.mark}. And I think we should then move on to the more
controversial things such as autonomous weapons systems]{.underline},"
she said.

The [Alliance's success with [AI will also **depend** on new and
well-designed **principle**]{.mark}**s** and practices relating to [good

others.]{.underline} In parallel[, Allies have taken part in the Group

[W]{.mark}eapon [S]{.mark}ystems** under the auspices of the United
Nations, [leading to the formulation of 11 guiding
principles]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, there is a good case for
viewing work on adopting AI and work on principles of responsible use as
complementary and synergistic. In effect, there are certain essential
principles or goals that will underpin and facilitate both engineering
good practice, as well as responsible state behaviour. Certain national
principles imply a need for specific design requirements. For example, a
principle of governability may be linked to technical abilities to
detect and avoid unintended consequences, and to disengage or deactivate
in case of unintended behaviour.

Pentagon: Exclusive details - Breaking Defense\",
https://breakingdefense.com/2022/05/updated-autonomous-weapons-rules-coming-for-the-pentagon-exclusive-details/\]/ISEE

WASHINGTON: The Defense Department is updating its guidance on
autonomous weapons to consider advances in artificial intelligence, with
a revised directive slated for release later this year, the head of the
Pentagon's emerging capabilities policy office told Breaking Defense in
an exclusive interview. DoD directive 3000.09 \[PDF\], signed by
then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Nov. 21, 2012,
established policy, responsibilities and review processes for the
"design, development, acquisition, testing, fielding, and employment of
autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems, including guided
munitions that can independently select and discriminate targets." But
in the decade since its release, artificial intelligence and machine
learning technologies have made a massive leap forward, and it's
"entirely plausible" there may need to be revisions that reflect the
Pentagon's "responsible AI" initiative and other ethical principles
adopted by the department, said Michael Horowitz, DoD director of
emerging capabilities policy. "Autonomy and AI are not the exact same
thing," Horowitz told Breaking Defense on May 24. "But given the growing
importance that AI plays, and thinking about the future of war and the
way the department has been thinking about AI, I think ensuring that's
reflected in the directive seems to make sense." It's important to note
that, based on the definition inscribed in DoD directive 3000.09, the
military currently does not operate any weapon [systems that qualify as
an autonomous weapon --- and at least **publicly** is not currently
developing such a weapon]{.underline}. The department characterizes an
"[autonomous weapon" as an autonomous or semi-autonomous system that can
choose its own targets and apply lethal or nonlethal force without a
human in the loop.]{.underline} The directive does not apply to unarmed
drones or armed drones like the MQ-9 Reaper, whose flight path and
weapons release is controlled by a human pilot sitting at a remote
location. It also doesn't apply to systems like the Switchblade
loitering munitions the US has provided to Ukraine, which are programmed
by a human operator to hit specific targets and can be called off when
needed. "It was the first national policy published on autonomous
weapons systems, and actually remains one of the only publicly available
national policies," Horowitz said. "It [[set the **standard**]{.mark}
essentially [for the global **dialogue**]{.mark} that followed [and
**demonstrated** America's responsible]{.mark} approach to the
[potential incorporation of **autonomy** into weapon]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}." In a 2012 interview with Defense News, David
Ochmanek, then the deputy assistant secretary for policy force
development, described the doctrine as "flexible" and stressed the
imposition of a "rigorous review process" that would now be in place
before any future autonomous weapon could be approved. [But that promise
has done little to assuage opponents, who raise comparisons to
Terminators and have organized into efforts, such as the eponymous
Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, to preemptively ban the
technology.]{.underline} Horowitz --- a longtime drone expert who once
authored a paper titled "The Ethics & Morality of Robotic Warfare:
Assessing the Debate over Autonomous Weapons" --- is well aware of the
debate around such systems, and while avoiding commenting on those
concerns directly, he noted that the department's increased focus on
autonomy and AI in recent years has always been with the idea of a human
being involved in the process. "I would say the one of the things about
the approach of [[the United States]{.mark} to the role of AI and
autonomous systems [has been **imagining** these systems as a]{.mark}
way to [**enhance** the warfighter]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said. "It's
why, dating back a couple of administrations, [[the United States
has]{.mark} talked about things like human-machine teaming, [because it
tends to think about]{.mark} AI and autonomous systems as [things that
work synergistically]{.mark} with the best trained military in the world
to improve its capacity."]{.underline} Modernized AI The update is
occurring not because a major technological breakthrough is on the
horizon, but because of a department standard that requires directives
be updated every 10 years. Right now, it's unclear exactly how much of
the original directive will need to be revised, but Horowitz seemed to
downplay massive rewrites. ["Our instinct entering this process [is that
the fundamental approach]{.mark} in the directive remains sound, [that
the directive laid out a very responsible]{.mark} approach to the
[incorporation of autonomy and weapons systems]{.mark}," Horowitz
said.]{.underline} "But we want to make sure, of course, that the
directive still reflects the views of the department and the way the
department should be thinking about \[autonomous\] weapon systems," he
continued. "You know, it has been a decade. And it's entirely plausible
that there are some updates and clarifications that would be helpful."
Horowitz declined to go into details about where he thinks changes may
be needed, but did highlight that the document reflects the Pentagon of
2012, which has morphed over the course of the Obama, Trump and Biden
administrations. For instance, the review process laid out in the
original directive references the Under Secretary of Defense for

### 2AC - NATO Key

#### LAWS are inevitable absent a unified pushback from NATO -- NATO policies are specifically designed with ethics in mind 

**Michelson 21** Brian Michelson, 2-23-2021, \"Why NATO Needs Lethal
Autonomous Weapon Standards,\" CEPA,
https://cepa.org/why-nato-needs-lethal-autonomous-weapon-standards//mb24

[**Lethal autonomous weapon systems will come to dominate warfare** in
the coming years. **NATO needs to harmonize its approach to their
development** and use, or risk being left behind. The rapid
weaponization of artificial intelligence]{.underline}, "big data,"
social media, robotics, and a host of other technologies [presents a
clear competitive challenge to NAT]{.underline}O, an alliance with
members that exist on a wide spectrum of military-technological
capabilities. The [future effectiveness of NATO will be driven in large
part by how it handles these challenges from hobbling its ability both
to act in unison and to prevail in a contest of wills]{.underline}.
While there are numerous potential technology gaps, one that will likely
only increase is partner nations' ability and willingness to employ
lethal autonomous weapon systems. [**These systems will inevitably grow
more capable**, and more necessary, in the coming decade.]{.underline}
Technological gaps are inevitable considering the disparities in GDP and
military budgets. [The United States accounts for over 70 percent of
NATO's overall military spending, while the next three largest
contributors]{.underline} (the United Kingdom, France, and Germany)
provide approximately half of the remaining 30 percent. [And with most
NATO nations continuing to fund their militaries at under the 2 percent
GDP goal, technological gaps will continue to grow.]{.underline} For
perspective, the 2021 United States Department of Defense research and
development budget is approximately equal to the entire defense outlay
of France and Germany combined. [With such a large differential, what
can be done to help enable effective investments in autonomous weapons
by smaller nations]{.underline}? Even more specifically, how can smaller
nations provide capabilities that can integrate into, and contribute to
the alliance? [To better invest limited funds, now is the **time to look
at a NATO standard for lethal autonomous weapons and their ethical
use.**]{.underline} While there is no agreed-upon international
definition of lethal autonomous weapons systems, the [U.S. Department of
Defense defines them as "weapon system\[s\] that, once activated, can
select and engage targets without further intervention by a human
operator.]{.underline}" While these are not Schwarzenegger-style
Terminators and still have a degree of human control over them, the
technology enabling these systems is maturing rapidly, and military
necessity will increasingly demand that these systems gain broader
parameters of autonomous action. Yet [despite the complexity of these
systems and the inevitability of their proliferation, NATO does not
currently have a common standard for their use or development. In fact,
some NATO countries even have opposing views of how to handle
them]{.underline}. [NATO standards are designed to ensure compatibility
among weapon systems, communication architecture, and a host of other
warfighting systems.]{.underline} The 7.62mm [small arms round is a good
example of this]{.underline}. But what is the 7.62mm equivalent standard
for the development and employment of autonomous weapon systems? This
opens a host of related questions regarding the employment of these
systems: What Identification -- Friend -- Foe (IFF) capability should
ground and air units require to prevent fratricide? What degree of
certainty does a lethal autonomous weapon system require before final
engagement? What level of collateral damage is acceptable? What degree
of compatibility between systems is required? Should all these
parameters (and others) be adjustable, and if so, at what command level?
[The attendant ethics also need to be addressed. NATO's experience in
Afghanistan was a case study in the challenges of coalition
warfare.]{.underline} Differing risk tolerances, legal requirements,
ethical views, domestic political concerns, and at times simply combat
capability, all combined into to complex policy cocktail that impeded
the effectiveness of combat operations. [While modern militaries have
accountability, legal, and ethical systems incorporated into their
command structures, **they are not uniform and leaders in differing
militaries have varying degrees of authority**]{.underline}**.** The key
questions hinge on two issues: Who gets to decide to employ an
autonomous weapon, and who is responsible should things go wrong? The
Kunduz hospital strike in October of 2015 was driven primarily by human
error. Responsibility was fixed on the chain of command and 16 leaders
were disciplined. Who will be responsible if a member nation conducts a
NATO-authorized strike and it goes terribly wrong? If this framework is
not thoroughly established ahead of time, not only is it likely that
commanders may hesitate to use this capability, the risk-aversion
inherent in bureaucracies may limit the development of autonomous
weapons that will be needed in future conflicts. In the emerging field
of **[lethal autonomous weapons, establishing a common NATO standard for
the development and use of autonomous weapons will help address the gap
in capabilities among NATO member nations. By establishing these
standards, nations can ensure that their defense expenditures on
autonomous weapons will create systems that are interoperable, able to
contribute to NATO's capability, and can be employed within defensible
ethical guidelines.]{.underline}**

#### NATO is key -- the EU is inefficient, and NATO is the only organization capable of setting an ethical precedent on AI 

**HeikkilÄ 22** Melissa HeikkilÄ, 6-22-2022, \"NATO wants to set AI
standards. If only its members agreed on the basics.,\" POLITICO,
<https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities//mb24>

[NATO wants to set AI standards. If only its members agreed on the
basics. Big differences over how to treat autonomous weapons could
undermine NATO's drive.]{.underline} On paper, [NATO is the ideal
organization to go about setting standards for military applications of
artificial intelligence.]{.underline} But the widely divergent
priorities and budgets of its 30 members could get in the way. The
Western [military alliance has identified artificial intelligence as a
key technology needed to maintain an edge over adversaries]{.underline},
and it wants to lead the way in establishing common ground rules for its
use. "We need each other more than ever. [No country alone or no
continent alone can compete in this era of great power
competition,]{.underline}" NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoană,
the alliance's second in command, said in an interview with POLITICO.
The standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications in the military largely free of democratic oversight. David
van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary general for emerging security
challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of concern with the tech\'s ethical
implications has sped along the integration of AI into the military
apparatus. \"I\'m \... not sure that they\'re having the same debates on
principles of responsible use or they\'re definitely not applying our
democratic values to these technologies," he said. Meanwhile, the [EU
--- which has pledged to roll out the world\'s first binding rules on AI
in coming weeks --- is seeking closer collaboration with Washington to
oversee emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. But
those efforts have been slow in getting off the ground.]{.underline} For
Geoană, that [collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working
closely with the European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on
"high risk" applications.]{.underline} The pitch [NATO does not
regulate, but "**once NATO sets a standard, it becomes in terms of
defensive security the gold standard in that respective field**," Geoană
said. The alliance\'s own AI strategy, to be released before the summer,
will identify ways to operate AI systems responsibly, identify military
applications for the technology, and provide a "platform for allies to
test their AI to see whether it\'s up to NATO standards," van Weel said.
The strategy will also set ethical guidelines around how to govern AI
systems, for example by ensuring systems can be shut down by a human at
all times, and to maintain accountability by ensuring a human is
responsible for the actions of AI systems. "**If an adversary would use
autonomous AI powered systems in a way that is not compatible with our
values and morals, it would still have defense implications because we
would need to defend and deter against those systems,"** van Weel
said.]{.underline} "We need to be aware of that and [we need to flag
legislators when we feel that our restrictions are coming into the realm
of \[being detrimental to\] our defense and deterrence]{.underline}," he
continued. Mission impossible? The problem is that NATO\'s members are
at very different stages when it comes to thinking about AI in the
military context. The U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has
prioritized the use of AI in the defense realm. But in Europe, most
countries --- France and the Netherlands excepting --- barely mention
the technology's defense and military implications in their national AI
strategies. "It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI
strategy before it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did
it exactly the other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy
fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: That echoes
familiar transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S. President
Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also
highlights the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly. The
EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently. There are also divergences
over what technologies the alliance ought to develop, including lethal
autonomous weapons systems --- often dubbed "killer robots" ---
programmed to identify and destroy targets without human control.
Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the U.S. have
developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons, while
others like Belgium and Germany have expressed serious concerns about
the technology. These weapons systems have also faced fierce public
opposition from civil society and human rights groups, including from
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018 called
for a ban. Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon
systems as part of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that its
upcoming recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology
without "stifling innovation." Staying relevant These issues threaten to
hamper NATO\'s standard-setting drive. \"I think there's a certain
danger that if NATO doesn't take this on as a real challenge, that it
may be marginalized by other such efforts," Franke said. She pointed to
the U.S.-led AI Partnership for Defense, which consists of 13 countries
from Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI use in the military context
--- a forum which could supplant NATO as the standard-setting body. That
could have consequences for human rights, too. "[NATO... is a great
place to responsibly think about how to harness the good parts of this
technology and how to prohibit the parts that would be catastrophic for
humanitarian law and human rights law, and people at the end of the
day,"]{.underline} said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty
International, which is part of the Stop Killer Robots campaign.
"[Without oversight mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and measures,
which would guarantee that this technology will operate under meaningful
human control]{.underline}" NATO's strategy could head into an "ethical
vacuum," Coyle said. Franke said it\'s better for the alliance to focus
on the basics, like increased data sharing to develop and train military
AI and cooperating on using artificial intelligence in logistics. "[If
NATO countries were to cooperate on that, that could create good
procedures and set precedents. And I think **we should then move on to
the more controversial things such as autonomous weapons
systems,"**]{.underline} she said.

Surmounting the Obstacles\",
https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/5/216318-toward-a-ban-on-lethal-autonomous-weapons/fulltext\]/ISEE

From April 1115, 2016, at the United Nations Office at Geneva, the
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) conducted a third year
of informal meetings to hear expert testimony regarding a preemptive ban
on lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS). A total of 94 states
attended the meeting, and at the end of the week they agreed by
consensus to recommend the formation of an open-ended Group of
Government Experts (GGE). A GGE is the next step in forging a concrete
proposal upon which the member states could vote. By the end of 2016 a
preemptive ban has been called for by 19 states. Furthermore, meaningful
human control, a phrase first proposed by advocates for a ban, has been
adopted by nearly all the states, although the phrase\'s meaning is
contested. Thus a ban on LAWS would appear to have gained momentum. Even
the large military powers, notably the U.S., have publicly stated that
they will support a ban if that is the will of the member states. Behind
the scenes, however, the principal powers express their serious
disinclination to embrace a ban. Many of the smaller states will follow
their lead. The hurdles in the way of a successful campaign to ban LAWS
remain daunting, but are not insurmountable. The debate to date has been
characterized by a succession of arguments and counterarguments by
proponents and opponents of a ban. This back and forth should not be
interpreted as either a stalemate or a simple calculation as to whether
the harms of LAWS can be offset by their benefits. [For all
[states]{.mark} that are [signatories to the laws of armed
conflict]{.mark},a any violation of the principles of international
humanitarian law (**[IHL]{.mark}**)b [must]{.mark} [trump

benefits of [LAWS]{.mark} justify their use and therefore oppose a
[ban]{.mark}, [are intent that **LAWS** do not become a special case
within IHL]{.mark}. Demonstrating that [LAWS **pose** unique challenges
for IHL has been a core strategy for **supporters** of a
ban]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those among the more than 3,100 AI/Robotics
researchers who signed the Autonomous Weapons: An Open Letter From AI &
Robotics Researchersc are reflective of a broad consensus among citizens
and even active military personnel who favor a preemptive ban.4 [This
consensus is partially attributable to speculative, futuristic, and
fictional scenarios. But perhaps [even science fiction represents a deep
intuition that unleashing LAWS is not a road humanity should
tread]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Some nations will be emboldened to start
wars if they believe they can achieve political objectives without the
loss of their troops.]{.underline} Researchers who have waded into the
debate over banning LAWS have come to appreciate the manner in which
geopolitics, security concerns, the arcana of arms control, and
linguistic obfuscations can turn a relatively straightforward proposal
into an extremely complicated proposition. A ban on LAWS does not fit
easily, or perhaps at all, into traditional models for arms control.

### 2AC -- AT: Weapons PICs

#### Hegemonic masculinity informs the use of weapon systems. The aff's analysis of gender is key to break down those norms.

masculinities" Women, Men Peace and security from Disarmament forum)**

Conventional wisdom has it that men enjoy a 'special relationship' with
weapons, a view which seems to be corroborated by empirical evidence[.
The relationship between 'masculine' men and weapons is
s]{.underline}uch a prevailing cliché that one finds it [everywhere,
from advertising to left-wing revolutionary posters, fascist imagery to
the novels of Hemingway, war memorials to homoerotic art, from the porn
industry to feminist critiques of male militarism.]{.underline} [Weapons
systems are designed]{.underline} mostly [by men]{.underline}, marketed
mostly [for men]{.underline} and used mostly by men---[and]{.underline}
in many parts of the world, [they are the primary source of death for
men]{.underline}. Boys are given guns and swords to play with or they
make them for themselves. Adolescent male warriors and middle-aged male
hunters pose for cameras brandishing their weapons. Michael Ignatieff
describes entering 'zones of toxic testosterone' in the Bosnian war.1
War memorials depict muscular men clutching their guns or hurling
grenades with flexed, oversized pectoral muscles bulging out of the
opened shirts of their uniforms. [If one considers]{.underline} gender,
in this case [masculinity, to be socially constructed, and one
additionally wants to further the cause of disarmament, it becomes
evident that this bond between men and weapons]{.underline} and how this
[is linked with violent notions of masculinity need to be investigated
and analysed further in order to be able to develop sustainable
disarmament policies]{.underline}. [The importance of analysing violent
masculinity gains]{.underline} even more [significance if one accepts
the notion of conflicts]{.underline} increasingly [being ones of
'identity', in which the gendered ethnic identities that are constructed
and mobilized tend to be highly militarized]{.underline}.2 In this
article, I will analyse some of the ways in which [enactments of
masculinities and the wielding of weapons go together]{.underline}, the
sexualized imagery used in conjunction with weapons, and the models of
masculinity that lie behind these concepts. I will argue that [the
public display, the **threat of or actual use of weapons is an intrinsic
part of violent, militarized models of masculinity**]{.underline}The
specific 'message' conveyed by the display and use of weapons is
dependent on the social and cultural environment. I will argue that
[weapons are part of one notion of masculinity, a militarized view that
equates 'manliness' with]{.underline} the 'sanctioned [use of
aggression, force and violence']{.underline}.[3 Weapons are used as
status symbols but also as tools to achieve economic and social
gains,]{.underline} wielding power over unarmed males and females. [This
can often be linked to a crisis of masculinity]{.underline}, when [there
is a 'fear of loss of male power and privilege]{.underline}'4 through
social transformations, [leading to a backlash in which 'traditional'
gender roles are reinforced]{.underline}. The construct of the male
warrior/protector relies on the suppression of others--- including
competing concepts of masculinity. Weapons and their public display seek
to underline the 'manly' prowess of the bearer, but tragically often
also undermine it---men are not only disproportionately the perpetrators
of violence, but also often its victims. This contribution is intended
to open up discussion. As I consider gender roles to be highly dependent
on the cultural and social environment in which men and women act, I
will start by delineating which socio-cultural environment I shall
examine. Unfortunately, by necessity rather than by choice**,** the
limited scope of this study will lead me to concentrate heavily on
'western' (i.e. North American, European and Australian) perceptions of
masculinity, though I will endeavour, where possible, to broaden this
scope.

On March 22, 2003, [two days into the U.S.-led invasion]{.underline} of
Iraq, American troops fired a [[Patriot interceptor]{.mark} missile at
what they **assumed** was an Iraqi anti-radiation missile designed [to
destroy **air-defense** systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Acting on the
recommendation of their computer-powered weapon, [the Americans fired in
self-defense, thinking they were shooting down a missile coming to
destroy their outpost.]{.underline} What the [[**Patriot** missile
system had identified as an incoming **missile**]{.mark}, was in fact a
[**UK Tornado** fighter jet, a]{.mark}nd when the [Patriot **struck**
the aircraft, it killed two **crew**]{.mark} on board
instantly]{.underline}. The deaths were the first losses suffered by the
Royal Air Force in the war and the tragic result of friendly fire. A
subsequent RAF Board of Inquiry investigation concluded that the
shoot-down was the result of a combination of factors: [how the [Patriot
missile classified targets]{.mark}, rules for firing the missiles,
**autonomous** operation of Patriot missile batteries, and several other
technical and procedural factors, like the Tornado not broadcasting [its
"**friend or foe" identifier at the time of the friendly
fire**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The destruction of Tornado ZG710, the
report concluded, [represented a tragic error enabled by the missile's
computer routines.]{.underline} The shoot-down of the Tornado happened
nearly 20 years ago, but it offers an insight into how AI-enabled
systems or automated tools on the battlefield will affect the kinds of
errors that happen in war. Today, human decisionmaking is shifting
toward machines. With this shift comes the potential to reduce human
error, but also to introduce new and novel types of mistakes. Where
humans might have once misidentified a civilian as a combatant,
computers are expected to step in and provide more accurate judgment.
Across a range of military functions, from the movement of autonomous
planes and cars to identifying tanks on a battlefield, computers are
expected to provide quick, accurate decisions. But the embrace of AI in
military applications also comes with immense risk. New systems
introduce the possibility of new types of error, and understanding how
autonomous machines will fail is important when crafting policy for
buying and overseeing this new generation of autonomous weapons. What
went wrong in 2003 [The Patriot missile began development in the 1960s,
when the U.S. Army sought a means to reliably shoot down enemy
airplanes. Later, the missile would gain the ability to also intercept
other missiles,]{.underline} and as the roles assigned to the missile
expanded, its autonomous capabilities increased. Patriot [missile
batteries use a phased array radar to detect and identify
targets]{.underline}. This information is then fed into a computer
control station to manage how the missiles are launched in response.
Once fired, the missiles fly toward an identified intercept point
calculated before firing, directions that can be altered by sending
updated sensor readings over radio signal to the fired missile. As it
approaches for impact, the missile's own radar tracks the
target[.]{.underline} Raytheon, which manufactures the Patriot, has
described the system as having "automated operations" with
"man-in-the-loop (human) override" capabilities---technology that allows
the weapon to quickly engage targets with the necessary speed to carry
out its missile defense mission. Automation is a compelling feature for
an anti-air and, especially, for an anti-missile system. [The
calculations involved in shooting down aircraft and missiles are hard
and require immediate translation of sensor information. Both
interceptors and targets are traveling exceptionally fast]{.underline}.
It's the kind of task in which the involvement of a human introduces
lag, slows down the process, and makes it less likely a missile is going
to successfully shoot down an incoming projectile or aircraft. But human
operators also serve an essential role: preventing accidental, incorrect
shootdowns. And this requires a balance between human and machine
decisionmaking that is difficult to achieve. When [the Pentagon
investigated the causes of the Tornado shootdown, as well as two other
incidents of friendly fire involving Patriot systems, the missile
system's **automated** functions were identified as contributing factors
in misidentifying friend as foe. U.S. Patriot batteries deployed to Iraq
under the assumption that they would face heavy **missile**
attacks]{.underline}, which would require the batteries to operate with
a relative degree of autonomy in order to respond with sufficient speed.
As a 2005 report by the Defense Science Board Task Force on the Patriot
system's performance observed, operating autonomously required U.S.
forces to trust that the automated features of the system were
functioning properly. So when the assumptions underlying the decision to
allow the Patriot system to autonomously identify and sometimes fire on
targets no longer applied, the soldiers operating the system were not in
a position to question what the weapon's sensors were telling them. Had
U.S. and coalition forces faced heavy missile attacks in the war,
automating such defenses would have made more sense. Instead, U.S. and
allied forces quickly established air superiority, enough to drastically
shift the balance of what was in the sky. Instead of facing large
amounts of incoming missiles, [[Patriot batteries were observing **large
numbers of allied planes operating** in the sky above them and sometimes
**struggling** to identify friend from foe]{.underline}]{.mark}.
According to the Defense Science Board's task force, the first 30 days
of combat in Iraq saw nine ballistic missile attacks that Patriot
batteries might have been expected to counter, compared to 41,000
aircraft sorties, amounting to a "4,000-to-1 friendly-to-enemy ratio."
Picking out the correct targets against the background of a large number
of potential false positives proved highly challenging.

Bayraktar TB2, which can carry 4 MAM-L and MAM-C missiles produced by
Roketsan [on its wings, has the ability to perform precise targeting
with its built-in laser target marker]{.underline}. While the Turkish
Armed Forces describes Bayraktar as \"Tactical UAV Class\" to prevent it
from being a competitor to the TAI Anka UAV, [[international

Bayraktar is capable of flying at 22,500 feet and loitering for more
than 24 hours. A highly sophisticated design that provides all solutions
that operator may need in one integrated system. [The system consists of

[[Drones have changed the battlefield]{.mark}, providing additional
situation awareness and the ability to strike targets, but [their high
success rates in the Ukraine war is a result of unique conditions
unlikely to be replicated elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unmanned
combat aerial vehicles (UCAV) such as the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 have
been successful in the Russian-Ukrainian war and helped prevent the
Ukrainian defenses from crumbling under the initial Russian onslaught.
[The [absence of]{.mark} short-range air defenses ([SHORAD]{.mark}) in
the initial months of the war [gave drones free
range]{.mark}.]{.underline} But [four months later, man-portable
air-defense systems (**[MANPADS]{.mark}**) like the US-manufactured
Stinger, its Russian counterpart the SA-25, and other air defense
systems, [are bringing **down** drones]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Air
defenses can as easily target larger, slow-moving drones such as TB2
Bayraktar just like other slow moving aerial targets such as helicopters
and transport aircraft. [Drones have additional points of
**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They require frequent radio
contact with their operator, and most need close-to-constant
communication. These comms channels were largely undisturbed in the
early stages of the war, but that has not lasted --- both sides are
increasingly capable of executing electronic warfare attacks to degrade
or deny the drone operators' radio links. The [connection between
operator and drone is a single point of failure, which, if attacked with
electronic warfare, can render the drones useless on the
battlefield]{.underline}. [[The Russians are trying to **imitate** the
Ukrainian drone success,]{.mark} but [they too face the same **issue**
since the Ukrainians are becoming more capable of electronic
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Naturally, there will be large
patches of the battlefield where electronic warfare is absent (as with
this filmed Ukrainian attack on a Russian oil refinery), but this will
change over time and as the fight develops. [The next step will be to
locate the electronic warfare units, seeking their spectrum and
electronic signatures, so that they can be located and struck. This
ability to hit electronic warfare units is an additional argument for
supplying Ukraine with advanced long-range rocket artillery, which can
be used for this purpose.]{.underline} While there has perhaps been too
much enthusiasm for the drone, there have been too many obituaries
written for the tank. [The success of drone warfare, starting with the
war in Nagorno-Karabach in 2020 to today's war in Ukraine may give the
appearance that the military environment has radically changed and that
armored vehicles are as much used as armored cavalry]{.underline} It is
true that the Ukraine war has seen enormous losses of Russian tanks
(almost 800 confirmed, plus the loss of another 3,500 armored vehicles,
though the real number is believed to be far higher) against lighter
Ukrainian forces using modern antitank missiles spying out the
battlefield with small, cheap commercial drones. Ukrainian forces have
used Javelin and the Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW) to
destroy hundreds of tanks -- most of these crews never had the chance
even to react to what eventually killed them. Such destruction has
triggered questions about the relevance of tanks on the modern
battlefield. This is not new. [Earlier [challenges to tanks led to
**adaptation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first time the tank was widely
considered obsolete was the Yom-Kippur War of 1973, where Israeli tanks
suffered heavily in the initial phases of the war. Israeli
counterattacks after the Egyptians crossed into the Sinai peninsula were
costly. The Soviets had provided the Egyptians with wire-guided AT-3
Sagger antitank missiles that could strike an armored target up to 3km
(2 miles.) The AT-3 missile itself was no surprise for Israel or NATO.
Designed and in Soviet service since the early 1960s, it was well-known
to foreign observers, but it wasn't until 1973 that it was employed at
large scale in wartime. Armies adapted with increased integration
between artillery, infantry, and armor. The second challenge to the
tank's relevance came in the late-1970s and early 1980s when NATO needed
a response to the huge tank armies of the Warsaw Pact armies. The answer
was the tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided (TOW) antitank
missile, which was considered the ultimate tank killer and was widely
distributed among NATO forces and on different platforms. Attack
helicopters and the Fairchild Republic A-10 Warthog airplane were
designed to strike Soviet armored echelons from above. Finally, in
operation Desert Storm in 1991, the coalition to liberate Kuwait tested
these antitank concepts' lethality by unleashing them on Saddam
Hussein's forces. The Iraqis lost more than 3,000 tanks and 2,500
armored vehicles in a limited number of days. The absolute annihilation
of the retreating Iraqi armored forces along Highway 80 is a grim
reminder of the destructive consequences. In an effort to offset these
threats, tanks were equipped with "active armor," comprising plates of
explosive material that degrade the impact from the kinetic impact of a
shape charge explosive warhead. Many forces also introduced short-range
air defense units to be integrated with their armored units to defend
against ground attack aircraft and helicopters. The high losses of
Russian tanks in Ukraine are partly related to the flawed design of the
Soviet T-72 design where the crew sits surrounded by 22 rounds of
ammunition to feed its automatic loader. The T-72 was designed for
another battlefield; during the Cold War, it was intended to charge
westward towards the Rhine and maximize forward firepower with little
concern for crew survivability or protection from being hit from the
side. Russian tactics have also been very strange. Deprived of covering
infantry or access to artillery support, unsupported tanks became almost
an invitation for Ukrainian troops to inflict maximum damage in the
early stages of the war. The Russians have now adjusted their tactics.
Ukrainians of course will face a similar problem in using the same
flawed tank design, since it too has T-72s and other Russian models. Yet
this actually presents the West with a major opportunity to change the
picture on the battlefield. By supplying modern Western tanks offering
much higher survivability for the crew and the tank against artillery,
and enemy antitank weapons, it could supply Ukraine with the firepower
needed to launch a counteroffensive. Russia is now deploying 50-year-old
tanks into the fight from long-term storage, vehicles that only have
combat value if used against unsupported infantry. It hopes to use these
obsolete tanks to shore up its defensive positions around Kharkiv and
Kherson against a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Any mothballed NATO tank
from the 1990s or early 2000s will outperform this Russian armor, and
would be devastating against it. Germany's blocking of Spain's desire to
provide Leopard 2s is, therefore, a direct threat to the war's
pro-democratic strategic outcome. A counteroffensive needs protected
firepower that can follow the maneuvering units. [Tanks **fill** that
role to support mechanized and light infantry in their forward movement.
Post-1990, modern [**Western tanks have improved sensors and targeting
syste**ms]{.mark}, the later versions with laser range finders and
thermal imaging. Electronic warfare cannot intercept a tank round; once
it is on its way, the round will continue until it hits (anti-projectile
systems, like Israel's Trophy, are now appearing but remain rare.)
Properly used, tanks remain a key system on the frontlines]{.underline}.
Advanced armored vehicles (many of which now sit in Western storage
facilities) have the power to turn the military tide. [The pretense by
democratic countries that supplying tanks to Ukraine is escalation, is
simply fatuous[. It is time to **dust** them down and send them
eastwards.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Gendered Stereotypes

Recently, concerns about weapons technology and "postmodern" war have
come to the fore, and with them a crosspollination of particular
feminist critiques between disciplines (Gray 1997; Wilcox 2009;
Blanchard 2011; Manjikan 2013). I follow this trend here. As the vision
of the [humanoid robot fighter]{.underline} I am working from is one
[that is both physically humanoid and]{.underline} artificially
intelligent [([AI]{.mark}),]{.underline} we must look to how [both the
body and the artificial mind [are constructed]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[the [gendered assumptions]{.mark} and practices [involved]{.mark} in
eac]{.underline}h. As to the physical body, I have already argued that
[designers of the DRC [robots]{.mark} are [explicitly and **implicitly**
gendering t]{.mark}heir machines]{.underline}. A [weapon becomes an
artificially intelligent learning machine through its software
[architecture]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are two ways of considering
how a gendered AI would arise: one where the [programmers]{.underline}
believe [[they are creating a **genderless** AI]{.mark} but it emerges
**[gendered]{.mark}**, an]{.underline}d one [where they purposefully
create a gendered AI]{.underline}. Let us refer to the first as the
Unintended Case and to the second as the Intended Case. The Unintended
Case is one in which software designers, programmers or engineers
(hereafter "programmers") believe that they are creating AIs that are
merely learning machines. [Programmers]{.underline} are concerned with
[creating an AI that can fight effectively, reduce the monetary and
manpower costs of war]{.underline} and extend the military's and
warfighter's range. [Gender has nothing to do with it.]{.underline} To
reach these goals, [[programmers]{.mark} must [find]{.mark} a way to
make the [warbot]{.mark} [capable]{.mark} of]{.underline}:
[[reasoning]{.underline}]{.mark} about its goals (and perhaps creating
its own goals or subgoals); [[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}; learning
from its experiences and thus formulating
[[memories]{.underline}]{.mark} from which to draw;
[[understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} communications through [natural
[language]{.mark}]{.underline} (as opposed to symbolic language);
perceiving the world around it through its
[[sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}; and [moving]{.underline} and
[[manipulating]{.underline}]{.mark} objects, including but not limited
to objects in the battlespace and its own weapons.14 They are attempting
to make the [warbot intelligent in order]{.underline} to be capable of
"doing things that would require intelligence if done by men" (Minsky
1968, v). To reach this goal, prog[rammers can draw]{.underline} from a
variety of existing software [programming]{.underline} techniques, such
as creating [[symbolic **systems**]{.underline}]{.mark}, sub-symbolic
systems or using statistical methods.15 Within each of these approaches
there are also a variety of types, but for present purposes I will limit
the discussion to the broader classes to show how gendered knowledge is
transmitted into the system. A programmer working with a symbolic system
will begin from a sufficiently large dataset (Adam 1998; Storrs Hall
2007). The general idea behind this approach is that an AI can simulate
the problem-solving capacities of human minds, such as through searching
for a solution by way of deduction (through logic), or reasoning by way
of analogy or example when there is no general inference from logical
predicates. The [programmer]{.underline} provides [a large dataset of
"facts" and writes in a "fixed set of concepts"]{.underline} to the
software architecture [from which the AI can draw]{.underline} when
confronted with a task or problem. For a warbot, this will of course
mean [a very complex set of factors and concepts]{.underline}, as it
will [require not merely information about its potential physical
environment]{.underline} (e.g. hill, valley, road, building, stairs) but
also more abstract concepts such as combatant and noncombatant. The base
knowledge provided and the process by which it is accessed is key. What
"facts" or pieces of information go into the database will affect the
actions of the machine. If a data point or "piece" is not present, there
is no opportunity for it to get there. An AI might be able to rearrange
existing bits of information to combine them into new insights, but it
will never generate something outside of its existing set of information
structures. There is a gatekeeping function present in the construction
of all symbolic representations. As Adam (1998) notes, "A formal system,
in other words a computer system, is a political choice to maintain
existing power structures" (108).16 To bring this back to gendered
warbots, [if [programmers decide that "**child**]{.mark}" as an
[object]{.mark}]{.underline} or
**[[representation]{.underline}]{.mark}** can never be paired with
"**[[combatant]{.underline}]{.mark}**," then the
[[machine]{.underline}]{.mark} will **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** be
capable of [identifying child soldiers]{.underline}. Moreover, [[what
**constitutes** "child]{.mark}" will have to be [represented in some
way]{.mark}]{.underline}. The process by which such
"[knowledge]{.underline}" is represented [is thus crucial]{.underline}.
As Adam (1998) explains, the problem about deciding "what sort of
objects there are in the world" becomes another problem about [knowledge
about "facts]{.underline}," and ho[w a knowledge base about "facts" is
recreated within a system of pure]{.underline}ly propositional
[knowledge]{.underline}" (39).17 The purely propositional knowledge
approach is open to all of the feminist critiques from feminist
epistemology, in particular, that there is some sort of Truth about
which the facts must correspond and that knowledge derived from skills
(such as a "knowing how") is not real knowledge (Adam 1998, 114).
[Warfighting is as much an art as it is a science]{.underline}, and so
prohibiting this kind of [embodied]{.underline} or practical
[knowledge]{.underline} would appear to [undermine the ability of a
warbot to fight effectively]{.underline}. The most pressing problem for
symbolic systems, however, comes from the direction of analogical
reasoning. Faced with the certainty [that [warbots]{.mark} will
encounter [complex situation]{.mark}s, which they [cannot]{.mark} have
prior **[knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} of, they will require some
[mechanism to abstract the situation t]{.underline}o one about which
they do have some higher order representation. This is done by way of
analogy. A program will have to break down the situation into smaller
objects that it can represent, and then it will search its database for
something that is analogous where the concepts are equivalent or
appropriate. To find such an abstract analogy, [the [AI uses
stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Adam 1998, 39).18 Programmers may not
readily admit to this, claiming that "the important thing is to break
the overall experience reflected in the memory into composable
regularities" (Storrs Hall 2007, 221). "Composable regularities" might
be that all hills are convex physical structures, but they might also be
that "[all [women speak with a high voice" or "all combatants are men
between 18 and 35]{.mark}]{.underline}." Reasoning by analogy [is a
**heuristic** that humans employ when they are being cognitive
miser]{.underline}s and is [not appropriate for complex situations
requiring critical thought]{.underline}.

#### They cannot regulate their way out of gendered warbots

**Roff, 16** \[Heather M. Roff works for the global security imitative

Finally, one might claim my arguments here are overstated. Some might
argue that the gender of the warbot is the least of our issues. I think,
however, that this objection [misses the larger problems of **gendered**
humanoid warbots]{.underline}. First, there is [no ostensibly good
reason to create **masculinist** humanoid robot figh]{.underline}ters.
If [[their]{.mark} function [were to **instill** terror]{.mark} and [be
**effective** fighters]{.mark}]{.underline}, a variety of [biomimetic
robots [would be far **superior** in this task]{.mark}]{.underline} and
easier from a design standpoint. One could imagine a [giant robot spider
[easily **maneuvering** around debris]{.mark}, as well as being
generally **[terrifying]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Dvorsky 2014). Second,
the [[gendering of a humanoid warbot]{.mark} is a **[conscious]{.mark}**
political decision to perpetuate practices of
**[domination]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We have ample work from feminist
philosophy, feminist IR and feminist security studies that shows the
wide-ranging impact of such a decision. I[mplications will extend to
areas such as [**targeting** decisions]{.mark} during [war]{.mark}, to
leadership positions in government offices or to ideals of a republican
citizenry.]{.underline} We must be critical of the beginnings of this
process, for if Sjoberg (2013) is correct, and [[gender is "not just
**in** war]{.mark} and/or our theories of it, [but is **fundamental** to
them]{.mark}, [**legitimating** of them]{.mark}, and [**inseparable**
from]{.mark} them"]{.underline} (13--14), [then gendered humanoid
[warbots]{.mark} will impact **[how]{.mark}** we fight,
**[when]{.mark}** we fight [and **who** we fight.]{.mark}]{.underline}

researcher based in London. He has worked as a Legal Associate in
immigration and asylum law, where he assisted with the preparation of

 [**COMPLEXITY IN** REGULATING **AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS**]{.underline}

The first problem with regulating LAWS [under existing legal frameworks
lies in assessing proportionality.]{.underline} The **[principle of
proportionality]{.underline}**, codified in article 51(5)(b) of
[Additional Protocol
I](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750065) prohibits "any
attack which may be expected to [cause incidental loss of
life]{.underline}, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a
combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the
concrete and direct military advantage anticipated". Bombing an entire
building in order to kill one sniper, for example, would be
disproportionate, due to collateral damage outweighing any military
advantage. Two problems are raised by LAWS in this context. Firstly**,
[clarity is required about the assessment at the "time of
attack]{.underline}**[".]{.underline} It is unclear whether "time of
attack" [refers to the moment when the weapon is deployed]{.underline},
or the moment when the anticipated use of force occurs, which might be
days or weeks later. This raises the second problem[. If the time of
attack is separate from the moment when the weapon is
deployed]{.underline}, [how can commanders "reasonably
determine]{.underline}" [collateral damage]{.underline} and military
advantage that "may be expected" to result from an attack, given their
limited insight into the eventual attack? The fact that LAWS, by
definition, carry out attacks without human supervision threatens to
undermine the key principles of IHL, which are founded on an assumption
of human assessments of proportionality. The principle of
proportionality is essential in determining whether an attack was
unjustified and in delivering justice for victims of war. The [**nature
of LAWS' deployment** essentially **muddies the water**s and makes this
a **vague** and nebulous **exercise.**]{.underline} The second major
problem with **[regulating LAWS]{.underline}** is the **[accountability
gap]{.underline}**. Accountability facilitates the punishment of
unlawful acts and aims to deter the commission of future ones. It gives
victims the satisfaction that there has been retribution and promotes
reconciliation. International humanitarian law and international human
rights law mandate personal accountability for war crimes. **[Given the
importance of accountability for the delivery of justice in times of
warfare, how are we to attribute blame to a machine]{.underline}**?
[These weapons have the potential to commit criminal acts for which **no
one would be responsible**]{.underline}. Any attempt to accord
responsibility to human operatives or manufacturers is thwarted by their
distance from the criminal act itself. Furthermore, even if the law was
amended to encompass such machines, a [judgment would **not fulfil the
purposes of punishment for a victim of a war crime**]{.underline}. A
machine cannot be deterred nor be "punished" in any meaningful sense.

### Perm 

Note: This assumes the mechanism of the plan is to maintain meaningful
human control.

#### Perm do the counterplan. Including [meaningful]{.underline} human control is a way to mitigate the [autonomy]{.underline} of the weapon.

It should be noted up front that the term LAWS itself is problematic.
After all, neither "lethality" nor "autonomy" are decisive factors in
the debate. The military application of non-lethal force raises concerns
as well (take the prohibition against blinding lasers as just one
example), and the term "autonomy", philosophically speaking,
inappropriately anthropomorphizes machines that have limited agency and
are incapable of reasoning and reflecting, as well as being unable to
take on responsibility. Nonetheless, at this point the term LAWS is
widely used as a shorthand, so the article will stick to this common
vocabulary. Also, [the article uses the term "**[regulation]{.mark}**"
-- rather than, for instance, "**ban**" -- because what potential new,
binding international law on this issue [is]{.mark} commonly
[understoo]{.mark}]{.underline}[d]{.mark} to eventually codify is not a
prohibition of a category of weapons. Instead, it is a positive
obligation [[to retain **meaningful** human control]{.mark}
[over]{.mark} the use of [military force]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And
while one might argue that ensuring meaningful human control and
prohibiting autonomous weapons (AKA "killer robots") are two sides of
the same coin, these two sides nevertheless represent different ways of
approaching the issue, as I will argue further below.]{.underline}
Lastly, I use the term "technology diffusion" rather than
"proliferation" because the latter suggests a distribution from one or
only a few points of departure (as in the case of nuclear proliferation)
whereas the former suggests an omnidirectional spread from multiple
sources, a more fitting picture in this case of widely (and oftentimes
even commercially) available hardware and software.

https://breakingdefense.com/2019/03/should-we-ban-killer-robots-can-we/\]/ISEE

UPDATED with Russell rebuttal WASHINGTON: We now live in a world where a
Campaign To Stop Killer Robots is a deadly serious thing, officially
endorsed by 26 national governments. (28, if you count Palestine and the
Vatican). China is on that list, albeit with a huge asterisk: It wants
to ban only the use of "lethal autonomous weapons systems," not
research, development and production. (After all, Beijing has an
enormously ambitious plan to dominate AI by 2030.) The US is not on the
list of countries who want to ban killer robots. Nor is Russia. Nor is
the UK, nor are any of our leading allies. Should we be? Robert Work
There's a strong argument that the US has already sworn off "killer
robots." Civilian officials and military leaders alike have said for
years the US will always keep a "human in the loop" for any use of
lethal force. There is a waiver provision in Pentagon policy, but no
one's ever used it. Plus arms control is a hard sell in Washington these
days. The US has finally abandoned the landmark INF Treaty after years
of futilely complaining about well documented Russian violations. "The
Department of Defense has no intention.... to go after what are now
called 'lethal autonomous weapons systems,\'" says Bob Work, who as
deputy secretary of defense under Obama did more than any other person
to push the Pentagon to embrace AI. "What commander would want that?"
But there's a contradiction here, argues Stuart Russell, a Berkeley AI
scientist and activist. "At present, the US is opposed to discussions on
a Lethal Autonomous Weapons System treaty, while officially claiming not
to be developing LAWS," Russell told me. "This amounts to military
suicide," he argued: If you won't build a new weapon yourself, why leave
potential adversaries free to pursue it? The cynical answer, of course
is that a ban would be so difficult to enforce it would only create a
sense of false security. But might it have real benefits? XQ-58A
Valkyrie "loyal wingman" drone, built by Kratos for Air Force Research
Lab Benefits of a Ban? Russell emphasizes he doesn't oppose all military
uses of artificial intelligence, only AI that can kill without a human
authorizing each attack. And if the US did agree to a ban on lethal
artificial intelligence, it would make it much easier for computer
scientists and engineers to work with their Pentagon on those other
kinds of military AI, Russell argued, [just as the Biological Weapons
Convention let biologists develop defenses against germ warfare without
fear]{.underline} their work would be perverted for offense. (In the US,
that is. The Soviet Union massively violated the BWC, which had no
inspection mechanism: just ask around about Bio Preparat and Ken
Alibek). Stuart Russell "[Having a **[ban]{.mark}** in place [would make
it]{.mark} much **[easier]{.mark}** [to develop]{.mark} ATLAS-like
**[tech]{.mark}nologies** [that can **protect** soldiers'
lives]{.mark},"]{.underline} Russell said, citing an Army program to use
AI to assist in aiming and targeting (but not firing) weapons. "Quite
possibly there would have been much less pushback against Project Maven
at Google, because researchers would have some assurance that the
technology would not be used in autonomous weapons. There would be a big
steel gate closing off the slippery slope." Certainly, US civilian and
military leaders insist, over and over, they want a "human in the loop"
at all times for reasons both ethical and tactical. "The last thing I
want is you to go away from this thinking this is all about technology,"
Work said during a speech on his AI push back in 2015. "[The number one
[advantage we have is]{.mark} the people in uniform, in our civilian
work force, in our defense industrial base, and the contractors who
**[support]{.mark}** us."]{.underline} If Russia or China decide to take
their people out of the loop and rely on automation alone, [Work argued,
then we can beat them with our [**combination** of humans]{.mark} plus
machines --- [creativity and calculation, **intuition** and
precision]{.mark}]{.underline}. Then there's the ethical aspect ---
which also ties to the military's deep cultural need to control the
chaos of battle as much as possible. "The commander who uses a lethal
autonomous weapons system that chooses its own target \[is\] delegating
for his culpability for a law-of-war violation to a free-willed
machine," Work said at CNAS. "I've never talked to any commander in the
West who's said, 'hey, that's a real good idea.'" [So if the [US
military **doesn't** really **want** lethal AI]{.mark}, should we ban
it? W]{.underline}ell, one former defense official told me, that depends
on what kind of AI you mean. What Work and other national security
insiders are objecting to is an AI that can choose and revise its own
objectives --- in rough terms, what scientists mean when they talk about
artificial general intelligence. US military leaders are not objecting
to so-called narrow AI that can only perform certain pre-defined tasks:
shoot down incoming missiles (which the Navy's Aegis, not even an AI,
can do already), for example, or hear a rifle fire, instantly calculate
a return trajectory, and kill the sniper before he gets off a second
shot. A drone's eye view of the target in the anti-lethal AI video
"Slaughterbots" Even a swarm of drones that hunt and kill specific
individuals --- one of Russell's nightmare scenarios --- would count as
narrow AI, at least as long as human beings drew up the target list. (An
AI that decides for itself who needs to die, perhaps based on a big-data
analysis of terror suspects, might still not qualify as general AI, but
it would give most generals a heart attack). And a drone that can
recognize a "high value target" on sight, then kill him with three grams
of explosives to the face, may be less likely to kill civilians by
accident than human beings watching a long-distance video feed, then
launching a Hellfire with a 20-pound warhead. UPDATE "This strategy of
saying it's not really autonomous unless it's
conscious/superhuman/mysterious is just a deflection tactic," Russell
told me after the original version of this article appeared. A "narrow"
AI, he argued, is quite capable of carrying out genocidal orders ---
like killing every light/dark-skinned adult male --- or making
catastrophic errors --- like mistaking children for adults --- and
repeating them with mindless efficiency long after a human would have
starting asking questions. "I don't think we should declare we will
never use a lethal artificial narrow intelligence weapon, designed for
specific battlefield missions," the former defense official said. As for
general AI, "we should debate whether or not we should pursue such a
weapon, and if the answer is no, we should state it as policy." What
about an international treaty banning lethal AI, which would have the
force of law? "Such a treaty would be very difficult to monitor and
enforce," the official said. "That doesn't mean an international treaty
should be ruled out." Inspectors from the Organisation for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a potential model for the
monitoring of military AI. The Enforcement Problem "Autonomous weapons
have all of the features that make arms control hard," said Paul
Scharre, a former Army Ranger, now at CNAS, who worked on the current
Pentagon policy. International inspectors can't tell by looking at an
unmanned tank, plane, or warship whether it's programmed to ask a human
for permission before opening fire. Even if they get to see the actual
code --- a security breach few countries would allow --- "there's
nothing to stop you from upgrading the software as soon as the
inspectors leave," he told me. Paul Scharre "Having said that," Scharre
continued, "I think that the kind of arms control that Stuart Russell is
advocating for is actually more feasible." If someone's building vast
swarms of lethal mini-drones, you don't have to see the code to know
they have to be fully autonomous: There's no practical way, Scharre told
me, for humans to review and approve "a million targets." Conversely,
such mini-drones are only truly threatening in vast numbers. "A country
or an individual... might be able to build a few hundred of these,"
Scharre said, "but if you're going to build millions of them, there's no
way to hide that." So how would you find them? [The best [model]{.mark}
is probably the [**Chemical Weapons Convention**,]{.mark} which, unlike
many other treaties --- the Biological Weapons Convention, the landmine
ban, and so on --- [has a robust **enforcement**
mechanism]{.mark}.]{.underline} The scope of the problem is similar[.
Lethal chemicals like chlorine and phosgene are widely used in
legitimate industry]{.underline}, so you can't ban them outright any
more than mini-drones; they're relatively easy to turn into weapons,
again like drones; and yet only rogue states like Syria and Iraq have
used them since the end of World War I. [Much of the [reason]{.mark}
[militaries abandoned poison gas is]{.mark} that a weapon that blows
with the wind is [hard to control]{.mark} --- yet another
[similari]{.mark}ty with [AI]{.mark},]{.underline} since even "narrow"
machine-learning algorithms modify themselves in ways beyond human
understanding. But there is also a robust monitoring regime, run by the
Organisation to Prevent Chemical Weapons, which has about 250 inspectors
who can rapidly respond to reported violations. Such "challenge
inspections" are a crucial tool, said Irakli Beridze, a Georgian-born
veteran of both OPCW and the UNICRI chem, bio, radiological, & nuclear
program --- with service in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria --- who
now runs the Centre for AI & Robotics at UNICRI, the United Nations
Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute. (Beridze emphasized
he was only expressing his personal opinion as an expert, not as a UN
official). Mini-drone production would be easier to hide than chemical
plants --- for one thing, it doesn't stink like a lot of toxic chemicals
[--- but investigative techniques have advanced since the CWC entered
into force in 1997. It might **even** be [possible]{.mark}]{.underline},
Beridze said, [[to set an AI to **catch** an AI]{.mark}: use artificial
intelligence to crunch big data --- social media or parts orders, for
example --- and correlate subtle clues no human inspector could
catch.]{.underline} Irakli Beridze Robust inspections, however, are only
one part of the solution, he told me. Countries need not only to sign
the treaty but use their own intelligence agencies and domestic law
enforcement to watch for violations. [And, after initial reluctance in
the private sector, "[buy-in and participation of]{.mark} the chemical
industry... [was absolutely essential," he]{.mark} said. "Otherwise this
treaty would not work." Once [compliance became a norm in the]{.mark}
chemical industry, in large part because of the [moral stigma]{.mark}
that attached to chemical weapons, it became [much harder to produce
poison gas in militarily significant amounts]{.mark}. Given widespread
[anxiety in the tech community about lethal AI, it]{.mark} should be
**[possible]{.mark}** to reach a similar [consensus]{.mark} among drone
manufacturers --- eventually]{.underline}. Getting private industry, law
enforcement, and national governments on board, even simply making them
aware of the problem, would take years. "We don't have too much time,"
Beridze warned. In a few years, "[we will have a widespread technology
where criminals can use small drones \[for\] mass terrorist attacks,
assassinations, contract killing, you name it."]{.underline} Emerging
threats and complex challenges to situational awareness require a next
generation of sensor systems. While it's comforting to imagine that US
hardware will only be directed at terrorists and Iranian threats,
"Bahrain's history of suppressing internal dissent with external
weaponry suggests that these choppers may end up serving a police
function during times of crisis, as well."

### War/Conflict

#### Negative turns are nonsense and should be assigned zero risk- even the head of the DOD AI program says no to autonomous nuclear weapons 

**Klare, PhD, 20**

April)

[The quest to]{.underline} further [automate]{.underline} key elements
of the U.S. [NC3 architecture is being driven]{.underline} largely [by
an altered perception of the global threat environment]{.underline}.
Although the existing framework was always intended to provide
decisionmakers with prompt warning of enemy nuclear attack and to
operate even under conditions of nuclear war, the operational challenges
faced by that system have grown more severe in recent years. Most
notably, the decision-making system is threatened by the ever-increasing
destructive capacity of conventional weapons, the growing sophistication
of cyberattacks, and, as a result of those two, the growing speed of
combat. The existing NC3 architecture was designed in the previous
century to detect enemy ICBM and bomber launches and provide
decision-makers with enough time, as much as 30 minutes in the case of
ICBM attacks, to assess the accuracy of launch warnings and still ponder
appropriate responses. These systems did not always work as
intended---the history of the Cold War is replete with false warnings of
enemy attacks---but the cushion of time prevented a major catastrophe.2
The reasonably clear distinction between conventional and nuclear
weapons, moreover, enabled military analysts to avoid confusing
non-nuclear assaults with possibly nuclear ones. With the introduction
of increasingly capable conventional weapons, however, the distinction
between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons is being blurred. Many of the
new conventionally armed (but possibly nuclear-capable) ballistic
missiles now being developed by the major powers are capable of
hypersonic speed (more than five times the speed of sound) and of flying
more than 500 kilometers (the limit imposed by the now-defunct
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty) and are intended for attacks
on high-value enemy targets, such as air defense radars and
command-and-control facilities. [With flight durations of as little as
five minutes, [defensive NC3 systems have]{.mark} precious [little time
to determine whether incoming missiles are]{.mark}]{.underline} armed
with [[nuclear]{.mark} or conventional]{.underline} missiles and to
select an appropriate response, possibly including the early use of
nuclear weapons.3 [Cybercombat occurs at an even faster
speed]{.underline}, potentially depriving nuclear commanders of critical
information and communication links in a time of crisis and thereby
precipitating inadvertent escalation.4 In the highly contested
environment envisioned by the 2018 NPR report, decision-makers may be
faced with an overload of inconclusive information and have mere minutes
in which to grasp the essential reality and decide on humanity's fate.
[Under these circumstances]{.underline}, some [[analysts
argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, increased NC3 [automation will prove
essential]{.underline}. They claim that increased reliance on [[AI can
help with]{.mark} two]{.underline} of the existing system's most [acute
challenges: [information overload and time
compression]{.mark}]{.underline}. With ever more sensors, (satellite
monitors, ground radars, and surveillance aircraft) feeding intelligence
into battle management systems, commanders are being inundated with
information on enemy actions, preventing prompt and considered
decision-making. At the same time, the use of more hypersonic missiles
and advanced cyberweaponry has compressed the time in which such
decisions must be made. AI could help overcome these challenges by
sifting through the incoming data at lightning speed and highlighting
the most important results and by distinguishing false warnings of
nuclear attack from genuine ones.5 Automation could be even more useful,
advocates claim, in helping commanders, up to and including the
president, decide on nuclear and non-nuclear responses to confirmed
indications of an enemy attack. With little time to act, human
decision-makers could receive a menu of possible options devised by
algorithms. "As the complexity of AI systems matures," the Congressional
Research Service noted in 2019, "AI algorithms may also be capable of
providing commanders with a menu of viable courses of action based on
real-time analysis of the battle-space, in turn enabling faster
adaptation to complex events."6 Some analysts have gone even further,
suggesting that [[in]{.mark} conditions of [extreme time compression,
the machines could]{.mark} be empowered to select the optimal response
and **[initiate the attack themselves]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
"Attack-time compression has placed America's senior leadership in a
situation where the existing NC3 system may not act rapidly enough,"
Adam [Lowther and]{.underline} Curtis [McGiffin wrote in a
commentary]{.underline} at War on the Rocks, a security-oriented
website. "Thus, [it may be necessary to develop]{.underline} a system
based on \[[AI]{.underline}\], with predetermined response decisions,
that detects, decides, and directs strategic forces with such speed that
the attack-time compression challenge does not place the United States
in an impossible position."7 [That commentary provoked]{.underline}
widespread alarm [about the possible loss of **human control over
decisions of nuclear use.**]{.underline} [Even]{.underline} some
[military officials expressed concern]{.underline} over such notions.
"[[You will find no stronger proponent of]{.mark} integration of
[AI]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities [writ large into]{.underline} the
Department of [Defense," [said]{.mark}]{.underline} Lieutenant
[[General]{.underline}]{.mark} Jack [[Shanahan]{.underline}]{.mark},
director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), at a
September 2019 conference at Georgetown University, "**[[but there is
one area where I pause]{.mark}, and it has to do with [nuclear command
and control]{.mark}.]{.underline}**" [Referring to the article's
assertion that an automated U.S. nuclear launch ability is needed, he
said, "I read that. And my immediate answer is**, '[No. We do
not]{.mark}.**'"8 Shanahan indicated that his organization was moving to
integrate AI technologies into a wide array of non-nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}, including command-and-control functions.
Indeed, JAIC and other military components are moving swiftly to develop
automated command-and-control systems and to ready them for use by
regular combat forces. [Initially, these systems will be employed by
conventional forces, but [the Pentagon fully **intends to merge them
over time with their nuclear counterparts**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Maintaining human control over nuclear decisions is crucial to peace**

(Michael T., SecurityStudies@hampshireEmeritus,

April)

[Given these]{.underline} multiple [risks]{.underline}, U[.S.
policymakers and their Chinese and Russian counterparts should be **very
leery of accelerating NC3 automation**]{.underline}. Indeed, [Shanahan
acknowledged as much, saying nuclear command and control "is the
**ultimate human decision** that needs to be made.... We have to be very
careful," especially given "the immaturity of technology
today."]{.underline} **[Exercising prudence]{.underline}** [in applying
AI to nuclear command and control is the responsibility,]{.underline}
first and foremost, of [national leaders of the countries
involved]{.underline}. In the United States, military officials have
pledged to expose all new AI applications to rigorous testing, but
Congress needs to play a more active role in overseeing these endeavors
and questioning the merits of proposed innovations. At the same time,
all three nuclear powers would benefit from mutual consultations over
the perils inherent in increased NC3 automation and what technical steps
might be taken to reduce the risk of inadvertent or accidental war. This
could occur as an independent venture or in the context of the irregular
strategic stability talks held by senior U.S. and Russian
representatives. [There is no more fateful decision a leader can make
than to order the use of nuclear weapons. Ideally, such a decision will
never have to be made. But so long as nuclear weapons exist, **humans,
not machines, must exercise ultimate control over their
use**.]{.underline}

Public Communication and Information Warfare

[The architecture, procedures, and policies on which the current U.S.
NC3 system depends were developed to optimize security, speed, and
secrecy, not public scrutiny and confidence]{.underline}. That
confidence was assumed as the citizenry and their congressional
representatives largely deferred to presidential authority in this
domain and entrusted the military with wide-ranging responsibilities of
execution and communication. Cloaked in secrecy, the public has little
authoritative, fact-based information on many essential C2 questions.
The participants discussed and raised major concerns about the [risks
that disinformation could pose before and during a crisis in ways that
could seriously tax the legitimacy of, and confidence in, crisis
decisionmaking generally and the NC3 system]{.underline} in particular.

Today, the [**NC3 system** is likely a **target for information warfare
and disinformation** as a **means of disrupting presidential
decisionmaking and exploiting societal divides** to **undermine public
confidence in the government**]{.underline}. [Disinformation campaigns
could be deployed to distract decisionmakers, slowing their ability to
respond in a crisis and giving adversaries an advantage]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [by promoting false narratives or simply flooding the
public with conflicting facts, potential adversaries could break
confidence in U.S. institutions and decisionmakers, sow distrust and
confusion, and coerce desirable outcomes at lower levels of conflict as
publics latch on to the maliciously spread information.]{.underline}

Today, the NC3 system is likely a target for information warfare and
disinformation as a means of [disrupting presidential decisionmaking and
exploiting societal divides to undermine public confidence in the
government.]{.underline} While secrecy and opacity can be advantageous
in countering some threats to the NC3 system, they simultaneously
increase the vulnerability of NC3 to disinformation tactics, which
attack public confidence in the system rather than attacking the system
itself. Weaponized social media, targeted adversary message
amplification through conspiracy theorists and automated bots, and the
strategic use of deepfakes are just a few examples of how the [new age
of information warfare could threaten the confidence in and legitimacy
of NC3 systems.]{.underline} The future NC3 system must better balance
trade-offs in complexity, effectiveness, and resiliency as well as
security and transparency to address the disinformation threat.

#### AI control of nuclear weapons makes escalation more likely by removing *humanity* from decisions

Michael T. Klare's article "Autonomous Weapons Systems and the Laws of
War" (ACT, March 2019) highlights important issues, but omits enormous
strategic risks inhearent to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in
a role of command. [In a war between major powers, both sides'
AI]{.underline} systems [would be able to outperform humans in the
application of game theory]{.underline}, similar to state-of-the-art
poker-playing AI, which can now readily defeat the top human players.
[Nation-[states would be tempted to endow]{.mark} these genius-level
[autonomous]{.mark} killing [systems with the authority to escalate,
bringing the risk of]{.mark} bad luck causing misunderstandings that
lead to **[uncontrolled escalation]{.mark}.** Exacerbating the risk of
near-instant autonomous escalation is the risk of [an AI system]{.mark}
deciding that it, [unlike a human, **may have nothing to
lose**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A human commander might be a father or
mother]{.underline} who might choose to put the preservation of the
human race above nationalistic warmongering. [Recall]{.underline} how
[Soviet air defense officer]{.underline} Stanislav
[[Petrov]{.underline}]{.mark} (a father of two) [[saved the
world]{.mark} in 1983]{.underline} [[by choosing to **disbelieve a
computerized system**]{.mark} that claimed a U.S. nuclear first strike
was in progress]{.underline}. [[His decision]{.mark} may have [included
a desire]{.mark}]{.underline} to put mercy over patriotism and **[[not
to]{.mark} participate in the [annihilat]{.mark}ion of [the human
race]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, **[[an AI system]{.mark}
would have no such qualms]{.underline}**. An [AI]{.underline} system
[might or might not be trained with a self-preservation instinct. If
not, it would not care if it is destroyed, and it [could **take needless
risks**]{.mark},]{.underline} [carelessly **bluffing and
escalating,**]{.underline} [seeking to make the adversary back down
[through suicidal brinksmanship]{.mark}.]{.underline} One might think,
therefore, that it is important to endow battlefield AI systems with a
self-preservation instinct, but the consequences of doing so could be
even worse. [[Once]{.mark} a weaponized [AI]{.mark} system [is
given]{.mark} a [self-preservation]{.mark} instinct, it may become
impossible to shut down, as [it would **kill anyone who tried to shut it
off**]{.mark}, including its own country's military or government
leaders.]{.underline} These killings might play out in several ways. On
a small scale, the system could limit its "self-defense" killings by
targeting only the officials trying to disable the AI system. Worse,
[[the AI system could]{.mark} try to preserve itself by
**[threaten]{.mark}ing [mutually assured]{.mark}**
**[destruction]{.mark}:** if it ever suspected, even incorrectly, that
its shutdown was imminent, the AI system could retaliate with the launch
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [A [dying AI]{.mark} system, still
energized for a few milliseconds by the last electrical charge remaining
in its internal capacitors, [could]{.mark} even [nuke]{.mark} not just
its own nation but [the **entire surface of
Earth.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Even suspected development of nuclear AI causes war 

**Boulanin, PhD, 18**

(Vincent, Senior Researcher at SIPRI,
<https://cpr.unu.edu/ai-global-governance-ai-and-nuclear-weapons-promise-and-perils-of-ai-for-nuclear-stability.html>,
12-7)

On the other, the adoption -- or **[even suspected
adoption]{.underline}** -- [of new AI capabilities]{.underline} by one
or several nuclear-armed states [could incentivize other
states]{.underline} (be they nuclear-armed or not) [to respond with
**destabilizing measures** that could increase the likelihood of a
nuclear conflict.]{.underline} [This could include entering into an arms
race, doubling down on the modernization of nuclear arsenals, renouncing
a 'no first use' policy, increasing alert statuses, or further
automating nuclear launch policies.]{.underline} Historical events like
the 1983 Petrov incident (where the Soviet early warning systems wrongly
detected a US nuclear attack) have also shown that [AI technology could
be the cause of an accidental or inadvertent escalation into a nuclear
conflict.]{.underline}

### Machine Learning

#### NC3s are dangerous and vulnerable because they are trained through machine learning 

Vincent **Boulanin**, May 20**19**, \",\" No Publication,
https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/sipri1905-ai-strategic-stability-nuclear-risk.pdf

It is already known that a broad range of [**models trained through
machine learning** are **susceptible to a new kind of vulnerability,**
termed 'adversarial examples']{.underline}: [an adversary can craft a
malicious input that reliably causes a trained model to produce the
wrong behaviour]{.underline} (e.g. [misclassify an object in an image or
take an inappropriate action in the environment]{.underline}).7 While
this vulnerability has been known and researched heavily for several
years, [no robust solution has yet been found]{.underline}. Nonetheless,
given the promise of new capabilities that machine learning and
automation offer, the pressure to deploy potentially insecure systems
may present itself.8 When considering threats that might be introduced
from increased autonomy and use of machine learning, it is important to
consider the entire sprawling range of systems and functions that make
up and support NC4ISR. [Specific attention has been given to delivery
systems and to nuclear command, control and communications
(NC3)]{.underline}.9 The awareness of potential threats to 'core'
computer systems in NC3 has led to significantly improved security for
such systems, and some reluctance to introduce autonomy and machine
learning into them.10 [However, **more peripheral systems can also pose
a threat**, especially as they are more likely sites for the
introduction of autonomy and machine learning]{.underline}. These
include, for example, systems onboard satellites that relay
communications and images or the simulators used to plan and test
strategies. They can also extend as far as the vast computer systems and
networks that provide news information to the public and to civilian
officials, which may affect tactical or strategic decision-making.
Admittedly, it is not always easy to chart a scenario that begins with a
compromise of a particular peripheral system and ends with the
unauthorized launch of a nuclear weapon.11 It is similarly difficult to
describe a scenario whereby an adversary would intervene in the
authorized launch of a nuclear weapon. However, these systems are
present for the well-funded and patient adversary to explore and
exploit. In particular, [there is increasing concern about attacks that
initially target command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems that are
'entangled'---that is, used for both nuclear and conventional
weapons]{.underline}---such as satellites, intelligence gathering and
logistics.12 Entangled systems present two challenges here: first, they
are often not considered 'nuclear' systems, so are subject to a lower
level of security scrutiny than nuclear systems. Second, attacks on such
systems may be considered by an adversary as unlikely to trigger a
nuclear escalation, leading to a miscalculation---the adversary may not
even know that the system has an NC4ISR purpose and may therefore
consider the attack to be conventional while the targeted state may
perceive the attack as an attack on its nuclear capabilities.

never mentions the KUB-BLA or military applications. Instead, it

machine-learning AI into military applications is [**significantly more
difficult** than in industrial or agricultural
applications]{.underline}. Modern machine-learning AI using deep neural
networks offers the opportunity for incredible gains in performance, but
that p[erformance depends on **having lots of training data during
development.**]{.underline} Moreover, that training data needs to
closely resemble operational conditions. In general, it is much easier
to get such training data from commercial customers than from an enemy
military, especially if friendly weapons systems and sensors do not
often come within range of enemy ones. The most [**mature military AI
applications are** ones like **satellite** reconnaissance: even in
peacetime,]{.underline} satellites get to take a lot of pictures of
Russian and Chinese military forces, and those pictures can be digitally
labeled by human experts to turn them into training data. Training data
is what machine learning AI systems learn from. The combination of a
learning algorithm and training data is how AI systems learn to
recognize what is in the image. But training data is generally
application-specific. [Satellite image recognition training data only
helps build satellite image recognition AI]{.underline}. [One cannot
magically use labeled satellite image data to train an AI for a robotic
drone's targeting computer]{.underline} (at least not with today's
technology).

[According to conventional accounts of international
relations]{.underline} ([IR]{.underline}), scholars focus on war
(predominantly as a means to providing the sovereign state with
security) and the existence of war\'s corollary is a foundational
assumption that goes largely unquestioned. Peace must exist, for
international relations are not characterised by perpetual conflict.
However, [peace is implicitly defined]{.underline}, in dichotomous
terms, by [the absence of violent conflict, as \'not-war\']{.underline}.
Of more analytical interest is conflict, which is always a possibility
and which, moreover, occurs between states. International relations as a
discipline, narrowly conceived, is largely unconcerned with activities
that occur within the state. Minimally, feminist and other critical
approaches to IR seek to correct such disciplinary myopia. While
classical realism theorises the political actor --Hans Morgenthau\'s
\'political man\' (1973, pp. 15--6) -- in order to construct the state
as actor, the now dominant neo-realism abstracts the human subject from
its disciplinary musings, leading to the infamous \'black box\' model of
the state. Early feminist scholarship challenged this assumption as
well, arguing that individuals, as human subjects in all their messy
complexity, are an integral part of international relations (see
Shepherd, 2007, pp. 240--1). [Attention to the human
subject]{.underline} in I/international R/relations -- or, as Christine
Sylvester phrases it, \'relations international\', to emphasise the
embedded nature of all kinds of relations in the international sphere,
including power relations and gender relations (Sylvester, 1994, p. 6;
see also Enloe, 1996) -- [allows critical scholars to look beyond the
disciplinary obsession with war. Further, it allows us to investigate
one of the simplest insights of feminist IR,]{.underline} which is also
one of the most devastating**[: [the war/peace dichotomy is
gendered]{.mark}, misleading and potentially
pathological.]{.underline}** In this essay, I address each of these
concerns in turn, developing a critique of the war/peace dichotomy that
is foundational to conventional approaches to IR through a review of
three recent publications in the field of feminist security studies.
These texts are Cynthia Enloe\'s (2007) Globalization and Militarism,
David Roberts\' (2008) Human Insecurity, and Mothers, Monsters, Whores:
Women\'s Violence in Global Politics by Laura Sjoberg and Caron Gentry
(2008). Drawing on the insights of these books, I ask first how violence
is understood in global politics, with specific reference to the
gendered disciplinary blindnesses that frequently characterise
mainstream approaches. Second, I demonstrate how a focus on war and
peace can neglect to take into account the politics of everyday
violence: the violences of the in-between times that international
politics recognises neither as \'war\' nor \'peace\' and the violences
inherent to times of peace that are overlooked in the study of war.
Finally, I argue that [feminist security studies offers an important
corrective to the [foundational assumptions of IR,]{.mark} which
themselves can [perpetuate the]{.mark} very instances of
[violence]{.mark} that [they seek to redress]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we
accept the core insights of feminist security studies -- the centrality
of the human subject, the importance of particular configurations of
masculinity and femininity, and the gendered conceptual framework that
underpins the discipline of IR -- [we are encouraged to envisage a
rather different politics of the global]{.underline}. From Boudica to
Bhopal As Sjoberg and Gentry recount (2008, pp. 38--9), Boudica was an
Iceni queen who led an uprising against the Roman forces occupying the
British Isles circa 61 AD. Prior to launching the attack, Boudica\'s
refusal to allow a Roman general to claim ownership of her land resulted
in the rape of her two daughters as punishment. However, \'many
inherited tales about Boudica do not emphasise her personal or political
motivations, but the savage and unwomanly brutality of her actions\'
(Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 39). Almost two thousand years later and
half a planet away, a toxic gas leak in 1984 at a Union Carbide plant in
Bhopal, India caused the immediate deaths of approximately 3,000 people
and left tens of thousands suffering the after-effects for decades
(Roberts, 2008, p. 10). At first reading, little links these two
accounts of quite different forms of violence. The first is an instance
of violent resistance against imperial oppression, and Boudica has been
vilified, her efforts delegitimised, in much the same way as many actors
in \'small wars\' tend to be in global politics today (see Barkawi,
2004). The second is perhaps more usefully seen as the result of
structural violence, following Johan Galtung\'s explanation of the same,
as \'violence where there is no such actor\' (cited in Roberts, 2008, p.
18). However, by asking questions about Boudica and Bhopal that are born
of a \'feminist curiosity\' (Enloe, 2007, p. 1, p. 11), these texts
demonstrate connections beyond the simplistic equation that is
applicable to both: actor/structure plus violence equals death. In Human
Insecurity, Roberts poses the question, **[\'What is
violence?]{.underline}**\' (2008, p. 17). [This is a question rarely
asked in international relations.]{.underline} Violence is war:
[large-scale, state-dominated]{.underline}, much studied,
[war]{.underline}. However, the three texts under review here all offer
more nuanced theories of violence that focus analytical attention on
complex constructions of agency (institutional and international),
structure, and the global context that is product and productive of such
violence. [Through an intricate and beautifully accessible analysis of
modernity]{.underline} --\'that pot of gold at the end of the global
rainbow\' (Enloe, 2007, p. 64) -- [Enloe encourages]{.underline} her
[readers to seek the]{.underline} [connections between globalisation and
militarisation, arguing that at the heart of this nexus lie important
questions about violence and security]{.underline}. Roberts notes a
broad dissatisfaction with the concept of \'human security\' (2008, pp.
14--7), offering instead his investigative lens of \'human insecurity\',
defined as \'avoidable civilian deaths, occurring globally, caused by
social, political and economic institutions and structures, built and
operated by humans and which could feasibly be changed\' (p. 28).
**[[Placing the human at the centre of concerns about security
immediately challenges]{.mark} a [conventional state-based
approach]{.mark} to security]{.underline}**, as Enloe explains. In a
convincing account of the hard-fought expansion of the concept of
security, mapped on to strategic and organisational gains made by
various feminist organisations, Enloe reminds us that **[if we take
seriously the lives of women -- their understandings of security -- as
well as on-the-ground workings of masculinity and femininity, we will be
able to produce more meaningful and more reliable analyses of
\'security\'-- personal, national and global]{.underline}** (Enloe,
2007, p. 47). This latter quote typifies an approach for which Enloe has
become somewhat famous. In the early 1980s, Enloe began asking the
questions for which she is rightly acknowledged as a key figure in
feminist security studies, including Does Khaki Become You? (Enloe,
1983) and \'where are the women?\' (Enloe, 2000; see also Enloe, 2004).
Inspired by her own curiosity about the roles played by women and the
functions performed by gender in the militarisation of civilian life,
Enloe has explored prostitution, marriage, welfare and war making with
an eye to the representation (both political and symbolic) of women. In
Globalization and Militarism she offers detailed vignettes that
illuminate just how interwoven violence is with the quest for (various
types of) security, and demands that nothing is left unquestioned in a
critical analysis of these concepts. Even baby socks (embossed with tiny
fighter planes, a gift to the parent of a small boy) have something to
tell us about gender, militarism and the casual representations of
violence and war that society accepts (Enloe, 2007, pp. 143--4).
Following a similar logic, although he initially defines human
insecurity as avoidable civilian deaths, Roberts focuses on
\'preventable female deaths \... and avoidable deaths in children under
five\' (2008, p. 31). While this conflation of \'civilian\' with \'women
and children\' is rather problematic (see Carpenter, 2006), in asking
not only, where are the women? but also, why are they dying in such
disproportionate numbers? Roberts enhances his critique of [\'most
security studies]{.underline} \... \[that\] [largely \[miss\] the scale
of]{.underline} avoidable [human misery and]{.underline} avoidable human
[death\']{.underline} (2008, p. 4). As mentioned above, Roberts uses
Galtung\'s concept of [structural violence]{.underline} to draw
attention to the manifest ways in which [an increasingly interconnected
global system relies on gender and violence (and gendered violence) for
its perpetuation:]{.underline} \'The process of globalization, to which
few are ideologically or otherwise opposed, is an essential conveyor and
articulator of the masculinity that underpins andrarchy\' (Roberts,
2008, p. 157). Whereas Enloe offers a persuasive and accessible account
of patriarchy, a concept familiar to feminist and non-feminist scholars
alike (Enloe, 2007, pp. 66--8), Roberts suggests \'andrarchy\' as an
alternative, which he defines as \'the gender-partisan ideological
domination and rule structure that determines and sustains the general
relative power of males over females globally\' (Roberts, 2008, p. 140).
However, it is difficult to see how this reformulation either differs
substantively from patriarchy as an analytical tool or assists in the
construction of an alternative theory of global violence that
centralises the individual, and therefore takes gender seriously, in
that it seems to essentialise violent actors (males) and violated
victims (females). In contrast, [Enloe\'s explanation of patriarchy
challenges]{.underline} such [essentialism as its first point of
critical intervention.]{.underline} That is, [the assumption of
essential differences between men and women is part of patriarchal
ideology, feeding into stereotypical notions of how such men and women
should behave, which in turn constitute recognisable discourses of
gender: sets of narratives about masculinity and femininity and how
these are, in general, respectively privileged and
marginalised]{.underline}. The most theoretically coherent account of
gender and violence offered in these three texts comes from Sjoberg and
Gentry and employs the notion of discourse to great effect. Whereas
Roberts seeks to map out a consciously structural account of global
violence, where the structure in question is a hybrid of andrarchy and a
\'rapacious, increasingly competitive and hyper-masculine\'
neoliberalism (Roberts, 2008, p. 118), Sjoberg and Gentry offer a more
sophisticated analysis of structure and agency in their \'relational
autonomy framework\' that accounts for both individual agency and
structural constraint (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, pp. 189--98). [When
people perform acts of political violence]{.underline}, they argue,
[this is a conscious choice, but crucially individuals \'choose within a
specified spectrum of socially acceptable choices\']{.underline} (p.
190). \'In its simplest form, relational autonomy is the recognition
that freedom of action is defined and limited by social relationships\'
(p. 194) and this has profound implications for the study of violence in
global politics. Sjoberg and Gentry use this insight to demonstrate that
[[women\'s violence in global politics is rendered
unintelligible]{.mark}, through narrative representations of the
perpetrators as mothers, monsters or whores]{.underline} (in media
discourse and academic discussion), rather than as autonomous agents.
From the abuses of prisoners held at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, via the
\'black widows\' of Chechnya, to female perpetrators of genocidal
violence in Rwanda, the authors show how representations of women\'s
violence conform to and further confirm the stereotypes of violent women
as either mothers (supporting or vengeful), monsters or sexually deviant
whores (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, pp. 30--49). The very different
theories of violence outlined in these three texts all contribute to the
development of a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of
violence in global politics. By insisting that international relations
are also gender relations -- by demanding that we recognise that states
are an analytical abstraction and politics is practised or performed by
gendered bodies -- all of the authors put forward theories of violence
that are corrective of gender blindness, in that the violences in
question are simultaneously gendered and gendering (see Shepherd, 2008,
pp. 49--54). They are gendered because they have different impacts on
male and female bodies (Enloe, 2007, p. 13), both materially as people
experience violence differently depending on their gender (and race,
class, sexuality and so on) and also discursively, as what we expect of
men and women in terms of their behaviours, violent and otherwise, is
limited by the meaning(s) ascribed to male and female bodies by society.
Regarding the former, Roberts proposes that we term the global
victimisation of women \'structural femicide\' (Roberts, 2008, p. 65),
but does not sufficiently engage with the question of whether defining
gendered violence as violence against women (and children) functions to
constitute the subject of \'woman\' as a perpetual victim, in need of
protection and lacking in agency (Shepherd, 2008, p. 41). In contrast,
Sjoberg and Gentry neatly articulate the interplay between material and
discursive violence as they write a theory that accounts \'for people\'s
impact on global politics and for the impact of narratives others
construct for and about them\' (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 216,
emphasis in original). Thus, violence is gendering as our understanding
of politics is in part reproduced through violent actions. Through
discursive violence against individuals -- for example, representing
Chechen women suicide terrorists as \'black widows\', which demands that
they are attributed the characteristics of the venomous and deadly black
widow spider and, further, that their violence is grounded in familial
loss, \'born directly of a desire for vengeance for the deaths of their
husbands and sons\' (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 100) rather than as
the result of a process of political decision making -- our
understanding of that individual and of the act of violence itself is
produced. Similarly, through material acts of violence, discourses of
gender are given physical form; the detainees at Abu Ghraib who were
forced to simulate oral sex with each other were forced to do so in part
because of crude cultural understandings of homosexuality as deviant and
homosexuals as lesser men -- that is, as women. To force a man to
perform oral sex on another man is to undermine his masculinity and
simultaneously to reinforce the gendered power relations that claim
privilege for masculinity over femininity, heterosexuality over
homosexuality -- power relations that render such an act intelligible in
the first instance. [Such understandings of violence are beyond the
remit of conventional state-based approaches to international
relations]{.underline}. However, \'it is [by tracking]{.underline} the
gendered assumptions about how to wield feminization to humiliate
male\[s\]\' (Enloe, 2007, p. 115) and [how to represent gendered
individuals in such a way as to render some acts of violence
intelligible as political and others as monstrous]{.underline} that [we
can begin to piece together a useful feminist account of global
violence, which is a necessary component of understanding
security.]{.underline} Everyday Violence and In-Between Days In addition
to questioning what violence is, how it is represented and with what
effects, [feminist security studies]{.underline} scholarship [also
asks]{.underline} which violences are considered worthy of study and
[when these violences occur. [Expanding the concept]{.mark} of violence
that underpins feminist analysis]{.underline}, as outlined above,
[[allows us to take seriously]{.underline}]{.mark} what Arthur Kleinman
(2000) refers to as [[\'the violences of everyday life\']{.mark}. Beyond
a narrow focus on war and state-based violence lies a plethora of
everyday violences]{.underline} that feminist security studies seeks to
address. In the field of security studies the broadening and deepening
of the concept of security, such that it is no longer assumed to apply
only to the sovereign state, has demonstrated the multiple insecurities
experienced by individuals and social collectives (Booth, 2005, pp.
14--5). The development of the concept of \'human security\' largely
took place within the parameters of a wider disciplinary debate over the
appropriate referent object for security studies (the individual,
society, the state) and the types of threat to the referent object that
would be recognised. In a move similar to Ken Booth\'s (1991)
reformulation of security as emancipation, Roberts\' quest for
individual empowerment seeks to overcome the \'élite-legitimized
disequilibrium\' that results in the manifest insecurity of the majority
of the world\'s population (Roberts, 2008, p. 185). [As might be
expected]{.underline}, the [violences]{.underline} Roberts identifies
are [innumerable. In addition to the physical violences]{.underline} of
\'infanticide, maternal mortality, intimate (\"domestic\", \"honour\"
and \"dowry\") killings and lethal female genital mutilation; and
avoidable deaths in children under five\' (Roberts, 2008, p. 31), his
[analysis attacks the institutional structures of the dominant
international financial institutions]{.underline} (pp. 117--35) [and the
andrarchal and neoliberal discourses that sustain them]{.underline} (pp.
136--58). In short, [Roberts\' answer to the question of which violences
matter in global politics is quite simple: **all of them**]{.underline}.
However, while studies of human security, he argues, seek to provide the
human with security, his reformulated analytic takes as its starting
point human insecurity; that is, he starts with the threat(s) to the
sovereign subject rather than the subject\'s ontological condition.
Roberts suggests that this circumvents the disciplinary definitional
problem with human security -- identified by Roland Paris (2001), Edward
Newman (2001; 2004) and others -- but I cannot see how this is the case,
given that the answer to the question \'what is it that humans do to
make the world a more dangerous and dysfunctional place?\' (Roberts,
2008, p. 28) is also quite simple: we live in it. Thus Roberts\'
analytic seems to suffer the same lack of definitional clarity -- and
therefore policy relevance -- that he ascribes to more conventional
approaches; it is no easier to identify, quantify and ultimately reduce
the threats experienced by coexisting human subjects than it is to
provide those human subjects with security, if security can first be
defined as freedom from fear or want. I do not espouse some construction
of human nature (if such a thing were to exist) that assumes essential
selfishness and a propensity for violence, nor do I assume that security
is a zero-sum game, in that one person\'s security must always be at the
expense of another\'s, but I recognise that even the most
well-intentioned security policy can have unforeseen and sometimes
disastrous effects. Sometimes, moreover, as Sjoberg and Gentry
demonstrate, the decision to perform acts of political violence that are
a source of insecurity for the intended victims can be understood if not
condoned. Enloe\'s analytical remit is similarly wide-ranging to
Roberts\', in that she focuses on processes -- globalisation and
militarism -- that are inherently violent. However, although Enloe also
insists that all violences should count in the study of global politics,
she grounds this claim in an analysis of specific sites of violence and
demonstrates with startling clarity just how everyday items -- for
example, sneakers -- are both globalised and militarised: Threaded
through virtually every sneaker you own is some relationship to
masculinized militaries. Locating factories in South Korea \[in the
1960s and 1970s\] was a good strategic decision in the eyes of those
Oregon-headquartered male Nike executives because of the close alliance
between male policymakers in Washington and Seoul. It was a relationship
-- unequal but intimate -- based on their shared anticommunism, their
shared commitment to waging the Cold War, and their shared participation
in an ambitious international military alliance (Enloe, 2007, p. 28). By
drawing her readers\' attention to the ways in which discourses of
gender (ideas about how \'proper\' men and women should behave)
function, Enloe reminds us that adhering to ideals of masculinity and
femininity is both productive of violence and is a violence in itself, a
violence against the empowered human subject. **[\'Ideas
matter\']{.underline}**, she concludes, [ideas about modernity,
[security, violence, threat]{.mark}, trust. [\'Each]{.mark} of these
ideas [is fraught with]{.mark} blatant and subtle [presumptions about
masculinity and femininity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ideas about both
masculinity and femininity matter. This makes a feminist curiosity a
necessity\' (Enloe, 2007, p. 161). While conventional studies of IR and
security may be willing to concede that ideas matter (see Finnemore and
Sikkink, 2001), paying close attention to the work that gender does
allows for a fuller understanding of why it is that particular violences
fall outside the traditional parameters of study. As to the question of
when violence is worthy of study, all three texts implicitly or
explicitly draw on the popular feminist phrase: \'the personal is
political\'. This slogan neatly encapsulates the feminist critique of a
supposed foundational divide between the private and the public realms
of social life. In arguing that the personal is political, feminist
theory refuses to accept that there are instances of human behaviour or
situations in social life that can or should be bracketed from study. At
its simplest, this critique led to the recognition of \'domestic
violence\' as a political, rather than a personal issue (see, for
example Moore, 2003; Youngs, 2003), forming the foundation for critical
studies of gendered violence in times of war and in times of peace that
would otherwise have been ignored. Crucially, Enloe extended the
boundaries of critique to include the international, imbuing the phrase
with new analytical vitality when she suggested, first, that the phrase
itself is palindromic (that is, that the political is also personal,
inextricably intertwined with the everyday) and, second, that the
personal is international just as the international is personal. \'The
international is personal\' implies that governments depend upon certain
kinds of allegedly private relationships in order to conduct their
foreign affairs. \... To operate in the international arena, governments
seek other governments\' recognition of their sovereignty; but they also
depend on ideas about masculinised dignity and feminised sacrifice to
sustain that sense of autonomous nationhood (Enloe, 2000, pp. 196--7).
These ideas about dignity and sacrifice are not neatly contained within
the temporal boundaries of any given war, nor are they incidental to the
practice of warfare. Further, there is of course also the question of
who gets to define or declare war, or peace. While some of the violent
women whose actions are analysed by Sjoberg and Gentry perform their
violences in wartime (for example, Lynndie England, who received the
most attention from global media of the women involved in prisoner abuse
at Abu Ghraib; see Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, pp. 67--70), others are
fighting wars that are not sanctioned by the international community
(such as the Chechen women \[pp. 97--111\] and female Palestinian
suicide bombers \[pp. 112--40\]). As discussed above, ideas about
masculinity and femininity, dignity and sacrifice may not only be
violent in themselves, but are also the product/productive of physical
violences. With this in mind, [the feminist argument that \'peacetime\'
is analytically misleading is a valid one. Of interest are the
\'in-between days\' and the ways in which [labelling periods of war or
peace]{.mark} as such can [divert attention away from the myriad
violences that]{.mark} inform and [reinforce social behaviour]{.mark}.
\[W\]ar can surely never be said to start and end at a clearly defined
moment. Rather, it seems part of a continuum of conflict, expressed now
in armed force, now in economic sanctions or political
pressure]{.underline}. A time of supposed peace may come later to be
called \'the pre-war period\'. During the fighting of a war, unseen by
the foot soldiers under fire, peace processes are often already at work.
A time of postwar reconstruction, later, may be re-designated as an
inter bellum-- a mere pause between wars (Cockburn and Zarkov, cited in
El Jack, 2003, p. 9). Feminist security studies interrogates the pauses
between wars, and the political processes -- and practices of power --
that demarcate times as such. In doing so, not only is the remit of
recognisable violence (violence worthy of study) expanded, but so too
are the parameters of what counts as IR. Everyday violences and acts of
everyday resistance (\'a fashion show, a tour, a small display of
children\'s books\' in Enloe, 2007, pp. 117--20) are the stuff of
relations international and, thus, of a comprehensive understanding of
security. In the following section I outline the ways in which taking
these claims seriously allows us to engage critically with the
representations of international relations that inform our research,
with potentially profound implications. The Violent Reproduction of the
International As well as conceiving of gender as a set of discourses,
and violence as a means of reproducing and reinforcing the relevant
discursive limits, it is possible to see security as a set of
discourses, as I have argued more fully elsewhere (Shepherd, 2007; 2008;
see also Shepherd and Weldes, 2007). Rather than pursuing the study of
security as if it were something that can be achieved either in
absolute, partial or relative terms, engaging with security as discourse
enables the analysis of how these discourses function to reproduce,
through various strategies, the domain of the international with which
IR is self-consciously concerned. Just as violences that are gendering
reproduce gendered subjects, on this view states, acting as
authoritative entities, perform violences, but violences, in the name of
security, also perform states. These processes occur simultaneously, and
across the whole spectrum of social life: an instance of rape in war is
at once gendering of the individuals involved and of the social
collectivities -- states, communities, regions -- they feel they
represent (see Bracewell, 2000); building a fence in the name of
security that separates people from their land and extended families
performs particular kinds of violence (at checkpoints, during patrols)
and performs particular subject identities (of the state authority, of
the individuals affected), all of which are gendered. All of the texts
under discussion in this essay argue that it is imperative to explore
and expose gendered power relations and, further, that doing so not only
enables a rigorous critique of realism in IR but also reminds us as
scholars of the need for such a critique. The critiques of IR offered by
feminist scholars are grounded in a rejection of neo-realism/realism as
a dominant intellectual framework for academics in the discipline and
policy makers alike. As Enloe reminds us, \'the government-centred,
militarized version of national security \[derived from a realist
framework\] remains the dominant mode of policy thinking\' (Enloe, 2007,
p. 43). Situating gender as a central category of analysis encourages us
to \'think outside the \"state security box\"\' (p. 47) and to remember
that \'the \"individuals\" of global politics do not work alone, live
alone or politic alone -- they do so in interdependent relationships
with others\' (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 200) that are inherently
gendered. One of the key analytical contributions of all three texts is
the way in which they all challenge what it means to be \'doing\' IR, by
recognising various forms of violence, interrogating the public/private
divide and demanding that attention is paid to the temporal and physical
spaces in-between war and peace. Feminist security studies should not
simply be seen as \'women doing security\', or as \'adding women to
IR/security studies\', important as these contributions are. Through
their theorising, the authors discussed here reconfigure what \'counts\'
as IR, challenging orthodox notions of who can \'do\' IR and what
\'doing\' IR means. The practices of power needed to maintain dominant
configurations of international relations are exposed, and critiquing
the productive power of realism as a discourse is one way in which the
authors do this. Sjoberg and Gentry pick up on a recent theoretical
shift in Anglo-American IR, from system-level analysis to a recognition
that individuals matter. However, as they rightly point out, the
individuals who are seen to matter are not gendered relational beings,
but rather reminiscent of Hobbes\' construction of the autonomous
rational actor. \'\[T\]he narrowness of the group that \[such an
approach\] includes limits its effectiveness as an interpretive
framework and reproduces the gender, class and race biases in
system-level international relationship scholarship\' (Sjoberg and
Gentry 2008, p. 200, emphasis added). Without paying adequate attention
to the construction of individuals as gendered beings, or to the
reproduction of widely held ideas about masculine and feminine
behaviours, Sjoberg and Gentry remind us that we will ultimately fail
\'to see and deconstruct the increasingly subtle, complex and disguised
ways in which gender pervades international relations and global
politics\' (2008, p. 225). In a similar vein, Roberts notes that \'human
security is marginalised or rejected as inauthentic \[because\] it is
not a reflection of realism\'s (male) agendas and priorities\' (2008, p.
169). The \'agendas and priorities\' identified by Roberts and
acknowledged by Sjoberg and Gentry as being productive of particular
biases in scholarship are not simply \'academic\' matters, in the
pejorative sense of the term. As Roberts argues, \'Power relationships
of inequality happen because they are built that way by human
determinism of security and what is required to maintain security (p.
171). Realism, as academic discourse and as policy guideline, has
material effects. Although his analysis employs an unconventional
definition of the term \'social construction\' (seemingly
interchangeable with \'human agency\') and rests on a novel
interpretation of the three foundational assumptions of realism
(Roberts, 2008, pp. 169--77), the central point that Roberts seeks to
make in his conclusion is valid: \'it is a challenge to those who deny
relationships between gender and security; between human agency (social
construction) and lethal outcome\' (p. 183). In sum, all three texts
draw their readers to an inescapable, and -- for the conventional study
of IR -- a devastating conclusion: the dominance of neo-realism/realism
and the state-based study of security that derives from this is
potentially pathological, in that it is in part productive of the
violences it seeks to ameliorate. I suggest that critical engagement
with orthodox IR theory is necessary for the intellectual growth of the
discipline, and considerable insight can be gained by acknowledging the
relevance of feminist understandings of gender, power and theory. The
young woman buying a T-shirt from a multinational clothing corporation
with her first pay cheque, the group of young men planning a stag
weekend in Amsterdam, a group of students attending a demonstration
against the bombing of Afghanistan -- studying these significant actions
currently falls outside the boundaries of doing security studies in
mainstream IR and I believe these boundaries need contesting. As Marysia
Zalewski argues: International politics is what we make it to be \... We
need to rethink the discipline in ways that will disturb the existing
boundaries of both that which we claim to be relevant in international
politics and what we assume to be legitimate ways of constructing
knowledge about the world (Zalewski 1996, p. 352, emphasis in original).
Conclusion: \'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of
Thought Contend\' (Mao Tse-Tung) In this essay, I have used the analysis
of three contemporary publications in the field of feminist security
studies to demonstrate three significant sets of analytical
contributions that such scholarship makes to the discipline of IR.
Beyond the war/peace dichotomy that is frequently assumed to be
definitive of the discipline, we find many and various forms of
violence, occurring in and between temporally distinct periods of
conflict, which are the product/productive of socially acceptable modes
of gendered behaviour, ways of being in the world as a woman or man. I
have also argued that critical engagement with conventional, state-based
approaches to (national) security must persist as the academic
discourses we write are complicit in the construction of the global as
we understand it. Further, \'if all experience is gendered, analysis of
gendered identities is an imperative starting point in the study of
political identities and practice\' (Peterson, 1999, p. 37). To this
end, I conclude by suggesting that we take seriously Enloe\'s final
comment: [\'Tracking militarization and fostering demilitarization will
call for cooperative investigations, multiple skills and the
appreciation of diverse perspectives\']{.underline} (2007, p. 164).
[While there has been intense intra-disciplinary debate within
contemporary feminist security studies]{.underline} over the necessary
\'feminist credentials\' of some gendered analyses, [it is important to
recognise the continual renewal and analytical vigour brought to the
field by such debates]{.underline}.

#### Deterrence analysts use "clean language" do separate emotions from decision making

[Entering the world of defense intellectuals was a bizarre experience-
bizarre because it is a world where men spend their days calmly and
matter- of-factly discussing nuclear weapons, nuclear strategy, and
nuclear war. The discussions are carefully and intricately reasoned,
occurring seemingly without any sense of horror, urgency, or moral
outrage-in fact, there seems to be no graphic reality behind the words,
as they speak of \"first strikes,\" \"counterforce exchanges,\" and
\"limited nuclear war,\" or as they debate the comparative values of a
\"minimum deterrent posture\" versus a \"nuclear war-fighting
capability.\"]{.underline} Yet what is striking about the men themselves
is not, as the content of their conversations might suggest, their
cold-bloodedness. Rather, it is that they are a group of men unusually
endowed with charm, humor, intelligence, concern, and decency. Reader, I
liked them. At least, I liked many of them. [The attempt to understand
how such men could contribute to an endeavor that I see as so
fundamentally destructive became a con- tinuing obsession for me, a lens
through which I came to examine all of my experiences in their
world.]{.underline} In this early stage, [I was gripped by the
extraordinary language used to discuss nuclear war. What hit me first
was the elaborate use of abstraction and euphemism, of words so bland
that they never forced the speaker or enabled the listener to touch the
realities of nuclear holocaust that lay behind the words. Anyone who has
seen pictures of Hiroshima burn victims or tried to imagine the pain of
hundreds of glass shards blasted into flesh may find it perverse beyond
imagination to hear a class of nuclear devices matter-of- factly
referred to as \"clean bombs.\"]{.underline} \"Clean bombs\" are nuclear
devices that are largely fusion rather than fission and that therefore
release a higher quantity of energy, not as radiation, but as blast, as
destructive explosive power.7 [\"Clean bombs\" may provide the perfect
metaphor for the language of defense analysts and arms controllers. This
language has enormous de- structive power, but without emotional
fallout, without the emotional fallout that would result if it were
clear one was talking about plans for mass murder, mangled bodies, and
unspeakable human suffering. Defense analysts talk about \"countervalue
attacks\" rather than about incinerating cities. Human death, in nuclear
parlance, is most often referred to as \"collateral damage\"; for, as
one defense analyst said wryly, \"The Air Force doesn\'t target people,
it targets shoe factories.\"]{.underline}8 Some phrases carry this
cleaning-up to the point of inverting meaning. [The MX missile will
carry ten warheads, each with the explosure power of 300-475 kilotons of
TNT: one missile the bearer of destruction approx- imately 250-400 times
that of the Hiroshima bombing.9 Ronald Reagan has dubbed the MX missile
\"the Peacekeeper.\"]{.underline} While this renaming was the object of
considerable scorn in the community of defense analysts, [these very
same analysts refer to the MX as a \"damage limitation
weapon.]{.underline}\"\'? These phrases, only a few of the hundreds that
could be discussed, exemplify the astounding chasm between image and
reality that character- izes technostrategic language. [They also hint
at the terrifying way in which the existence of nuclear devices has
distorted our perceptions and rede- fined the world. \"Clean bombs\"
tells us that radiation is the only \"dirty\" part of killing
people.]{.underline} To take this one step further, such phrases can
even seem healthful/ curative/corrective. [So that we not only have
\"clean bombs\" but also \"surgically clean strikes\" (\"counterforce\"
attacks that can purportedly \"take out\"-i. e., accurately destroy-an
opponent\'s weapons or command cen- ters without causing significant
injury to anything else). The image of excision of the offending weapon
is unspeakably ludicrous when the surgi- cal tool is not a delicately
controlled scalpel but a nuclear warhead. And somehow it seems to be
forgotten that even scalpels spill blood.]{.underline}

#### The language used to describe nuclear war is full of sexual undertones that exacerbate hegemonic masculinity

**Cohn 87 -** Dr. Carol Cohn is the founding director of the Consortium

Feminists have often suggested that an important aspect of the arms race
is phallic worship, that [\"missile envy\" is a significant motivating
force in the nuclear build-up.]{.underline}12 I have always found this
an uncomfortably reductionist explanation and hoped that my research at
the Center would yield a more complex analysis. But still, [I was
curious about the extent to which I might find a sexual subtext in the
defense professionals\' discourse. I was not prepared for what I
found.]{.underline} I think I had naively imagined myself as a feminist
spy in the house of death-that I would need to sneak around and
eavesdrop on what men said in unguarded moments, using all my subtlety
and cunning to unearth whatever sexual imagery might be underneath how
they thought and spoke. [I had naively believed that these men, at least
in public, would appear to be aware of feminist critiques. If they had
not changed their language, I thought that at least at some point in a
long talk about \"penetra- tion aids,\" someone would suddenly look up,
slightly embarrassed to be caught in such blatant confirmation of
feminist analyses of What\'s Going On Here.]{.underline}\'3 Of course, I
was wrong. [There was no evidence that any feminist critiques had ever
reached the ears, much less the minds, of these men. American military
dependence on nuclear weapons was explained as \"irresistible, because
you get more bang for the buck.\" Another lecturer solemnly and
scientifically announced \"to disarm is to get rid of all your stuff.\"
(This may, in turn, explain why they see serious talk of nuclear
disarmament as perfectly resistable, not to mention foolish. If
disarmament is emasculation, how could any real man even consider
it?)]{.underline} A professor\'s explanation of why the MX missile is to
be placed in the silos of the newest Minuteman missiles, instead of
replacing the older, less accurate ones, was \"because they\'re in the
nicest hole-you\'re not going to take the nicest missile you have and
put it in a crummy hole.\" [Other lectures were filled with discussion
of vertical erector launchers, thrust-to-weight ratios, soft lay downs,
deep penetration, and the comparative advantages of pro- tracted versus
spasm attacks-or what one military adviser to the National Security
Council has called \"releasing 70 to 80 percent of our megatonnage in
one orgasmic whump.\"14 There was serious concern about the need to
harden our missiles and the need to \"face it, the Russians are a little
harder than we are.\" Disbelieving glances would occasionally pass
between me and my one ally in the summer program, another woman, but no
one else seemed to notice.]{.underline} If the imagery is transparent,
its significance may be less so. The temptation is to draw some
conclusions about the defense intellectuals themselves-about what they
are really talking about, or their motivations; but the temptation is
worth resisting. [Individual motivations cannot neces- sarily be read
directly from imagery; the imagery itself does not originate in these
particular individuals but in a broader cultural context. Sexual imagery
has, of course, been a part of the world of warfare since long before
nuclear weapons were even a gleam in a physicist\'s eye]{.underline}.
The history of the atomic bomb project itself is rife with overt images
of competitive male sexuality, as is the discourse of the early nuclear
physi- cists, strategists, and SAC commanders.\'5 [Both the military
itself and the arms manufacturers are constantly exploiting the phallic
imagery and promise of sexual domination that their weapons so
conveniently suggest.]{.underline} A quick glance at the publications
that constitute some of the research sources for defense intellectuals
makes the depth and pervasiveness of the imagery evident. [Air Force
Magazine\'s advertisements for new weapons, for example, rival Playboy
as a catalog of men\'s sexual anxieties and fantasies.]{.underline}
Consider the following, from the June 1985 issue: emblazoned in bold
letters across the top of a two-page advertisement for the AV-8B Harrier
II-\"Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick.\" The copy below boasts \"an
exceptional thrust to weight ratio\" and \"vectored thrust capability
that makes the . .. unique rapid response possible.\" Then, just in case
we\'ve failed to get the mes- sage, the last line reminds us, \"Just the
sort of\'Big Stick\' Teddy Roosevelt had in mind way back in 1901. \"16
An ad for the BKEP (BLU-106/B) reads: The Only Way to Solve Some
Problems is to Dig Deep. THE BOMB, KINETIC ENERGY PENETRATOR \"Will
provide the tactical air commander with efficient power deny or
significantly delay enemy airfield operations.\" [\"Designed to maximize
runway cratering by optimizing penetration dynamics and utilizing the
most efficient warhead yet designed.\"17 (In case the symbolism of
\"cratering\" seems far-fetched, I must point that I am not the first to
see it. The French use the Mururoa Atoll in South Pacific for their
nuclear tests and assign a woman\'s name to eac the craters they gouge
out of the earth.)]{.underline} Another, truly extraordinary, source of
phallic imagery is to be found in descriptions of nuclear blasts
themselves. Here, for example, is o journalist William Laurence, who was
brought to Nagasaki by th Force to witness the bombing. \"Then, just
when it appeared as though thing had settled down in to a state of
permanence, there came sh out of the top a giant mushroom that increased
the size of the pillar to of 45,000 feet. The mushroom top was even more
alive than the seething and boiling in a white fury of creamy foam,
sizzling upward then descending earthward, a thousand geysers rolled
into one. It kept struggling in an elemental fury, like a creature in
the act of breaking the bonds that held it down.\"\'8 [Given the degree
to which it suffuses their world, that defense intellec- tuals
themselves use a lot of sexual imagery does not seem especially
surprising]{.underline}. Nor does it, by itself, constitute grounds for
imputing motiva- tion. For me, the interesting issue is not so much the
imagery\'s psychody- namic origins, as how it functions. [How does it
serve to make it possible for strategic planners and other defense
intellectuals to do their macabre work? How does it function in their
construction of a work world that feels tenable?]{.underline} Several
stories illustrate the complexity. During the summer program, a group of
us visited the New London Navy base where nuclear submarines are
homeported and the General Dynamics Electric Boat boatyards where a new
Trident submarine was being constructed. At one point during the trip we
took a tour of a nuclear powered submarine. [When we reached the part of
the sub where the missiles are housed, the officer accompanying us
turned with a grin and asked if we wanted to stick our hands through a
hole to \"pat the missile.\"]{.underline} Pat the missile? The image
reappeared the next week, when a lecturer scornfully declared that the
only real reason for deploying cruise and Pershing II missiles in
Western Europe was \"so that our allies can pat them.\" Some months
later, another group of us went to be briefed at NORAD (the North
American Aerospace Defense Command). On the way back, our plane went to
refuel at Offut Air Force Base, the Strategic Air Command head- quarters
near Omaha, Nebraska. When word leaked out that our landing would be
delayed because the new B-1 bomber was in the area, the plane became
charged with a tangible excitement that built as we flew in our holding
pattern, people craning their necks to try to catch a glimpse of the B-1
in the skies, and climaxed as we touched down on the runway and hurtled
past it. [Later, when I returned to the Center I encountered a man who,
unable to go on the trip, said to me enviously, \"I hear you got to pat
a B-I.\"]{.underline} What is all this \"patting\"? What are men doing
when they \"pat\" these high-tech phalluses? [Patting is an assertion of
intimacy, sexual possession, affectionate domination. The thrill and
pleasure of \"patting the missile\" is the proximity of all that phallic
power, the possibility of vicariously appro- priating it as one\'s
own.]{.underline} But if the predilection for patting phallic objects
indicates something of the homoerotic excitement suggested by the
language, it also has another side. [For patting is not only an act of
sexual intimacy. It is also what one does to babies, small children, the
pet dog. One pats that which is small, cute, and harmless-not
terrifyingly destructive. Pat it, and its lethality disappears. Much of
the sexual imagery I heard was rife with the sort of ambiguity suggested
by \"patting the missiles.\" The imagery can be construed as a deadly
serious display of the connections between masculine sexuality and the
arms race. At the same time, it can also be heard as a way of minimizing
the seriousness of militarist endeavors, of denying their deadly conse-
quences.]{.underline} A former Pentagon target analyst, in telling me
why he thought plans for \"limited nuclear war\" were ridiculous, said,
\"Look, you gotta understand that it\'s a pissing contest-you gotta
expect them to use every- thing they\'ve got.\" [What does this image
say? Most obviously, that this is all about competition for manhood, and
thus there is tremendous danger. But at the same time, the image
diminishes the contest and its outcomes, by representing it as an act of
boyish mischief.]{.underline}

### Hegemony

#### Hegemony does not create peace- their theorization uses masculine assessments for war and obscures ongoing structural violence.

Hegemony and peace ¶ [PTT claims that the greater and more stable the
concentration of power, the more peaceful that system will be. PTT
associates peace with the absence of armed conflict \'between great
powers.]{.underline} As such, [the world can still be \"at peace\" if
dozens of civil wars are going on in countries outside of the class of
\"great powers.\"]{.underline} The dominant/challenger dichotomy means
that [PTT ignores all but the most powerful states]{.underline}. Instead
of limiting the discourse on security to the concerns of the dominant
global power and the (few or even only one) challenger(s), [feminists
pay attention to the entire global political community.¶]{.underline}
The [PTT understanding of \"peace\" obscures terrible atrocities and
conceals a crucial and contradictory effect of the concentration of
power in the international arena]{.underline}. Feminist work has
consistently shown that, as the powerful wield more power, the weak feel
more pressure. [This pressure is manifested not only in the form of
interstate war, but also in civil war and structural
violence]{.underline}. **[Feminists\' interrogation of state centrism
suggests that lack of War between great states does not automatically
create peace within them]{.underline}**,\"mind that the marginalized
citizens of great states should be a topic of concern in global
politics. [Feminists\' interest in gender subordination shows that
**women\'s security and their lives are constantly at risk.**
¶]{.underline} As such, [the feminist reformulation (R2) predicts that
concentrated power is a net negative, empirically, normatively, and
epistemologically]{.underline}. Empirically, [it is likely to increase
international conflicts and internal unrest outside of the center of
power]{.underline}, and to draw attention away from the world\'s worst
humanitarian disasters. As Ann Tickner notes, [much of the violence in
the world is outside of great power war]{.underline} and, as theorists,
\"we in the west can no longer afford to privilege a tradition of
scholarship that focuses on the concerns and ambitions of great
powers.\"1Â°3 Feminists reject the dominance of the strong over the weak
as a\' mechanism of control in favor of empathy and connectedness.
[Epistemologically, feminists note different social experience produces
different knowledges.]{.underline}1Â°\"\' [A theory of international
security that excludes most people also leaves out important
knowledge]{.underline}.\"˜Â°5 An empathetic approach might increase the
inclusiveness of knowledge about global politics.¶ These insights mean
that [a feminist perspective would draw attention to the security of the
people on the margins rather than focusing on an improbable conflict
between the US and China]{.underline}. Feminist insights suggest it is
important to recognize that in a world where the US and China compete
for dominance, more than four billion other people neither compete nor
dominate. Decisions made by states with the preponderance of power-over
reverberate around the world. If the US and China decided to fight a
nuclear then their decision would be felt around the world. Even less
severe decisions by powerful states have wide-ranging impacts on
individuals\' lives. For example, the US governments decision to
condition continued military presence in South Korea on mandatory STD
testing in Korean prostitution villages impacted the social and economic
dynamic between Korean prostitutes.1¶ Neither the US nor China provides
its poorest citizens adequate humanitarian aid to avoid death from
starvation or preventable disease.\" Yet the US and China are the two
biggest military spenders in the world.\" In real terms, the most
marginalized citizens of each nation lose when strategic posturing
inspires them to focus on military readiness. [Feminists have documented
how militarization of women\'s lives decreases freedoms and changes
economic and social patterns]{.underline}.1Â°9 Because of the these
threats, feminists problematize the assumption that entities called the
US and China legitimately merit more consideration than the most
marginal citizens within those states or the citizens of states that
their dominance subordinates.

### Realism

#### Realism isn't inevitable, but their assertion is informed by masculinity---it assumes that each actor perceives its national identity in the same away, as separate from gender hierarchies that make states compete for survival in the first place.

This discussion (albeit briefly) makes the case that a struc- tural
gender order can be seen as reflected in state identities, state
relative power, and processes of state interaction, the places where
Waltz suggests structure shows. Most mainstream scholarship on the
causes of war at the international system level comes from the tradition
of structural realism (see Mearsheimer 2001; Waltz 1979). I argue that
gender analysis has something to add both to neorealist system-level
theories of war and to system-level theories that fall outside of the
neorealist paradigm. In order to see the value-added of gender analysis,
a brief discussion of those theories is necessary. ¶ [Structural
realists suggest that the international system structure (how it works)
is anarchical - that there is no government among states, and that this
anarchy is key in shaping how states behave]{.underline} (Waltz 1986).
Drawing from political theory that suggests that, before government,
life for people was \"nasty, brutish, and short\" (Hobbes 1996
\[1651\]), [realists contend that a similar reality currently rules in
the inter- national system. Without a government to protect their
rights, enforce rules, and defend their survival, states can only rely
on and trust themselves (Waltz 1979). This creates an incentive to
behave competitively with other states, since survival in anarchy is, in
this interpretation, a game where one either kills or is
killed]{.underline} (Waltz 1979). Some structural realists are called
offensive realists - they suggest that states go out, find, and take
resources in order to maximize their relative power (Elman 2004;
Mearsheimer 2001). Others are defensive real- ists - they suggest that
states amass resources to defend themselves in the event that other
states attack them (Walt 1987; Taliaferro 2000/1). **[Both see states as
fundamentally competitive, and that competition as deriving from the
anarchical international system structure. They therefore see sur- vival
as states\' primary concern, and relative power as the way that states
ensure survival]{.underline}**. ¶ While neorealist approaches dominate
system-level war theorizing, their critics also sometimes theorize the
causes of war at the system level. Neoliberal system-level theorist
David Lake (1996, 2009), for example, agrees with the realists that the
international system anarchy causes conflict, but dis- agrees with the
realist assertion that the resultant conflict is inevitable. Lake and
other neoliberal war theorists suggest that the violence of anarchy can
be tempered by positive state relationships and effective utilization of
international law (e.g., Keohane 1986). Marxist theorists also sometimes
see a system-level cause of war, but they locate it in what they have
identified as the capitalist world-system, rather than interna- tional
anarchy (Chase-Dunn and Podobnik 1995; Wallerstein 1984). These
theorists are arguing that the international system is not anarchic, but
organized by global capitalist trade, and that it is that organization
which inspires state competitiveness and (therefore) violence. **[All of
these theories share the assumption that the international system struc-
ture is gender-neutral; an assumption I argue is problem- atic. I
suggest that gender order is part of the international system
structure]{.underline}** (see Sjoberg 2012 for an expansion of this
argument). It is possible to use Waltz\'s properties of the
international system to build an understanding of the ways that system
is gendered. Waltz describes system anarchy as \"invisible\" (1979: 82)
and suggests that the invisibility of the interna- tional structure is
how observers know that it does not exist - that the system is
anarchical. He then explains that, though no one can see anarchy, it has
observable implications: a structure is the principle by which the
system is ordered, the mechanism of specification of functions of
different units within the system, and the distributor of capabilities
across those units (Waltz 1979: 81). More accessibly, Waltz expects an
international system (whether anarchy or government, which are in his
mind the only possible structures) to be the logic by which states
function, the determinant of what states do, and the distributor of
relative power among them. Waltz sees anarchy as playing this role,
where, because there is no government, states\' logics prioritize
survival, states become primarily providers of order and defense, and
states\' relative power is measured by military capability (Waltz 1959:
233). ¶ [The biggest faulty assumption that Waltz and other sys-
tem-level scholars of war make in this logic is that a structure must be
visible to exist]{.underline}. In the discussions of women\'s and men\'s
roles in wars in Chapters 2 and 3, gender analysis routinely confronted
roles that people play in wars that are invisible in war narratives. It
also revealed narrative limits on ¶ people\'s roles in wars that come
from the invisible gendered logics of war. In other words, [no one
writes out wars\' gen- dered scripts; wars have just come to function
with those ideal-typical gender roles as a crucial element. While it is
possible to see manifestations of gender orders everywhere - from
women\'s economic inequalities to the ways men and women are expected to
dress - it is not possible to see gender orders. Perhaps the
international system contains a gender ¶ order that Waltz could not
see]{.underline}? [The evidence discussed above that gender hierarchy
provides an ordering principle for the international system, specifies
the functions of units, and distributes capabilities among them suggests
the existence of such a gender order]{.underline}. [¶ **Seeing a gender
order as part of the international system structure has implications for
ways to think about war and conflict.**]{.underline} Structural IR
theorists see international anarchy as a permissive cause of war - war
is possible because there is no government between states. Though that
may be true, other theorists (e.g., Suganami 1996) argue that there is
nothing inherent in anarchy that necessitates the competition that we
see between states. [There is, however, something essential about
structural gender hierarchy that necessitates ¶ (gendered) competition.
Since gender-based traits are often measured relatively, structural
gender hierarchy provides an incentive for not only competition but also
competition for relative position along gender hierarchies - the very
sort of competition that states engage in regularly in the interna-
tional arena. Seeing gender hierarchy as a permissive cause of war,
then, explains more about the possibility of war than seeing anarchy as
the only system-structural principle.]{.underline}

[One element of a gender-hierarchical international system would be that
that assumptions about gender underlie the structure and ordering
prin-ciples of the international system and provide commonsense ground
for theorizing them. This is an observation consonant with feminist
observations of global politics, which have characterized the global
political arena as a 'patriarchal structure of privilege and
control']{.underline} (Enloe 1993, 70). Others see the global political
arena a place where 'the structure of political communities has assumed
gendered forms' (Steans 2003, 43), and ordered by 'gender relations
\[which\] structure social power' (Pettman 1996, 43). [These
observations are rooted in feminist work which shows gender operating in
how political leaders are chosen]{.underline} (Tickner 1992), [how state
governments work]{.underline} (Peterson 1992), [how militaries
function]{.underline} (Enloe 1989), [and how economic benefit is
distributed]{.underline} (Pettman 1996). [States have been shown their
relative military prowess, judged and asserted their relative power, and
demonstrated and adjusted their relative economic status through
gendered competition using gendered language]{.underline} (e.g. Cohn
1988). [The gender hierarchy in the world 'out there' can be read as
replicated in the 'commonsense ground' or traditional theorizing in IR,
which feminist theorists]{.underline} (e.g. Tickner 1988) [have
characterized as partial at best and unre- presentative at worst because
it often analyzes the perspectives and lives of only a small, elite,
male portion of the global population]{.underline}. ¶ [This theme in
feminist theorizing in IR suggests that there might be something to the
idea that **international structures are theorized as gender- neutral
because men take their perspectives to represent the
human**]{.underline}. Feminists have characterized conventional
knowledge in IR as problematic because it is constructed only by those
in a position of privilege, which affords them only distorted views of
the world.14 As such, [it has been a crucial part of the feminist
project in IR to 'not only add women but also ask how gender -- a
structural feature of social life -- has been rendered invisible' by
working to 'distinguish ''reality'' from the world as men know
it']{.underline} (Peterson and True 1998, 23). Often, [in disciplinary
knowledges, 'gender' is seen as a proxy for 'women' because 'women' are
perceived to have gender, where men are not.]{.underline} ¶ Another
element of a gendered international system structure would be that, when
it is acknowledged that gender plays a role in global politics, ¶ it is
often discussed as a corruption of a gender-neutral system rather than a
product of a gendered system. For example, work like that of Inglehart
and Norris (2002) and Hudson et al. (2009)15 argues that [it is states
that treat their women the worst that corrupt not only the gender order
but the potential for interstate peace, cooperation, and development.
This logic is replicated in many discussions of gender in the policy
world as well]{.underline}. For example, 'gender mainstreaming' agendas
(see True and Mintrom 2001; Shepherd 2008) engage in a process of
integrating gender concerns into the structures that already exist in
governments and organizations. The scenario derived from Acker's
theorizing suggests that when gender sub- ordination is characterized as
the exception, rather than the rule, in international political
interactions, gender is difficult to see because the masculine is at
once assumed and invisible. The recurrent focus in feminist work on the
need to ask IR theory 'where are the women?' (Enloe 1983) and 'where is
gender?' (Bell and O'Rourke 2007) suggests that [it is plausible that
gender is difficult to see in IR because the masculine dominates our
visions of the international system. It is important to note that the
masculine here involves and implicates, but is not reducible to,
men.]{.underline} ¶ Waltz 'tests' his idea of structure primarily by its
predictive power and its indirect manifestations (1986, 72). He argues
that, since the anarchical nature of the international system is
invisible and thus cannot be directly verified or proven, it must be
verified by its manifestations and implica- tions (Waltz 1986, 73). This
verification, to Waltz, comes by examining unit function, distribution
of capabilities across units, and political pro- cesses of unit
interaction. The remainder of this section considers whether there is
evidence in those three observable parts of global politics that the
international system may be gender-hierarchical. ¶ Unit function: does
state identity have gendered components? ¶ In Waltz's account, 'a system
is composed of a structure and of interacting units' where 'the
structure is the system-wide component that makes it possible to think
about the system as a whole' and 'the arrangement of units is a property
of the system' (1986, 70, 71). [Waltz sees the system as an anarchy,
which by definition specifies that units have the same
function]{.underline}. Still, Waltz gives a sense of what would be
different if the system was a hierarchy, since 'hierarchy entails
relations of super- and subordination among a system's parts, and that
implies their differentiation' (1986, 87). Calling states 'like units'
in Waltz's terms is 'to say that each state is like ¶ all other states
in being an autonomous political unit' (Waltz 1986, 89). [Waltz sees
states as performing fundamentally similar tasks in similar ways, and
argues that the differences between states are in capabilities not in
function or task (1986]{.underline}, 91). ¶ This section explores two
arguments about gender and the function of the units of the
international system. First, it argues that gender can be seen as
constituting unit 'function' in the international system, whether the
units are 'like' or differentiated. Second, it proposes that gender
hierarchy actually differentiates unit function in the international
system. ¶ [The argument that gender constitutes the function of all
units in the international system is supported by the degree to which
states define their identities (and therefore the tasks of domestic and
foreign policy) in gendered ways]{.underline}. A growing literature on
[ontological security (e.g. Mitzen 2006; Steele 2008) characterizes
state identity in terms of 'sense of self,' a language that has long
been used in feminist accounts of nation and nationalism. Feminists who
have worked on nationalism have argued that national identity and gender
are inextricably linked, and that 'all nationalism are gendered, all
nationalisms are invented, and all are dangerous']{.underline}
(McClintock 1993).16 [Feminists have shown that gendered imagery is
salient in the construction national identities, particularly when,
often, women are the essence of, the symbols of, and the reproduction of
state and/or national identity]{.underline} (Yuval-Davis 1997; Wilcox
2009). ¶ A number of examples illustrate the link between national
identity and gender. [Feminist studies have demonstrated that gender has
been essential to defining state identity in Korea]{.underline} (Moon
1997), modernizing Malaysia (Chin 1998), Bengal (Sen 1993), Indonesia
(Sunindyo 1998), Northern Ireland (Porter 1998), South Africa (Meintjes
1998), Lebanon (Schulze 1998), Armenia (Tachjian 2009), and a number of
other states. For example, Niva has noted that, [during the First Gulf
War, the United States' identity was understood as a 'tough but tender'
masculinity where it was expected that the United States military would
courageously defeat the Iraqi military, but would at the same time
rescue the feminine state of Kuwait from the hypermasculine clutches of
the Iraqi state]{.underline} (1998). On the other hand, responding to
the United States' and United Nations' threats of military intervention
in Kuwait, Saddam Hussein's Iraq consistently used gendered references
to hypermasculine understandings of state identity (Sjoberg 2006b).
[Gendered nationalisms, however, do not just arise in ¶ conflict
situations]{.underline}. Bannerji has noted that Canadian national
identities are constructed through 'race,' class, gender, and other
relations of power, where subordinate classes and 'races' are feminized
in relation to the dominant image of Canadian identity, not only within
the Canadian state but also in Canada's external projection of
nationalist identity (2000, 173). Taylor's analysis of the 'Dirty War'
in Argentina characterizes identity in the conflict as 'predicated on
the internalization of a rigid hierarchy' of gender and argues that 'the
struggle, as each group aimed to humiliate, humble, and feminize its
other, was about gender' (1997, 92, 34). ¶ A brief look at one example
recently used in the literature might further illustrate the point. In
his book, Ontological Security in International Relations, Steele (2008)
notes that honor and shame shape states' self- perception of their
identities. Contrary to the realist logic that state prioritizes
prudence and survival over honor and justice, Steele sees honor as a
universal part of state self-identity, where states look for honor even
sacrificing physical integrity. To illustrate the role of honor in state
self- identity, Steele uses the example of the Belgian choice to fight a
losing war against the Germans in 1914 rather than allow Germany access
to Belgian territory and avoid the casualties and terror involved in
their inevitable defeat. Steele notes that honor was implicated in
Belgium's response to Germany's ultimatum, given that most policy
statements stressed their need to 'fight for the honor of the flag' and
'avenge Belgian honor' (Steele 2008, 112). [¶ Feminist analysis suggests
that we cannot understand the role of honor in state self-identity
without reference to both masculine and feminine conceptions of honor in
the state]{.underline} (Jowkar 1986). [Masculine conceptions of honor
vary between chivalric and protection-oriented and aggressive and
prideful, while feminine conceptions of honor often focus on the purity
and innocence of the territory of the state and/or the women and
children inside]{.underline} (see Elshtain 1985). Through gender lenses,
the Belgian discussion of national honor in 1914 was one where the
leaders' (mas- culine) honor was tied to not giving in to, and even
resisting, the would-be violators of the territory's (feminine) honor,
which was tied to purity. The 'honor' of the Belgian government then was
tied to unwillingness to sacrifice the 'honor' of the innocent, neutral,
vulnerable, and untouchable identity and position of Belgium vis a vis
its neighboring Germany. It is no coincidence that the following attack
was referred to as the 'Rape of Belgium' (Niarchos 1995). In the 'Rape
of Belgium' narrative, the German invasion spoiled the feminine elements
of Belgian state identity, and emasculated Belgian leaders as protectors
of its feminized territory. Survival or prudence cannot account for
Belgium's actions in 1914; in fact, as Steele pointed out, Belgium acted
contrary to both. Honor can explain the ¶ behavior, but neither the form
nor function of that honor is clear without accounting for the gendered
elements of Belgian state identity. [The story about gendered state
identity can also be read onto Germany (as a hypermasculine aggressor)
and Britain (as a chivalrous protector). ¶ While some might see the
influence of gender on state or national identity as a 'second-image' or
unit-level explanation,17 Waltz explains that a factor is structural if
it is not influencing state identity (and therefore state function) in
states individually, but instead influencing the identities (and
therefore functions) of states generally]{.underline}. In other words,
forces that define one state's identity or five states' identities are
second- image; forces that influence all states identities are
third-image. [Feminist scholars have shown that 'nationalism is
naturalized, and legitimated, through gender discourses that naturalized
the domination of one group over another through the disparagement of
the feminine']{.underline} (Peterson 1999). [These gender hierarchies
are always present even if specific genders and their orders in
hierarchies are fungible. In other words, it is not particular
nationalisms that are gendered (and some nationalisms that are not), it
is that gender hierarchy as a structural feature of global politics
defines the properties and functions of the system's constituent units,
including their national identities.]{.underline} All nationalisms being
gendered does not mean that all nationalisms are the same, however. ¶
[The mechanism through which gender hierarchy can be seen to influ- ence
national identity and state function is through the link between any
given state's national identity and the 'hegemonic masculinity,' or
parti- cular ideal-typical gender that is on top of the gender hierarchy
that state 'units' are situated in at any given time and
place]{.underline} (Hooper 1998, 34). The argument that states'
structures and functions are often defined by mas- culinities (see
Peterson 1992) is not based on the observation that states are (mostly)
governed by men**[. Instead, as Connell explains, 'the state
organizational practices are structured in relation to the reproductive
arena']{.underline}** (1995, 73). [Some states' hegemonic masculinities
are aggressive and projected, others are tough but tender, and still
others are stoic and reserved. All hegemonic masculinities relate to a
feminized other, but they do so in different ways: some encourage
violating it, some define themselves in ¶ opposition to it, some
understand it as treasured and to be protected, and some mix elements of
all of the above. The gendered nature of national identities influences
the function of states, particularly in the areas of war- making and
war-fighting, but also in terms of citizenship, economic organization,
diplomatic relations, and involvement in international
organizations.]{.underline}18 For example[, feminists have catalogued
throughout the history of the modern state system a relationship between
military service, masculinity, and full citizenship]{.underline} (either
de jure or de facto) in states (Moscovici 2000). ¶ Though the
relationship between gender and nationalism generally (and genders and
nationalisms specifically) influences the function of units whether they
are like units (in anarchy) or not like units (indicative of a
hierarchical system in Waltz's terms), [evidence of different gendered
nationalisms suggests that gender hierarchy in global politics
differentiates between functions of units in the system rather than
dictating that all units function similarly.]{.underline} Units in the
system (even defined in the narrow realist terms where only states count
as units) do have many similar functions in terms of governance,
education, health care, and the like. [But especially in their external
relations, states also have a number of differentiated functions. Some
states were/are colonizers, some states were colonized and still deal
with remaining markers of colonization. Some states are aggressors,
while other states are the victims of aggression. Some states are
protectors, while other states require protection. Some states provide
peacekeeping troops, international humanitarian aid, and other public
goods, while other states do not serve those functions, depending on
state identity]{.underline} (e.g. Savery 2007). [Some states serve to
facilitate international cooperation while others act as cogs in
cooperation's wheels. Some states see their masculinity as affirmed in
the interstate equivalent of rape and pillage, while other states see it
in chivalry, honor, and a sense of the genteel]{.underline}. ¶ While
Waltz might classify these differences as merely capabilities gaps,
different state functions in the community of states do not map one-to-
one onto capabilities. Instead, I propose that they map onto the ways
that gender shapes state identities and functions. As Peterson (2010)
notes, 'not only subjects but also concepts, desires, tastes, styles,
ways of knowing y can be \[masculinized or\] feminized,' such that
**[states' ontological security is related to their gendered
identities.]{.underline}** For example, a number of feminist analyses of
the United States during the first Gulf War identify its policy ¶
choices and military strategies as consonant with a new, post-Cold War
'tough-but-tender' image of the United States' masculinity, which
maintained the Cold War-era projection of strength, but added an element
of sensitivity and a chivalric conception of protecting the weak (e.g.
Niva 1998; Sjoberg 2006a). [Seemingly inconsonant functions for the US
military as at once an attack force and a tool for protection then make
sense, because the state does function differently based on its
self-perception of identity, which might be seen as (at least in part) a
product of structural gender hierarchy in the international
arena.]{.underline}

### Warming/Climate Change

#### GCMs and mainstream climate science are entrenched in masculinity which distorts their conclusions and erases the gendered nature of warming

Gender Critique of Climate Change Science

If gender matters in some medical research, does it matter in all
medical research, or all scientific research, especially climate
science? Various critics of the research findings of the IPCC have
focused on its reliance on large-scale general circulation models
(GCMs).69 [Feminist scholars argue that GCMs reflect a classically
masculine approach which minimizes knowledge gained from human lived
experience in favor of abstract mathematical representations of
reality]{.underline}.7°Climate change skeptics charge that the models
are \"alarmist\" social constructions that generate \"phantom threats\"
designed to satisfy environmental press groups and to promote
scientists\' self-interest in fame and funding. Beyond their negative
evaluations of GCMs, there is little other common ground for proponents
of these two critiques, though both likely would agree that:¶ \[I\]t is
difficult to imagine an environmental phenomenon less directly
observable, more remote from everyday experience, and more dependent on
the technical apparatus of science for con-structing its apparent
\"reality\" than the so-called greenhouse effect.72¶ Although GCMs are
acknowledged by their designers to be complex, inaccurate, and
incomplete representations of the actual global climate system, they are
the backbone of the IPCC reports.73 [Climate models rest on the prestige
of their mainly male designers (prominent scientists and engineers),
advanced technology used to create them (supercomputers), technical
language]{.underline} (Navier-Stokes equations and computation ally
intensive numerical models), [and elevated status of the institution
where they are refined and tested (national laboratories, scientific
agencies, leading universities]{.underline}).¶ The work of climate
scientists and the IPCC has been and remain essential to understanding
the physical processes associated with climate change and sounding the
alarm about its seriousness. The predictions of these models and the
science that supported them were\' the basis of our discussion of
climate change and its impacts in the¶ previous three chapters. In fact,
we spent the last two entire chapters examining the impacts of climate
change on men and women, relying largely on the findings associated with
GCMs reported in the 2013 IPCC\'s AR5, Climate Change 2013: 1he Physical
Science Basis**[. Despite the importance of this research, there have
been major]{.underline}** ~~blind spots~~ [**weaknesses in**¶ **climate
science and the work of the IPCC, particularly in the area of**¶
**climate justice, and especially with regard to gender inequalities
related to climate change.**¶]{.underline} In the first three chapters
of this book on gender and climate change we¶ depended on [the 1552-page
IPCC Working Group I report on Climate Change 2013]{.underline} - The
Physical Science Basis to estimate the gendered¶ implications of its
predictions, though [**the words "gender" or**¶ **"women\'\' never
appear in its pages.**]{.underline} A [word search of the report does,
however generate dozens of entries for \"human,\" mostly referring to
human influence on the climate system.]{.underline} [Apparently the
IPCC\'s]{.underline} AR5 Working Group I [is interested in humans, but
not men or women.]{.underline} A similar search of the IPCC AR5 of
Working Group II\'s \"Summary for Policymakers,\" which focused on
climate change \"impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability,\" yields
similar results - no men or women, only humans. The same absence of
references to gender or women characterized IPCC ARS of Working Group
Ill\'s \"Summary for Policymakers,\" which focused on \"mitigation of
climate change.\" Some of the chapters of the full Working Group II and
III reports do reference gender and women, but they do not discuss men,
and few readers look beyond the more succinct \"Summary\" documents,
since presumably that is what is important for policymakers and
non-specialists to know[.¶ The disjuncture between \"human\'\' causes
and impacts of climate ¶ change and the gender causes and impacts, or
the class or racial or regional or age-related causes and impacts of
reflects the level of generality of much climate change science,
including climate models]{.underline}. [Climate science depicts the
causes and impacts of climate change as a universal process in which
human distinctions are irrelevant. This emphasis on \"human\" obscures
differences between men and women, rich and poor, young and old,
educated and uneducated, urban and rural, or global North and global
South as they¶ relate to the causes and consequences of climate
change]{.underline}. "[**Human\" implies a common and equal contribution
to and fate in the face of climate chance.**¶]{.underline} ["Human"
ignores unequal inputs as well as unequal impacts within ¶ and across
populations]{.underline}. [**A critique of this universalism is that
while we all may be human, and we all may be in this**¶ **together, we
do not all equally contribute to the problem,**¶ **nor are we going to
have the same experience of climate change**]{.underline}. The IPP
acknowledges¶ that historically [most greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
originated in the global North with increasingly catastrophic effects in
the global South.]{.underline} Its failure to deconstruct
\"anthropogenic" climate change, however, obscures the raced, classed,
and gendered nature of both its causes and consequences[**.**¶ **The
focus of GCMs and IPCC reports on \"humans\" creates a comfortable
\"objectivity\" and distance for the model makers- a safe space that
equalizes blame for the problem being studied by**¶ **mostly male
climate scientists from developed countries**]{.underline}. [By¶
emphasizing the "human contribution\" to climate change, researchers
can¶ ignore exactly which groups of humans are doing the causing and
paper over who is responsible for climate injustices and
inequality.]{.underline} How should we understand climate modelers\'
difference-erasing focus on the universal \"human\'\' aspects of climate
change? The study of gender inequalities in European molecular biology
cited above offers two possible explanations: [the emphasis on \"human\"
is because male scientists do not see any significant differences among
humans, or because they prefer not to acknowledge differences that are
an indictment of the system in which they have not only an
investment]{.underline},¶ but a controlling interest. Critics make a
direct connection between¶ [the overrepresentation of men in climate
science and policy and the¶ gender biases and]{.underline} ~~blind
spots~~ [weaknesses in both climate science and climate
policy]{.underline}.¶ Men dominate the issue at all levels, as
scientific and economic experts, entrepeneurs, policy makers and
spokespeople. Since the 1970s climate change had been identified and
explained by natural scientists\... It is not irrelevant that the
majority of climate scientists are men. The Intergovernmental Panel on ¶
Climate Change (IPCC) is mostly made up of male scientists, with
\"chairman\'\' Rajendra Pachauri leading at the global level. Men also
dominate in the climate policy arena \... [The most prominent
politicians associated with the issue are male]{.underline} \... In 2007
[an Internet survey of \"global consumers\" in 47
countries]{.underline}¶ conducted by The Nielsen Company and Oxford
University [found that 18 out of the 22 \"most influential spokespeople
on climate change" are men.]{.underline}

### Econ

#### Reducing life to existing economic markers disavows the really-existing labor such as care and nurturing which aren't given an economic valuation. Such a masculine measure of economics epistemically guarantees their predictions are false while sustaining exploitation and violence against women.

**[Theorising Finance as Gendered and Embodied]{.underline}** [The
centrality of bodies to economic processes is a basic ontological
premise]{.underline} that underpins the great majority [of feminist
economics]{.underline} and feminist International Political Economy
(IPE), though this is often implicit rather than explicit. Drawing on
fem- inist and historical materialist scholarship, [we can identify
three theoretical entry points,]{.underline} or premises, that [are
useful for thinking about both the inherently embodied nature of finance
and the specific ways in which]{.underline} TBF [agendas work to
produce, or at times to disappear, bodies. The first premise is that all
economies]{.underline}, including financial economies[, are constituted
by productive and reproductive labour, including the labour associated
with biological reproduction]{.underline}. Insofar [as]{.underline} many
of the [projects]{.underline} associ- ated with TBF **[remove from view
the]{.underline}** vast amounts of **[labour linked to social
reproduction, they intensify the demands placed on women as workers and
nurturers]{.underline}**. The second premise is that [we are witnessing
the increasing "financialisation of social reproduction",]{.underline}
which is [contributing to the commodification of women's bodily
capacities as they are projected as "untapped resources" in need of
exploitation]{.underline} by (Western) capital. The third premise is
that [financial deepening contributes to the differential production of
bodies, which includes the production of differences between bodies that
stem from the differential valuation of their labour (the valuation of
paid above unpaid, productive above reproductive]{.underline}, etc.).
The production of differ- ence also takes shape here through processes
that work to ostensibly erase the bodies of financial consumers in the
Global North (i.e. **[through "abstract" assessments of
risk]{.underline}**) while actively producing financial consumers in the
Global South as "people of the body" who make good investments precisely
because of their association with maternalism. I will elaborate each of
these in turn. (1) [Economies are constituted by productive and
reproductive labour, including the labour associated with biological
reproduction]{.underline}. The first theoretical entry point is based on
the observation first made by socialist feminists in the 1970s and 1980s
that the economy is constituted by the social relations of labour that
are involved in the production and exchange of commod- ities and the
meeting of human needs on a daily and generational basis.8 These latter
forms of labour are now more commonly described as "social
reproduction", which has a distinctly embodied dimension as it includes
the work associated with: (a) biological reproduction (including social
constructions of motherhood); (b) the reproduction, socialisation and
education of the labour force; and (c) the reproduc- tion and
provisioning of care.9 [This work is linked to historically specific
ideals regarding the gendered division of labour]{.underline} that
[feminise the (paid and unpaid) work of social reproduction and
contribute to its devaluation.]{.underline}10 Given that **[finance is
deeply connected to other forms of production and exchange, it should
also be seen as structurally linked to labouring bodies]{.underline}**,
as well as to **[the mothering and caring bodies that together perform
the productive and reproductive labour underpinning accumulation in
capitalist societies.]{.underline}** Most [mainstream
economics]{.underline} would [reject this view]{.underline} of finance,
as [finance tends to be treated as an objective]{.underline} (and
pseudo-scientific) [tool that is used to allocate assets and liabilities
across tim]{.underline}e. [Bodies,]{.underline} as bearers of productive
and reproductive labour, [do not]{.underline} generally [appear at all,
though an abstract figure of homo oeconomicus does figure into the
analysis]{.underline}. In this andocentric model, [homo oeconomicus is
presumed to represent all people, appearing as both disembodied and
socially disembedded. Feminist economists have called this the
"separative-self model]{.underline}", as it [abstracts the
utility-maximizing rational actor away from all other social forms and
leaves little to no room for considering non-maximizing behaviour and
motivations]{.underline} (i.e., love, nurture, altruism, etc.).11 Yet,
[in the process of removing the material body from economic
analysis,]{.underline} it simultaneously [works to devalue the bodies of
those tradition- ally associated with "non-rational" and "emotional"
behaviour, which have historically included the poor, women and
non-European "others]{.underline}".12 What is particularly interesting
when using this lens to look at the gender dis- courses of TBF is that
while it tends to adhere to a neoclassical view of markets as
coordinating mechanisms that are fundamentally disembodied and gender-
neutral, it also draws on a historically constructed view of female
economic actors as mothering and nurturing. That is, the body reappears
here as women's higher aversion to risk and greater likelihood to invest
in their children is natura- lised, and implicitly linked to their
(socio-)biological role as mothers. Yet, as I will further evidence in
the third section, this does not lead the proponents of TBF to see
markets as inherently gendered, but rather, [gender continues to be
externalised from broader economic processes]{.underline}. (2) The
["financialisation of social reproduction" is rendering women's bodies
particularly susceptible to processes of commodification and
exploitation]{.underline} A second theoretical entry point for thinking
about the relationship between finance, gender and bodies has been
opened up by recent writing on what we might refer to as "the
financialisation of social reproduction", by which I mean the mediation
of social reproduction through financial markets and interest- paying
financial transactions.13 For instance, it has been well documented in
the academic and policy literature that finance has become increasingly
important in mediating the social relations of housing (i.e. through
privatised and securitised mortgage financing), forms of consumption
(i.e. by using credit cards to pay for food), education (i.e. though
student loans and, in the US, loans to pay for all levels of schooling),
security in old age (i.e. through the privatisation of pension plans),
and so on.14 In one of the clearest theoretical engagements with this
trend, Bryan, Martin and Rafferty point out that the linking of
financial circuits of accumulation to the reproduction of
labour---though interest payments made on credit used to buy the
commodities necessary for reproduction and other means---is helping to
reconstitute labour as a form of capital.15 Although very little of this
literature deploys a gender analysis or uses a frame- work of social
reproduction per se, it is important in offering empirical evidence
regarding the ways in which social reproduction, which has always been
structu- rally linked to the accumulation of capital, is increasingly
being structurally linked to finance. Given women's positioning at the
crossroads of production and social reproduction, it is therefore rather
unsurprising that women's bodies are increasingly being framed as
"untapped resources" that offer potential profits to financial and other
firms.

### Gendered Language

#### Their \_\_\_\_\_\_ evidence uncritically uses gendered language, which is a reason to reject their argument entirely. Gendered language discourages women to enter the field of IR and naturalizes patriarchal norms.

words, the connotation shapes the meaning of words, which shapes our
understanding of concepts. [Many gendered words, like "mankind," have
perfectly good alternatives that eschew any reference to gender, like
"humankind" or "humanity."]{.underline} These linguistic options, in
addition to the [decreasing popularity of gendered
words](https://www.academia.edu/1597246/The_extinction_of_masculine_generics)
in the social sciences, present a puzzle for IR: [why are so many IR
academics still using gendered language, when they don't have to, and
when they should know better?¶ The list of gendered IR terms is long:
"statesman," "brinksmanship," "man-made," "mankind," "manning," and
"manpower" are some of the most common]{.underline}. [As a young woman
pursuing a career in mainstream IR, and with an interest in security
studies, these words add insult to the injury of seeing panels, syllabi,
and the [TRIPS survey](https://trip.wm.edu/reports/2014/rp_2014/)
dominated by men. These discouragements to women entering a
male-dominated field are often overlooked because they are
psychological]{.underline}. Being one of few women in an ISA panel makes
one feel highly visible at best, and unwelcome at worst. [Gendered
language sends the message that I am not expected to be a foreign
policymaker (because authors choose "statesman") or the chair of a
committee]{.underline} (because authors choose "chairman"). These kinds
of daily exclusions weigh on my psyche.¶ I am often told, in response to
such complaints, that I should take a class, attend a panel, or contact
a scholar who works on Feminist IR theory. I am a materialist, a
theorist of geopolitics. I should not have to change my scholarly
interest in order to find an inclusive community. No subject or topic is
inherently male-dominated, so there must be something discouraging women
from pursuing the most masculinized areas of study[. It is the
responsibility of all IR scholars to help identify and extirpate the
reasons young women are deterred from particular topics. The best places
to look are those where we make active choices, choices that can be
re-thought and re-directed to neutralize the highly gendered spaces we
create with our words and actions]{.underline}.¶ Replacing "man-made"
with "anthropogenic," or coining "brinkship" to replace "brinksmanship,"
will not solve the gender problem in International Relations, but it
will increase the visibility of [our quotidian contributions to
patriarchy](http://search.proquest.com/docview/1530414732?accountid=11752).
What we read reinforces what we see, and what we write [reflects what we
want to
see](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3ASERS.0000037757.73192.06).
I do not see myself in most of the texts that I study and engage with. I
do not see people who look like me on the Presidential Theme Panels at
the ISA. Affirmative action in admissions, hiring, and panel placement
can only do so much because there is problem of "self selection[." We
need to seriously consider the idea that women select their field at
least partially because of the "man-made" social environment that
surrounds it.¶ **My power is not "manpower," but it is just as
strong.**]{.underline}

### Inevitability of Violence

#### Claiming violence is inevitable is what justifies the logic of "the worse of two evils" and necessitates a security state to protect against such violence.

**Wright '10** (Susan is Research Scientist in History of Science and
International Relations in the Institute for Research on Women and
Gender at the University of Michigan. "10 Feminist theory and arms
control." In Gender and International Security. Pg. 206-207.
2010.)-GirlsDebate

Bull and Schelling justify the use of "power over" states that are
treated as adversaries, or potential adversaries, in several ways.
First, violence in the state system, and therefore the need to defend
against it, are taken as given. As Bull wrote: It is true that
strategists take the fact of military force as their starting point ...
The capacity for organized violence between states is inherent in the
nature of man and the environment. The most that can be expected from a
total disarmament agreement is that it might make armaments and armed
forces fewer and more primitive.75 [This claim of the inevitability of
violence and the consequent need for military protection have been
extensively analyzed by feminist theorists. If violence is inevitable,
then someone or something is required to defend against it.]{.underline}
Jean Elshtain, Laura Sjoberg, and other feminist theorists have
demonstrated [the pervasive tradition of western political thought that
claims that the inevitability of violence calls for the services of a
Just Warrior]{.underline} (representing variously the state military
apparatus or the soldier) [who is "engaged in the regrettable but
sometimes necessary task of collective violence in order to prevent some
greater wrong" to the Beautiful Soul, representing variously patria or
the homeland or innocent civilians]{.underline}.76 Bull's political
philosophy falls completely within this tradition.

### National Security

#### National security is profoundly gendered- it relies on binaries like protector/protected that sanitize global violence and shut down questions about militarism

[This article offers a gendered reading of]{.underline} three recent
events under newly elected Donald J[. Trump:]{.underline} the attempt to
build a 'beautiful wall' between Mexico and the United States, the
recent Mother Of All Bombs (MOAB) military strike in Afghanistan and the
'locker room talk' scandal that emerged during the 2016 election
campaign[. I relate these events to international security by
**disturbing the cultural grammar** on which these events are founded
and respond to the feminist call that '[the personal is international
and the international is personal']{.mark}]{.underline} (Enloe \[1989\]
2000). [A feminist American foreign policy analysis of '100 Days of
Trump' brings attention to the ways in which [bordering
practices]{.mark}]{.underline} like wall-building and military
interventions [[are rendered legit]{.mark}imate [through]{.mark}
**constructed [gendered tropes
]{.mark}**[that]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in turn,
[[transform]{.mark} the wider [w]{.mark}ar [o]{.mark}n
[t]{.mark}errorism [into]{.mark} a [private 'family
affair']{.mark}.]{.underline} In this light, [[military strikes are
not]{.mark} political [acts requiring legitimation]{.mark} in the public
sphere [but]{.mark} instead are necessary [disciplinary tools
**unqualified for** ]{.mark}**political
[discussion]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The field of [International Security
addresses]{.underline} questions about [the interactions
between]{.underline} more or less secure [sovereign states in an
anarchical international system but **tends to ignore** questions about
gender.]{.underline} In this view, states are considered as clearly
separated entities in an anarchical international system 'who' become
'alive' by being attributed anthropomorphic qualities: they have a
'body' (the nation) and a mind (the state) with a capacity to think
'rationally' (Wadley 2010, 38). As Wadley (2010) notes, 'this means that
states are gendered, and are gendered in much the same way as people
are: through repeated performances'. An example of this performance is
the recent launch of the MOAB attack in the Nangarhar province. On 13
April 2017, the US military sent the largest non-nuclear bomb to
Afghanistan, which impact, according to Afghans, 'felt like the heavens
were falling' (Rasmussen for The Guardian, Rasmussen 2017). This
colloquialism, which has dominated most accounts of the attack, has
three important functions. First, it feminises the Other (the Islamic
State) by forcing the Islamic State to be passive through the act of a
feminine actor, the 'Mother'. According to White House Press Secretary
Sean Spicer (2017), the 'Mother' was launched to deny the Islamic State
'operational access'. In turn, the feminisation of the Islamic State
reaffirms US masculinity and agency. Linda Åhäll (2015) argues that
ideas of motherhood and maternalism are valued as agency in
International Relations (IR). Indeed, the 'Mother attack' is written as
a powerful manifestation of US power. The strike is described with
action verbs underpinned by sexualised masculine tropes of aggression,
all in the active voice. The MOAB, is 'designed for destroying
underground targets but is not a deep-earth penetrating weapon'
(Rasmussen 2017 emphasis added). It 'exploded above a complex of caves
and tunnels' and 'killed dozens of ISIS fighters' (CNN 2017 emphasis
added). This excitement was shared by Fox News talk show host Geraldo
Rivera and guests, who broadcasted the video over the top of country
singer Toby Keith singing 'courtesy of the red, white and blue' and
praised the attack as 'what freedom looks like' (Jamieson 2017). Making
weapons exciting is not new. Carol Cohn (1987) has written in length
about the phallic imagery that suffused the world of defence
intellectuals during the Cold War. Cohn (1987) suggests that the words
that described nuclear weapons as 'vertical erectors, thrustto-weight
ratios, soft lay downs, deep penetration' constitute a form of distance
by removing military strategists from the possibilities of nuclear
destruction and instead making them thrilling. As Duncanson and Eschle
(2008, 549) argue, 'it makes the nuclear arms race seem the stuff of
funny locker-room rivalry, denying its deadly consequences'. While
action and sexualised verbs describing the strike has the potential to
make military endeavours exciting while minimising harm, the reference
to a 'Mother' also associates the strike with something that is
instinctive, maternal and thus the product of a natural order. The work
of Ruth Bloch (1978) on the rise of the Moral Mother in America in the
mid-nineteenth century is quite insightful here. From the eighteenth
century onwards, printed literature began to stress the unique value of
the maternal role (Bloch 1978, 109). It merged New England Puritan ideas
about women as 'help-meet', a form of domestic competence in assisting
roles for men and essentially female subordination to them, and
eighteenth-century notions of purity, femininity and ornamental
refinement. In examining childcare books of this period, Bloch (1978)
finds that mothers, who were considered as the natural carers of their
infant, were also expected to 'establish gentle but firm discipline as
early as possible'. In this 'MOAB' war story, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is made the]{.mark} natural and [legit]{.mark}imate
[actor who can nurse the Islamic State]{.mark} and be in charge of their
physical management]{.underline} ('denying them operational space').
More importantly, this war story equates the attack to a moral mission,
just as women were idealised above all as 'transmitters of moral values'
(Bloch 1978). Concomitantly, [the ultimate [goal of the strike
becomes]{.mark} one of **[protection]{.mark}**, moral directive and
nurture, [defining]{.mark} the [relationship between a]{.mark} Moral
[Mother and]{.mark} her [infant]{.mark}, and [not]{.mark} one of [war,
aggressiveness or masculinity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Launching the
GBU-43/B in the Nangahar province is a moral duty of care, just as Moral
Mothers had a duty to protect their infant. Therefore, calling the
largest airdrop munitions in the US arsenal a 'Mother' also infantilises
the Islamic State. In this construction, bombing the Islamic State is
not an act of war, but a necessary act of discipline of badly behaved
children.1 [Family tropes shape perception of military interventions by
making certain interpretations more visible]{.underline} than others.
For instance, referring to NATO at the end of the Cold War as a 'nuclear
family' that welcomed ex-Soviet countries who 'just got divorced' and
'looking to get married immediately' attempt to naturalise unequal
relations of power between countries in the international system
(Costigliola 1997, 163). The second repeated performance reaffirming the
gendered nature of the United States involves the practice of
wall-building. [At the heart of]{.underline} 'America First' and
'[[m]{.mark}ake [A]{.mark}merica [g]{.mark}reat [a]{.mark}gain' [is the
idea]{.mark} of [a community]{.mark} that [is in
decline]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not only does America 'not win anymore'
but America is letting others control and dominate the American nation.
On the one hand, [[the nation is gendered by acquiring]{.mark} a
[status]{.mark} of being threatened and [in need of
protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. 'Bringing back borders' here
constitutes a practice that protects this gendered community against the
'ravages of other countries' (Trump 2017), which according to Trump, can
be made secure again by the erection of a wall. Indeed, the 'American
carnage stops right here and stops right now' (Trump 2017). On the other
hand, the wall reinstates the state as masculine protector of the
nation. This wall is 'physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern' and
importantly, it is 'impenetrable' (Trump 2016b). The raison d'être of
the nation-state is thus preserved through the fencing of the border, by
physically locking out immigrant Others and other threatening states.
[Other security practices]{.underline}, by contrast, [lock bodies
in]{.underline}. On 7 October 2016, at the height of Donald J. Trump's
campaign, a lewd video revealed Trump boasting about 'grabbing women by
the pussy' and 'moving onto a woman like a bitch' (Trump 2016a). This
language was described as illustrating 'rape culture' (Dirks 2016)
according to the New York Times, 'constitut- \[ing\] rape culture'
(Mahdawi 2016) according to The Guardian, and 'directly contributing to
rape culture' (Rivesz 2016) according to The Independent. Trump
constructed the locker room as a non-political space, in which the
agency of female bodies was irrelevant or was subjected to the power of
a masculine other. Indeed, 'they \[women\] let you do it, you can do
whatever you want' (Rivesz 2016). In response, Trump 2016a apologised
'if anyone was offended' and stated that his words were 'locker room
banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago'. By
dismissing this incident as 'locker room banter', it implied that what
goes on in the locker room should be left and 'locked in' the private
sphere[. Yet Trump's comments in the 'locker room' are not simply a
private matter of female agency. It entails a much more complex
construction of a gendered subject along national lines. Forms of power
between men and women in seemingly 'private' spaces are connected to
forms of power in the international system]{.underline} (Enloe 2013,
40). '**[[Nat]{.mark}ional [security' is gendered by reproducing]{.mark}
the [protector]{.mark}]{.underline}** (state)/
[[protected]{.underline}]{.mark} (nation) [[script]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As Hansen (2000, 59 original emphasis) notes, ['gender security' cannot
be examined outside of the concept of 'national security' but 'the
discourse of "[nat]{.mark}ional [security"]{.mark} might [silence
women's security problems when]{.mark} "women's problems" [conflict
with]{.mark} the [securities of the national
community']{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, addressing gender security in
the locker room may entail unlocking the American nation to encounter
the Other, which is far from Trump's strategy in building the beautiful
wall. [For feminist scholars]{.underline} of security and foreign
policy, [the research agenda is widened by [expand]{.mark}ing the
[analysis beyond war]{.mark} and international conflict [to include
poverty, patriarchy, domestic violence, rape]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Sjoberg 2010, 4) [and essentially 'locker room banter']{.underline}.
[The [goal]{.mark} here [is]{.mark} one of [internationalising the
locker room by examining the scandal as a security problem,]{.mark} not
only of women in the locker room, but [embedded in]{.mark} the
[construction of]{.mark} the [America]{.mark}n nation [as an insecure
community]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Disturbing the cultural
grammar2 of foreign policy thus involves seeing the gendered nature of
military interventions entwined with what goes on in the locker
room.]{.underline} The US--Mexico wall attempts to materialise and
maintain gendered dichotomies between the national and the
international, the inside and the outside, and importantly between the
private/locker room and the public/political room. It is not only a wall
between two states; it can be problematised to border two sets of
spaces: the American nation and the locker room. 'Winning again' by
regaining borders is thus tantamount to locking power hierarchies in the
locker room and not simply a matter of 'national security'. (1-3)

### Russia/Putin

#### The disad reinforces a gendered understanding of Putin's national identity, which turns the DA

**[Representing Nations: Masculinizing Us, Feminizing
Them]{.underline}**

[In addition to [establishing Putin as a symbol of national masculinity,
the remasculinization of Russia requires the attachment of masculine
attributes to the image of the nation]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. Carol
Cohn points out, "[to be abstract, logical, or dispassionate is not
simply to be those things but also to be manly. And [to be manly
is]{.mark} not simply to be manly but also [to be in the]{.mark} more
[highly valued position in the discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other
words, to exhibit a trait on that list is not neutral---it is not simply
displaying some basic human characteristics. [It also positions you in a
discourse of gender. It associates you with a particular gender, and
also with a higher or lower valuation]{.underline}."50 In examining the
[[gender connotations of Russia's new image, we focus on]{.mark} such
characteristics as [independence and strength]{.mark}.]{.underline}
First, [these characteristics are dominant components of
masculinity]{.underline} in modern cultures. Second, they have become
marked as really masculine in the post-Soviet period, as survey results
show.51 Moreover, **[[independence has a clear gender
association]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially in contemporary Russia.
In analyzing the customs of post-Soviet societies, Elena Gapova writes,
when poor, women still remain women (and even feminine): they are women
"by the virtue of their bodies," and hardly anything can change this
perception of what they are. Not so with men: manhood is not about their
bodies (or not only about their bodies), and those lacking affluence
lack a big part of what constitutes masculinity. I refer here to the
social construction of normative masculinity, which explains why the man
pays for dinner at the restaurant. The reverse would also be true, i.e.,
paying for dinner makes him a man.52 In the 1990s, Russia's dependence
on foreign aid was evaluated as evidence of the country's lack of
self-determination and hence nonmasculinity. [[The idea of "**sovereign
democracy**" became an ideological cornerstone of Putin's second term.
**Sovereignty is seen as an opportunity for Russia to decide its own
fat**e]{.mark}, to render it less dependent on international financial
organizations, to make it a subject rather than an object in world
politics, to lay claim to a measure of self-sufficiency---[these
are]{.mark} precisely the things [credited to Putin's
rule.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The second essential trait of the new image
of Russia is strength.]{.underline} One might even describe a cult of
strength in Russia---whether applied to national military might,
athletic achievements, or the fitness of national leaders. Meriting our
attention are Putin's comments on the terrorist attack in Beslan in
September 2004: "We displayed weakness, and the weak are always
beaten."53 In 2012, Putin wrote in his preelection article, "we should
not tempt anyone by allowing ourselves to be weak."54 The results of
sociological surveys in Russia attest that these claims by Kremlin
leaders reflect the opinion of many Russians. In 2003, one Russian
sociological foundation asked respondents to complete the sentence "I
would like the world to regard Russia as . . ." Forty-eight percent of
respondents wished to represent the country as mighty or invincible; 22
percent chose wealthy or prosperous; and 9 percent picked independent.
Only 6 percent preferred the perception of Russia as an educated or
cultured nation, and 3 percent favored peaceful or friendly.55 The
growing popularity of Russia's "bear" image serves as an indirect
confirmation of the trend toward cultivating strength as an attribute of
Russians. This popularity, to be sure, has another source as well. It
was generated by United Russia, whose logo is a polar bear. 56 At the
same time, one should take into account that people of various political
sympathies support this symbol. Its strength and ability to defend
itself makes the bear the best symbol of the nation in the eyes of many
Russians. As indicated by our sociological survey and interviews held in
Russia (2009), strength is the primary trait associated with the bear as
an allegory of Russia.57 Along with the "Russian bear," the other image
intended to demonstrate the country's growing strength is "Russia rising
from its knees," which first appeared in Putin's rhetoric in September
1999.58 This image, in fact, has served as one of most important means
of legitimating power, especially in the 2012 presidential campaign.59
"Russia has once and for all risen from its knees. Now it is taking the
next step: putting the rest of the world on its knees"---so journalists
venomously commented on Dmitry Medvedev's Foreign Policy Concept,
proclaimed early in his presidency.60 As David Campbell points out,
identity is constituted in relation to differences, while differences
are constituted in relation to identity.61 Representations of the Other
thus serve as a necessary part of an ideal image of Self. As social
identity theory postulates, the desire for a positive identity, one of
the basic needs of human beings, is realized not only by improving the
image of the Self but also by worsening the image of the Other.62 The
reverse side of remasculinization is demasculinizing Others, both
external and internal, in mass-media discourse and political rhetoric.
This symbolic demasculinization has been applied to the former
"fraternal countries" of Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet
states---particularly those that have undergone color revolutions.
Political opposition by these states to Russian interests is often
attributed to U.S. influence, with the states themselves portrayed as
lacking sovereignty and independence---hence masculinity. Metaphors and
images further demasculinize the neighbors. The case of Ukraine serves
as a good example. In the gas supply dispute of 2006, [a Russian
television program described Ukraine as a Mammonish kept woman, a
"flighty Ukrainian mistress]{.underline}" (TVTS-Postskriptum, March 26,
2006). Protestors at a demonstration near the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
held a poster with the slogan "A Gentleman Always Pays for His
Girlfriend," calling on the United States to pay off Ukraine's debts to
Russia. [In [criticizing the Ukrainian leaders']{.mark} politics during
the next gas war in 2009, [Putin compared transit counties with an
overly picky girl]{.mark}: "They should have no illusions[; the girls
should have no illusions: the groom has other choices; they have to
understand]{.mark}."]{.underline}63 The other target of criticism is
Poland, especially during Lech Kaczyński's presidency. It is no wonder
that the Polish professor Włodzimierz Marciniak considers the image of
Poland as a prostitute the most widespread stereotype among Russians. In
his opinion, this stereotype has its sources in Russians' attitudes
toward the world: they believe that only large states have a say; the
rest can only sell themselves.64 Indeed, Russian newspaper articles
often mention "sponsors of Poland," and users of Internet forums
frequently evoke the metaphor of prostitution.65 Furthermore, Poland's
military and political weakness is emphasized, especially in contrast to
the strength of the Russian bear.66 The West traditionally serves as the
most important Other for Russian identity. Analyzing the remarkable
shift in Russians' perceptions of Us and Them, Edward Lucas points out
that in the mid-2000s, the West ceased to be an indisputable moral
authority for Russia.67 The same point applies to gender issues. In the
1990s, Western masculinity---above all, American masculinity--- was
considered a model, while Western civilization was endowed with
masculine characteristics (strength, rationality, independence,
individualism). In the 2000s, the situation changed, as reflected in
various types of discourse.

### Terrorism

#### Their seemingly benign understanding of terror only regenerates masculine war-making. 

**Athanassiou 12**

**(Cerelia, PhD candidate at the School of Sociology, Politics and
International Studies (SPAIS) at the University of Bristol, UK. Her
research is on conceptualisations of security post-9/11, focusing
specifically on the discursive strategies used by the Obama
administration to disempower the Global War on Terror., 'Gutsy'
Decisions and Passive Processes ¶ THE WARRIOR DECISION-MAKER AFTER THE
GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2014,
Vol. 16, No. 1, 6--25, JKS)**

Analytically, the exceptionality of the GWOT most usefully serves in
high- lighting its continuities with 'normal' politics (see Grewal 2005:
197; Puar 2007: 76; Richter-Montpetit 2007: 40; Parpart and Zalewski
2008: 5). [**The effects of the Obama administration's efforts to roll
back the GWOT's overt militarization with a 'return to the rule of law'
do not signify change from the masculine 'war machine', but rather
generate this 'war machine's' very conditions of existence.** It is,
after all, the warrior's logic that is privileged and channelled through
every decision, and it is this logic that subordinates other, seemingly
more passive, processes]{.underline}. The Washington Post editorial on
the killing of Osama bin Laden quoted Senator Lindsey Graham's
rationaliz- ation of the decision to kill and not capture: 'From a Navy
Seal perspective, you had to believe that this guy \[Osama bin Laden\]
was a walking IED \[impro- vised explosive device\]' (Washington Post
2011[). A militarized understanding and treatment of 'national security'
continues to re-write itself into the ¶ workings of the State, enabling
the hegemonic masculinity of the warrior decision-maker to keep
privileging itself, preventing meaningful change from
happening.]{.underline} If we heed Enloe's (2000: 3) invaluable advice
on the matter[, we notice that these are exactly the workings of
militarization, and through that, of a continuing GWOT: 'The more
militarization transforms an individual or a society, the more that
individual or society comes to imagine military needs and militaristic
presumptions to be not only valuable but also normal'. It is this
veneration of militarism, and its associated gender and race
hierarchies, that offer the clue on the lack of change]{.underline}. ¶
[Obama's insistence on reintroducing the rule of law went against the
tra- ditional understanding of 'security' because masculine posturing,
not feminine public negotiation, is traditionally seen as being most
effective in protecting the nation-state and its 'women and
children']{.underline} (Enloe 2007: 60--1). However[, articulations on
the importance of the law also prop up the warrior's
agenda]{.underline}: Abdulmutallab's prosecution is an aspect of an
operation geared pre- cisely towards achieving the effects of the bin
Laden episode (see Cohen 2011). With the most recent debates centring on
the validity of extrajudicially killing US citizens, we are shown a
system in which the status of the warrior has not diminished (see Holder
2012), despite the promise in 2008 that different atti- tudes might be
prioritized. Carver (2008: 84) [provides valuable support here, because
he points to the overarching framework of international politics that
'incorporates a myth of a unitary, unproblematic masculinised being --
"warrior man"/"economic man" -- whose world is not in fact bifurcated by
a war/peace distinction, but is rather one world of competitive,
aggressive, self- interested and somewhat paranoid strategic
interaction' (]{.underline}emphasis in original). In such a framework,
[the 'rational decision-maker' alone cannot deliver any meaningful
change when he is so closely correlated to the 'warrior'; this was
demonstrated by Obama's reintroduction of the 'rule of law' only to keep
subor- dinating it to the demands of the GWOT's framework of
war]{.underline}. **[The hegemonic masculinity of the executive
decision-maker clearly has to privilege warrior definitions of
'toughness' over dangerous forays into public deliberation and
accountability; and that is the masculine reality of national
security.]{.underline}**

### U.S. Leadership

#### "Global leadership" is code for [masculine protection]{.underline}. The aff is the benevolent masculine protector who attempts to save feminized groups from insecurity, which requires women to forfeit autonomy to gain protection. 

**Young 03**

**(Iris Marion, Department of Political Science University of Chicago,
The Logic of Masculinist Protection: Reflections on the Current Security
State, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 2003, vol. 29, no.
1\], pgs 4-5, JKS)**

[The logic of masculinist protection contrasts with a model of
masculinity assumed by much feminist theory, of masculinity as
self-consciously dominative]{.underline}. On the male domination model,
masculine men wish to mas- ter women sexually for the sake of their own
gratification and to have the pleasures of domination. They bond with
other men in comradely male settings that give them specific benefits
from which they exclude women, and they harass women in order to enforce
this exclusion and maintain their superiority (MacKinnon 1987; May 1998,
chaps. 4--6).¶ This image of the selfish, aggressive, dominative man who
desires sexual capture of women corresponds to much about male-dominated
institutions and the behavior of many men within them. For my purposes
in this essay, however, [it is important to recall another apparently
more benign image of masculinity, one more associated with ideas of
chivalry]{.underline}. In this latter image, [real men are neither
selfish nor do they seek to enslave or overpower others for the sake of
enhancing themselves. Instead, the gallantly masculine man is loving and
self-sacrificing, especially in relation to women. He faces the world's
difficulties and dangers in order to shield women from harm and allow
them to pursue elevating and decorative arts. The role of this
courageous, responsible, and virtuous man is that of a
protector.¶]{.underline} [The "good" man is one who keeps vigilant watch
over the safety of his family and readily risks himself in the face of
threats from the outside in order to protect the subordinate members of
his household. The logic of masculinist protection, then, includes the
image of the selfish aggressor who wishes to invade the lord's property
and sexually conquer his women. These are the bad men. Good men can only
appear in their goodness if we assume that lurking outside the warm
familial walls are aggressors who wish to attack them]{.underline}. The
dominative masculinity in this way constitutes protective masculinity as
its other. [The world out there is heartless and uncivilized, and the
movements and motives of the men in it are unpredictable and difficult
to discern]{.underline}. **[The protector must therefore take all
precautions against these threats, remain watchful and suspicious, and
be ready to fight and sacrifice for the sake of his ones]{.underline}**
(Elshtain 1987, 1992[**). Masculine protection is needed to make a home
a haven.**¶]{.underline} [Central to the logic of masculinist protection
is the subordinate relation of those in the protected position. In
return for male protection, the woman concedes critical distance from
decision-making autonomy]{.underline}. When the household lives under a
threat, there cannot be divided wills andS I G N S Autumn 2003 ❙ 5¶
arguments about who will do what, or what is the best course of action.
[The head of the household should decide what measures are necessary for
the security of the people and property, and he gives the orders that
they must follow if they and their relations are to remain
safe.]{.underline} As Stiehm puts it: "[The protector cannot achieve
status simply through his accom- plishment, then. Because he has
dependents he is as socially connected as one who is dependent. He is
expected to provide for others. Often a protector tries to get help from
and also control the lives of those he protects---in order to 'better
protect' them"]{.underline} (1982, 372).¶ [Feminine subordination, in
this logic, does not constitute submission to a violent and overbearing
bully. The feminine woman, rather, on this construction, adores her
protector and happily defers to his judgment in return for the promise
of security that he offers. She looks up to him with gratitude for his
manliness and admiration for his willingness to face the dangers of the
world for her sake. That he finds her worthy of such risks gives
substance to her self. It is only fitting that she should minister to
his needs and obey his dictates.¶]{.underline} Hobbes is the great
theorist of political power founded on a need and desire for protection.
He depicts a state of nature in which people live in small families
where all believe some of the others envy them and desire to enlarge
themselves by stealing from or conquering them. As a conse- quence,
[everyone in this state of nature must live in a state of fear and
insecurity, even when not immediately under attack.]{.underline}
Households must live with the knowledge that outsiders might wish to
attack them, espe- cially if they appear weak and vulnerable, so each
must construct defensive fortresses and be on watch[. It is only
sensible, moreover, to conduct preemptive strikes against those who
might wish to attack and to try to weaken them. But each knows that the
others are likely to make defensive raids, which only adds to fear and
insecurity]{.underline}. In Hobbes's state of nature some people may be
motivated by simple greed and desire for conquest and domination. In
this state of nature everyone has reason to feel in- secure, however,
not because all have these dominative motives but be- cause he or she is
uncertain about who does and each person understands his or her own
vulnerability.

In March 2014, hundreds of mysterious gunmen in camouflage appeared on
the streets of Crimea and began taking over local government buildings.
While Russia initially denied the existence of the "little green men",
as they came to be known, President Vladimir Putin admitted that they
were Russian military at the one-year anniversary of the Crimean
occupation. Ethical issues and the complete violation of the Geneva
Conventions notwithstanding, [the logic behind this tactic was quite
straightforward and compelling: [Aid]{.mark} pro-Russian [forces]{.mark}
while creating enough uncertainty about Russian involvement so as to
prevent NATO retaliation and global backlash. The tactic itself has been
deployed by rogue states before, but usually [through proxies.
Pakistan]{.mark}, for instance, has a history of [supporting
terrorist]{.mark} and insurgent groups in Jammu and
Kashmir]{.underline}. Yet with fewer remaining strategic partners and
important resources connecting it to more powerful states, [Pakistan no
longer possesses the leverage needed to shield itself from international
backlash as Russia did. In such an environment, states like
[Pakistan]{.mark} may be [tempted to turn toward]{.mark} new methods to
achieve their goals. Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems ([LAWS]{.mark})
--- which can detect, select and attack targets without human
intervention --- are one such avenue]{.underline}. International rules
around LAWS are relatively underdeveloped, and in the absence of clear
norms on human accountability and attribution for autonomous weapons,
[we could see states like Pakistan deploy LAWS for operations outside
their borders.]{.underline} LAWS present several benefits for "middle
powers": They increase the reach and effectiveness of forces, reduce
casualties and enable persistent presence in vast, inaccessible
terrains. Countries like India or South Korea, which operate in a
complicated geostrategic context, can therefore use LAWS to effectively
police and protect their territory. On the flipside[, [LAWS can be used
by]{.mark} state and [non-state actors to engage in asymmetric
tactics]{.mark}. This could take three forms: A state could directly
deploy LAWS against an adversary state; [a state could equip]{.mark}
proxies such as insurgent or [terrorist groups with autonomous
weapons]{.mark} units; [a non-state actor steals]{.mark} or otherwise
illegally acquires [autonomous systems]{.mark} or units. [With]{.mark}
this [destabilising potential]{.mark} in mind, external [state actors
that]{.mark} actively [aid]{.mark} insurgencies and [terrorist
organisations will]{.mark} be tempted to [deploy autonomous systems and
claim they are]{.mark} stolen or [rogue]{.mark} units.]{.underline}
While LAWS are still in the development stage and are fairly
inaccessible for most states --- let alone non-state groups --- due to
high costs, and lack of skilled AI talent and operators, it is not a
complete stretch of imagination to envision [a future where autonomous
weapons are within the reach of any state or non-state actor that wants
them.]{.underline}

### Enloe -- Must Read

#### Set aside concerns with political will or scarce resources - it's what makes violence against women possible

**Enloe 04** \[Cynthia, prof of IR, The Curious Feminist, p. 74\]

Thus [[we need to become more curious about]{.mark} the process of
[trivialization. How]{.mark}]{.underline} exactly
[[do]{.underline}]{.mark} regimes, opposition parties,
[judges]{.underline}, popular movements, [and [the press go about making
any incident of violence against women appear
trivial?]{.mark}]{.underline} The gendered [[violence can be explained
as inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}- that is, [**[not worth the
expenditure of political capital]{.mark}**. Or it can be
treated]{.underline} by the trivializers [[as numerically
inconsequential, so rare]{.mark} that [it would seem wasteful of scarce
political will or]{.mark} state [resources]{.mark}]{.underline} to try
to prevent it. Third, trivialization can be accomplished by engaging in
comparisons: [[how can one spend limited political attention on]{.mark},
say, [domestic violence]{.mark} or forced prostitution [when there are
market forces]{.mark} like global competition, structural adjustment,
[or nuclear testing]{.mark} to deal with- [as
if]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} that is, [[none of those had any
relationship to]{.mark} the incidence of [violence against
women?]{.mark}]{.underline} Finally, trivialization may take the form of
undermining the credibility of the messenger. As early as the 1800\'s
trivializers already were labeling women who spoke out publicly against
violence against women as \"loose,\" \"prudish,\" or disappointed (it
would be the trivializers twentieth century successors who would thing
to add \"lesbian\").

If you are a [[politician]{.mark} in a liberal democracy, then the
technology of [unmanned weapons is the answer to your
**dreams**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While armed aggression between liberal
democracies is rare, [they are involved in many [military conflicts
driven by clashes with **nondemocratic**]{.mark} countries or
interventions [in unstable regions of the]{.mark} world]{.underline}.
Given the norms and values espoused in liberal democracies there is a
political will to spread the virtues of democracy and check the
aggressions of non-democratic powers. But [other values and norms such
as the [**distribution** of **political** power to the voting
population]{.mark}, severely [hampers]{.mark} the **governments** of
these countries who try to act on their [military
aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are massive political costs to
be paid when it comes to deploying large numbers of troops in foreign
lands. Sauer and Schörnig (2012), [note that the governments of
[democracies]{.mark} want to engage [in military activities]{.mark} but
the citizens of democracies [demand]{.mark} that these adventure be [low
**cost** with no casualtie]{.mark}s from their own military and low
casualties inflicted on the enemy and local populati]{.underline}on.
\[T\]he need to reduce costs, the short-term satisfaction of particular
'risk-transfer rules' for avoiding casualties, and the upkeep of a
specific set of normative values -- constitute the special appeal of
unmanned systems to democracies" (Sauer and Schörnig, 2012, p. [365).
[Unmanned weapons systems]{.mark} would seem to allow all
[**constituents** within a liberal democracy]{.mark} to **achieve**
their [goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} The weapons are not expensive
compared to the massive expense of building, deploying and maintaining
manned systems. The missions are secret and so small they hardly warrant
mention in the daily news back home. There is almost no risk to military
personnel in their use and the number of enemy casualties per strike is
relatively small. Also, politicians such as President Barack Obama have
made claims that these weapons are far less indiscriminate and more
tightly controlled in their killing than alternative modes of attack
(Landler, 2012). We should note that this claim is backed up by what
appears to be questionable methods used in the official calculation of
civilian casualties since every adult male in the blast of the weapon is
often considered a combatant by default, a claim that is often
disputable (Qazi and Jillani, 2012). So the more precise targeting
available on modern drones does not necessarily correspond to less
civilian casualties (ibid). These weapons also come with a moral veneer
that comes from the assumption that a more ethical conduct of war is
possible using these machines. [Sauer and Schörnig go on to conclude
that the political goals along with the normative drives of liberal
democracies necessitates that unmanned systems will continue to be armed
with more powerful weaponry and that they will be given more demanding
missions which will require greater autonomy from the
machine]{.underline} (Sauer and Schörnig, 2012, p. 370). This argument
shows that we can expect the research into autonomous weapons systems to
increase and for these systems to proliferate into every aspect of
military activities across the globe. Recent history has given ample
empirical evidence to back this theory up. Even though President Obama
was elected largely on an anti-war vote, it has been reported that there
has been an 8% increase in the use of drones during his first term and
in 2011 drones were used in, "...253 strikes -- one every four days....
\[And\] Between 2,347 and 2,956 people are reported to have died in the
attacks -- most of them militants" (Woods, 2011). This trend has only
increased since that time. Other countries such as Israel and Italy are
known to operate reconnaissance drones but recently the German
government has announced plans to invest in both armed and unarmed
drones (Kim, 2013). As the enthusiasm for this technology grows, a
mounting opposition movement has also emerged that claims that this
technology is not a cheap, easy, casualty free means of propagating just
war. Instead they claim that these technologies contribute to unjust
military adventures and a indefensibly immoral push button warfare that
claims the lives of thousands of innocents caught in the cross fire. In
the interest of furthering the ethical use of these technologies, it is
important that we give these counter arguments our full attention in
this paper[. We should note that some [technologies can cause]{.mark}
what **philosophers** of technology call **[reverse
adaptation]{.mark};** "...the adjustment of [human **ends** to match the
character of the available **means**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Winner,
1978, p. 229[). This is where the social and political milieu of a
society changes to accommodate the **inflexibility** of a technology,
rather than waiting to deploy the technology when it is more suited to
the human **environment**]{.underline}. A prime example would be the way
that human societies changed due to the adoption of mass production
necessitating all manner of social upheaval that proved to be the fault
lines of human conflict over the last two centuries. There are many
other examples of this in recent history, think of the social disruption
caused by the introduction of the automobile or cellular telephone,
etc[. It is obvious that autonomous weapons are again **confronting**
our societies with the problems of **reverse adaptation**.]{.underline}
These weapons are completing a trend in technological warfare begun in
the nineteenth century that is making traditional notions of ethics in
warfare largely untenable. These notions were always on shaky ground to
begin with, but the tradition of just war that reaches back to the
middle ages has become almost mute in its ability to influence decisions
made on the modern battlefield. If this was not worrisome enough, as
aging drone technologies are replaced with better equipment, the surplus
will find use in civilian law enforcement duties, [this will complete
the circle and [technologies that liberal democracies gladly used to
control their **enemies**]{.mark} will now be used in ways that
challenge [and potentially curtail cherished civil **liberties** at
home]{.mark}. B]{.underline}ecause of this, it is vital that we engage
in discussion of these technologies at every opportunity. We will take
up this issue again and apply it to the problem of creating a realistic
robotic arms control at the end of this paper.

[Risk transfer and lowering the threshold for the use of lethal force:
Earlier we discussed these concerns in detail in our discussion of
autonomous systems in general. However, these problems take on a more
[tragic **character** when]{.mark} decision makers realize [the
political **expediency** of risk transfer]{.mark}. Since [lethal danger
is **transferred**]{.mark} from the human warfighters [to
**machines**]{.mark}, this can cause increased, and [less
**thoughtful**, deployment of lethal autonomous
system]{.mark}s]{.underline}. When this happens there is far [[less
**political** risk to those who decide to take us to war]{.mark}, thus
potentially [leading to more armed conflict]{.mark} (Strawser
2013]{.underline}). This problem follows into the [civil use of these
systems where the use of them may be chosen over more traditional
policing methods that might be more expensive or difficult. This would
lead to an increased use of lethal force over the capture of those
suspected of crime]{.underline}.

**Matsuda 88** (Mari, Associate Professor of Law, University of Hawaii,
"When the First Quail Calls: Multiple Consciousness as Jurisprudential
Method", 11 Women\'s Rts. L. Rep. 7 1989)

[[The multiple consciousness I urge]{.mark} lawyers to attain
[is]{.mark} not a random ability to see all points of view, but [a
deliberate choice to see the world from the standpoint of the oppressed.
That world is accessible to all of us]{.mark}]{.underline}. We should
know it [[in its con- crete particulars]{.mark}. We should know of our
sister carrying buckets of water up five flights of stairs in a welfare
hotel, our sister trembling at 3 a.m. in a shelter for battered women,
our sisters holding bloodied children in their arms in Cape Town, on the
West Bank, and in Nicaragua.]{.underline} The jurispru- dence of
outsiders teaches that these details and the emotions they evoke are
relevant and impor- tant as we set out on the road to justice.
[[These]{.mark} [details are accessible]{.mark} to all of us, of all
genders and colors. We can choose to know the lives of others by
reading, studying, listening, and ventur- ing]{.underline} into
different places. For lawyers, our pro bono work may be the most
effective means of ac- quiring a broader consciousness of oppression.
[[Abstraction and detachment are ways out of the discomfort of direct
confrontation with the ugliness of oppression. Abstraction]{.mark},
criticized by both feminists and scholars of color, is the, method that
[allows theorists to discuss]{.mark} liberty, property, and rights in
the aspirational mode of liberalism [with no connection to what those
con- cepts mean in real people\'s lives]{.mark}. Much in our [mainstream
intellectual training values abstrac- tion and denigrates nitty-gritty
detail.]{.mark} Holding on to a multiple consciousness will allow us to
op- erate both within the abstractions of standard ju- risprudential
discourse, and within the details of our own special
knowledge]{.underline}. Whisperings at Yale and elsewhere about how
deconstructionist heroes were closet fascists remind me of how important
it is to stay close to oppressed communities. [[High talk about
language, meaning, sign,]{.mark} process, and law [can mask racist and
sexist ugliness if we never stop to ask: \"Exactly what are you talking
about and what is the implication of what you are saying]{.mark} for my
sis- ter who is carrying buckets of water up five flights of stairs in a
welfare hotel? [What do you propose to do for her today, not in some

sist!]{.underline}]{.mark} Read what Professor Williams, Professor

[[Gendered hierarchies and cultural scripts are not a side issue for
movements that]{.mark}]{.underline} aim to
[[contest]{.underline}]{.mark} the [g[lobalization of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Materialist feminists have highlighted
how capitalism has relied upon concealed, underpaid or unpaid female
labour (e.g. Eisenstein 1979; Barrett 1980; Fuentes and Ehren- reich
1983). As Rosemary Hennessy (2000: 6) puts it, '[[women provide most of
the world's socially necessary labo]{.mark}r -- that is, labor that is
necessary to col- lective survival -- [but much of it is rendered
invisible, both in and outside the value system of commodity
exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}. Materialist analyses have also
highlighted the relationship between heteronormative and capitalist
social relations. Leslie Feinberg (1997: 231, see also Hennessy 1996),
for example, theorizes the oppression of transgender people under
capitalism through a Marxist analysis of how an ideology of binary
gender became hegemonic with 'the rise of private property, the
male-dominated family and class divisions'.¶ Moreover, the power-laden
performances through which gender is produced are intricately bound up
with cultural scripts deployed in the imposition of capitalist relations
across the world. J. K. Gibson-Graham (1996: 120--47), for instance,
draws a parallel of globalization's 'tightly scripted narrative of
differential power' that celebrates 'the inevitability of capitalist
penetration' in every corner of the world and the script that normalizes
and naturalizes the rape of female bodies (1996: 120--1). Lara Coleman
(2007) has explored how the violent imposition of neoliberal development
in Colombia has mobi- lized gendered imaginative geographies, through
which spaces targeted for 'civilizing' interventions are marked out in
terms of sub-ordinate gender identities counterposed to the identity of
an ideal citizen cast in terms of a hegemonic, bourgeois-rational
masculinity. Similarly, Penny [Griffin (2007) has highlighted the way in
which [dominant forms of heterosexual masculinity mark out the norms of
successful human behaviour reproduced in the neoliberal discourse of the
World Bank]{.mark}**.**¶ **The [reiteration of gendered cultural scripts
within (anti-)globalization politics does not only shore up capitalism's
unequal effects on wome]{.mark}n**]{.underline} (cf. Sullivan 2005:
9**[[). It also bolsters other effects of gender-based oppression on
women, transgender people and men with non-hegemonic gender
performances]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, [[this
reiteration]{.mark} of hierarchically ordered gender identities [should
be understood as reinforcing capitalist relations at a much deeper
level]{.mark}, in that [it restates the cultural scripts that capital
deploys to normalize]{.mark} its interventions and policy
'solutions]{.underline}'.¶ There is a circular element to this too.
**[[Who is visible and who can speak within (anti-)globalization
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and which bodies are privileged or
excluded**[[, derives from the gendered performance of
'resistance'.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Cultural texts assign roles
defining, for example, who is able to speak with authority and **[[who
is confined to a walk-on appearance as a 'movement
housewife]{.underline}]{.mark}**' (Roth 2001). [[This in turn forecloses
the possibilities for contestation and re-signification within spaces of
'resistance', reinforcing the tendency to re-iterate those cultural
scripts that enhance the status quo.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[Gender and fully autonomous weapons]{.underline}** Throughout
history, we have seen that **[weapons symbolise power]{.underline}**.
The association of weapons with power [comes from a very
particular---and very dominant---understanding of
masculinity]{.underline}. This is a [masculinity in which ideas like
strength, courage, and protection are equated with
violence.]{.underline} It is a [masculinity in which the capacity and
willingness to use weapons, engage in combat, and kill other human
beings is seen as essential to being "a real man". Fully autonomous
weapons]{.underline} are being developed in the context of the
aforementioned norms of [gender and power]{.underline}. Scholars of
gender and technology have long argued that [gender relations are
"materialised in technology".]{.underline} That is, the meaning and
[character (the norms) of masculinity and femininity are "embedded" in
machines.]{.underline} These scholars argue that technological products
bear their creators mark. If [**technology is developed and utilised
primarily by men operating within a framework of violent masculinity,
their creations will be instilled with that framework of thought,
knowledge, language, and interpretation.** Fully autonomous weapons, as
tools of violence and of war]{.underline}, will likely [have specific
characteristics that may simultaneously reinforce and undermine
hegemonic gender norms.]{.underline} The use of fully autonomous weapons
can [lead to gender-based violence against men]{.underline}. In
conflict, [civilian men are often targeted]{.underline}---or counted in
casualty recordings---as militants only because they are men of a
certain age.While men are not necessarily targeted solely because they
are men, taking sex as a key signifier as identity and exacting harm on
that basis constitutes gender-based violence. That is to say, if someone
uses sex as a basis for assessing whether or not a person is targeted,
or if an attack is allowed (are only men present?), or in determining
the impact of an attack later (i.e. during casualty recording), then
they are using the sex of that person not as the motivation for the
attack but as a proxy for identifying militants, or "acceptable
targets". This is gender-based violence. This **[erodes the protection
that civilians should be afforded in conflict and violates many human
rights, including the right to life and due process.]{.underline}** It
alsohas broader implications in the [reinforcement of gender norms,
including violent masculinity.]{.underline} Assuming all military-age
men to be potential or actual militants or combatants entrenches the
idea that men are violent and thus targetable. This [devalues male
life---it suggests men are relatively more expendable than
women]{.underline}. It i[ncreases the vulnerability of men, exacerbating
other risks adult civilian men face such as forced recruitment,
arbitrary detention, and summary execution.]{.underline} The [gendered
culture of violent masculinities that surrounds the development of
autonomous weapon]{.underline}s, likely to be [embedded within the
technology]{.underline} and its use, will [create new challenges for
preventing violence, protecting civilians, and **breaking down gender
essentialisms or discrimination.**]{.underline} Understanding how
autonomous weapons are likely to be perceived in a gendered way by their
developers, operators, and their victims is crucial to developing
policies that can help break the cycle of violence. This could include
an understanding that the operation of weapons without meaningful human
control, weapons programmed to target and kill based on pre-programmed
algorithms of who is considered to pose a threat, used without consent
in foreign lands or in the streets of local cities, will result in
civilian casualties, psychological harm, and destruction of civilian
infrastructure. That this in turn will result in a violent masculine
response from affected communities, reinforcing gender inequalities and
oppressions. What efforts have been taken to address the development and
use of fully autonomous weapons? During the Human Rights Council session
in April 2013, 24 states attended the presentation of the report of the
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions,
Christof Heyns, and discussed the issue of autonomous weapons.
Participating states expressed concerns regarding the use of fully
autonomous weapons and indicated an interest in continuing discussions.
At the meeting of states parties of the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW) in November 2013, governments decided to
convene a four-day meeting of experts on the topic of fully autonomous
weapons. The CCW, adopted in 1980, regulatesweapons which are not
derived from chemical, nuclear, or biological sources. Since 2014, the
states parties of the CCW have discussed how to address the threat of
killer robots. In 2016, the Fifth Review Conference of CCW decided to
begin a formal process in 2017 to discuss autonomous weapon systems. The
meetings since have focused on building a common understanding about the
meaning of human control and the risks of fully autonomous weapons. Most
governments, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and the Campaign to
Stop Killer Robots, have reached the conclusion that humans must
maintain control over programming, development, activation, and/or
operational phases of a weapon system. [A growing number of states are
calling for a **pre-emptive ban on killer robots**]{.underline}
(currently 28 states). Furthermore, the [Non-Aligned
Movement]{.underline}, the la[rgest bloc of states operating in the UN,
has called for a legally binding instrument stipulating prohibitions and
regulations of such weapons;]{.underline} Austria, Brazil, and Chile
support the negotiation of "a legally binding instrument to ensure
meaningful human control over the critical functions" of weapon system.
A f[ew others have expressed their interest in non--legally binding
mechanisms]{.underline}, [such as a political declaration proposed by
France and Germany. Additional support for a prohibitio]{.underline}n
has also co[me from thousands of scientists and artificial-intelligence
experts.]{.underline} In July [2018]{.underline}, they issued a [pledge
not to assist with the development or use of fully autonomous
weapons.]{.underline} This comes on the heels of br[oader activism from
the scientific and technology community against misuse of
technolog]{.underline}y. For example, 4000 Google employees recently
signed a letter demanding their company cancel its Project Maven
contract with the Pentagon, which was geared toward "improving" drone
strikes through artificial intelligence. Twelve hundred academics
announced their support for the tech workers. As a response, Google
renounced its work on Project Maven. Furthermore, more than 160 faith
leaders and more than 20 Nobel Peace Prize laureates back the ban.

#### Their essentialism argument misreads our evidence- gender is a social construction which is enforced contingently

In order to understand feminist work in ir, it is important to note that
**[gender is not the equivalent of membership in biological sex
classes.]{.underline}** Instead, **[gender is a system of symbolic
meaning that creates social hierarchies based on perceived associations
with masculine and feminine characteristics.]{.underline}** As Lauren
Wilcox explains, **["gender symbolism describes the way in which
masculine/feminine are assigned to various dichotomies that organize
Western thought" where "both men and women tend to place a higher value
on the term which is associated with masculinity."23 Gendered social
hierarchy, then, is at once a social construction and a "structural
feature of social and political life" that "profoundly shapes our place
in, and view of, the world."]{.underline}**24¶ **[This is not to say
that all people, or even all women, experience gender in the same
ways]{.underline}**. While genders are lived by people throughout the
world, **["it would be unrepresentative to characterize a \'gendered
experience\' as if there were something measurable that all men or all
women shared in life experience.]{.underline}**"25 Each person lives
gender in a different culture, body, language, and identity. Therefore,
**[there is not one gendered experience of global politics, but
many.]{.underline}** By extension, there is not one gender-based
perspective on ir or international security, but many. **[Still, as a
structural feature of social and political life, gender is "a set of
discourses that represent, construct, change, and enforce social
meaning."26 Feminism, then, "is neither just about women, nor the
addition of women to male-stream constructions; it is about transforming
ways of being and knowing" as gendered discourses are understood and
transformed]{.underline}**.27

#### Gender binary is the *object* of critique, not the method 

**Sjoberg, PhD, 17**

(Laura, PoliSci@Florida, Towards Trans- gendering International
Relations?
http://www2.hhh.umn.edu/uthinkcache/gpa/globalnotes/Sjoberg.Towards%20Transgendering%20IR.docx)

Generally, "sex" is perceived membership in the biological categories of
"male" or "female" based on (perceived) distribution of sex organs and
sexed bodies. [While most feminists see more than two
"sexes]{.underline}" (including varieties of intersex and trans-
bodies), [[we]{.mark} often [talk about sex as
dichotomous]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(male/female) either out of
convenience or [[out of]{.mark} an [interest in **focusing on gender
issues presented dichotomously in global politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}(e.g., Keohane 1989). While some theorists have argued that
"sex" is itself a social construction (Fausto-Sterling 2005) or a
performance (Butler 1993), many continue to refer to sex as a biological
fact. If "sex" is usually characterized as biological and dichotomous,
"[[gender," is]{.underline}]{.mark} usually [**[characterized as social
and a continuum]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Hooper 2001). Gender is a set of
socially and culturally constructed characteristics that are associated
with persons based on their perceived sex. People understood to be "men"
are expected to be "masculine" and associated with masculinity, while
people understood to be "women" are expected to be "feminine" and
associated with femininity (Tickner 1992; Sylvester 1994). These traits
are organized hierarchically, where characteristics associated with
masculinity are often symbolically and actually valued over
characteristics associated with femininity (see Peterson 2010). In these
terms, sexism is the assumed or explicit preference for men over women;
gender hierarchy is the assumed or explicit preference for masculinities
over femininities; and sex/gender discrimination is the enacting of
these preferences in interpersonal interaction (see Enloe 2007).

### It's Performative

#### Gender is not stable, rater it is a socially encoded state of doing -- making gender performative. 

**Mikkola 17** \[Mari Mikkola (Junior Professor in Practical Philosophy
at the Humboldt-University, Berlin), 2017, "Feminist Perspectives on Sex
and Gender," The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,
<https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/feminism-gender/>\]
// st

Further, being feminine and desiring men (for instance) are standardly
assumed to be expressions of one\'s gender as a woman. Butler denies
this and holds [that **gender is really performative. It is not "a
stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts follow;
rather, gender is ... instituted ... through a stylized repetition of
\[habitual\] acts"**]{.underline} (Butler 1999, 179): through wearing
certain gender-coded clothing, walking and sitting in certain
gender-coded ways, styling one\'s hair in gender-coded manner and so on.
[Gender is not something one is, it is something one does; it is a
sequence of acts, **a doing rather than a being**. And repeatedly
engaging in 'feminising' and 'masculinising' acts congeals gender
thereby making people falsely think of gender as something they
naturally are. Gender only comes into being through these gendering
acts:]{.underline} a female who has sex with men does not express her
gender as a woman. This activity (amongst others) makes her gendered a
woman.¶ The constitutive acts that gender individuals create genders as
"compelling illusion\[s\]" (Butler 1990, 271). Our [gendered
classification scheme is a strong pragmatic construction: social factors
wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent
accurately any 'facts of the matter']{.underline} (Haslanger 1995, 100).
People think that there are true and real genders, and those deemed to
be doing their gender 'wrong' are not socially sanctioned. But**[,
genders are true and real only to the extent that they are
performed]{.underline}** (Butler 1990, 278--9). It does not make sense,
then, to say of a male-to-female trans person that s/he is really a man
who only appears to be a woman. Instead, males dressing up and acting in
ways that are associated with femininity "show that \[as Butler
suggests\] 'being' feminine is just a matter of doing certain
activities" (Stone 2007, 64). As [a]{.underline} result, [the trans
person\'s gender is just as real or true as anyone else\'s who is a
'traditionally' feminine female or masculine male]{.underline} (Butler
1990, 278).\[5\] Without heterosexism that compels people to engage in
certain gendering acts, there would not be any genders at all. And
ultimately the aim should be to abolish norms that compel people to act
in these gendering ways.¶ For Butler, given that gender is performative,
the appropriate response to feminist identity politics involves two
things. First, feminists should understand '[woman' as open-ended and "a
term in process, a becoming, a constructing that cannot rightfully be
said to originate or end ... it is open to intervention and
resignification"]{.underline} (Butler 1999, 43). That is, feminists
should not try to define 'woman' at all. Second, the category of women
"ought not to be the foundation of feminist politics" (Butler 1999, 9).
Rather, [feminists should focus on providing an account of how **power
functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood** not only in the
society at large but also within the feminist movement.]{.underline}

Global military spending has been estimated by the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) to have been around
US\$1.6 trillion in 2016. The military economy is not, however, just
about state spending: direct and indirect employment within the U.S.
aerospace and defence industry alone includes approximately 3.53 million
people. Feminist scholars have highlighted how militarism goes further
in that there are a number of key roles often played by women outside
the formal work place. Militarisation can be seen as both creating and
profiting from informal (unpaid) work by women, which also produces and
maintains gender difference. In addition, military spending benefits
companies. It does not, as two peace scholars point out, 'compete
directly with private investment. It supplements but does not supplant
the private sector. Thus, its expansion will not undermine business
confidence'. The military economy is a fast-moving one, creating
continuous profits as technology advances and systems need replacing.
Military development spending has increased over the past decade in many
states including the U.S., Kenya, Brazil, Colombia, India, Malaysia,
Poland and Russia. Much of this war economy is driven by the development
and deployment of technology, which reaps profits not only through
military use but also often later through civil use. Satellite
navigation is a prime example of this. While existing weapons systems
such as the PAC-3 and the Samsung SGR-A1 described below are more
automated than autonomous, 'there are significant global efforts in the
research and development (R&D) of autonomous systems'. Artificial
intelligence and machine learning technologies have seen considerable
advancement in the commercial sector, which is leaving the military
sector behind.11 States are beginning to note the need to "catch up with
Silicon Valley".Seeking to tap into the advancements made in the
commercial sector, the creation of weapons systems with some level of
autonomy has recently become a key focus for the U.S. Department of
Defense through Project Maven. When establishing the project in 2017,
the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work stated that 'the
Department of Defense (DoD) must integrate artificial intelligence and
machine learning more effectively across operations to maintain
advantages over increasingly capable adversaries and competitors'. While
Project Maven is currently focusing on the incorporation of algorithms
into military operations, reflecting the current state of technological
advancement, it seeks to consider and promote 'all initiatives that
develop, employ, or field, artificial intelligence, automation, machine
learning, deep learning and computer vision algorithms'.In other words,
Project Maven is not only creating more complex algorithms but is also
actively seeking to ensure that the U.S. is at the forefront of the
development of autonomous weapons technologies. In this paper I argue
that [[feminist **posthumanist**]{.mark} theory]{.underline} is an
important paradigm through which to understand our relationship to
technology, and [[to **autonomous** weapons **systems** in
particular]{.mark}.]{.underline} Feminist posthumanism uses technology
([[alongside]{.mark} the **[nonhuman]{.mark}** animal and
matte]{.underline}r) to question [[what it means to be
**human**]{.mark}, deconstructing the [very notion of what the **human**
is]{.mark}, noting that the concept of the [human in **dominant**
Western]{.mark} accounts of [subjectivity creates **hierarchies**
**between** humans]{.mark} as well as between the human and other living
beings]{.underline}. A clear example of the way in which feminist
posthuman theory challenges humanist accounts of subjectivity can be
seen in Donna Haraway's work. Haraway notes that [[humans are already
cybor]{.mark}gs in that they are deeply connected to, desire, and [are
**dependent** upon technology]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 Such an
understanding of [technology]{.underline} is essential to understanding
[[a]{.mark}utonomous [w]{.mark}eapons [s]{.mark}ystems]{.underline}. In
noting [[the connection **between** the]{.mark} [human and
machine]{.mark} and [**deconstructing** distinctions between
**autonomy**]{.mark} and automation]{.underline}, a posthuman
perspective on [autonomous [weapons **foregrounds** the need to]{.mark}
focus not only on autonomous weapons but on the broad array of
[delegated **killing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While current attempts at
legal regulation distinguish between [civil and military technologies,
such a distinction becomes impossible in light of the clear links
between civil and military technologies]{.underline} and the killing
potential of many technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI).
This article therefore contributes to legal studies as well as the
discourse on autonomous weapons. It further contributes to feminist
approaches to international law, inserting such approaches into the
realm of military technologies and highlighting the relevance of
feminist approaches to all areas of international law. Law and gender
theory is an important lens through which to analyse military
technologies. [Military technologies touch on several political and
philosophical issues that **gender** theorists have long
discussed]{.underline}. Legal articulations of subjectivity in
particular are something that feminist legal theory has long
problematised, and is directly relevant to the question of the 'legal
person' as machines become more and more autonomous.20 [This may require
legal change to allow for '**electronic'**
subject-recognition]{.underline}. In addition to this, [[gender theories
have **developed**]{.mark} a nuanced set of tools through which to
analyse issues around [inclusion, exclusion and
justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. This can be seen in gender theory's
commitment to intersectionality, which looks at gender alongside race,
sexuality, ability, class, etc. [A [gender perspective
ensures]{.mark}]{.underline} the consideration of the multiple ways in
which [[technologies may impact on intersecting groups]{.mark},
which]{.underline} may be missed in mainstream discussions about the use
of autonomous weapons systems. Despite the many debates on autonomous
weapons, there has been little consideration of such systems from a
feminist posthuman perspective. Mary Manjikian appears to be the only
scholar who has sought to apply feminist posthumanism to the realm of
autonomous technology. Manjikian discusses the ways in which military
technologies may be used to create either a less or a more militarised
world, concluding that technology is more likely to create a more
militarised, hyper-masculine world. Heeding Manjikian's suspicion of the
hyper-masculinity of militarism, this article works in the vein of
Haraway and other feminist posthuman thinkers such as Rosi Braidotti and
the 'xenofeminists', a collective of scholars working under the name
'Laboria Cuboniks' who seek to use and appropriate technology for
feminist aims -- to think critically about [the significance of
**autonomous** weapons systems, for the ways in which law [fashions our
**understanding** of human subjectivity]{.mark}.]{.underline} This paper
adds to the discourse on autonomous weapons by proposing a
[**xenofeminist** posthuman perspective, [providing a different way of
**understanding**]{.mark} these systems while contributing [to the
development of **feminist** approaches]{.mark} to international
law]{.underline}. While Haraway is fundamentally positive about
technology's potential to be used for feminist aims, she notes that
feminists must also ensure that technology is not used to create 'the
final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name
of defence, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a
masculinist orgy of war.' Haraway also notes that technology is embedded
within capitalism, pointing out the fact that the people usually making
the machines are often poor women from the Global South.28 Haraway's
work seeks to create a feminist techno-future in spite of and while
trying to avoid the risks of a possible hyper-masculine techno-future.
While Haraway seeks to promote the use of technology for feminist aims,
the Xenofeminist Manifesto (XFM) has a more focused feminist project in
mind. The XFM seeks to destroy capitalism through the accelerated use of
technology to create a post-work world, thereby directly advocating for
post-capitalism as a feminist aim. Thus, the XFM insists not only on the
need to accelerate our use of/dependence upon technology, but also to
appropriate this technology for feminist aims, ensuring that such
technology remains loyal to the politics they wish it to promote. Such
feminist aims include the will to ensure the free distribution of
hormones or the will to use technology to restructure gendered systems
of reproductive labour and care.While the xenofeminists note the
dilemmas technology brings and the need to 'explicit\[ly\]
acknowledge... these conditions as a target for elimination', they do
not address the fact that the creation of a post-capitalist world will
not be not immediate. In the meantime, as Haraway notes, science and
technology have both contributed to and changed the face of 'late
capitalism', with more work becoming precarious and being done at home,
which affects women and people of colour most. Technology is largely
designed by (and profits) people who are white, male and living in the
Global North, while the raw materials are mined and manufactured
elsewhere, by others. While some xenofeminist scholars propose the
ubiquitous use of technology as the way to a feminist future, that
future is less utopic when one considers that much technology is
developed, first and foremost, for military purposes. While there has
[not yet been a [feminist posthuman reading of autonomous weapons
systems]{.mark} which seeks [to dissect the false binaries
upheld]{.mark} within the debates on these weapons between the
[human-machine and **autonomy**]{.mark} **automation**]{.underline},
there has been some limited engagement with these systems from a
feminist perspective by NGOs, one example being the Women's
International League for Peace and Freedom's disarmament programme,
'Reaching Critical Will'. They consider the masculine nature of
militarism and the ways in which this would only likely get worse if
[[machines stripped of **empathy** engage in killing]{.mark}, instead of
soldiers in face-to-face combat. It is]{.underline} interesting to note
that many of the [**posthuman** perspectives which currently exist on
the topic of **conflict** and technology do come from a **gender**
perspective.]{.underline} These works come from outside the legal
discipline, however, and tend to focus on drone warfare. [Posthuman
theory, however, could have a key impact if applied to **legal** studies
and the debates around **autonomous** weapons.]{.underline} In refusing
to see the machine as other, noting the links between the machine and
the human, a posthuman approach would refuse the [[**exceptionalism**
promoted by existing discourses]{.mark} on autonomous weapons,
[**allowing** for discussions]{.mark} to encompass a]{.underline} wider
range of [[human-machine life/]{.mark}death decision-making.
[**Killing** machines]{.mark} may not be created as killer robots but
may come into existence through other civil or [**military**
technological **developments**]{.mark},]{.underline} such as artificial
intelligence (AI) which may not have been designed to kill, but may
ultimately be used to kill.38 [More **mundane** but equally dangerous
are developments in algorithm-driven decision-making]{.underline}.39
Further to this, given the vast advances in wearable military
technologies and human enhancement technologies, a killer machine of the
dystopian kind envisaged by many NGOs may, in [fact, come about through
[**technologically** enhancing soldiers and turning them into
**superhuman**]{.mark} soldiers.]{.underline} While such cyborg soldiers
would not be deemed autonomous weapons under existing understandings of
such systems, they will beg the same ethical questions around control
and accountability, something which has not yet been recognised by the
existing work on autonomous weapons. After all, at what point does a
technologically mediated human become more machine than human? While job
automation may indeed help create a post-work, post-capitalist
society,40 such systems pose vast ethical issues around control and
accountability. '[Fully automated luxury communism' seems less luxurious
in the face of machines taking professional killing jobs.41]{.underline}
Drawing on the XFM, this article concludes by proposing the need for a
[posthumanxenofeminist discourse on autonomous weapons
systems]{.underline} and other civil and military technologies. This
means that we do not need to '[abandon' technology, but rather to use it
warily, drawing on the wisdom of intersectional critiqu]{.underline}es
and seeking a post-capitalist vision of society.42 This article
therefore makes several key contributions. First, the paper adds to the
debate on 'autonomous' weapons by challenging existing definitions of
such systems. The paper also analyses the international debates on these
systems from the as-yet unapplied perspective of posthuman-xenofeminism,
highlighting both what feminist posthuman and xenofeminist theory may
add to the debates on autonomous weapons systems. Further, [this article
adds to **feminist** approaches to international law by situating them
within discussions of autonomous weapons, proposing a new
**posthuman-xenofeminist methodology** for such approaches]{.underline}.
I conclude that there is a need for feminist posthuman intervention into
the legal regulation of all technologies -- one that understands the
ways in which humans-machines work in connection while seeking to
[[prevent]{.mark} [the creation of all killer machines]{.mark}, thereby
refusing [current attempts at technological]{.mark} legal regulation
[which distinguish between civil and military
technologies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Jean **[[Baudrillard blames the failure of the "revolution" on women and
change]{.mark},]{.underline}** women's change. [[He sees puritanical
"hysterics" everywhere whom he accuses of exaggeration about sexual
abus]{.mark}e]{.underline} (1986, p. 42). The radical nostalgia which
pervades his postmodern scribbling is for Rousseau's (1979) Sophie and
Lasch's haven in a heartless world[. For Baudrillard, a rapist is a
violent fetus who longs for ancient prohibitions not sexual
liberatio]{.underline}n (1986, p. 47**[). [Baudrillard's pessimism is
actually his hope for a defeat of feminist initiated change and a return
to man and god in contra]{.mark}ct, the eternal sacrifice of
woman.]{.underline}** His ramblings in his cups of cool whisky (1986, p.
7) are given the status of thought. [[He considers himself]{.mark} outré
and [daring to criticize feminist]{.mark}s but, as anyone who has taken
a feminist position knows, misogynous attack is banal and
regular]{.underline}. **[S[orry, Baudrillard: it is outré to support and
to be a feminist.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But is this in vino veritas,
when Baudrillard proposes a Dionysian sacrifice of woman to the image of
beauty, purity, eternity? In Amérique, [he [writes: "One should always
bring something to sacrifice in the desert and offer it as a victim. A
woman]{.mark}. If something has to disappear there, something equal in
beauty to the desert, why not a woman?]{.underline} (1986, p. 66). [When
queried about this "gratuitously provocative statement" Baudrillard
replied, "Sacrificing a woman in the desert is a logical operation
because in the desert one loses one's identity. It's a sublime act and
part of the drama of the desert. **[Making a woman the object of the
sacrifice is perhaps the greatest compliment I could give
her]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (Moore: 1989, p. 54). A compliment
postmodernism will make over and over, like opera.18 Commenting on a
sacrificial scene in D.H.Lawrence's The Woman Who Rode Away, Millett
writes: This is a formula for sexual cannibalism: substitute the knife
for the penis and penetration, the cave for a womb, and for a bed, a
place of execution---and you provide a murder whereby one acquires one's
victim's power. Lawrence's demented fantasy has arranged for the male to
penetrate the female with the instrument of death so as to steal her
mana\... The act here at the centre of the Lawrentian sexual religion is
coitus as killing, [its [central vignette a picture of human sacrifice
performed upon the woman to the greater glory and potency of the
male]{.mark}]{.underline} (1971, p. 292).

Nonetheless, [Baudrillard's contradictions seem less subtle than those
of other practitioners of such theory]{.underline}, since he remains
within a classical theoretical rhetoric of assertion, category, logic.
If Baudrillard's case is interesting to me, it is, first of all, because
of the blatant enormity of the contradictions which are better hidden by
the stylistic charms of a Derrida or a Lacan. And second of all (this
second reason being for me the primary one -- my hidden agenda, in
fact), because [the contradictions seem linked to a rather rabid attack
Baudrillard makes on feminism]{.underline}. Many of us have seriously
wondered about the effect of French theory on feminism's health.
[Baudrillard is, to my knowledge, the male French theorist who most
explicitly and most frontally adopts an adversarial relation to
feminism. I would like to quote you a passage from the first chapter of
De la seduction where the theoretical contradiction occurs within
Baudrillard's pronouncement of the proper course for women: "Now, woman
is only appearance. And it's the feminine as appearance that defeats the
profundity of the masculine. Women instead of rising up against this
'insulting' formula would do well to let themselves be seduced by this
truth, because here is the secret of their power which they are in the
process of losing by setting up the profundity of the female against
that of the masculine"]{.underline} (p. 22). When he writes "insulting
formula," he puts the word "insulting" (injurieuse) in quotation marks.
[He does not consider it an insult to say that woman is only appearance.
Baudrillard is writing against the history of writing against
appearances. He is for appearances, and against profundity, so when he
says that "woman is only appearance" it should be taken as a
compliment.]{.underline} Nonetheless, [when I read this passage, as a
woman, I feel insulted. Baudrillard would have it that my feeling of
offense is a great error which stems from my inscription within the sort
of masculinistic essentialist thinking which condemns appearances as
misleading mediations of essences, realities, and truths]{.underline}.
Yet, in considering the passage carefully, I decide that it is not what
he says about "woman" that offends me so much as what he says about
"women": "Women would do well," he advises, "to let themselves be
seduced by this truth." It is the phrase "would do well" (feraient bein
de) that irks me. Although he puts "insulting" in quotation marks, [he
uses the word -"truth" (verite) straight. He knows the truth -- the
profound or hidden truth, I might add -- about women, and women, "would
do well to let themselves be seduced" by the truth he utters. He speaks
not from the masculine or masculinist position (which he identifies as
against appearances and for profundities) but from a position that knows
the truth of the feminie and the masculine and can thus, from this
privileged position beyond sexual difference, advise women how best to
combat masculine power. It is his assumption from this position of
superiority, of speaking the truth -- more than any content of "truth"
that he may utter -- which offends me.]{.underline} Women, he wants, are
in danger of losing their power, but if they would only let themselves
be seduced by what he says... A line if ever I heard one. The problem
may not lie with the women -- the women are not "letting themselves" be
seduced -- [the problem may lie with Baudrillard's "technique." Perhaps
truth never seduces, or at least not self-certain truth or certainly at
all]{.underline}. Baudrillard asserts, in this book, which is, after
all, very insightful about how seduction works, that "it is by our
fragility that we seduce, never by powers or by strong signs." (p. 115)
As opposed to truth, which is necessarily irreverersible (the opposite
of the truth cannot be true), seduction, as Baudrillard understands it,
is the very principle of reversibility. [Hence the very best "technique"
for seduction turns out to be that which can never be simply a technique
at all.]{.underline} As Baudrillard puts it: "To be seduced is yet again
the best way to seduce... No one, if he is not seduced, will seduce
others." (p.112) [Truth cannot seduce; only seduction seduces.
Baudrillard cannot seduce feminism with his truth, because he protects
his truth from being seduced by feminism.]{.underline}

End of Seduction: A Few Words About Baudrillard\'s \"Sex\"", Pg.
113-114, Vance)**

In \"The Destiny of the Sexes and the Decline of Sexual Illusion\" Jean
Baudrillard at once mourns the loss of the shimmering artifices and
alluring indeterminacies of the seductive gaze, and condemns the
emancipatory discourses of sexual identity which for him amount finally
to so much \"leering\" (Baudrillard\'s word loucher, bears the
connotations of ogling, squinting, and gawking). The depressing social
scene that Baudrillard observes in the wake of these changes in
perspective are as lurid as any hyper-reality that one could imagine.
[Gaping at each other across a gendered divide, Baudrillard sugests, men
and women consolidate their respective fantasies of power, knowledge and
identity, but only as a prelude to a further and more wide-reaching
cultural and psychological disaster, here rather schematically described
as \"the commutation of sexual polarities.\"]{.underline} The ensuing
situation is profoundly counter-intuitive, not to say iconoclastic, like
so many of the social landscapes that now bear Baudrillard\'s name; it
is as if once the sexes get a hard look at each other, abandoning the
suspense and the tension of the playfully seductive glances, they in
effect hold each other hostage. [Sexual difference - which for
Baudrillard is, properly speaking, the site of seductive gaming and of
illusions that are freed from any nostalgic comparison to a
\'reality\' - thereby collapses into a field of indetermination where
the subject positions designated \"man\" and \"woman\" threaten to
switch uncontrollably like an alternating current. In a strategic move
that remains extremely troublesome for many of his readers, Baudrillard
chooses to identify the chief assassin of seduction and the subsequent
triumph of sexual in-difference with **something called**
\"feminism.\"]{.underline} An old hand at decoding the stakes,
displacments, decoys, and deceits of seduction (let us not forget that
his initial meditation on the beguiling art, De la seduction, was
written in the late 1970s), Baudrillard has for years warned readers
that the positive capacity of each sex to be the bearer of a radical
illusoriness had been irretrievably undermined by the politics and the
epistemologies of sexual emancipation. [For Baudrillard, \"feminism\" in
particular subtly reproduces certain humanistic and melioristic
assumptions about sexual identity and the subject, committed, as it is,
to giving a voice to that subject\'s imagined \"depths,\" or, 14 Jean
Caroline Bayard, Michael Kliffer & Daniel Simeoni in his words, to be
bringing \"out \'the real woman\' (or the biological or psychological
being, conscious or unconscious, that she is supposed to be).\" This
\"outing\" of and grounding in \"sex,\" he contends, spells the end of
its seductive illusions, or, to be more precise, the end of its
existence as seductive illusion;]{.underline} [in the supposed name of
truth and freedom, subject positions instead harden to the point that
they become interchangeable, and consequently in-different to the
difference that might otherwise keep their radical illusoriness
alive]{.underline}. [That Baudrillard continues to speak this way about
sex, notwithstanding wholesale shifts in his thinking about many other
questions, puts to us just how important \"seduction\" remains for him
as a point of critical leverage on the postmodern condition. A world
devoid of seduction and of the illusion of sexual differentiation is a
world in which \"passion\" has been evacuated from \"the firmanent of
concepts,\"]{.underline} as Baudrillard melancholically puts it.
Baudrillard writes in an age that has seen the collapse of utopian
desires and the breaking of the greatest ideological icons; the
commutation of sexual difference is not unconnected to these declines,
yet it is one about which Baudrillard is tellingly regretful. [It is
perhaps worth noting that the single figure who is perhaps most closely
identified with postmodern iconoclam here flirts shamelessly with making
a fetishistic idol out of both \"the sexes\" and the \"sovereign\" power
of \"seduction\" in whose thrall the chimera of the sexes is said to
thrive. Hence the passion of his lament for the end of seductive
passion, a lament that it is difficult to read - not to say unacceptable
to a majority of feminist thinkers, several of whom have denounced
Baudrillard as naive at best, and violently sexist at
worst.]{.underline}

Moreover, while [Baudrillard]{.underline} was calling for a cultural
revolution¶ and total revolution (1975: pp.130ff.), he [never explicitly
formulated any concrete vision or practice of revolution]{.underline},
other¶ than some reflections on urban grafitti as a form of political¶
resistance (Baudrillard 1976: pp. 118ff.). [Thus his micropolitics are
rather vague and empty.]{.underline} [His ultra-left politics of the
time are really no more than slogans]{.underline} which position his
theory as \'ultrarevolutionary\'.¶ But, it is not clear what this
revolution could¶ accomplish in view of the hegemony of the dominant
codes that¶ he described. In fact, [there is extreme tension between his
advocacy of cultural revolution and his descriptions of the system\'s
ability to absorb all oppositional practices]{.underline}. For a
cultural revolution¶ would produce new practices, institutions, signs,
codes,¶ values, and so on, but in Baudrillard\'s theory all practices
and¶ signs are controlled by and absorbed into the almighty code - a¶
typically vague and undertheorized term. Thus, the only practice¶ that
he can really recommend is total refusal, total negativity, and¶ the
utopia of radical otherness (Baudrillard 1975: pp. 130ff.,¶ passim).¶
Like Foucault and Deleuze and Guattari, Baudrillard\'s politics¶ at this
time circulate in the trajectory of ultra-leftist \'gauchiste\'¶
discourses which purport to be more radical and revolutionary¶ than
traditional Marxism. Such gauchistes took ultra-left positions¶ and
operated outside of the major left parties, either forming¶ splinter
parties or groups, or acting as an extra-parliamentary¶ opposition.
[Baudrillard]{.underline} and other French thinkers of the period,¶
deeply influenced by the heterogeneous uprisings of May 1968,¶
decisively broke with Marxian working-class politics and sought¶
alternative perspectives for revolutionary politics. Yet he [never
succeeded in articulating any concrete and specific political
perspectives]{.underline} and in his later works turned away from
political¶ reflection and critique altogether.

Furthermore, [Baudrillard\'s analysis operates on an excessively high
level of abstraction]{.underline}. He fails to make key distinctions
and¶ engages in misplaced abstraction. For instance, Ron Silliman¶
pointed out in his response to Baudrillard at the Montana conference¶
that Baudrillard failed to distinguish between tranvestism and¶
transexuality. Transvestites play at dressing as members of the¶
opposite sex and enjoy the \'gender fucking\' and subversion of¶ dress
codes; transsexuals, by contrast, are often tortured and¶ suffering
individuals who can appear uncomfortable in either sex \~¶ as evidenced
by the high rate of suicides of those who undergo sex¶ change
operations. But [human suffering is erased from Baudrillard\'s
semiological universe which abstractly describes certain sign spectacles
abstracted from material underpinnings]{.underline}.¶ The same bad
abstraction appears in his travelogue America¶ (l988d).
[Baudrillard]{.underline} speeds through the desert of America and¶
merely sees signs floating by. He looks at Reagan on TV and sees¶ only
his smile. He hangs out in southern California and concludes¶ that the
United States is a \'realized utopia\'. He [fails to see]{.underline},¶
however, [the homeless, the poor, racism and sexism, people dying of
AIDS, oppressed immigrants, and fails to relate any of the phenomena
observed to the vicissitudes of capitalism]{.underline} (he¶ denies that
capital ever existed in America!), or to the conservative¶ political
hegemony of the 1980s. [Baudrillard\'s imaginary is thus a highly
abstract sign fetishism which abstracts from social relations and
political economy]{.underline} in order to perceive the¶ play of signs
in the transvestite spectacles of the transaesthetic,¶ transsexual, and
transpolitical. Baudrillard\'s \'trans\' manoeuvres,¶ however, are those
of an idealist skimming the surface of appearances¶ while speeding
across an environment which he never contextualizes, understands, or
really comes to terms¶ with.

Valentinas: [We all know that Jean Baudrillard did not believe that the
Gulf War did take place]{.underline}, as it was over-mediated and
over-simulated. In fact, the Gulf War II is still not over, and Iraq
became much more than just a Frankenstein laboratory for the new media,
technology and "democracy" games. What can we learn from wars that do
not take place, even though they cannot be finished? Are they becoming a
symptom of our times as a confrontation between multiple time-lines,
ideologies and technologies in a single place?¶ Lars: Actually, it has
always been the same: new wars have been better test-beds for the state
of art technologies and the latest computer-controlled firearms. The
World War I already was a fully mechanized war where pre-robots were
fighting each other and gassing the troops. And afterwards, the winners
shape the new world order.¶ Olaf: **[Who on hell is

fuck,**]{.underline} **[French philosophy deals too much with luxury

I went to see that Virilio's exhibition \"Ce qui arrive\" at Foundation
Cartier in 2003. I was smashed by that banal presentation of the evil of
all kinds: again[, natural catastrophes and evil done by

with]{.underline} a piece of \"[theory]{.underline}\". There you find it
all, filed up in one row: [the pure luxur]{.underline}y [of]{.underline}
the Cartier-funded Jean Nouvel building, an [artwork without any blood
in its veins]{.underline}, and that late Christian philosophy about the
techno-cataclysm being the revenge of God. **[Pure shit, turned into
gold in the holy cellars of the modern alchemists'

Manhattan towers opposed to Iraqian war pictures: that's not Armageddon,
that's man-invented war technology to be used to subdue others. And

**[War technology has always been made to make killing

[Compare Baudrillard with **Henry Dunant,** the founder of
the]{.underline} International Committee of the [Red Cross]{.underline}.
[Dunant was no philosopher]{.underline}, he was just an intelligent rich
man in the late 19th century. But [his ideas went far more in the
direction where **you should hope to find**
**philosophers**]{.underline} as well. He experienced war as a
\"randonneur\": he passed by, [he]{.underline} [saw]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} suffering and the [inhumanity of war.]{.underline}
**[And he felt obliged to act]{.underline}**. Apart from the maybe 10
days he spent on the battlefield, on the beautiful meadows in the
Europeans Alps, helping wounded people to survive, [as a complete
medical layman he decided to do something more sustainable against these
odds.]{.underline} [He knew that his efforts]{.underline}
[couldn't]{.underline} [prevent wa]{.underline}r in general, [but he
felt that he could alter the cruelty of reality. **And he succeeded in

Geneva, where they are still based. And they are not only doing their
necessary surgeon's work in the field: they are as well **[fighting with
