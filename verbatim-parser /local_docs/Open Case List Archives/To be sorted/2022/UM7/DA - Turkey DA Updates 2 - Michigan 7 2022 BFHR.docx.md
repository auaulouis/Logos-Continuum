Russia Taps Allies of Convenience",

[BRUSSELS --- Commenting on the visit of Vladimir V. [Putin to
Iran]{.mark}, a member of the Russian Parliament and television [talking
head]{.mark}, Yevgeny G. Popov, said that the two countries hoped to
[form an "axis of good," mocking]{.mark} former President George W.
[Bush's]{.mark} description of Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an "axis of
evil."]{.underline} Trolling American foreign-policy blunders and
rhetoric is a popular sport in Russia, from Mr. Putin, the president, on
down, but the growing affection between Russia and Iran is that of two
isolated, sanctions-stricken countries whose main connection is their
active opposition to the United States, its allies and its domination of
the multilateral world order. [While the United States likes to wrap its
alliances in grandiloquent words about shared values and democracy,
Russia, Iran and China, Moscow's other openly supportive pal and
American rival, are far more transactional in their connections. But
transactional relations do not make for lasting alliances or disguise
the strains within them.]{.underline} "Russia is isolated on the global
stage in a way it's never been," said Charles A. Kupchan, a former
American official who is a professor at Georgetown University. "Putin is
looking for recognition and acceptance wherever he can get it, and that
he can get it in Tehran speaks volumes." Even China, which has stood by
its anti-American partnership with Russia, "has carefully kept its
distance from the war in Ukraine," Mr. Kupchan said. "And even though
the lion's share of the world's countries aren't enforcing the sanctions
regime against Russia, they get it: that Russia's invasion was a bald
act of aggression." [[Turkey has no interest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} being
part of [any new axis]{.mark} [or alliance]{.mark} with Russia or Iran.
Instead, [Ankara]{.mark} has very [artfully managed a foreign policy
that is diversified and open to all sides]{.mark} and that gives it
considerable leverage with both Moscow and Washington. "[Turkey]{.mark}
is [skillfully walking]{.mark} a [middle path]{.mark}, signaling to the
Americans that it won't just be a compliant ally and do what we want,
but they're signaling the same thing to the Russians," Mr. Shapiro said.
Mr. Heisbourg agreed. "[The Turks continue]{.mark} [to play both
sides]{.mark} against the middle and they are in a very strong position
to do so," he said. "It's a highly [profitable game politically]{.mark},
economically [and strategically]{.mark} --- but [that excludes any new
alliance."]{.mark}]{.underline} Turkey has created a vital role for
itself as the mediator between Russia and Ukraine --- effectively the
mediator between Washington, NATO and Russia. It has worked with all
sides, including the United Nations, to try to get Ukrainian (and
Russian) grain exports out through the Black Sea to the developing
world. Mr. Erdogan has bought Russian antiaircraft missiles and has not
joined Western sanctions against Russia, which has irked Washington. But
Turkey remains a key NATO ally of the United States, signed a tough
anti-Russian communiqué at the NATO summit in Madrid, has sold Ukraine
weapons and drones that are helping to kill Russians, and has removed
its block on the entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO, at least for
now. [[Turkey's]{.mark} [mediation]{.mark} may [bring even more
benefits]{.mark}, Mr. Kupchan said. Mr. [Erdogan has credibility]{.mark}
and [channels to both Moscow and Washington]{.mark}, as well as to Kyiv,
and "if he [can broker a deal]{.mark} to get Ukrainian grain flowing
again, that might be the [first step to pivot to diplomacy]{.mark}, a
confidence-building measure that would [require concessions by both
Russia and Ukraine, but could be done under the rubric of humanitarian
aid,"]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr. Kupchan said. What Turkey clearly wanted
from this trilateral summit, however, was narrower --- a green light to
conduct a new military incursion into northern Syria against the Syrian
Kurds, who Mr. Erdogan says are allies with the P.K.K., or Kurdistan
Workers' Party, which he and the West consider terrorists. Attacking the
Kurds is popular in Turkey, even among Mr. Erdogan's opposition, and is
part of his effort to win re-election next year, Mr. Heisbourg said. And
Syria is the only issue where the policies of all three countries
intersect, even though their interests are different. Iran and Russia
have been the firmest allies of Mr. Assad. But Turkey has backed armed
groups fighting for his removal; has sent its troops into northern
Syria; and has kept Syrian, Iranian and Russian troops from conquering
Idlib Province, still mostly controlled by anti-Assad rebels. "With so
much leverage, now is a great time for Erdogan to beat up on the Kurds,"
Mr. Heisbourg said. While Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader,
warned Turkey against further attacks in Syria, Mr. Erdogan was unfazed.
And it's likely that Russia does not much care, so long as the Turkish
intervention is limited to the north. More likely, Mr. Heisbourg
suggested, Mr. Erdogan used the meeting in Tehran to inform Russia and
Iran of his plans and to try to avoid unnecessary confrontation.

"Putin and Erdogan in Iran to Discuss Syria's Future, Ukraine War",
https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/07/putin-and-erdogan-iran-discuss-syrias-future-ukraine-war)LR

[[Russian]{.mark}, [Iranian]{.mark} [presidents aim to prevent
Turkey]{.mark} from a new offensive in northern Syria. The leaders of
Russia, Turkey and Iran are gathering in Tehran, with Ankara's threat of
a new incursion into northern Syria likely to top the
agenda.]{.underline} [While Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has
both domestic and strategic reasons for the move, Russian President
Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi want to maintain the
status quo in Syria, where both their countries have expended
significant resources to prop up the Assad regime]{.underline}. Russia's
war on Ukraine will also feature prominently at the trilateral summit.
Iran has offered to provide Moscow with drones and Putin and Erdogan are
reportedly set to discuss restarting Ukrainian grain exports in the
Black Sea. Increasingly, domestic factors also drive Erdogan's
decision-making on a new offensive into Syria. Turkey's economy is in
crisis, marked by nearly 80 percent inflation causing growing hardship
for Turkish consumers and deepening anxiety across the country. Turkey's
worsening economic woes are also stoking greater hostility toward the
3.6 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey. With elections looming in
2023, Erdogan likely calculates he can win voter sympathy with another
incursion into Syria, at times tying it to an aspirational promise that
Turkey will return one million Syrian refugees to Syria. To varying
degrees, both Russia and Iran oppose a new Turkish offensive. Russia
holds the most sway on the ground in Syria, and a Turkish move would
likely be predicated on a Russian "green light," however pale. Iran has
been more adamant in its opposition to another Turkish incursion, yet
continues to focus on a diplomatic resolution. Given the high stakes for
Erdogan, he is unlikely to be dissuaded from making at least a symbolic
move into Syria. As such, the July 19 trilateral summit could focus on a
three-way negotiation delineating the parameters, constraints and timing
of a limited Turkish operation, although a last-minute diplomatic
resolution could yet forestall another Turkish incursion --- at least in
the short term. [[The war in Ukraine]{.mark} has [given Turkey more
leverage in Syria]{.mark} and [beyond]{.mark} with [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [Russia and Europe]{.mark}. [It is expected it would
use such leverage]{.mark} to downsize the SDF and Kurdish influence in
Syria. Turkey has conducted several military operations in northern Iraq
against the PKK and has not shied away from publicly stating its
interests in creating a deep security zone along its borders with Syria
and Iraq.]{.underline} In the past few years, it has taken incremental
steps toward accomplishing that goal. While the United States
understands Turkey's national security interests, it believes a more
effective and lasting outcome would come through dialogue and political
solution. Drennan: Russia's invasion of Ukraine and resultant push by
the West to isolate Moscow has driven Russia and Iran closer together,
[while Russia-Turkey relations have been more complicated. Officially,
Putin is traveling to Tehran to meet with his Iranian and Turkish
counterparts as part of the Astana process, seeking a settlement to the
conflict in Syria. He is also meeting with each bilaterally, as well as
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Putin likely has at least
two goals for his meeting with Raisi,]{.underline} who he has met with
two other times since January. In the immediate term, he is likely
trying to secure military assistance to support the Russian war effort
in Ukraine. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security advisor,
recently went on record to say that Iran is planning to provide Russia
with unmanned systems to assist with long-range artillery targeting.
Other U.S. officials have stated that the Iranians could begin providing
up to 300 remotely piloted aircraft and begin training Russian
servicemembers in their use as early as this month. More broadly, both
countries have been isolated by Western sanctions, creating an opening
--- or perhaps forcing function --- for them to improve their relations.
Ahead of the visit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov noted that the two
countries could soon sign a treaty on strategic cooperation, bolstering
financial and banking ties in a bid to move away from dollar-denominated
trade. [Russia's relations with Turkey have been fraught. On Syria
specifically, both Russia and Iran are united in their opposition to any
new Turkish offensive, so [Putin will likely push Erdogan]{.mark} on
this issue when they meet. [Putin and Erdogan may also discuss the
contours of a notional deal between Moscow and Kyiv]{.mark} on
[lifting]{.mark} Russia's [blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea]{.mark}
[ports]{.mark} to allow grain exports to leave.]{.underline} [Earlier
this month, [Erdogan suggested that a deal was close to being
reached.]{.mark} Erdogan's role as go-between in this proposed deal
follows from his role elsewhere in the conflict, where he has sought to
play an active role in the Russia-Ukraine peace process. Turkey hosted
two rounds of negotiations in Istanbul in March that ended as Russia
expanded its offensive in Ukraine.]{.underline} The Turkish president
has indicated a willingness to continue playing that role, to little
apparent interest from Russia. [[Ankara]{.mark} has been [reluctant to
sign on to the broader Western sanctions]{.mark} regime against Russia.
At the same time, [Turkey]{.mark} has supplied Ukraine with Bayraktar
TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which the Ukrainian military has used to
great effect against Russian artillery and tanks.]{.underline} Putin may
attempt to pressure Erdogan into limiting or ending future sales, but
Turkey has previously framed the provision of Bayraktars as a private
company's decision, not a state-to-state sale.

Turkey ambassador: strategic ties intact but public unhappy over Turkish
stance on Russia",
https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/07/ukraines-turkey-ambassador-strategic-ties-intact-public-unhappy-over-turkish)LR

[Turkey's relations with Ukraine are showing increasing signs of strain
five months into Russia's invasion of its Black Sea neighbor. The
brewing friction stems from Ukrainian allegations that Russia is
stealing its grain and shipping it to Turkey and Ankara's reluctance to
crack down on the illicit trade.]{.underline} Turkish inaction is a
symptom of the deeper malaise besetting the two countries as Ankara
seeks to keep ties with the Kremlin steady even as Russian forces
continue to commit atrocities against Ukraine. [Some accuse Turkey of
tilting ever more toward Russia,]{.underline} a view that pro-Kremlin
media channels in Ukraine zealously propagate. [Turkey insists that it
is "pro-Ukraine" but "not anti-Russian."]{.underline} In an exclusive
interview Wednesday with Al-Monitor, [Ukraine's ambassador to Ankara,
Vasyl Bodnar, acknowledged that the grain issue was bedeviling the
"strategic partners."]{.underline} Tensions escalated today after Ankara
allowed a Russian vessel to leave the port of Karasu on the Black Sea.
[Ukraine summoned Turkey\'s ambassador to Kyiv to air its displeasure
over what Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko called "an
unacceptable situation." "We regret that Russia's ship Zhibek Zholy,
which was full of stolen Ukrainian grain, was allowed to leave Karasu
port despite criminal evidence presented to Turkish
authorities,"]{.underline} Nikolenko said. Turkish customs officials
seized the Russian-flagged Zhibek Zholy after Kyiv said the cargo was
illegally transporting 7,000 tons of grain out of Russian-occupied
Berdyansk, a port in southeast Ukraine. [The move followed a flood of
similar demands from Ukraine for numerous ships,]{.underline} which
open-source intelligence reports indicate are transporting Ukrainian
grain mainly from Russian-occupied Crimea and from newly wrested
Ukrainian ports. Bodnar said Kyiv had "bombarded" Ankara with "notes and
information" supporting the claims. [But Turkey remained unswayed. "As I
was explained by Turkish colleagues so far they only have documents
showing that these are Russian ships carrying Russian grains from
Russian ports," Bodnar said, echoing statements by Turkey's foreign
minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu.]{.underline} Bodnar continued, "We provided
them different information on grain, including ones of legal character.
Let's look at some details. For example, let's look at who is receiving
the grain. In Iskenderun, for example, there was a Russian company that
owns the port and was unloading some of this grain. The Turkish
authorities need to thoroughly check who the buyers are and what sort of
contracts they have signed." The envoy acknowledged, nonetheless, that
establishing theft is a challenge. The ships typically use false
documents and switch off their short-range coastal tracking systems to
avoid detection when loading goods. \"There is a problem of judicial
character; we should be able to establish that the grain is stolen. From
a legal standpoint, we need formal testimony from witnesses of the
theft, from the owners of the grain or analysis of the grain," Bodnar
noted. However, the case against the Zhibek Zholy was watertight.
Ukrainian officials said they had all the evidence that the ship had
departed from Berdyansk. Even Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov,
confirmed that the ship was Russian-flagged but then claimed that it
belonged to Kazakhstan and was being "carried on a contract between
Estonia and Turkey." [Ukraine was clearly hoping that diplomatic
pressure from Washington and the EU combined with a slew of damning
investigative reports splashed across prominent Western outlets in
recent weeks would shame Ankara into action.]{.underline} The optimism
proved premature and [the Kremlin was delighted. "Having an important
NATO country not joining in sanctions against it is a huge plus for
Russia, and if it can drive a wedge between Turkey and Ukraine as it has
between Turkey and NATO, all the better]{.underline}," said a Western
diplomat speaking not for attribution. The diplomat was referring to
Turkey's threats to block Sweden\'s and Finland's membership ahead of
the alliance's summit in Madrid. While Turkey has sealed its straits
linking the Black Sea and the Mediterranean to Russian naval ships and
its airspace to Russian military planes, it has blocked passage of NATO
ships through the waterways as well and kept its airspace open to
Russian commercial planes. Timothy Ash, a London-based emerging-market
strategist who closely follows Turkey and Ukraine, said, "I think in the
beginning that the Bayraktar thing won Ukrainian hearts. [But now I
think there is a realization that the Turks are trying to exploit the
conflict." Turkey's finance minister, Nurettin Nebati, reportedly told a
group of Western financiers as much during a recent briefing. "He said
'we are going to benefit from the sanctions \[on Russia\] as we did in
Iraq]{.underline},'" one of the bankers present at the gathering told
Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity. Bodnar concedes that the mood in
his country is starting to sour. "Since the start of the war, the
Ukrainian public has become very sensitive about Russia and Russians and
the narrative that Turkey is balancing both sides. This perception of
cooperation with Russia, Russian tourists, affects public opinion in
Ukraine. In meetings with Turkish officials, we asked them to consider
the opportunity to join in sanctions against Russia, but that it is
their choice[." However, with Turkey's economy in shambles amid rising
global food and energy prices and nationwide elections around the
corner, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is desperate for the war
to end]{.underline}. "There is a desire to end it at any cost even if it
means getting the Ukrainians to end the war on Russia's terms," Ash told
Al-Monitor. Moreover, [opinion polls suggest that many Turks believe the
canard that the United States ignited the war and is "using" Ukraine to
get at Russia.]{.underline} Bodnar says the reality is more nuanced.
"[If you look at the figures, almost everyone in Turkey is supporting
us." Moreover, there was "no question" from the beginning of the war and
"in view of the heroic resistance the Ukrainian people are displaying"
that the Turkish government would "tell us to compromise or bow to
Russian demands. There has been no such pressure."]{.underline} Turkey
has offered to serve as a guarantor, but Ukraine remains skeptical. "If
Turkey were to be a guarantor country, I have doubts that even when
[Turkey might be supporting Ukraine politically and diplomatically that
it would take any practical steps in case of Russian attacks on
Ukrainian ports]{.underline}. I don't see any kind of military leverage
or deterrence, and this is a huge threat to Ukraine," Gaber said.
Erdogan claimed on Wednesday that the sides were close to finalizing a
deal. Bodnar shared his optimism, telling Al-Monitor, "[I believe that
we will see some kind of agreement as a result of combined mediation
efforts by Turkey and the UN."]{.underline}
