#### War in Ukraine highlighted key shortfalls in US-NATO precision munition supplies -- only increasing supplies prevents inevitable conflict

**Mahnken 22** -- Thomas G. Mahnken is president and chief executive
officer of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a
senior research professor at The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies. (Thomas G. Mahnken, \"The US needs a new approach
to producing weapons. Just look at Ukraine.,\" Defense News, 4-26-2022,

Accessed 6-20-2022, LASA-SC)

The [war in Ukraine has offered]{.underline} **[vivid
testimony]{.underline}** [of the effectiveness]{.underline}, and the
high usage rate, [of]{.underline} **[modern precision
weapons]{.underline}**. [Ukraine has]{.underline} so far **[been
fortunate]{.underline}** [to receive a massive supply of such munitions
from]{.underline} the United States, Britain and other **[NATO
states.]{.underline}**

Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has told
Congress [the West]{.underline} has [delivered]{.underline} **[60,000
antitank weapons]{.underline}** and 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons to
Kyiv. Weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank guided weapon and Stinger
surface-to-air missile played an important role in halting Moscow's
initial offensive and forced the Russian leadership to scale back its
expansive objectives. However, [it has become **increasingly
apparent**]{.underline} [such weapons are]{.underline} **[neither
cheap]{.underline}** [nor]{.underline} **[available in unlimited
numbers]{.underline}**. Indeed, the United States has reportedly
provided Kyiv one-third of its overall stockpile of Javelins.

**[Unless things change]{.underline}**, and soon, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [may be **far less
fortunate** in a future conflict]{.underline}. Put bluntly, although the
United States and its allies have been able to resupply Ukraine, the
United States cannot count on similar help should the roles be reversed.
[U.S. allies' stocks of precision weapons **are limited**]{.underline},
[and they may have an **urgent need for these munitions** in a future
coalition conflict.]{.underline}

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will]{.underline} also
[need]{.underline} **[large numbers]{.underline}** [of longer-range
weapons]{.underline} like the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile --
Extended Range (JASSM-ER) and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) that
are not as widely available as the Javelin and Stinger are today. [It is
thus]{.underline} **[imperative]{.underline}** [for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its allies
to]{.underline} both **[increase their munitions]{.underline}** capacity
[and adopt]{.underline} **[innovative approaches to munitions
production.]{.underline}**

The war in Ukraine is but the most recent reminder that 21st century
warfare is munitions intensive. As NATO found out in its 2011 air
campaign over Libya, and as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
discovered in their war against the Houthis in Yemen, [military
operations against even relatively unsophisticated adversaries can
require the use of **large quantities of precision
weapons**]{.underline}. As recently as 2015, the U.S. Air Force ran
dangerously low on Hellfire air-launched missiles in its campaign
against ISIS.

The [effectiveness of precision weaponry]{.underline} [against invading
Russian forces has been]{.underline} **[impressive]{.underline}** [but
has also highlighted the fact that the current U.S. munitions
infrastructure]{.underline} **[is not robust]{.underline}** [enough to
support a high-intensity, protracted conflict against a major adversary
such as Russia or China]{.underline}. In fact, in 2019 the
Congressionally-mandated National Defense Strategy panel warned of the
inadequacy of the current munitions base and highlighted the need to
expand and sustain it.

Similarly, the [requirement for]{.underline} **[greater
investment]{.underline}** [in munitions is a recurring finding of
**wargames and strategic choices**]{.underline} [exercises that the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments has conducted over the
course of years.]{.underline} The current [U.S. munitions production
base]{.underline} **[lacks capacity]{.underline}**, and manufacturing
methods are not always tailored to the needs of 21st century warfare.
For example, it reportedly takes 18-24 months to manufacture a
production run of Stinger missiles. [Too often, the capacity of the
industrial base rests on second-tier suppliers with even more limited
capacity and supply chains that are vulnerable to
disruption.]{.underline}

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should consider its
munitions requirements **in coordination with key allies and
partners**]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[needs to do more to **meet its own munitions**]{.underline} [needs but
may also need to **supply allies with large numbers of munitions as
well**]{.underline}. It is in America's interest to have sufficient
munitions capacity to be able to supply frontline states without having
to draw down its own stocks to perilously low levels. [Some]{.underline}
U.S. allies, such as Australia, are making considerable investments to
build up their own munitions industry, but more needs to be done.

The [Defense Department needs to analyze]{.underline} **[U.S. and allied
munitions requirements]{.underline}** [for 21st century
warfare]{.underline}, both for Ukraine and beyond. The [ongoing war with
Russia offers]{.underline} a [valuable set of data]{.underline}, [but a
war against China may have **very different requirements**]{.underline}:
the need for many long-range weapons, for example, as well as for lots
of anti-ship missiles. [How many munitions do we and our allies
require]{.underline}, [and of what type]{.underline}? To what extent
must our current production capacity be expanded to meet that demand?
How many munitions and of what types need to be stockpiled, and what
sort of surge production capacity is needed on top of that? [Would it
make sense to stockpile certain long-lead-time components, such as
seekers, and if so, where?]{.underline}

[Transforming]{.underline} [the U.S. munitions base will **take time and
investment**]{.underline} [and would benefit from]{.underline}
**[innovative approaches]{.underline}** [to yield greater
capability]{.underline} and capacity while reducing unit cost. [The need
to expand the munitions base offers an excellent opportunity to **bring
new firms into the defense industrial base**]{.underline}. The task of
fielding modern precision weapons is much more achievable than, say,
building a next-generation combat aircraft, and new entrants can bring
innovative design and manufacturing approaches to the table, such as
modular or multi-mission designs. [The Defense Department should also
consider innovative approaches to precision weapons, such as the
adoption of loitering munitions and guided projectiles that can be
**purchased in large numbers at low cost for both offensive and
defensive missions.**]{.underline}

The [war in Ukraine]{.underline} has [highlighted lethality of modern
precision weapons]{.underline} on the battlefield, [but also the
fragility of the current munitions base]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[cannot enter]{.underline}**
[the next war with inadequate stocks of precision
munitions]{.underline}, [**nor would it be acceptable to cut off allies
from resupply** in order to husband limited stockpiles for its own
defense]{.underline}. Rather, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [needs to work with its close allies to both
increase their collective munitions stockpiles and production capacity
while also adopting innovative approaches to munitions
production]{.underline}

#### Allies agree that now is key to prepare for the next conflict

**Clark 22** -- Maiya Clark is a Senior Research Associate at the Center
for National Defense. (Maiya Clark, \"The War in Ukraine Continues; Can
the U.S. Defense-Industrial Base Keep Up?,\" Heritage Foundation,

Accessed 6-20-2022, LASA-SC)

[The conflict has]{.underline}, however, [given rise to]{.underline}
**[silver linings]{.underline}**. **[Many]{.underline}** [of our allies
are waking up to the need to **boost their defense
spending**]{.underline}.

[Germany]{.underline} has [decided to buy F-35s]{.underline} from the
U.S. [and pledged an]{.underline} **[increased defense
budget]{.underline}**, exceeding NATO's 2%-of-GDP target. [Poland has
moved to increase its defense spending as well]{.underline}, with the
goal of reaching 3% of GDP by 2023.

To some degree, the [Russia-Ukraine conflict has served as a **stress
test**]{.underline} [for the West's defense industrial
base]{.underline}. From that has come a [growing recognition
that,]{.underline} for too long, [America has **underestimated** the
amount of munitions and platforms required in modern
warfare.]{.underline}

[Due to the **complexity and time**]{.underline} [required to
manufacture today's precision weapons]{.underline}, **[we must start
thinking now]{.underline}**, [before a war breaks out, about whether
America has enough weaponry to sustain a conflict.]{.underline}

#### The AI arms race with Russia is only escalating -- applying that tech to PGMs is the [next frontier]{.underline}.

**Suciu 20** -- Peter Suciu is a defense writer and journalist for the
National Interest. (Peter Suciu, \"Coming Soon: AI-Powered Jam-Resistant
Munitions,\" National Interest, 12-5-2020,

Accessed 6-18-2022, LASA-SC)

Since antiquity once a weapon was developed there were soon methods to
counter it. [Just as the shield and armor were meant to protect a
soldier from swords and spears]{.underline}, **[today]{.underline}**
[there are now]{.underline} **[countermeasures]{.underline}** [designed
to stop **smart munitions**]{.underline}, which were [first developed
during the]{.underline} **[Second World War.]{.underline}**

[While the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has **[continued to develop even smarter
bombs]{.underline}**, including laser- and GPS-guided bombs, the [latest
efforts]{.underline} include those that [could select
targets]{.underline} automatically [when dropped from an
aircraft.]{.underline} Such **[smart munitions]{.underline}** [could
maneuver in flight after being launched]{.underline}, but efforts have
continued to counter such measures and this has included the use of
jamming technology.

[In what is part of a seemingly never-ending]{.underline} "**[arms
race]{.underline}**," [Russia is now]{.underline} reportedly [developing
software]{.underline} that is [designed for use in precision munitions
of defensive and offensive weapons]{.underline}. According to a report
in TASS last week, Tecmash Group, which is part of the state tech
corporation Rostec, has developed [new]{.underline} analytical
[software]{.underline} [that utilizes]{.underline} **[artificial
intelligence]{.underline}** (AI) [for smart munitions that could make
the weapons resistant to electric warfare systems including
counter-measures]{.underline}.

"[The next-generation munitions with the function of artificial
intelligence are the **most effective means of destruction in a
present-day battle**]{.underline}," Rostec Industrial Director Bekkhan
Ozdoev said via a statement provided by the company\'s press office.

"One of the developers' key tasks was to make the 'smart' core
invulnerable to electronic warfare systems," Ozdoev added. \"The [new
software]{.underline} **[outshines]{.underline}** [Russian and foreign
versions in terms of the munition\'s protection and renders the
operation of electronic warfare systems ineffective]{.underline}.

The system was developed by the Novosibirsk Research Institute of
Electronic Devices, which specializes in creating short-range avionics
systems for munitions. Its [new software could provide increased
capabilities for precision munitions used by both defensive and
offensive platforms. It also utilizes a new system of radio-electronic
protection]{.underline}, which increases the accuracy of striking
targets in a jamming environment. According to the press office, it
allows receiving detailed information on the targets under active
jamming with changing intensity.

[This is just the **most recent** tech]{.underline}
"**[upgrade]{.underline}**" [of smart munitions that Moscow has focused
on]{.underline}. Last year, the [Russian military announced]{.underline}
the development of an **[improved smart bomb]{.underline}** and the
aircraft that carried the weapon. [The SVP-24 was described as a system
that could transform unguided conventional bombs into precision-guided
weapons, similar to the U.S. Joint Direct Attack Munition
(JDAM).]{.underline}

#### The US and NATO need to step up smart PGMs to ensure Russia [does not]{.underline}.

AI-Enabled Weapons in Ukraine, but That Could Change,\" CSIS, 5-26-2022,

Accessed 6-19-2022, LASA-SC)

In March, WIRED ran a story with the headline "[Russia\'s]{.underline}
**[Killer Drone]{.underline}** in Ukraine [Raises Fears About **AI in
Warfare**]{.underline}," with the subtitle, "The maker of the [lethal
drone]{.underline} claims that it [can]{.underline} identify targets
using artificial intelligence." The story focused on the KUB-BLA, a
small kamikaze drone aircraft that smashes itself into enemy targets and
detonates an onboard explosive. The KUB-BLA is [made by]{.underline}
ZALA Aero, a subsidiary of the Russian weapons manufacturer Kalashnikov
(best known as the maker of the AK-47), which itself is partly owned by
**[Rostec]{.underline}**, a [part of **Russia's** government-owned
**defense-industrial complex**.]{.underline}

The WIRED story understandably attracted a lot of attention, but those
who only read the sensational headline missed the article's critical
caveat: "It is unclear if the drone may have been operated in this \[an
AI-enabled autonomous\] way in Ukraine." Other outlets re-reported the
WIRED story, but irresponsibly did so without the caveat.

WIRED's assessment that [Kalashnikov]{.underline} claims the KUB-BLA
"**[boasts]{.underline}** [the ability to identify targets using
**artificial intelligence**]{.underline}" is based on two main pieces of
evidence: a Kalashnikov [press release]{.underline} [about]{.underline}
ZALA Aero's "**[Artificial Intelligence]{.underline}** Visual
Identification (AIVI)" [capabilities]{.underline} [for]{.underline} its
[unmanned aircraft]{.underline}, and the original Kalashnikov press
release announcing the KUB-BLA in 2019.

However, these two pieces of evidence are less than they seem.

The Russian-language AIVI press release never mentions the KUB-BLA or
military applications. Instead, it describes a ZALA Aero
machine-learning AI drone product line that is marketed to industrial
and agricultural sectors. Incorporating modern machine-learning AI into
military applications is significantly more difficult than in industrial
or agricultural applications. Modern machine-learning AI using deep
neural networks offers the opportunity for incredible gains in
performance, but that performance depends on having lots of training
data during development. Moreover, that training data needs to closely
resemble operational conditions.

In general, it is much easier to get such training data from commercial
customers than from an enemy military, especially if friendly weapons
systems and sensors do not often come within range of enemy ones. [The
**most mature**]{.underline} [military AI]{.underline}
[applications]{.underline} [are ones like satellite
reconnaissance]{.underline}: even in peacetime, satellites get to take a
lot of pictures of Russian and Chinese military forces, and those
pictures can be digitally labeled by human experts to turn them into
training data. Training data is what machine learning AI systems learn
from. The combination of a learning algorithm and training data is how
AI systems learn to recognize what is in the image. But training data is
generally application-specific. Satellite image recognition training
data only helps build satellite image recognition AI. [One cannot
magically use labeled satellite image data **to train an AI for a
robotic drone's targeting computer**]{.underline} (at least not with
today's technology).

Getting enough of the right sort of training data to incorporate modern
AI into, say, a robotic tank's targeting computer, is a much tougher
technical challenge. It is not impossible in principle, but in practice,
there are far fewer opportunities to collect the right sort of training
data.

[This is **not** to say Russia has not tried]{.underline}. In the past,
[Rostec and Kalashnikov]{.underline} executives **[have
not]{.underline}** [been shy about their attempts to develop weapons
that successfully combine modern AI and combat autonomy]{.underline}, so
it would be odd if they had succeeded in doing so with the KUB-BLA and
not disclosed it in their marketing materials. Kalashnikov has been
heavily promoting the KUB-BLA for both Russian and international
customers.

What does Kalashnikov say about the KUB-BLA specifically? The 2019
KUB-BLA announcement states that the system has two means of delivering
the drone and its explosive warhead to target coordinates: "The target
coordinates are specified manually or acquired from \[the sensor\]
payload targeting image."

The vague latter description is what led many to assume KUB-BLA was
using AI. However, "payload targeting image" is consistent with how many
other precision-guided munitions and drone loitering munitions work,
including ones that do not use any advanced AI capabilities. A Rostec
executive specifically described the KUB-BLA as a Russian "domestic
analogue" to the Israeli-built Orbiter 1K drone, which looks nearly
identical. The Orbiter 1K comes with a ground control station where
human operators monitor the video coming from the drone's sensor and
select targets directly from the video feed.

[In other words, a human has already selected the target prior to the
drone attacking it]{.underline}, **[and the drone is only autonomously
maintaining target lock and navigating to the target]{.underline}**,
[not autonomously selecting and deciding to engage targets]{.underline}.
Autonomy over decisions to "select and engage targets" is the specific
standard in U.S. Department of Defense policy as to what qualifies as an
"autonomous weapon system." Fire and forget munitions---which is the
standard term used to describe not only the Orbiter 1K, but also
heat-seeking missiles like the Javelin and Stinger---do not qualify as
autonomous weapons. Those heat-seeking missiles do not use modern deep
neural network machine learning, but they do use thermal image
processing algorithms that were once considered state of the art. They,
and many more systems like them, have been in use for decades by dozens
of militaries around the world.

It is possible that the KUB-BLA received some kind of lethal
AI-targeting upgrade prior to being used in Ukraine, but that is
doubtful. Neither WIRED nor anyone else has provided evidence that this
is the case. [If the weapon did have those capabilities, it is
**unlikely** that Kalashnikov would fail to mention them]{.underline}.
The company has bragged about KUB-BLA's recent use in Ukraine, and in
the past Kalashnikov has openly talked about seeking to develop a "fully
automated combat module" based on AI deep neural network technology.

In sum, [there is]{.underline} **[little reason]{.underline}** [to
believe that Russia is using AI-enabled autonomous weapons in Ukraine,
**yet**]{.underline}. [That is the good news]{.underline}. [The bad news
is that, if Russia's unlawful war in Ukraine drags on]{.underline},
**[Russia has the intent and likely has the means to deploy autonomous
weapons, with or without advanced AI.]{.underline}**

Regarding means, a recent report by Russian news outlet RIA Novosti
interviewed an unnamed Russian military source that is worth quoting
(via Microsoft's automatic translation) at length:

Russian reconnaissance and reconnaissance-strike UAVs will receive a
digital catalog with electronic \[optical and infrared\] images of
military equipment adopted in NATO countries. This will allow them to
automatically identify it on the battlefield and create a map of the
location of enemy positions directly onboard the device, which will be
broadcast to the command post. . . . It is formed due to neural network
training algorithms, which makes it possible to accurately determine the
samples of equipment in a wide variety of environmental conditions,
including with a short exposure (the technique is visible for several
seconds or less), as well as when only part of the sample falls into the
field of view of the drone---when, for example, only part of any combat
vehicle is visible from cover.

[As mentioned above]{.underline}, **[collecting adequate training
data]{.underline}** [remains a]{.underline} **[significant
hurdle]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} many military [AI development
projects]{.underline}. While [the invasion of Ukraine has been a
disaster in many ways for the Russian military]{.underline}, [NATO has
provided weapons and equipment to Ukraine that offers the best
opportunity yet to collect operational training data for new AI models
and more diverse military AI applications.]{.underline} The anonymous
quote suggests that **[Russia's military is taking this opportunity
seriously.]{.underline}**

Of course, [domestic opposition to the war has caused an **exodus of
tech workers from Russia**]{.underline}, and the sanctions levied
against Russia have left it with major shortages of the semiconductor
chips needed to make advanced AI systems. [These are **major
challenges**]{.underline}, [but advanced AI is not required to endow
weapons with all types of lethal autonomous capabilities]{.underline},
**[only a willingness to delegate decisions and freedom to military
machines]{.underline}**. The Israeli-built Harpy autonomous weapon,
which can loiter in the air over a battlefield for hours while searching
for enemy radar emissions to attack, dates back to the late 1980s. In
addition to the KUB-BLA, Kalashnikov makes another drone called the
Lancet, which the aforementioned Rostec executive describes as a Russian
analogue to the more modern Harpy-2 (aka Harop). Kalashnikov claims the
following about the Lancet:

\[The Lancet\] is a smart multipurpose weapon, capable of autonomously
finding and hitting a target. [The weapon system consists of precision
strike component]{.underline}, [reconnaissance, navigation and
communications modules.]{.underline} [It creates **its own navigation
field** and does not require ground or sea-based
infrastructure.]{.underline}

Kalashnikov is clearly marketing the Lancet as a capable autonomous
weapon but also one that can be remotely controlled depending on user
preference. The Russian military has already used the Lancet for combat
operations in Syria in its remotely controlled mode, but observers have
not yet confirmed that the Lancet is being used in Ukraine. Once it
shows up, Russia will likely be tempted to turn on Lancet's autonomous
weapon functionality---that is, if the system's performance matches
Kalashnikov's advertising.

Remotely piloted drones have demonstrated effectiveness in the war in
Ukraine that exceeded most analysts' expectations before the war, when
drones were often viewed as useful in counterinsurgency operations, but
not a high-end conflict against a technologically sophisticated
adversary like Russia. [In military technology competition,
however]{.underline}, **[each successful move leads to a
countermove.]{.underline}** [Many analysts feel that the weak point in
current drone weapons is their reliance on a high-bandwidth
communications link to their human remote controllers]{.underline}. If
the war in Ukraine drags on for many more months or years, expect both
sides to more widely deploy jammers and other electronic warfare systems
to counter drones. Elimination or reduction of remote piloting options
will naturally lead Russia to desire greater autonomy in their drone
weapons.

Regarding intent, [Russia has consistently played the role of **stubborn
obstructionist** through years of UN expert discussions]{.underline}
[about developing new international norms or codes of conduct for the
development and use of autonomous weapons]{.underline}. **[Most
countries]{.underline}** around the world [are being]{.underline}
**[cautious]{.underline}** [with the introduction of military
AI]{.underline}. [Much of the AI ethics and autonomous weapons debate
has been heavily focused on whether or not using AI increases the risk
of technical accidents and harm to civilians]{.underline}.
**[But]{.underline}** [Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine is a tragic
reminder that,]{.underline} [while unintentional harm to civilians is a
real tragedy,]{.underline} **[there is also the unsolved problem of
intentional harm to civilians]{.underline}**. [The Russian military has
routinely attacked not only residential neighborhoods, **but hospitals
and humanitarian organizations.**]{.underline}

Finally, [Russia's human soldiers in Ukraine have suffered **heavy
losses**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} reportedly **[deserted in large
numbers]{.underline}**. [Faced with such frustrations]{.underline},
[there's]{.underline} **[little reason]{.underline}** to [doubt Russian
president Vladimir Putin would use]{.underline} lethal [autonomous
weapons if he thought it would **provide a military edge.**]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its allies]{.underline} [need to start thinking about **how to ensure
that he does not.**]{.underline}

There are **[many lessons]{.underline}** [to be learned

based]{.underline} heavily [on the employment of large numbers
of]{.underline} small, short- and some medium-range, lethal **[precision
strike weapons]{.underline}** in the ground, air, and sea domains could
[suggest]{.underline} particularly [important lessons]{.underline}
[**highly** relevant to the defense of other]{.underline} nations,
including [**Baltic** and]{.underline} other **[NATO
states]{.underline}**. The [Ukrainian military]{.underline} has been
[able to inflict a]{.underline} remarkably **[high level]{.underline}**
[of attrition on Russian forces by employing]{.underline} large
quantities of small, mostly short-range, lethal precision-guided weapons
(**[PGW]{.underline}**) [that it received from NATO allies]{.underline}
and other states.39 These have included very large quantities of
anti-tank/vehicle weapons such as Javelins and NLAWs. General Milley,
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Staff, testified to the Senate Armed Services
Committee (SASC) that as of early April 2022, the U.S. and allies had
provided 60,000 anti-tank weapons and 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons to
Ukraine.40 [These systems have been particularly useful because of
**favorable terrain and their ease of use**]{.underline}.41 Armed
unmanned aerial systems (UAS), notably the Turkish TB-2, have proven
singularly effective in detecting and destroying Russian tanks and other
vehicles and equipment.42 Those aircraft are also able to perform in
other roles such as reconnaissance and targeting for ground troops.
Similarly, thousands of SHORADS such as Stingers, Starstreaks (UK), and
other "Man-Portable Air Defense Systems" (MANPADS) not only inflicted
attrition but as importantly "[highly unpredictable ground-mobile SAMs
complicate the tactical threat picture even more for
Russia]{.underline}," while being highly survivable compared with larger
static air defense systems.43 [Other types of weapons]{.underline} and
supplies [such as]{.underline} machine **[guns]{.underline}** and
assault **[rifles]{.underline}**, **[ammunition]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[body armor]{.underline}** and other protective gear
offered by NATO allies and others clearly [have been of great
utility]{.underline} as well, **[but]{.underline}** [it is the **PGWs**
and the ways they have been employed by the Ukrainians that have
**underpinned the** exceptional battlefield **results** seen to
date]{.underline}. The battlefield experience in Ukraine provides but
the **[most recent]{.underline}** [evidence of the key role of PGWs in
modern warfare.]{.underline} It has highlighted the **[deadly
effectiveness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[high usage
rate]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} modern **[precision
weapons]{.underline}**, particularly shorter-range weapons that are able
to operate without a near-real-time targeting network.44 Indeed, the
ability to detect and strike targets in near-real-time without the need
for sophisticated real-time targeting networks may be the defining
characteristic of a shorter-range PGW.45 [This has important
implications for addressing serious concerns about the resilience of
command, control, communications, computer, and ISR]{.underline} (C4ISR)
[capabilities under attack in wartime]{.underline}.46

60-day mark]{.underline}, the focus on the [possibility that
**Russia**]{.underline} [might invade the]{.underline}
**[Baltics]{.underline}** next has lessened, but [the risk may be **no
less heightened** than in the war's early days]{.underline}. The three
[Baltic countries]{.underline}---Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania---[are]{.underline} all [at a]{.underline} **[geographical
disadvantage]{.underline}** [to Russian aggression]{.underline}, and, as
members of NATO, carry the highest possible stakes in the event of an
attack.

Many [neighboring countries]{.underline} are [re-evaluating their own
defense policies in the event that Russian aggression reaches their
borders]{.underline}. Even Germany, which had a default policy of
non-aggression after the Second World War, has committed to buying the
F-35 fighter jet from the U.S., anticipating the need to defend itself.
Finland and Sweden, which had a policy of neutrality when it came to
joining NATO, are now seriously considering membership.

In response to Finland and Sweden\'s statements, the [Kremlin threatened
to]{.underline} **[reposition nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [in the
Baltic region]{.underline}. While the threat may be empty, and not one
that is going to stop Finland and Sweden from joining NATO, it is still
a [reminder that the **Baltic countries** are in the **crosshairs of
hostile rhetoric between Russia and the alliance**, not to mention
**actual war.**]{.underline}

There are several reasons why the [Baltic states are]{.underline}
**[uniquely vulnerable]{.underline}** [to Russian invasion]{.underline}.
The prime reason why they might be [the Kremlin's next
**target**]{.underline} is that [each of them]{.underline}, particularly
Estonia and Latvia, [has an **ethnic Russian minority
population**]{.underline}. Moscow's justification for prior invasions,
including the ongoing one in Ukraine, is that ethnic Russians have to be
"liberated" from oppressive non-Russian governments.

However, [geography plays a]{.underline} **[significant
role]{.underline}** [in adding to the Baltics'
vulnerability]{.underline}. More so than Finland, which shares an
800-mile border with Russia, and countries such as Poland, which borders
Russian ally Belarus, are relatively disconnected from allies by
geography.

As of now, [Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania **do not** have allies in
close proximity in the Baltic region]{.underline}. The three countries
are essentially trapped between Russia and the Baltic Sea with few NATO
allies close by. In terms of logistics, this means that [it will be
difficult to send troops and supplies to the Baltic states on short
notice]{.underline} [in the event of a Russian attack]{.underline}.
Estonia and Lithuania share a border with Russia; potentially worse is
the fact that Latvia is hemmed in by Kaliningrad, the heavily armed
Russian enclave loaded with nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles.

Finland and Sweden, the two countries that would be able to deliver
military support most quickly, are not NATO members yet and have not
been since the alliance was established. Thus, until they decide to
join, if that does indeed happen, the Baltic countries will remain stuck
with the status quo.

Those geographical disadvantages could end in the whole region being
squeezed like a vise if the Russian military becomes more sophisticated
in the time between the current invasion of Ukraine and a future
invasion of one of the Baltic countries. However, that scenario is
looking less likely than it did prior to February 24th, as the Russian
army has shown that it is not the invulnerable fighting force the world
once thought it to be, suffering casualties in troops and in equipment
at the hands of the Ukrainian army that are becoming increasingly hard
to explain away at home. The sinking of the warship Moskva is one such
example.

[To make up for that geographical disadvantage, the Baltic countries
should probably be reinforced with **additional military support from
NATO allies as soon as possible**]{.underline}, whether [in the form
of]{.underline} extra troops or [weapons systems]{.underline}. As of
January, there was already some discussion of this within NATO. As
Russian forces were observed massing on the Ukrainian border, Estonian
Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told Reuters that her government was
currently "[discussing with our allies to increase their presence here
to act as a deterren]{.underline}t\" and voiced worries in Tallinn that
the [Baltics were a]{.underline} \"**[NATO peninsula]{.underline}**.\"

However, [those discussions have largely appeared to take a
**backseat**]{.underline} [as the Russian invasion
progresses]{.underline}, **[more is learned]{.underline}** [about
Russian atrocities against civilians, and millions leave Ukraine for
safety abroad]{.underline}. About 2,700 additional U.S. troops, as well
as extra NATO forces, have been distributed across the three countries,
but Baltic leaders have been pushing for a more substantial solution.

In March, NATO's summit in Brussels did not produce a permanent
agreement that would fortify any of the Baltic countries and create a
credible deterrent. Rihards Kols, chair of the Latvian parliament\'s
foreign affairs committee, stated afterward that "[We welcome these
reinforcements, but it's not enough --- **absolutely not
enough**]{.underline}."

Another reason the Baltics could look like an easy next target for the
Kremlin is because of their small size; Lithuania, the largest of the
three, has a population of only 3.7 million. Moscow may very well assume
that its advantage in numbers would allow it to overwhelm any local
defenses in an invasion. But additional weapons systems as deterrents in
the Baltics are more likely to make Russia think twice before repeating
its invasion of Ukraine in one of the three countries.

At least temporarily, [Russia]{.underline} **[could be
deterred]{.underline}** [if NATO delivered the same systems]{.underline}
to the Baltics that are already scheduled for delivery to Poland: the
F-35 fighter, the Patriot missile system, and the M1 Abrams tank.
Likewise, given that the U.S. has sent 100 surplus towed 155mm howitzers
to Ukraine, mobile 155mms would be a realistic, quickly deliverable
option for Baltic defense. Other systems such as the High Mobility
Artillery Rocket System (**[HIMARS)]{.underline}**, Iron Dome [missile
defense system, and **Predator missiles** should also be
considered.]{.underline}

This would require [bypassing **two obstacles**]{.underline}. First, the
[process of]{.underline} approving the sale and the schedule of
[delivering the systems would have to be **massively
accelerated**]{.underline}. Poland, which ordered the F-35 in 2020, only
began to receive them this year, and has yet to receive the other
systems. Second, [the U.S. and the Baltic countries would have to agree
to a plan that **ameliorates the cost** to the three countries'
governments]{.underline}. The current system of rotating troop
deployments and other reinforcements from NATO exists because Tallinn,
Vilnius, and Riga do not have the budget to purchase systems like the
F-35 on their own. And in addition to making the decision to deliver
these weapons systems, the logistical challenges of delivering them have
to simultaneously be addressed.

[Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania may need military support **now more
than ever**]{.underline}, [as all three have depleted their own weapons
reserves in order to aid Ukraine]{.underline}. There is **[no more
opportune moment than the present]{.underline}** [to prepare for a
second onslaught of Russian aggression in Europe, and there is no place
where **NATO's credibility is more at risk** than in the Baltic
countries.]{.underline}

#### Otherwise, Russia [escalates]{.underline} -- it spillsover

Estonia and the [Baltics]{.underline} will remain [**vulnerable** to a
broad spectrum of Russian threats]{.underline}. Chapter 1 noted the
range of Russian threats from the sub-conventional level to a full
invasion and occupation. The proximity of the Baltic states to Russia
and the disparities between NATO and Russian forces in the region leave
the Baltic states vulnerable in a variety of potential scenarios.
Accordingly, NATO's security posture in the Baltic region must move from
a focus on forward presence to persistent forward defense, which entails
having sufficient combat-ready forces positioned and ready to "fight
tonight" to deter and, if necessary, to stop or greatly slow a Russian
invasion. [NATO and Europe as a whole **do not** have the option of
returning to the pre-2022 European security status quo]{.underline}. The
most [likely persistent threats are those on the low-intensity end of
the conflict spectrum, where Russia could employ various "**gray
zone,"** or **sub-conventional**, measures to attempt to intimidate or
coerce Baltic states.]{.underline} Potential operations may try to use
the Orthodox religion, Soviet nostalgia, or education and citizenship
issues to manipulate Russian-ethnic populations living in strategically
relevant areas of the Baltics such as Tallinn, Paldiski, Narva, Riga, or
Daugavpils.96 [Other scenarios below the threshold of open conflict
include the weaponization of migrants, exploitation of natural or
man-made disasters, or promotion of social unrest in the
Baltics.]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}, however, [could]{.underline}
also try to [provoke repeated reserve mobilizations]{.underline} in the
Baltics [through]{.underline} **[limited incursions]{.underline}** or
provocations in order [to]{.underline} impose economic costs,
mobilization exhaustion, or **[create tensions]{.underline}** [within
NATO while also desensitizing indications and warning about possible
future Russian operations. Mobilizing]{.underline} in response to any
Russian provocation, [however small]{.underline}, [might]{.underline}
**[risk]{.underline}** [Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania wearing out the
current sense of urgency within the Alliance and could **jeopardize the
perceived legitimacy**]{.underline} of their claims on other Alliance
members. Even after recent events in Ukraine, it remains to be seen if
and for how long the supposedly greatly heightened threat perceptions in
western European NATO members persist.97 The Baltic states themselves,
with limited assistance from NATO, are best positioned to counter these
sub-conventional threats because they typically require civil and
government rather than military responses. Further along the conflict
spectrum to conventional military operations, limited air and missile
strikes or "pulsed" ground incursions would put the onus on NATO to
react or escalate.98 [Limited attacks or incursions could create
tensions within the alliance between members who want to rapidly
escalate and hit back, and members who would prefer other, less risky
response measures]{.underline}. These types of attacks would place a
premium on air and missile defense capabilities, which the Baltic states
do not possess in substantial numbers. [Given the potentially high costs
of these scenarios to NATO and their relatively low cost to Russia, the
Alliance should work to **significantly improve the Baltic states'
ability to defend against such Russian provocations.**]{.underline} A
key question for NATO to consider is the threshold at which point
Estonia, the other Baltic states, and/or the Alliance would strike
Russian territory in retaliation. A conventional ground invasion to
seize and occupy one or more Baltic states is possible. Although it has
been the least likely scenario, it is the most dangerous one, and one
that NATO must be adequately prepared for. [This scenario is especially
salient now, given that Russia has actually undertaken exactly such an
action against Ukraine]{.underline}. In the event of a similar future
invasion, [the Baltic states]{.underline} **[must]{.underline}** [be
able to withstand preliminary Russian attacks and heavily attrite
Russian forces as they enter NATO territory and sustain the fight as
other NATO forces assemble and move to reinforce the
region]{.underline}. Fundamentally, the **[credibility of the
Alliance]{.underline}**, both as a military organization and with regard
to the Baltic region, **[rests]{.underline}** [on its ability to counter
Russian threats by reinforcing units and assets, moving its forces
rapidly to decisive combat areas, and executing successful conventional
military operations to defeat such a Russian invasion.]{.underline} The
NATO Alliance must also be prepared to counter these Russian threats in
the face of increased nuclear saber-rattling from Russia.

#### **Conflict in the Baltics goes nuclear.**

Tragedy: Statecraft and World Order.\")

Would the U.S. fight a nuclear war to save Estonia? The question would
probably strike most Americans as absurd. Certainly, almost no one was
thinking about such a prospect when NATO expanded to include the Baltic
states back in 2004. Yet a series of reports by the nonpartisan RAND
Corporation shows that **[the [possibility of nuclear escalation]{.mark}
in a conflict [between]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic
[T]{.mark}reaty [O]{.mark}rganization [and Russia over]{.mark} the
[Baltic]{.mark} region [is high]{.mark}]{.underline}**er than one might
imagine. The best way of averting it? Invest more in the alliance's
conventional defense. There was a time when it seemed quite normal to
risk nuclear war over the sanctity of European frontiers. During the
Cold War, NATO was outnumbered by Warsaw Pact forces, and it would have
had great difficulty stopping a Soviet attack with conventional weapons.
**[From the moment it was formed, [NATO relied on]{.mark} the threat of
[nuclear escalation]{.mark} --- whether rapid and spasmodic, or gradual
and controlled --- [to maintain]{.mark}
[deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}** American thinkers developed
elaborate models and theories of deterrence. U.S. and NATO forces
regularly carried out exercises simulating the resort to nuclear weapons
to make this strategy credible. After the Cold War ended, the U.S. and
its allies had the luxury of thinking less about nuclear deterrence and
war-fighting. Tensions with Russia receded and nuclear strategy came to
seem like a relic of a bygone era. Yet today, with Russia rising again
as a military threat, the grim logic of nuclear statecraft is returning.
The spike in tensions between Russia and the West over the past
half-decade has revealed a basic problem: **[[NATO doesn't have the
capability to prevent Russia]{.mark}n forces [from quickly overrunning
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russian invaders
would be at the gates of the Baltic capitals in two to three days;
existing NATO forces in the region would be destroyed or swept aside.
NATO could respond by mobilizing for a longer war to liberate the Baltic
countries, but this would require a bloody, dangerous military campaign.
Critically, that campaign would require striking targets --- such as air
defense systems --- located within Russia itself, as well as suppressing
Russian artillery, short-range missiles and other capabilities within
the Kaliningrad enclave, which is situated behind NATO's front lines.
Moreover, this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert. **[[Russian]{.mark}
officia[ls understand]{.mark} that [their country would lose a long
war]{.mark} against NATO.]{.underline}** They are particularly alarmed
at the possibility of NATO using its unmatched military capabilities to
conduct conventional strikes within Russian borders. **[So [the Kremlin
has signaled]{.mark} that [it might carry out limited nuclear
strikes]{.mark} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike" somewhere in the
Atlantic, or against NATO forces in the theater --- [to force the
alliance to make peace]{.mark} on Moscow's terms. This concept is known
as "escalate to de-escalate," and there is a growing body of evidence
that the Russians are serious about it. A NATO-Russia war could thus go
nuclear if [Russia "escalates" to preserve]{.mark} the [gains]{.mark} it
has [won early]{.mark} in the conflict. [It could also go
nuclear]{.mark} in a second]{.underline}**, if somewhat less likely,
way: **[[If]{.mark} the U.S. and [NATO initiate their own]{.mark}
limited [nuclear strikes]{.mark} against Russian forces [to prevent
Moscow from overrunning the Baltic]{.mark} allies in the first place.
And even the limited use of nuclear weapons raises the question of
further escalation]{.underline}**: Would crossing the nuclear threshold
lead, through deliberate choice or miscalculation, to a general nuclear
war involving intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers and
apocalyptic destruction?

One of the **[best weapons]{.underline}** [Ukraine has in its war with
Russia is]{.underline} **[Javelin missiles]{.underline}**.
[But]{.underline} **[supplies are low]{.underline}**, [and restocking
them]{.underline} **[will not be easy]{.underline}**. Frank Morris of
our member station KCUR explains why.

FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: [Every conflict has its **iconic
weapons**]{.underline} - tanks in World War II, helicopters in the
Vietnam War. And Mark Cancian with the Center for Strategic and
International Studies says [the war in Ukraine has distinguished an
American-made]{.underline}, shoulder-fired,
**[precision-guided]{.underline}** anti-tank [missile]{.underline} -
**[the Javelin.]{.underline}**

MARK CANCIAN: We\'ve seen pictures of Saint Javelin. We\'ve heard
Javelin songs.

MORRIS: That\'s right. T-shirts, murals, even songs, venerating a
missile.

MORRIS: This video shows familiar images of Ukrainian soldiers firing
Javelins, Russian tanks exploding and burned-out wrecks smoldering. But
Cancian says the U.S. has stopped shipping the celebrated missile.

CANCIAN: [What you\'ve seen is that **in recent aid
packages**]{.underline}, [there]{.underline} **[aren\'t]{.underline}**
[any Javelins]{.underline}, and I think [that\'s because the stockpile
is **getting low.**]{.underline}

MORRIS: Cancian figures [the U.S. has sent up to **7,000
Javelins**]{.underline} to Ukraine, about a third of its stockpile.

CANCIAN: [The production problem for Javelins is that **we\'ve sent a
lot of them**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[we are producing them
at a very high rate]{.underline}**. We\'ve been producing them at about
800 a year, more or less.

MORRIS: [Javelins are assembled in]{.underline} a plant in Troy,
[Ala]{.underline}., [out of parts and materials sourced from around the
country]{.underline}. Production is picking up, but **[it\'s going to be
expensive]{.underline}**, as President Joe Biden conceded when he
visited the plant earlier this month.

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: And to [make sure the United States and our allies
can **replenish our own stocks of weapons**]{.underline} [to replace
what we\'ve sent to Ukraine]{.underline} - [as I said from the
beginning, this **fight is not going to be cheap.**]{.underline}

MORRIS: Last week, [Biden signed a new]{.underline} \$40 billion [aid
package for Ukraine]{.underline}. The [Pentagon has ordered]{.underline}
another \$309 million worth of [replacement Javelins]{.underline}. But
Mark Cancian says filling [that order is going to be challenging because
the assembly plant in Alabama **can\'t speed up until all its
suppliers**]{.underline} - plants that produce the chemicals, 200
computer chips [and other highly specialized parts required in every
Javelin - **speed up first.**]{.underline}

A [war in Ukraine that began with a **Russian debacle**]{.underline} as
its forces tried and failed to take Kyiv [has seemingly **begun to
turn**]{.underline}, [with Russia now picking off regional targets,
Ukraine **lacking the weaponry it** needs and Western support for the
war effort fraying]{.underline} in the face of rising gas prices and
galloping inflation.

[On the 108th day]{.underline} of President Vladimir V. Putin's
unprovoked war, driven by his conviction that Ukraine is territory
unjustly taken from the Russian Empire, [Russia appeared no closer to
victory. **But its forces did appear to be making slow, methodical and
bloody progress toward control of eastern Ukraine**.]{.underline}

On Saturday, Ukraine's agile president, Volodymyr Zelensky, once again
promised victory. "[We are]{.underline} **[definitely]{.underline}**
[going to prevail in this war that Russia has started]{.underline}," he
told a conference in Singapore in a video appearance. "It is on the
battlefields in Ukraine that the future rules of this world are being
decided."

**[Yet]{.underline}**, [the heady early days of the war]{.underline} ---
when the Ukrainian underdog held off a deluded and inept aggressor and
Mr. Putin's indiscriminate bombardment united the West in outrage ---
[have]{.underline} **[begun to fade]{.underline}**. In their place is a
war that is evolving into what analysts increasingly say will be a long
slog, placing growing pressure on the governments and economies of
Western countries and others throughout the world.

[Nowhere is that slog more evident than in Ukraine's eastern Donbas
region]{.underline}. **[Despite urgent pleas to the West for more heavy
weapons]{.underline}**, [Ukrainian forces appear to lack what it takes
to confront Russian use of artillery for scorched-earth shelling of
towns and villages]{.underline}. While Ukraine is holding Russia back in
the major regional city of Sievierodonetsk, it is suffering heavy losses
--- at least 100 fatalities a day, though their full extent is not yet
known --- and desperately needs more weapons and ammunition.

[Russia]{.underline} also appears to be [making headway in establishing
control in towns it has captured]{.underline}, including the leveled
Black Sea port of **[Mariupol]{.underline}**. It has set out to convince
and coerce the remaining population that its future lies in what Mr.
Putin views as his restored empire. Citizens there and in cities like
**[Kherson]{.underline}** and **[Melitopol]{.underline}** face a bleak
choice: If they want to work, they must first obtain a Russian passport,
a blandishment offered to secure a semblance of loyalty to Moscow.

#### Unless stopped, Putin will escalate -- extinction

**Dokoupil 22** -- Tony Dokoupil is an American broadcast journalist and
author, known for his work as a co-anchor of CBS Mornings. He was also a
news correspondent for CBS News and MSNBC. (Tony Dokoupil, \"Conflict in
Ukraine triggers fear of nuclear warfare,\" CBS, 4-29-2022,
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conflict-nuclear-warfare-ukraine-russia/,
Accessed 6-21-2022, LASA-SC)

The [threat of a global nuclear war **doesn\'t feel as distant** as it
did]{.underline} a few weeks ago. A recent CBS News poll found that
**[70%]{.underline}** [of adults]{.underline} [are worried Russia\'s
invasion]{.underline} [of Ukraine]{.underline} [could lead to fighting
with **nuclear weapons.**]{.underline}

Many are curious as to what a nuclear war would look like --- so Alex
Wellerstein, a historian and professor at the Stevens Institute of
Technology, developed a website called \"NUKEMAP.\" It can simulate a
detonation anywhere in the world.

As in real life, the simulation begins with just the push of a button.
CBS News\' Tony Dokoupil and Wellerstein simulated a scenario of what
Times Square would look like if it was hit with a bomb like the one that
struck Hiroshima.

\"There\'s a sort of zone that\'s about here, and\... which is pretty
hopeless, no matter what,\" Wellerstein said as he pointed to a large
section of midtown Manhattan in the simulation.

When larger, more modern bombs were simulated, the website showed [a
single blast could cause heavy damage throughout the entire metropolitan
region and kill millions.]{.underline}

[Winds can also carry radioactive particles **even
further**]{.underline}.

\"These are areas where, if you\'re not taking shelter several hours
after the bomb, you could get enough radiation to die,\" Welllerstein
said when referring to cities downwind of New York in the simulation.
\"You could get enough radiation to get significantly sick.\"

There was a time when Americans were prepared for that kind of attack.
In the 1950s and 60s, school children practiced \"duck and cover\"
drills to help survive a blast, and a public campaign educated Americans
on surviving the fallout. Office of Civil Defense teams also spent
hundreds of millions of dollars building and stockpiling fallout
shelters all across the U.S., but a visit to the basement of a public
library in Passaic, New Jersey, reveals this threat has fallen into the
very back of our minds.

In a space that was designed to shelter up to 90 people, decades of dust
has settled over the medicine and food --- which has long since expired
--- in the basement. Building supervisor Gary Salvatoriello told CBS
News there are no plans for replenishment. Instead, the one-time fallout
shelter, like so many others, has turned back into an everyday storage
space.

George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni said she\'s been
warning about the risk of nuclear conflict for years.

\"[The lessons of the Cold War seem to have been
forgotten]{.underline},\" she said.

The number of nuclear weapons has decreased dramatically since the Cold
War. [But Russia and the U.S. each have more than 1,500 weapons
**deployed and ready to fire**]{.underline}. Squassoni said she fears
that could happen eventually, either by accident or an intentional
attack.

\"We know from [Russian doctrine]{.underline} that they have a
**[plan]{.underline}** or they\'ve been thinking [about using nuclear
weapons to **escalate the war**, to stop it or deescalate
it]{.underline},\" she said.

The big question is: [what would happen **after an initial
attack**]{.underline}?

\"The [world would recoil **in horror**]{.underline}. And I\'m sure
there would be a lot of voices demanding for some kind of similar
action. But do you really want to trigger the third world war? A third
nuclear war?\" Squassoni said.

\"I don\'t think that Vladimir Putin wants to tangle with NATO,\" she
added. \"I don\'t think he wants to tangle with the U.S. But I also
think that we\'ve been misreading him for quite a while.

[The truth is there is **very little** standing in the way of an all-out
nuclear war]{.underline}.

\"The only thing that really stands is that\... it is not really in the
interests of our enemies to have that happen to them either,\"
Wellerstein said.

[Even though nuclear weapons haven\'t been used in battle since
1945]{.underline}, [Wellerstein said the threat they post never really
went away.]{.underline}

\"[We have a **long list** of stuff to worry about]{.underline}. [But I
think they should be on the list]{.underline}. [I\'m not saying they
should be the top of the list all the time]{.underline}. But I think if
they were on the list, **[you might get a somewhat different world as a
result]{.underline}**,\" he said. \"Future problems are brewing, I
guarantee it.\"

#### Arms cooperation with Turkey rebuilds relations

US President Joe **[Biden]{.underline}** [sought approval from
congressional leaders to sell]{.underline} **[missiles]{.underline}**,
radars and electronics [to Turkey]{.underline} for its F-16 fighter
jets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.

[Turkey will spend]{.underline} more than **[\$500
million]{.underline}** [on the arms]{.underline} deal if it goes
through, Bloombergreported.

Ünlühisarcıkli said the fighter jets are central to defending Turkey's
territory since amissile defense system would be very expensive.

There were fears of an escalation in 2015 when a Turkish F-16 jet shot
down a Russian fighter jet that Ankara accused of entering its airspace.

Ünlühisarcıkli said [relations]{.underline} **[improved]{.underline}**
[between the two NATO allies]{.underline} after Ankara offered to
provide security at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. "Before that,
Turkey was characterized as 'our so-called ally' by the US State
Department, but after that, the terminology changed to 'our valuable
ally.'"Ties with the US have been strained for years. In 2018,
Washington placed limited sanctions on Turkey over its detention of an
American pastor, leading to an exchange rate crisis for the lira.

[The most]{.underline} **[contentious current issue]{.underline}**
[between the countries is Ankara's]{.underline} purchase of the Russian
S-400 anti-ballistic [missile defense system]{.underline}. Ankara has
been adamant that it will not return the Russian weapons and, in
response,Washington kicked Turkey out of the F-35 stealth fighter
program. Last year, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the US suggested
selling Turkey F-16 fighter jets in lieu of the F-35s it would not be
getting. [With Turkey in economic crisis and slipping poll numbers for
the ruling party, Erdogan has sought to warm ties with wealthier
countries in the hopes of bringing in more investment ahead of national
elections scheduled for June 2023]{.underline}. [Biden's response has
been]{.underline} **[lukewarm]{.underline}**.[It took the US president
more than three months after entering office last year to hold his first
phone conversation with Erdogan]{.underline}. But the [war in
Ukraine]{.underline} **[highlighted]{.underline}** [Ankara's value to
NATO]{.underline}, with Turkey hosting talkswith top officials from
Ukraine and Russia. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden told
Erdogan in a phone call that he appreciated Turkey's efforts to seek a
diplomatic solution, according to the White House.

[Ankara also has contributed to **NATO interests**]{.underline},
[including by selling drones to Ukraine]{.underline} that have played an
important role in fending off Russian attacks and using its authority
under the 1936 Montreux Convention to limit Russia's access to the Black
Sea. [At the same time, Russia's invasion made clear the security risks
the country poses to its neighbors.]{.underline}

Aaron Stein, director of research at the Philadelphia-based Foreign
Policy Research Institute (FPRI), told The Media Line the prospective
[arms deal would help]{.underline} maintain [Turkey's **aging air
force,**]{.underline} [which would advance NATO interests in the event
of a war with Russia]{.underline}.

He said the F-16 program has been central to Turkey-US relations for
decades, and that Ankara would have few options if it decided to
approach other countries in hopes of securing a comparable fighter jet.
"[If it doesn't go through, you're severing basically the **backbone of
the modern US- Turkish relationship**]{.underline}," Stein said.

However, he warned that [the deal faced]{.underline} **[major
hurdles]{.underline}** [because there are some in
Washington]{.underline} **[who are against it]{.underline}**.US Senator
Robert Menendez, chairman of the **[Senate Foreign Affairs

#### NATO arms are key

**[The crisis is an opportunity for the alliance to reinvigorate itself,
while alleviating the suffering]{.underline}** Few places on Earth are
more miserable than Idlib province, the last big pocket of rebel-held
territory in war-torn Syria. It is home to some 3m people, roughly half
of whom are there only because they have fled fighting elsewhere. Along
with the poor, huddled masses came jihadists, who now largely control
the territory. Syria's dictator, Bashar al-Assad, wants it back, even if
that means reducing it to rubble. His months-long bombing campaign has
destroyed schools, houses and hospitals, and pushed a million people
towards Turkey's sealed border. Many are trapped there, cold, hungry and
exposed. The world is at last waking up to this humanitarian
crisis---and to the fact that Turkey is the only country trying to stave
it off. Fearing another flood of migrants, its president, Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, has sent thousands of troops to Idlib in recent weeks to stop
Mr Assad's offensive. Dozens were killed in an attack by Syrian (and
perhaps Russian) forces on February 27th, prompting retaliatory strikes
from Turkey (see article). But what got the attention of European
countries was Mr Erdogan's decision to open Turkey's borders and send
refugees streaming their way (see article). [**Turkey is crying out for
help in Idlib. Its nato partners should provide it, not only to stop the
suffering of desperate Syrians, but also to reinvigorate their faltering
alliance.** Some nato members are reluctant to work with Mr
Erdogan]{.underline}. This is understandable. He locks up dissidents,
cosies up to Russia, uses refugees as bargaining chips, and is often at
odds with nato. Look no further than Syria, where Turkey has pounded
Kurdish fighters, whom it calls terrorists, but whom America regards as
allies in the fight against Islamic State. Mr Erdogan sees Vladimir
Putin, Russia's president, as the man to deal with in Syria---and
elsewhere. Mr [Putin]{.underline}, in turn, [uses]{.underline} Mr
[Erdogan to divide and weaken nato. Russia's sale to Turkey of an s-400
anti-aircraft system, which is incompatible with nato systems, has
deepened the rift between Turkey and its allies.]{.underline} But
**[Turkey is too important for nato to abandon]{.underline}**. [It has
the alliance's second-biggest army and sits at the crossroads between
west and east. The situation in Idlib]{.underline}, dire as it is,
[provides an opportunity to reset relations. Turkey has renewed its call
for nato to patrol a no-fly zone over the province and asked America for
Patriot missiles to defend itself against attack]{.underline}. Western
leaders are understandably reluctant to put troops on the ground or
planes in the air around Idlib. [nato]{.underline}, though, [can do more
than merely express solidarity]{.underline}. [Promises of more
ammunition, humanitarian aid and radar surveillance over Syria are a
start]{.underline}. Spain already stations Patriot missiles in Turkey
and other [European allies should step in. **nato should put its weight
behind talks to reach a political settlement over Idlib**]{.underline}.
And [Turkey should insist that some of its allies should be present at
such talks, something Russia rejects]{.underline}. [These moves
will]{.underline} not completely heal the rift between Turkey and the
West, nor will they solve the problem of Idlib, which has been festering
for years. But they might [restore some of Turkey's faith in its allies
and send a message to Mr Putin. The fact that such strategic
considerations---and a fear of Syrian refugees---might motivate Western
policymakers more than their concern over struggling Syrians is
disheartening.]{.underline} Yet nato attention would look the same to
the people of Idlib whatever its motive. Helping Turkey there would
alleviate some of their suffering.

#### Otherwise, Russia escalates

**Stavridis 20** -- James Stavridis is a retired United States Navy
admiral, currently Vice Chair, Global Affairs and Managing Director of
the global investment firm the Carlyle Group, and Chair of the Board of
Trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation. (James Stavridis, \"Turkey is a

I explained that there was more to it than [Putin]{.underline}'s desire
to show the world his loyalty to a long-term ally. He [felt that
engaging militarily would diminish U.S. influence in the region, ensure
Russia's access to warm-weather ports on the Mediterranean and enhance
his sway with Iran]{.underline} (which also supports Assad). [He also
wanted to demonstrate to the Russian people that he was a decisive
global player unafraid to stand up to the West.]{.underline} His
strategy remains coherent, and it appears he will succeed in helping
Assad crush the rebellion. Turkey has been opposed to Assad and aligned
with some of the rebel forces for years; hence its deploying troops to
Idlib. Like Putin, [Erdogan is pursuing a larger strategy in the region.
He wants to control the Syrian border to diminish attacks in Turkey by
Kurdish terrorists from the south, and to exert Turkish influence across
the former Ottoman Empire. He also aims to demonstrate to his political
base in Turkey that, like Putin, he is an authoritarian man of
action]{.underline}. He figures the ends are worth placing at risk the
strong economic ties between the two nations, tourism from Russia, and a
cordial personal relationship with Putin. [Erdogan has hardly been an
ideal ally recently]{.underline}: sending his troops to slaughter
U.S.-allied rebels in Syria, purchasing an advanced missile-defense
system from Russia, and threatening to shut down NATO installations on
Turkish soil, among other provocations. [Still]{.underline}, **[the
potential of a military collision between Russia and Turkey is of far
greater concern for the NATO alliance.]{.underline}** [If the two
nations' troops end up in direct combat, Erdogan could call on the rest
of NATO for assistance against a military great power.]{.underline}
We've been here before. During my time at NATO, we saw several incidents
involving Russian and Turkish fighters and defense systems. Eventually
we ended up deploying Patriot air-defense batteries to southern Turkey.
That forced Assad and his Russian allies to concentrate on other parts
of Syria to avoid an accidental clash with NATO. This time, [with
significant land forces in close proximity and active combat underway,
the chances of a miscalculation are far higher.]{.underline} Last
Wednesday, [Erdogan insisted that Turkey would not take even the
"smallest step back" in an escalating standoff with Russia. He also
called for again sending Patriot batteries to his southern border. From
an alliance perspective, there are a handful of actions that might ease
tensions and avoid an open conflict triggering Article 5]{.underline},
the guarantee that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all.
The top NATO brass and Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg need to meet
with their Turkish counterparts and make the case for doing everything
to avoid Russian forces on the battlefield --- which of course is easier
said than done. NATO can provide what militaries call "deconfliction"
between Russian and Turkish forces by providing high-level intelligence
about Russian troop deployments and intentions. It can also technically
assist Turkey with developing preventative protocols to avoid combat
with Russia. The U.S. and Russia do this, for example, at sea, where we
have very specific rules about approaching each other's ships and
aircraft, the so-called Incidents at Sea agreements. NATO can also
provide logistical and humanitarian assistance to the refugee
population. Most important perhaps, **[the U.S. must let Moscow know in
no uncertain terms that the consequences of combat operations against
Turkish troops would include further sanctions and greater military
support for Turkey in accordance with the NATO treaty]{.underline}** ---
[to include, for example, the Patriot deployment Erdogan has
requested.]{.underline} Clearly, [there needs to be a global response to
the violence in Idlib, and the United Nations Security Council must
address this with more than calls to action.]{.underline} The idea of a
negotiated "safe zone" between Turkey and Syria is still worth pursuing,
although Assad and Putin feel they have all the momentum at the moment.
It's unlikely we can avert the tragedy facing three million Syrians
civilians --- many women and children --- about to be crushed between
Putin's and Erdogan's competing strategic plans. Still, **[things would
get immeasurably worse for everyone in the case of a full-blown
NATO-Russia confrontation. Without nuanced U.S. and NATO efforts to both
rein in and protect the interests of their fractious Turkish ally, that
isn't an unthinkable result.]{.underline}**

#### Extinction

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
nuclear war between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Russia]{.underline}, despite horrific casualties, [neither country's
population is likely to be completely destroyed **by the direct effects
of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The aftermath could
be **much worse**]{.underline}: the [burning]{.underline} of [flammable
materials could send massive amounts of smoke into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause sustained
global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption -- **[a
nuclear winter]{.underline}**. According to one model 9 , [an all-out
exchange of 4,000 weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global
temperatures of around 8°C, making it **impossible to grow food
for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave some
survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but they
would be in a very precarious situation and the **threat of extinction
from other sources would be great**. An exchange on this scale is **only
possible between the US and Russia** who have more than 90% of the
world's nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500
warheads each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some
models suggest that even [a small regional nuclear war involving 100
nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious
enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of
starvation,12 [though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale are **unlikely to lead
to**]{.underline} outright **[human extinction]{.underline}**, but this
does suggest that conflicts which are around an order of magnitude
larger may be likely to threaten civilisation. It should be emphasised
that there is very large uncertainty about the effects of a large
nuclear war on global climate. This remains an area where increased
academic research work, including more detailed climate modelling and a
better understanding of how survivors might be able to cope and adapt,
would have high returns. [It is]{.underline} very [difficult to
precisely estimate the probability of **existential risk from nuclear
war**]{.underline} over the next century, and existing attempts leave
very large confidence intervals. According to many experts, [the most
likely nuclear war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given the relatively modest size of
their arsenals, the risk of human extinction is **plausibly greater**
from a conflict between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and Russia]{.underline}. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

Establish stocks of common-use munitions and equipment.
**[NATO]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should preposition
munitions in the Baltics for use by reinforcing units]{.underline}.
These [stocks could include]{.underline} **[anti-tank]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[anti-air missiles]{.underline}** [like Javelins and
Stinger]{.underline} [as well as similar munitions produced by European
NATO states]{.underline}, loitering munitions, armed UAS, cannon and
rocket artillery munitions, and small arms ammunition. Inventories could
also be used to supply and restock the training expenditures of Baltic
forces. [The cost of a munitions sharing program would be]{.underline} a
**[relatively minor]{.underline}** expense [for NATO but could save the
Baltics valuable training funds to be allocated toward high-priority
capabilities or to **training facilities** for Alliance use or NATO
Center of Excellence operations]{.underline}. This would have the
**[dual advantage]{.underline}** [of enhancing peacetime training while
constituting important prepositioned stock]{.underline}s. **[Ramp up
U.S. and European production capacity]{.underline}** for G-RAMMs. NATO
and other states donated tens of thousands of G-RAMMs such as Stingers,
NLAWs, and Javelins to the Ukrainian military, with resultant heavy
depletion of their own inventories. Consistent with historical
experience, [the expenditure rates of those weapons in Ukraine have
reportedly been very high.]{.underline} [There is currently]{.underline}
**[little surge production capacity]{.underline}**, both for replacement
of older G-RAMM types such as those sent to Ukraine or for more advanced
versions for reasons both of supply chain issues and certain required
materials.134 Current estimates are that large replacement orders will
not be filled until 2023 or even 2024. [Given that such weapons will
play an increasingly important role on future combat operations,
expanding production capacity should become a high priority for both
U.S. and European producers]{.underline}.135 **[Bolster NATO's ability
to reinforce its eastern front and the Baltic region.]{.underline}**
[NATO]{.underline} and the European Union [should further invest in
defense infrastructure along the eastern front using programs such as
the NATO Security Investment Program]{.underline}, Permanent Structured
Cooperation (PESCO), and the Three Seas Initiative. The United States
should continue to support improvements to European logistics and
training infrastructure through European Deterrence Initiative (EDI)
funding. These projects should focus on NATO's ability to rapidly move
and sustain forces in eastern and northern Europe and might include
improvements to airbases, seaports, rail infrastructure, fuel
distribution systems, command and control networks, expedient bridging
equipment, and hardening of critical nodes[. NATO should continue to
stress-test reinforcement scenarios in annual exercises and rehearse
securing sea lines of communication in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}.
Several nations bordering the Baltics have ongoing technology and
commercialization initiatives to develop and operate uncrewed cargo
ships, which may prove vital in contested logistics scenarios. Finally,
[sealift capacity is a crucial aspect of any U.S. effort to reinforce
and defend Europe. Recapitalizing the U.S. sealift force is long overdue
and necessary for contingencies in both Europe and other
theaters.]{.underline}13

Senior [Pentagon]{.underline} officials​ recently [invited]{.underline}
[leaders]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} U[.]{.underline}S. **[defense
industry]{.underline}** [to discuss the need for]{.underline}
**[replenishing the stockpiles of weapons]{.underline}** that have been
sent to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. [This and the
**pacing threat of China**]{.underline} [are necessary for planning the
production of weapons and services by our military
industry]{.underline}. But they are not nearly enough for the new era
ushered in by​ Vladimir Putin's war.

True, the [supplying of]{.underline} two [particular]{.underline}
[weapon systems]{.underline} so far has put a significant dent in our
stockpiles. We have sent Ukraine 33 percent of our Javelins --- a
portable **[anti-tank missile]{.underline}** --- [and]{.underline}
around 25 percent of our Stinger **[anti-aircraft
missiles]{.underline}**. The [Pentagon has quite rightly said these must
be replenished]{.underline} --- [or]{.underline} better still,
**[replaced by more capable newer models.]{.underline}** And as [there
is no indication that the war will end any time soon]{.underline}, [we
must assume the requirement for resupply **will continue and even
increase**]{.underline}.

The [mix of weapons will likely also change over time]{.underline}.
Already, the Ukrainian president is asking for HIMRAS (rocket
launchers), helicopters and drones. For effective use of these weapons,
the Ukrainians will need training and sustainment assistance. [The
**U**nited **S**tates and]{.underline}/or **[NATO]{.underline}** [will
need to organize quickly for this mission]{.underline}, perhaps by
establishing a Military Assistance Command [to train and sustain the
Ukrainian forces. Such a step will also assist with the **coordination
of resupply operations among allies.**]{.underline}

But [the message to our defense industrial complex must be]{.underline}
**[to go beyond replenishment]{.underline}** of [what we are sending to
Ukraine]{.underline}. [We are in an]{.underline}
**[unfortunate]{.underline}** and stark [global era after
the]{.underline} [Russian invasion]{.underline}. The [unprovoked
aggression]{.underline} [represents a]{.underline} **[sea
change]{.underline}** [in the international security
environment]{.underline}. This [change requires]{.underline} [a
**major** expansion of our]{.underline} **[d]{.underline}**efense
**[i]{.underline}**ndustrial **[b]{.underline}**ase that addresses four
urgent needs:

**[First]{.underline}**, [resupply allies and partners]{.underline}.
[They]{.underline} too [have]{.underline} [expended]{.underline}
**[significant percentages]{.underline}** [of their own weapon
stockpiles]{.underline} and face the same exigent need to backfill those
readiness depots. The [Russian invasion]{.underline} has [educated
Europeans about their continent's security environment]{.underline} and
collective security. Astonishingly, Finland and Sweden are now leaning
toward [joining **NATO**]{.underline}, and many [others]{.underline} ---
Germany, in particular --- [are]{.underline} **[willing]{.underline}**
[to spend **significantly more** on defense]{.underline}. [This is
**very positive**]{.underline}. The [willingness to upgrade defense
spending will also mean purchasing **new and more powerful
weapons**]{.underline} [to replace old and ineffective]{.underline}
[systems]{.underline}. Our defense industrial base should prepare to
help them meet this important goal.

**[Second]{.underline}**, the [poor performance of Russian]{.underline}
armed [forces]{.underline} in Ukraine [will cause those who have been
relying on Russian systems,]{.underline} such as India, [to]{.underline}
**[reconsider those investments]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[future purchases]{.underline}**. Additionally, the G-7 [sanctions on
Russia will undermine its ability to provide weapons in the numbers that
Moscow had anticipated]{.underline} or provide the spare parts needed
for systems already provided. [This presents an opportunity to decrease
Indian dependence on Russian weapons in **key areas.**]{.underline}
India's dependence on Russia for fighter jets, missiles and air defense
systems has precipitated its ambivalent response to Russia's naked
aggression. [Reducing key countries']{.underline} --- especially India's
--- [dependence on Russia should guide both our strategy and how **we
map the path our military industry policy follows.**]{.underline}

Third, [the conflict has **substantially increased**]{.underline} [the
importance of Saudi Arabia's capacity for increased oil
production]{.underline}. The Biden administration has had frosty
relations with Riyadh. Unlike the previous administration, the [White
House has kept Riyadh at arm's length diplomatically and even denied or
delayed the sale of several weapon systems]{.underline}. Now the
administration is in the process of urgently attempting to reset these
relations. A key component of this reset will be the increase in arms
sales to help Saudi Arabia deal with the threat from Iran and its
proxies, especially the Houthis, who have launched more than 800 attacks
against Saudi Arabia, including some attacks against its major cities.

**[Fourth]{.underline}**, [this war has impacted geopolitical and
security calculations beyond Europe]{.underline}. [Indo-Pacific
countries are now faced with **potential conflict**]{.underline} [in
their region involving China or North Korea that could start with little
notice]{.underline}. [The result would be]{.underline}
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**. This illuminates an urgent need to
pre-position appropriate weapons in Taiwan for its defense in case of
Chinese aggression. [Unlike Ukraine, Taiwan's island disposition makes
resupply immensely complex once hostilities are initiated]{.underline}.
The administration has been lukewarm in its attitude towards the sale of
U.S. arms to Taiwan. This must change. The supply of naval helicopters
to Taiwan would ​be an important first step.

The [Russian invasion of Ukraine requires]{.underline} a **[significant
change]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} tone, tenor and [tempo of our
foreign military sales]{.underline}. Ukraine demonstrates that [our
allies]{.underline} and partners **[need]{.underline}** [the military
capability to defend themselves against aggression with little or no
notice]{.underline}. This would act as a deterrent.

The [U.S]{.underline}. **[military-industrial base]{.underline}** [is
an]{.underline} **[essential]{.underline}** **[instrument]{.underline}**
[and bulwark against the multiple security threats that we and our
allies and our partners face]{.underline}. [Steadily]{.underline}
**[rebuilding]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[upgrading]{.underline}** [the supply chain demands that we stay at
the forefront of innovation]{.underline} and redouble our commitment
[and investment in **research and development.**]{.underline}

[Creating **new financing and contracting options**]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} **[public-private partnerships]{.underline}**,
[will also support deeper investment in]{.underline} the [manufacturing
facilities]{.underline} of our key producers. Surging [production must
be accompanied by **reducing foreign supplier dependence,**]{.underline}
[which]{.underline}, unless addressed, [can be an unintended
problem]{.underline} for the global supply chain in a significant and
prolonged regional crisis and conflict. [These steps are **fundamental
components** of preserving both our national security and our role as
global leaders.]{.underline}

#### First, military innovation lowers costs -- NATO is the key forum to foster development

An increasingly assertive [Russia has conducted hybrid warfare against
its adversaries on a **global scale**]{.underline}. [China is building
up its reach and ambition]{.underline}. [Rogue state and non-state
actors have growing access to capabilities]{.underline} -- cyber,
drones, or long-range missiles for instance -- [enabling them to
threaten Europe's strategic network]{.underline}s. The Alliance, its
member states, and their defence industry partners have a long road
ahead in arenas such as hypersonics, space, and artificial intelligence.
However, one thing remains steadfast: [we]{.underline}
**[must]{.underline}** [maintain our competitive edge through
coordinated investments]{.underline}, [sharing of best
practices]{.underline} -- both successes and failures -- [and shaping
policies that promote optimal innovation in timely cost-effective
ways.]{.underline} [Now is **not the time for isolation**]{.underline}
[among allied nations]{.underline} and industry partners, but for
cooperation.

[Competition and cooperation across the transatlantic supply chain are
**vital** to foster]{.underline} [a climate of innovation and keep our
competitive edge]{.underline} over those who challenge our collective
security. [It is essential that these channels]{.underline} of
cooperation [remain **free and open**]{.underline} --
**[not]{.underline}** [only for larger industry partners]{.underline}
such as Raytheon [-- but also for our **small and medium-sized industry
partners in Europe**]{.underline}. [Isolating countries with a
sophisticated industrial base]{.underline} -- that could help realise
the most advanced technologies -- [is]{.underline}
**[detrimental]{.underline}** [to keeping NATO and its member states
safe]{.underline}.

[Recognising the need for complementary]{.underline} [and niche
capabilities to address this changing battlespace]{.underline},
[Raytheon]{.underline} [continues to]{.underline} proactively [partner
with companies across Europe]{.underline}. For example, we worked
together with Saab to develop a new type of shoulder-launched,
laser-guided munition for infantry troops. The munition flies at
near-supersonic speeds and can penetrate multiple targets including
fortified structures, bunkers and light armoured vehicles. [Its
augmented precision enables soldiers to use it in complex battle
environments to reduce the risk of collateral damage.]{.underline} The
U.S. Army and ground forces of more than 40 countries use this
Carl-Gustaf weapon system.

The [Patriot]{.underline} air and missile [defence system provides
another example of successful industrial and military cooperation with
its supply chains crossing the Atlantic]{.underline}. It is the backbone
of NATO's air and missile defence and partners from Poland, Germany, and
beyond contribute to the advancements of the systems. Further, [Norway's
Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace have worked with us for 50 years most
notably for the NASAMS air defence system, which protects the U.S.
capital and five European]{.underline} nations (Norway, Spain, Finland,
The Netherlands and Lithuania). NASAMS demonstrates key **[European
technology imported into the U.S]{.underline}**. -- [and a partnership
that is economically **beneficial on both sides of the
Atlantic**.]{.underline}

The list continues. The Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) programme is a
partnership among 12 allies (nine of which are European) and their
respective industries to continue to enhance and sustain the most
cutting-edge anti-ship missile in its class. ESSM remains the largest
and most successful international cooperative weapon programme in NATO.

[As NATO and its member state leaders look to address these advanced
threats]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[defence industry will need to
meet their expectations]{.underline}** [and deliver technological
innovation while maintaining secure top-quality manufacturing and
trusted capabilities]{.underline}. [Achieving this objective will
require access to an **open**]{.underline} and fair **[transatlantic
defence market]{.underline}**. The [intention by European
members]{.underline} of the Alliance [to increase their defence
spending]{.underline}, either **[separately or through the
EU]{.underline}**, i[s welcome, but this cannot be carried out at the
expense of open competition and cooperation that have underpinned the

#### Second, allied sales and technology plug the gap

undermining the arsenal of democracy,\" Breaking Defense, 5-3-2022,
https://breakingdefense.com/2022/05/how-bidens-buy-american-is-undermining-the-arsenal-of-democracy/,
Accessed 6-20-2022, LASA-SC)

The [arsenal of democracy]{.underline} is **[making a
comeback]{.underline}**. As it did in past moments of global crisis,
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is arming a
sovereign nation]{.underline} [in its struggle]{.underline} **[for
survival]{.underline}** against the depredations of a dictator. But it
is not doing so alone.

[In the aftermath of]{.underline} Russia's invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}, [the US is coordinating with its allies and
partners on the urgent **production, modification,
donation**]{.underline} [and delivery of military equipment]{.underline}
from across the world to Ukraine. [It is working to rapidly replace
equipment donated from its own inventory as well as those of its allies
and partners.]{.underline} As many European nations consider increasing
defense spending in future years, [the US is helping lead discussions on
how best to bolster capabilities needed to deter and defend against
Russian aggression]{.underline}. And it is attempting to glean lessons
from the war in Ukraine to prepare itself, as well as allies and
partners such as Taiwan, for the possibility of Chinese aggression. This
new arsenal of democracy is a multinational effort.

**[Yet]{.underline}** [at a decisive moment]{.underline} in the war in
Ukraine [when defense industrial cooperation with America's allies and
partners has never been more vital]{.underline}, the
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration [is moving in the]{.underline}
**[opposite direction]{.underline}**. The so-called "**[Buy
American]{.underline}**" [regulations will harm relationships with
America's friends, risk American jobs and leave America's military
**less prepared** for the challenges posed by Russia and
China.]{.underline}

With certain exceptions, the [Buy American Act]{.underline}
[requires]{.underline} [the federal government to buy]{.underline}
**[domestic]{.underline}** "articles, materials, and
**[supplies]{.underline}**," [when they are acquired for public
use.]{.underline} In March, one week after Russia invaded Ukraine, the
Biden administration finalized a new regulation requiring that 75% of
the cost of products procured by the US government be made up of
domestic components by 2029. That's up from the 55% today.

In other words, despite its rhetoric, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [is]{.underline} **[cutting back defense industrial
cooperation]{.underline}** [with allies and partners **in the middle of
a war in Europe**]{.underline}. The [concern **is so
great**]{.underline} [that allied nations have written a new
letter]{.underline} \[PDF\] [to the White]{.underline}
[House]{.underline}, **[pleading]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}**
more critical **[exemptions]{.underline}**.

The **[primary impact]{.underline}** [of this new regulation will be
**on defense**]{.underline}. While the Buy American Act theoretically
applies to all federal government purchases, [in practice it most
directly affects defense purchases]{.underline}, which do not receive
the same broad exemptions as commercial goods do under World Trade
Organization agreements and US free trade agreements such as the United
States-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA).

The [Biden administration]{.underline} and proponents of so-called "Buy
American" regulations **[claim]{.underline}** [they will help grow
America's defense industrial base]{.underline} [and create more defense
jobs]{.underline}. **[They will do neither]{.underline}**. The Biden
administration's [new regulation will]{.underline} **[aggravate
relations with allies]{.underline}** and partners [and]{.underline},
**[over the long term]{.underline}**, [shrink the global market for US
defense products.]{.underline}

Last year, [a group of military attaches representing]{.underline} **[25
nations]{.underline}** including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany
wrote to lawmakers **[opposing]{.underline}** [an increased domestic
content threshold under the Buy American Act.]{.underline} The
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration **[didn't listen]{.underline}**.
As a result, just as many European nations are pledging significant
annual increases in defense spending, Europe's protectionists will need
only parrot the Biden administration to argue that new resources should
be spent to buy European products --- not American products.

[Supporters of]{.underline} so-called "[Buy American]{.underline}"
regulations [point out that some allies]{.underline} and partners
[have]{.underline} negotiated Reciprocal Defense Procurement
(**[RDP]{.underline}**) [agreements]{.underline}, [which provide some
exemption]{.underline} from the Buy American Act. However, **[10 NATO
states do not have these agreements]{.underline}**. Nor do key
Indo-Pacific allies and partners such as South Korea, Taiwan, India and
Singapore. For those that do, the impact of these agreements is limited.
[RDP agreements do not guarantee allied participation in US defense
programs.]{.underline} [The opportunity]{.underline} to do so
[is]{.underline} often **[stymied]{.underline}** [by an intricate web of
laws and regulations,]{.underline} as well as by a cultural hubris [that
finds it hard to admit that allied technology **could ever be any
good.**]{.underline}

Still, even what constrained value these agreements do provide is at
risk. Congressional supporters of so-called "Buy American" policies have
passed multiple bills, including the recent bipartisan infrastructure
law, pushing the last two administrations to limit the application of
RDP agreements and reduce waivers and exemptions. In an April 25 letter
to OMB, the same group of allies that opposed the higher domestic
content threshold in the first place are now pleading with the
administration to preserve an "allied" exemption.

Beyond the risk to American jobs, so-called "**[Buy
American]{.underline}**" [regulations will endanger national security by
making it harder for the US military to access the capability and
capacity it needs to stay ahead of Russia and China.]{.underline}

[These regulations]{.underline} will **[shrink]{.underline}** [the
number of defense suppliers willing to do business with the
Pentagon]{.underline}, both **[at home and abroad]{.underline}**,
[potentially choking off the US military's access **to critical
technology**]{.underline}. In order to prove they are meeting the Biden
administration's higher domestic content threshold, companies will be
required to produce complex and expensive compliance documentation to
the government. [For]{.underline} those US [companies]{.underline} [that
sell exclusively]{.underline} or primarily [to the
government]{.underline}, [they will have no choice but to shoulder this
enormous paperwork burden while passing the cost of compliance on to
taxpayers.]{.underline}

But many other companies have a choice of whether to do business with
the government, which is not their only or even primary customer. That's
**[especially]{.underline}** [true of innovative companies leading the
way in emerging technologies]{.underline} in the commercial
sector---[technologies **our warfighters need**]{.underline} to stay
ahead of Russia and China. These American companies may very well
conclude that complying with so-called "Buy American regulations---not
only through administrivia, but potentially by changing the content of
their products---just isn't worth the hassle.

[America's warfighters deserve the]{.underline} **[best
technology]{.underline}** in the world, [some of which happens to come
**from allies and partners**]{.underline} like the United Kingdom and
Australia. Placing [arbitrary limits on the US military's ability to
access that technology makes it **less likely allies and partners will
be willing to sell it to us in the first place.**]{.underline}

**[Allies]{.underline}** and partners also help **[reduce the cost of
defense procurement]{.underline}** for US taxpayers [through
**purchases** of US military equipment and co-funding of the
**development of certain weapons systems**]{.underline}. But the Biden
administration's [protectionist regulations will **increase costs for
taxpayers**]{.underline} [by reducing incentives for US allies and
partners to buy US defense equipment]{.underline}, particularly
countries with substantial defense industries of their own.

The **[US defense industrial base]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
currently **[too small]{.underline}** [to produce enough military
equipment to meet the US military's needs]{.underline}, [particularly
when it comes to]{.underline} ships and **[critical
munitions]{.underline}**. For example, [it will take years to
replace]{.underline} US Javelins and Stingers [supplied to
Ukraine]{.underline}. **[Allies]{.underline}** and partners [can help
**plug this gap**]{.underline}, [which is especially dangerous in light
of China's vast and growing defense production capacity.]{.underline}

How Biden Can Help The US Defense Industrial Base

To be clear, the Pentagon can and should buy American---not because of
any statute or regulation, but for the very simple reason that most of
the best technology in the world that our warfighters need is made in
America. Moreover, the Biden administration and the Congress can and
must do more to support the US defense industrial base.

In particular, [it's time to **invest in growing the defense industrial
base**]{.underline} [to meet the needs of the US military]{.underline}
as well as those of its allies and partners. Legislation proposed by
Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., to provide \$25 billion to modernize and
expand America's public and private shipyards is a good start. Similar
legislation will likely be needed for munitions production not only to
replace munitions sent to Ukraine but to ensure sufficient munitions
stocks for the Indo-Pacific.

Finally, [instead of making it harder to work with allies,]{.underline}
the [Biden]{.underline} administration [could]{.underline} focus on
[eliminat]{.underline}ing our [adversaries from our defense supply
chain]{.underline}. China, for example, sells commercial dual use
component parts that often find their way into US military systems and
will not be restricted under the new Biden "Buy American" thresholds.
These Chinese semiconductors, electronics, IT services and
telecommunications---even in small amounts---are rightful targets of
regulatory scrutiny and [should be replaced through a
targeted]{.underline} "**[buy allied]{.underline}**"
[strategy]{.underline}.

[War unearths the past and reveals the future.]{.underline} The war in
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** [is a reminder of the **defense industrial
base**]{.underline} [America once had and must build
again]{.underline}---[one]{.underline} with the scale, speed,
responsiveness and flexibility [that enables America and its allies and
partners to deter and defend against great power adversaries willing to
wage war to achieve political objectives.]{.underline}

[China and Russia are]{.underline} **[no match]{.underline}** [for the
combined technological and industrial might of the United States and its
allies and partners]{.underline}. But we cannot marshal that collective
power by indulging saccharine, populist schemes. Only [in concert with
allies and partners can America realize aspirations for a 21st century
arsenal of democracy.]{.underline}

#### Otherwise, continued decline will cause the base to [collapse]{.underline} BUT allied innovation solves competition with China and Russia

**Gill 22** -- Jaspreet Gill was the senior technology reporter for
Inside the Army. (Jaspreet Gill, \"The health of the Defense Industrial
Base is failing, trade group says,\" Breaking Defense, 2-22-2022,
https://breakingdefense.com/2022/02/the-health-of-the-defense-industrial-base-is-failing-trade-group-says/,
Accessed 6-20-2022, LASA-SC)

The [health of the **defense industrial base**]{.underline} [has
received a]{.underline} "**[failing]{.underline}**" [grade from a lead
defense trade group for the first time]{.underline}, largely [due to
**unprecedented**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[ongoing]{.underline}** [challenges created by the
COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [and strategic competition from China and
Russia.]{.underline}

That conclusion is part of the National Defense Industrial Association's
third annual Vital Signs 2022 report, which offers an analysis of the
US's defense industrial base. For this year's report, NDIA and data firm
Govini worked together to grade eight "vital signs" that shape the
performance of defense contractors, on a 0 to 100 scale, where an
average score of 70 is considered passing.

Of the eight categories --- demand; production inputs; innovation;
supply chain; competition; industrial security; political and
regulatory; and productive capacity and surge readiness ---five received
a "failing" grade.

"This past [year]{.underline} [has witnessed **significant
deterioration** in the signs including 'supply chain' as well as
'production capacity and surge readiness]{.underline},' which almost
certainly is a result of the impact of the pandemic," according to the
report. "[Conversely, the only sign that significantly improved was
'demand,' **reflecting recent growth in the defense
budget."**]{.underline}

"Industrial security" continues to be the weakest sign in NDIA report,
receiving an overall failing score of 50. The score reflects larger
trends in shortcomings of industrial cybersecurity, despite increasing
resources dedicated to combating the threat, the report states. The
number of newly reported common IT cybersecurity vulnerabilities
continued to increase.

"Data breaches, intellectual property theft, and state-sponsored
industrial espionage in both private companies and university labs are
on an unrelenting rise while the dynamic nature of attacks makes it a
constantly moving target to address," according to the report.

Industrial security has also been an area of active federal rulemaking,
the report states, pointing to the Cybersecurity Maturity Model
Certification as a prime example.

An Interim Rule for CMMC was released in 2020, "prohibiting executive
agencies from entering into contracts with any entity that incorporates
any equipment or service that uses telecommunication equipment made by
Huawei, ZTE, and several other Chinese-made telecommunications equipment
manufacturers," according to the report. "CMMC is a DOD effort to
improve the handling of sensitive information by and within the defense
industrial base . . . These programs are still in interim stages and
their impact on cybersecurity is yet to be determined."

**[Innovation]{.underline}** also [remained stagnant last
year]{.underline}, [with a decline in investments and a lack of change
in the status of scientific research and development services, according
to the report.]{.underline} NDIA gave this area a score of 69 for 2021,
the same score it received in 2020.

The [need for]{.underline} US **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[dominance]{.underline}** [is bolstered by the growing intensity of
competition with **China and Russia**]{.underline}. According to the
report, R[&D investment has declined precipitously as a percentage of
global expenditures]{.underline}. As of 1995 the US ranked fourth in
terms of total R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP and by 2019, it
dipped to tenth.

"[Outside of the private sector]{.underline}, [public sector investment
in innovation also **continued to deteriorate**]{.underline}," according
to the report. "[This is especially significant considering that public
sector funding dominates the area of basic, experimental and theoretical
research in the U.S.]{.underline} Between 2011 and 2016, U.S. government
funding for R&D projects fell by 12% in absolute terms. [Over the same
timeframe, Russia and China **grew public investment in R&D by 13% and
56%, respectively**]{.underline}."

The [outlook for innovation **continues to remain bleak**]{.underline}:
According to the report, companies this year will be required to
amortize their R&D expenses over five years as part of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017, amounting to a significant tax increase, negatively
impacting innovation.

This year's report includes a new section: emerging technologies. NDIA's
Emerging Technologies Institute says some uncertainty lies ahead for the
future of emerging technologies and the US needs to prioritize defense
modernization above all else.

"The 2018 National Defense [Strategy placed]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
**[heavy emphasis]{.underline}** [on investing in high-end technologies
to improve overall capability]{.underline}," the report states. "The
question now is whether the 2022 NDS will do the same. [Though we are
still in a transition period, indications are that the Biden
administration will make **relatively few changes in modernization
priorities.** DoD leaders have states that integrated deterrence will
play a large part in the new defense strategy, which will require
technological improvement across all agencies and
services]{.underline}."

Despite the negative scores, the report does point to a few areas of
confidence. For example, the demand for defense goods and services
remained robust in 2021 due to a rise in contract obligations issued by
DoD.

Another area that NDIA considered passing was competition, with an
analysis of the top 100 publicly-traded DoD contractors producing
favorable outcomes.

"This high mark was driven by several high-scoring factors including a
low level of market concentration for total contract awards, the low
share of total contract awards received by foreign contractors, and a
high level of capital expenditure in the DIB," the report states.
"Conversely, [other factors within the 'competition' sign experienced
decreases]{.underline}, including a significant 11-point decrease for
liquidity. **[These decreases were anticipated]{.underline}**,
[however]{.underline}, [due to the **impact of the pandemic on the
economy."**]{.underline}

\"Geostrategic Competition and Climate Change: Avoiding the
Unmanageable\" September 15.
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/geostrategic-competition-and-climate-change-avoiding-unmanageable>
//pipk

[[Humanity faces two]{.underline}]{.mark} [catastrophic, indeed
**[existential,
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---**[climate]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[change [and nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These risks
play out before us as if on split screen. On one side are the
here-and-now impacts of climate change: wildfires from Siberia to
California to southern Europe, scorching "heat domes" over the Pacific
Northwest, and "once in a thousand years" flooding in China. On the
other, [heightened [geostrategic competition carry]{.mark}ing the
[great]{.mark}est [risk of war between nuclear powers]{.mark} since the
depths of the Cold War]{.underline}: in the month of April 2021 alone,
[a [Russian]{.mark} troop surge on the Ukraine border]{.underline}
triggered an "imminent crisis" alert in NATO while [[Chinese]{.mark}
naval vessels and bombers conducted a largescale war-game encircling
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Though ostensibly discrete, the [events]{.mark}
playing out on the split screen [are linked]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[This]{.mark} new [nexus between geostrategic competition and climate
change must be]{.mark} understood and integrated in policy if the twin
threats are to be [averted]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In his landmark book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded, New York Times columnist
Thomas L. Friedman stated that the central challenge of climate change
to humanity is now "to manage what is already unavoidable and avoid what
will truly be unmanageable." To that compelling formulation can be added
a corollary reflecting the new nexus: **[[avoiding unconstrained
geostrategic competition is a prerequisite for]{.mark} managing [the
climate]{.mark} threat.]{.underline}**

[[The window for humanity]{.mark} to avoid unmanageable climate change
[is narrowing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United Nations'
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that global
temperatures will inexorably rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels by mid-century because of the projected level of
atmospheric carbon. The IPCC starkly warns that the [[dire
consequences]{.mark} arising from a temperature increase beyond that
point [can only be averted through]{.mark} prompt concerted global
action to bend the curve and sharply reduce atmospheric
carbon]{.underline}. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the
report a "code red for humanity." [[China, the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [and Russia]{.mark}
are]{.underline}, respectively, [the first, second, and fourth largest
carbon emitters.]{.underline}

Yet **[[at the precise historical juncture when unprecedented global
cooperation is necessary to forestall catastrophe, the world is on the
brink of unconstrained geostrategic competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Indeed[, [U.S. relations with Russia and China]{.underline} ]{.mark}[are
the worst they have been since the end of the Cold War, with a recent
Department of Defense policy document [warn]{.mark}ing [of an "increased
potential for regional conflicts involving]{.mark} nuclear-armed
adversaries ... and the potential for adversarial [nuclear
escalation]{.mark} in crisis or conflict]{.underline}.\"

One could logically argue against a linkage---that if the great powers
have a mutual interest in averting a climate catastrophe then
cooperation in that area could be compartmentalized from geostrategic
tensions. But [the onset of [unconstrained geostrategic competition
negates]{.mark} the possibility of
[compartmentalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrasting positions on the
nexus---the linkage between geopolitical competition and climate
change---were evident in an exchange between Chinese Foreign Minister,
Wang Yi and former Secretary of State John Kerry, now the Biden
administration's Special Presidential Envoy for Climate during his visit
to China in August 2021. [Wang warned that cooperation on climate change
"cannot possibly be divorced" from other geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}, while Kerry countered that climate change is
neither "a geostrategic weapon" nor "ideological"....but "a global, not
bilateral, challenge."

These contending perspectives divide along political theorist Arnold
Wolfers's classic dichotomy between "possession goals" and "milieu
goals." Possession goals relate to the preservation or enhancement of a
state's narrow national interest---for example, in relation to territory
or trade relations. In contrast, milieu goals pursued by a state aim to
shape and improve the international political environment beyond
parochial national interest---which in this context relate to the
fostering of favorable conditions for concerted action on climate
change.

Applying this framework, the Chinese Foreign Minister's comment suggests
that climate change is viewed within the context of furthering
conventional Chinese possession goals---that cooperation on climate
change can be leveraged to gain advantage on another issue (such as
Taiwan). Kerry's rejection frames climate change as a milieu goal whose
existential stakes transcend any one state's national interests. Through
Kerry, the Biden administration has signaled its aspiration to eschew
efforts by other states to relegate climate change to just another issue
in transactional diplomacy.

Yet on a macro level---elevating climate change to a milieu
goal---**[the [linkage between geostrategic competition and climate
change is unavoidable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Even if]{.mark}
unconstrained geostrategic [competition does not]{.mark} lead to
conflict that might itself [trigger catastrophic global
destruction]{.mark}, [virulent relations]{.mark} between the United
States and its great-power adversaries [create a political environment
in which close cooperation on climate change becomes]{.mark} difficult,
if not [impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For that reason the
**[avoidance of unconstrained geostrategic competition is a prerequisite
for]{.mark}** addressing **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be
sure, [[avoidance does not mean]{.mark} the [**elimination of**]{.mark}
geostrategic [**competition**, but rather]{.mark}, bounding it to
**[mitigate the risks of conflict through effective
management.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Avoiding Unconstrained Competition

[New **[risk factors have brought the great powers to the verge of
unconstrained geostrategic competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An
understanding of those risks provides insight into how they can be
mitigated and thereby managed.

A New Calculus of Risk

[Contemporary geopolitics is driven not by Cold War ideology, but by
nationalism and expansive assertions of state sovereignty. Nuclear
powers are engaged in strategic competition with the United States over
the territorial status quo in areas of vital interest---for China,
Taiwan and the South China Sea; for Russia, Ukraine and the periphery of
the former Soviet Union]{.underline}. This contrasts with the Cold War
era in which the superpowers engaged in competition in the regions of
what was then called the Third World, which were clearly of peripheral
interest. [[This]{.mark} geostrategic competition [runs the risk of war
through inadvertent escalation driven by miscalc]{.mark}ulation and
misperception]{.underline}.

[The territorial dimension, which could be the occasion for great-power
conflict, is compounded by key developments affecting the nuclear
deterrent relationship between the United States and its great-power
adversaries.]{.underline} All the nuclear-weapon states have embarked on
ambitious force modernization programs, and they are developing
capabilities, such as low-yield nuclear weapons, which critics warn make
them more usable in a crisis. The Trump administration's Nuclear Posture
Review claimed that the Russians had adopted an "escalate to deescalate
posture" involving the first use of tactical nuclear weapons. Moreover,
military escalation has traditionally been conceived as progressing from
conventional to nuclear forces. [With the advent of [new
tech]{.mark}nologies, however, escalation during a crisis would most
likely occur in a non-traditional domain]{.underline}---cyber or space.
[Conflict escalation could plausibly take the form of a cyberattack to
interfere with an adversary's communications with its nuclear systems or
an attack on reconnaissance satellites to blind an
adversary]{.underline}. [These [developments could have the
destabilizing consequence of creating an incentive for]{.mark} one side
or the other to take [preemptive action]{.mark} during a
crisis.]{.underline}

Managed Competition

The [[contemporary]{.underline}]{.mark} pursuit of [[strategic stability
is conditioned by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [recasting]{.underline} of
the traditional [tension between]{.underline} two Cold War dynamics. The
[first]{.underline} is the so-called "[stability-instability
paradox,"]{.underline} which captures the dynamic in which a nuclear
stalemate between adversaries may embolden lower-level aggression on the
regional level. The second is what Cold War strategist Albert
Wohlstetter described as the "delicate balance of terror" which
emphasized [the maintenance of a **[stable and robust
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [thereby [removing any
incentive]{.mark} for one power or another [to strike first]{.mark} in a
crisis]{.underline}.

As during the Cold War, **[this [tension can be managed, but]{.mark} it
can[not]{.mark} be [resolved]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Key
elements]{.underline}---some aspirational, others operational, many
surrounded by uncertainty---[will affect the prospects for successful
management]{.underline}:

Resolve/Manage regional flashpoints---The best way to avoid conflict
among nuclear-weapon states is to redouble diplomatic efforts to address
the territorial disputes that could precipitate it. To be sure, if these
territorial issues were easy to resolve, they would have been. In some
instances, domestic politics in one or both parties may be an impediment
to resolution; in others, the discrete territorial issue may be a proxy
for a more deeply rooted source of enmity or grievance. If resolution is
not possible, conflict management may be. For example, the Code for
Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), to which both China and the United
States are signatories, may be a mechanism for managing maritime
tensions between their navies.

Maintain the residual arms control architecture---The new START treaty
has been extended until 2026 and provides certainty and time for Russia
and the United States to agree on a successor arrangement and
outstanding issues (such as non-strategic nuclear weapons and engaging
or taking Chinese capabilities into account).

Do not blur conventional and nuclear operations to prevent inadvertent
escalation---Placing conventional warheads on ballistic missiles, such
as that envisioned through the "Conventional Prompt Global Strike," has
utility (the ability to reach any target on the globe in under one
hour), but runs the risk that Russia may perceive (and respond to) the
launch of a ballistic missile that it associates with U.S. nuclear
capabilities as the initiation of such an attack. Another potential
driver of inadvertent escalation, with implications for both Russia and
China, is the targeting of an adversary's conventional capabilities that
are co-located with its nuclear capabilities.

Mitigate risks through strategic dialogue---In the absence of an arms
control architecture, each nuclear power in the multipolar system will
have strategic autonomy to structure its offensive and defensive
systems. All of the nuclear-weapon states have long been uncomfortably
ambivalent with vulnerability captured in the acronym MAD---mutual
assured destruction. But since the Cuban missile crisis, assured
retaliation---eliminating incentives for a surprise first strike---has
been the sine qua non of strategic stability. The risk now is that an
unconstrained arms race (unregulated numbers of offensive and defensive
systems, in tandem with new weapons technologies and cross-domain
threats to space and cyber assets) could revive those incentives and
undermine the deterrent relationships. In the past, arms control
negotiations provided a forum for strategic discourse. "On a bilateral
or a multilateral basis," scholars Christopher Chyba and Robert Legvold
argue, "the United States, Russia, and China should pursue discussions
intended to improve understanding of one another's strategic concerns
and views on which actions by an adversary would be especially
concerning or dangerous." The focus should be on negotiated restraints
(e.g., a ban on the deployment of anti-satellite weapons) to enhance
stability and reduce incentives for one side or the other to act
preemptively during a crisis.

Managing the Geopolitics of Climate Change

When George Kennan, the diplomatic architect of U.S. containment policy,
declared the end of the Cold War, he explained that the Soviet Union
under Mikhail Gorbachev had evolved from a revolutionary state into an
orthodox great power---the country "should now be regarded essentially
as another great power, like other great powers." Kennan was essentially
arguing that Russia's post-Soviet foreign policy, stripped of ideology,
was a renationalized version of traditional Russian foreign policy with
strategic priorities starting with the "near abroad" of the former

Trading New York for Hamburg? **[The U.S. ability to defend Western
Europe]{.underline}** with nuclear forces [capable of deterring a
superior conventional opponent]{.underline} (and, in time, a nuclear
peer) thus [represented the **cornerstone of NATO Cold War defense
strategies**. It was also vital to U.S. efforts to assure each of the
alliance's member states that they enjoyed the protection of a
nuclear-armed superpower]{.underline}. With [the United States
representing far and away the most powerful member of NATO, **the
cohesion of the alliance depended on member states believing that U.S.
political leaders were prepared to put their military forces -- and**
perhaps even **their homeland -- at risk in order to defend allies on
the other side of the Atlantic**. As the Soviet Union began developing
nuclear forces capable of ranging U.S. cities, however, not all U.S.
allies were convinced this was the case]{.underline}. By the 1960s,
President Charles de Gaulle of [France was openly speculating the United
States would never]{.underline} trade New York for Hamburg -- i.e. it
would never [risk a Soviet nuclear strike against a major U.S. city in
order to protect a vulnerable allied target from an attack by the Warsaw
Pact]{.underline}.92 [He]{.underline} also [argued that NATO was
dangerously dependent on the United States and its uncertain (in his
mind) nuclear deterrent]{.underline}, effectively ceding sovereign
decision-making and national security decisions to American policymakers
in Washington. [This, he asserted, was extremely dangerous given
tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline},
holding NATO's European members hostage to decisions in foreign
capitals. [**De Gaulle's doubts** about the credibility of U.S. extended
deterrence commitments to NATO **led him to strongly support France's
development of an independent nuclear deterrent**]{.underline}. Neither
assured destruction nor flexible response appeared credible to him in
light of the Soviet Union's ability to directly threaten the United
States with nuclear attack. [These]{.underline} doubts and his broader
[concerns]{.underline} that France's membership in the alliance hindered
its national security and ability to independently engage in Cold War
geopolitics [informed his decision to withdraw France from the NATO's
military structure in 1966]{.underline}.93 The questions raised by de
Gaulle [posed a significant challenge to U.S. efforts to assure its
European allies as the Soviet Union began to develop ICBMs]{.underline}
and other long-range nuclear forces.94 By the late 1960s Moscow
possessed a significant edge in conventional forces and appeared capable
of credibly threatening the United States, even if its overall numbers
of forces were still several years from catching up to the U.S. arsenal.
[Some allies wondered if an American president would engage in
brinkmanship with the Kremlin]{.underline} over Hamburg, Berlin, or
other vulnerable areas of the alliance. U[.S. domestic politics also
contributed to allied unease in the 1960s]{.underline}, with a number of
members of Congress voicing their displeasure over what they viewed as a
failure of other NATO states to shoulder what they considered a fair
share of the burden of defending Europe.95 [**The loss of one of its
strongest members was a blow to NATO**, but **it remained
intact**]{.underline} through the end of the Cold War **[because U.S.
leaders clearly demonstrated their willingness to risk blood and
treasure on behalf of]{.underline}** Germany and other members of
**[NATO]{.underline}**. When France's exit from NATO threatened to leave
the alliance homeless and deprive it of a number of key military
facilities, the Johnson administration worked to quickly and seamlessly
transition NATO's headquarters from Paris to Brussels and U.S. forces
stationed in France to the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Germany.
[President Lyndon Johnson also used his skills in domestic politicking
to]{.underline} head off efforts in the Congress to halve the number of
U.S. forces in Europe, and [ensured the provision of **continued
military**]{.underline} and economic **[support]{.underline}** to key
NATO members.96 Furthermore, [for many European allies de Gaulle's
argument that nuclear weapons represented the only true guarantee of
national security in the superpower era ultimately solidified their
commitment to NATO]{.underline}. Like de Gaulle, they had become
convinced of the importance of nuclear deterrence to the defense of
their home countries. They differed from de Gaulle, however, in their
assessment of the U.S. commitment to their defense. For most NATO states
during the Cold War, U.S. conventional and nuclear forces posted to
bases on or near their home territory provided a visible demonstration
of Washington's preparedness to fight for Western Europe. In addition,
the support of U.S. leaders, beginning with President Eisenhower, for
NATO "nuclear sharing" arrangements (which would make certain types of
U.S. nuclear weapons stored in Europe available to allies in the event
of a major Warsaw Pact attack) also addressed concerns the United States
would reserve nuclear forces for use only in defense of its narrow
national interests.97 As aptly summarized by Sir Lawrence Freedman in
his study The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy, most NATO allies during the
Cold War "prefer\[ed\] to live with the known uncertainties of the US
nuclear guarantee than with the political and strategic uncertainties of
nuclear independence."98 Despite significant stresses upon the alliance
later in the Cold War, after 1966 [**no other states would defect from
NATO**,]{.underline} and U.S. nuclear forces would remain the linchpin
of NATO defense strategies and plans until the fall of the Berlin Wall.
De Gaulle's defection also raised questions about the role of U.S.
extended deterrence strategies within the broader geopolitics of the
Cold War. The French president charged that these strategies could
actually interfere with the development of stable, productive relations
between European states and the Soviet Union. While disagreeing with de
Gaulle's decision to break away from the alliance, other members of NATO
agreed the alliance needed to determine its views on the relationship
between deterrence and diplomacy during an era of competition between
two superpowers and their respective blocs. [Recognizing the importance
of this relationship to assuring its NATO allies]{.underline}, the
Johnson administration supported Belgian Foreign Minister Pierre
Harmel's suggestion in late 1966 that [the members of the alliance
conduct a **comprehensive study of its first 20 years** and use the
results to assess its future military and diplomatic goals]{.underline}.
The initiative was recognized as a key effort to rally the alliance in
the wake of France's withdrawal and internal disagreements over whether
and how to diplomatically engage the Soviet Union. The report found that
the alliance could exercise deterrence and conduct diplomacy at the same
time, concluding that "military security and a policy of détente are not
contradictory but complementary."99 While the Johnson administration
would have preferred stronger language in support of deterrence, the
[report's findings generally aligned with the president's conviction
that the **alliance's bargaining power was directly linked with its
military strength**: \[a\] strong NATO remains essential if we are to
reach a solid agreement with the Soviet Union that reflects the common
interests of each of the allied nations in peace and
security.]{.underline}100 [**The United States'** endorsement of the
report and its **unanimous acceptance**]{.underline} by the other
members of NATO in late 1967 [effectively **ended questions about the
alliance's viability**]{.underline} in the wake of France's departure.
[It also addressed allied concerns regarding the superpower
relationship]{.underline}. NATO members believed the U.S. nuclear
umbrella over the alliance was important to their national security.
However, they also wanted the United States to leave the door open for
diplomacy with the Soviet Union, arguing that a cold peace with the
Soviet bloc was better than a hot war that would destroy Europe. As a
result, the willingness of U.S. leaders in the late 1960s and beyond to
stake political capital on both the defense of NATO and on diplomacy
with the Kremlin was an important component of U.S. assurance strategies
during the remainder of the Cold War.

#### NATO cohesion is key to prevent Russian miscalc and extinction

**Farmer 15** (Ben Farmer, Defense Correspondent at The Daily Telegraph,
citing General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, Deputy Commander of NATO Forces in
Europe, and former Director of British Special Forces, and Michael
Fallon, Secretary of State for Defence, member of the National Security
Council, and Member of Parliament, United Kingdom and Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, "NATO general: Russia tensions could escalate into
all-out war," Business Insider, 2-20-2015,
<http://www.businessinsider.com/nato-general-russia-tensions-could-escalate-to-war-2015-2>)

[Tensions with Russia could blow up into **all-out conflict**, posing
"an **existential threat**]{.underline} to our whole being", [Britain's
top general in Nato has warned]{.underline}. [Gen Sir Adrian Bradshaw,
deputy commander of Nato forces in Europe, said]{.underline} there was a
danger Vladimir [Putin could try to use his armies to invade and seize
Nato territory, after calculating the alliance would be too afraid of
escalating violence to respond]{.underline}. His comments follow a clash
between London and Moscow [after the Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon,
said there was a \"real and present danger]{.underline}\" Mr [Putin
could try to destabilize the Baltic states with a campaign of subversion
and irregular warfare]{.underline}. The Kremlin called those comments
"absolutely unacceptable\". Sir Adrian told the Royal United Services'
Institute there was a danger such a campaign of undercover attacks
[could **paralyze Nato decision making, as members
disagreed**]{.underline} over how much Russia was responsible, and how
to respond. [Nato commanders fear a campaign of skilfully disguised,
irregular military action by Russia]{.underline}, which is [carefully
designed not to trigger the alliance\'s mutual defence
pact]{.underline}. He said the [\"resulting ambiguity\" would make
\"collective decisions relating to the appropriate responses more
difficult\"]{.underline}. But [Sir Adrian, one of the most senior
generals in the British Army and a former director of special
forces]{.underline}, went further and [said there was also danger that
Russia could use conventional forces and Soviet-era brinkmanship to
seize Nato territory]{.underline}. He said [Russia had shown last year
it could generate large conventional forces at short notice for snap
exercises along its borders. There was a danger these could be used "not
only for intimidation and coercion but potentially to seize Nato
territory, after which the threat of **escalation** might be used to
prevent re-establishment of territorial integrity. This use of so called
escalation dominance was]{.underline} of course [a classic Soviet
technique]{.underline}." He went on to say that ["the threat from
Russia, together with the risk it brings of a **miscalculation**
resulting in a **strategic conflict**, however unlikely we see it as
being right now, represents an **existential threat**]{.underline} to
our whole being." [Nato has agreed to set up a rapid reaction
force]{.underline} of around 5,000 troops ready to move at 48 hours
notice, [in case of Russian aggression in Eastern Europe]{.underline}.
Supplies, equipment and ammunition will be stockpiled in bases in the
region. [Alliance leaders hope the force will deter any
incursion]{.underline}. David Cameron warned Vladimir Putin there will
be more sanctions and \"more consequences\" for Russia if the ceasefire
in Ukraine does not hold. The Prime Minister vowed that the West would
be \"staunch\" in its response to Russia and was prepared to maintain
pressure on Moscow \"for the long term\". He rejected the findings of a
scathing parliamentary committee report that the UK found itself
\"sleep-walking\" into the crisis over Ukraine. The EU Committee of the
House of Lords found there had been a \"catastrophic misreading\" of
mood by European diplomats in the run-up to the crisis. Earlier this
week, [Mr Fallon said the Russian president might try to **test Nato's
resolve** with the same Kremlin-backed subversion used in Crimea and
eastern Ukraine]{.underline}. [A murky campaign of infiltration,
propaganda, undercover forces and cyber attack such as that used in the
early stages of the Ukraine conflict could be used to inflame ethnic
tensions in Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia]{.underline}, he said. [The
military alliance **must be prepared** to repel Russian aggression
"whatever form it takes"]{.underline}, Mr Fallon said, as he warned that
tensions between the two were "warming up". His comments were dismissed
in Moscow. Russia\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country does
not pose a threat to Baltic countries and accused Mr Fallon of going
beyond "diplomatic ethics" . Alexander Lukashevich said: \"His
absolutely unacceptable characteristics of the Russian Federation remind
me of last year\'s speech of US president Barack Obama before the UN
general assembly, in which he mentioned Russia among the three most
serious challenges his country was facing." \"I believe we will find a
way to react to Mr Secretary\'s statements.\"

#### Cooperation with NATO over defense base is key to collective security

**Low 22** -- Thomas Low is a junior fellow at NDIA. (Thomas, "U.S. Must
Ready Defense Industrial Base to Aid NATO," National Defense, 3-25-2022,
<https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2022/3/25/us-must-ready-defense-industrial-base-to-aid-nato>,
Accessed 6-20-2022, LASA-SC)

[People]{.underline} **[across the globe]{.underline}** [have
witnessed]{.underline} **[first-hand]{.underline}** [Russia's renewed
aggression towards Ukraine]{.underline}, a conflict resulting in the
largest land war in Europe since World War II.

[If the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[and its]{.underline} **[NATO allies]{.underline}**
**[cannot]{.underline}** [deter such action]{.underline}, [it could be
possible for]{.underline} similar [scenes to occur in **other countries
bordering Russia**]{.underline}. A **[prime example]{.underline}** [are
the Baltic states]{.underline}: [Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania]{.underline}. [Though now tied to the West through economic
cooperation]{.underline}, as well as military alliances such as NATO,
[these nations previously existed as part of the Russian sphere of
influence]{.underline}. [They have]{.underline} **[sizable Russian
minorities]{.underline}** [who speak Russian and consume Russian
news]{.underline}.

Recent events have put paired action to what has up to now been mere
verbal antagonism toward NATO's eastern expansion. [While a conflict
with NATO members would result in a **wholly different set of**
ramifications, member countries should not fail to take the steps
required **to deter wider regional conflict.**]{.underline}

In order to adequately remain vigilant against any possible scenario,
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in its own
right [needs to take the steps necessary to prepare **its defense
industrial base.**]{.underline}

Yet an important question remains: What is the current state of this
vital economic sector? To answer this, one should examine the National
Defense Industrial Association's annual report, "Vital Signs 2022: The
[Health and Readiness of the Defense Industrial]{.underline} Base."
While the report does not assess individual defense companies, it does
analyze the environment in which they are asked to operate. This year's
[report assigned the industrial base an overall]{.underline}
"**[unsatisfactory, failing]{.underline}**" [grade]{.underline} of 69.
While [this score is obviously **disappointing**]{.underline}, for the
purposes of this analysis, two particular sections are particularly
relevant.

First, "[Production Capacity and Surge Readiness]{.underline}"
capabilities [dropped]{.underline} a significant **[15
points]{.underline}** compared to the previous year. This can partly be
attributed to the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic but is
nonetheless a cause for serious concern. [When coupled with the current
status of NATO's Eastern European members, the problems are only
**compounded**.]{.underline}

[In the Baltic region]{.underline}, for example, [NATO lacks a
significant military presence]{.underline}. In January of this year
alone, there were only 4,000 NATO troops stationed in the Baltic states,
without any accompanying tanks or warplanes. It [would be difficult and
time-consuming to try and surge much-needed personnel into the Baltic
region should it prove necessary.]{.underline}

The [lack of current]{.underline} personnel and
[infrastructure]{.underline}, [coupled with existing capacity challenges
in the United States]{.underline}, [would place NATO in an **unenviable
position**]{.underline} if [an industrial and deployment surge became
necessary.]{.underline} A **[massive effort]{.underline}** [would be
required as the industrial base maneuvers to produce countless weapon
systems and munitions.]{.underline}

There is also [another factor]{.underline} that must be considered when
addressing the build-up of deterrence forces in NATO member territories.
This is the development of new and **[evolving
technologies]{.underline}**. In the "Emerging Technologies" section, the
[report details several modernization priorities that can deliver
technical capabilities needed to cope with an evolving security
environment]{.underline}. Of those areas, hypersonics stand out as one
technology particularly crucial to keeping pace with other emerging
great powers.

By definition, hypersonic weapons are those which can travel more than
five times the speed of sound, or Mach 5. For numerous nations,
including the United States, they represent the next frontier in missile
technology. However, for far too long, research and development
necessary to cultivate this technology have been lacking. In "Vital
Signs 2022," Congressional interest in these capabilities expressed in
committee hearings decreased six percent. This is a troubling trend,
especially when considering the significant resources near-peer
adversaries are devoting to developing this technology.

Hypersonic systems, which could be utilized for a variety of deterrence
purposes, remain a crucial element within NATO's security apparatus.

Yet as previously mentioned, efforts have been neglected for far too
long. [Development has accelerated and then been halted while
developmental testing has happened at a painfully slow rate if at all,
resulting in years of slow progress allowing other nations to leap
ahead]{.underline}.

Russia recognizes this, as their Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu recently
confirmed hypersonic missiles will make up the core of his nation's
non-nuclear deterrence. Russia's key strategic partner, China, is also
cognizant of these developments, having accelerated its own hypersonic
program through extensive investments and testing---over 10 times the
rate of U.S. testing.

Since the Soviet Union's collapse, there has been a relative peace in
Europe. Gone were thought to be the days of vast European land wars that
displaced populaces and reduced cities to rubble. This collective idea
has been shattered by the recent actions of Russia in the Ukraine. At
[the same time, competition continues to heat up in the Western Pacific
as China notes the Western response to aggression.]{.underline}

[When NATO was established in 1949, its purpose was to provide a
**collective security measure**]{.underline} in [the event of future
conflict with the Soviet Union]{.underline} and later its Warsaw Pact
allies. It sought not to conquer or provoke additional tension. [The
same principles exist today, as NATO members seek to secure their future
and establish a peaceful existence.]{.underline}

To achieve this goal, especially in more geographically sensitive
regions, [**the U.S. and its NATO allies** should closely examine
current capabilities in order to deter future **costly
confrontations**]{.underline}. [A renewed priority must be placed on
industrial capacity and capabilities, investments in emerging
technologies, and force posture.]{.underline}

**[Commercial sales]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[armaments
cooperation]{.underline}**

After 2017 commercial sales of armaments and military equipment to Kyiv
increased; this was partly accompanied by broader arms cooperation.

The [purchase of weapons and military equipment from]{.underline}
**[NATO\'s eastern flank]{.underline}** countries, [mainly]{.underline}
**[Poland]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the **[Czech]{.underline}**
Republic, [played a]{.underline} **[significant role]{.underline}** [in
strengthening]{.underline} the [Ukrainian ground forces]{.underline}.
Kyiv purchased both new and post-Soviet military equipment which met the
current needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. [Polish companies supplied
**loitering munitions** and mini **reconnaissance
drones**]{.underline},\[18\] Oncilla wheeled armoured vehicles,\[19\] 54
MT-LB armoured personnel carriers, grenade launchers and mortars,
pistols and rifles and ammunition.\[20\] The value of export of Polish
armaments and military equipment to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020
amounted to €122 million.\[21\] Partially modernised post-Soviet
equipment was also delivered. Some of the transfers (from the stocks of
the Czech army) were carried out in cooperation between Czech and Polish
firms. After 2017, 46 BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles\[22\] and 33 used
2S1 Goździk self-propelled howitzers were sold to Ukraine.\[23\] The
Czech company sent additional 37 infantry fighting vehicles\[24\] and 16
howitzers\[25\] of the type mentioned, and in 2020 signed a contract to
sell 26 Dana-M2 self-propelled howitzers with ammunition. Czech Tatra
Trucks chassis for Ukrainian Neptun ground-based anti-ship missile
systems\[26\] have also been delivered. Overall, the Czech arms exports
to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020 were worth €48 million.\[27\] [Weapons
and ammunition]{.underline} (including grenade launchers, rifles) [were
also sold to Kyiv by companies from **Bulgaria and Slovakia**, but the
scale of these operations is difficult to estimate.]{.underline}

In recent years, [Turkey has]{.underline} **[intensified]{.underline}**
armaments [cooperation with Ukraine]{.underline}. This
[collaboration]{.underline} developed [in line with]{.underline}
**[Turkish ambitions]{.underline}** [to pursue a]{.underline}
**[multi-vector policy]{.underline}**, to [strengthen its presence in
the Black Sea region and to **modernise its own arms industry and armed
forces**]{.underline}. The [possibility of]{.underline}
**[improving]{.underline}** [Turkey's position in NATO]{.underline} and
as regards Russia (with Ukraine being a part of a complex
Turkish-Russian relationship based on strategic competition and
cooperation) was an additional factor.\[28\] In effect, [Ukraine became
a supplier of engines for Turkish unmanned aerial vehicles]{.underline}
(etc.) and in return received the opportunity to acquire Turkish armed
drones. In 2019 Kyiv signed a contract to purchase 12 Bayraktar TB2s
along with ammunition for \$69 million.\[29\] Drones were used in
Donbass last autumn, which caused Russia to protest.\[30\] Further
agreements on military-technical cooperation were concluded in 2020. On
the basis of these, a Turkish-Ukrainian joint venture will produce an
additional 24--48 drones\[31\] for Kyiv. [The bilateral programme also
foresees the construction of two Ada-class corvettes for the Ukrainian
navy]{.underline} (construction of the first began in September
2021).\[32\]

**[Broader arms cooperation]{.underline}** [with Kyiv is also being
developed by the]{.underline} **[United Kingdom]{.underline}**. If the
bilateral agreement ratified at the end of January 2022 by Ukraine's
parliament is implemented,\[33\] the UK will become the main partner in
rebuilding and modernising the Ukrainian navy. Kyiv plans to acquire 8
missile boats, 6 of which will be built locally, and 2 Sandown-type mine
destroyers (the first to be delivered by the end of this year). For this
purpose, Ukraine received a ten-year loan of £1.7 billion guaranteed by
UK Export Finance.\[34\] With British support, Ukraine will also build
two new naval bases. The cooperation programme is envisaged as long-term
and will not quickly strengthen Ukrainian maritime capabilities. Kyiv is
grateful, even if the UK is not ready to sell Ukraine naval weapon
systems that would significantly strengthen the Ukrainian navy\'s combat
potential.

Some [other NATO countries that]{.underline} **[have been
wary]{.underline}** of [commercial military sales]{.underline} [to
Kyiv]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} [equipping services subordinated to
the Ukrainian interior ministry]{.underline}. **[France]{.underline}**
[signed a contract]{.underline} in 2018 [for the sale]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} 55 [helicopters]{.underline} for the police, border
guards and emergency services\[35\] and, in 2019, for the delivery of 20
[patrol boats,]{.underline} five of which will be built locally.\[36\]
**[Denmark]{.underline}** [wants to develop a similar
cooperation]{.underline} -- in December 2021 a memorandum was signed
envisioning the construction of search and rescue vessels for the
Ukrainian coast guard\[37\] with the participation of Ukrainian
shipyards.

In a rapidly changing world, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited

interests]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[values]{.underline}**
[against new threats and new competitors]{.underline}, especially from
China and Russia. **[But it can\'t do it alone]{.underline}**. Instead,
[the U.S. must strengthen relationships with **existing partners and
allies**]{.underline} [while also building new
partnerships.]{.underline}

**[Strengthening alliances]{.underline}** and attracting new partners
[is]{.underline} one of three lines of effort **[central]{.underline}**
[to the National Defense Strategy]{.underline} laid out in 2018. It\'s
something Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper has been focused on since
he took office last year. The secretary said developing a coordinated
strategy for American allies and partners is among his top priorities.

\"These like-minded nations are an unmatched advantage that China and
Russia do not have,\" Esper said.

Over the past year, with encouragement from the United States,
**[NATO]{.underline}** [has enhanced its readiness by continuing to
secure pledges from alliance members **to increase their defense
spending**]{.underline}. About **[two-thirds]{.underline}** of [NATO
nations have pledged to increase defense spending]{.underline} to 2% of
their gross domestic product by 2021, but all have increased spending to
some degree already.

In the Indo-Pacific region, the department has strengthened alliances
and partnerships by deepening interoperability, expanding deterrent
networks, and executing maritime security and awareness operations.

Also in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. conducted a record number of
freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea over the past
year, more than any other year since 2015, to deter China\'s malign
behavior. For example, in July 2019, the USS Nimitz conducted exercises
with the Indian navy in the Indian Ocean. That exercise, Esper said,
demonstrates a shared commitment between the two nations to support a
free and open Indo-Pacific region.

In November 2019, the United States also participated in its first joint
military exercise with India --- a partnership Esper called \"one of the
all-important defense relationships of the 21st century.\"

In the Middle East, the United States has led a coalition of more than
80 partners to ensure the enduring defeat of the ISIS physical
caliphate. And in September, the United States joined a group of nations
to establish the International Maritime Security Construct, in which the
U.S. partners with eight countries, Lithuania being the most recent. The
goal of the group is to maintain order and security in the Persian Gulf
and the Gulf of Oman.

[When it comes to]{.underline} **[foreign military sales]{.underline}**,
[the department]{.underline} has [improved policy and practices

and both conventional and hybrid challenges in operating domains that
have expanded to include cyberspace as well as land, sea, and
air.]{.underline} NATO must also contend with a growing group of
nonstate challengers empowered by the pace of technological change and
the global diffusion of technology. Increasingly dependent on ubiquitous
technology, NA[TO is adapting to a world in which commercial investments
in]{.underline} research and development ([R&D]{.underline})
**[outpace]{.underline}** [those of governments]{.underline}, innovation
cycles are shortening, and there is more international competition for
technology and innovation. [Since 2014,]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has promoted defense
innovation as a strategy]{.underline} [to integrate new technologies
into military capabilities and strengthen U.S. technological superiority
over its potential adversaries]{.underline}. Today, **[many European
allies]{.underline}** [acknowledge the importance of technology and
innovation in defense, and they are beginning to respond to the changing
environment by committing more resources to defense, and a few have
national defense innovation strategies of their own]{.underline}. The
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom,
**[France]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Germany]{.underline}**---NATO's largest European defense

R&D]{.underline} and reforming their defense ministries [to]{.underline}
take more risk, [procure technology faster,]{.underline} develop
innovative concepts, and strengthen their links with commercial
industry. Generally speaking, however, [European governments are still
in the early stages of developing what are predominantly national
strategies.]{.underline} [NATO seeks to **harmonize the allies' national
strategies**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[defense
investments]{.underline}**, [promote collaboration]{.underline}, [and
build a]{.underline} **[shared vision for the future]{.underline}**. Its
[member states have sophisticated militaries, institutional frameworks
for collaboration, and dynamic economies that attract talent, and
support innovation]{.underline}. [Innovation challenges]{.underline}
**[persist]{.underline}**, [however, such as those related to NATO's
limited budgets and its bureaucratic processes]{.underline}, which make
it difficult for NATO to attract the attention of commercial industry
and global technology companies. [NATO is also working to balance its
member states' concerns over national sovereignty with the need for more
multinational cooperation, both from a cost and from an interoperability
point of view]{.underline}. NATO also seeks to enhance interoperability
among allied militaries and balance short-term priorities with
preparations for future warfare. In the future, NATO might have to rely
as much on its agility and on its capacity for innovation as it has
relied on its military technological advantage in the past. [Congress
may consider what role the United States can play to support NATO's
adaptation, and what channels Congress could pursue to exert influence
over NATO's directio]{.underline}n. There are both risks and
opportunities associated with sharing technology or developing it
jointly with NATO allies, and there are questions about what the United
States and its allies expect from one another in terms of technology and
innovation. [Technology has the potential to enhance NATO's
effectiveness, but it also has the potential to undermine
interoperability or political cohesion if the United States develops a
technology-driven strategy and its NATO allies either do not keep pace,
or do not adapt to strategic, political, and technological
change]{.underline}.

[It **matters** that]{.underline} "[NATO **gets its skin in the game**
with NATO forces]{.underline}, [not **individually offered NATO
contributions**]{.underline}, bilaterally to the effort, [which is
what's going on]{.underline} now," Breedlove said.

Breedlove applauded German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's announcement, in
response to Russia's entering the Donbas region, that Germany would
rescind certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to bring natural gas
from Russia to Germany. It will be harder, Breedlove said, for European
states dependent on Russian petroleum and gas to make similar decisions.

But [Breedlove believes a **unified NATO reaction**, in addition to
military signaling, are the **only effective responses to deter Putin
from further invasion.**]{.underline}

[Putin, in]{.underline} moving [his]{.underline}
"**[peacekeeping]{.underline}**" [forces into the region, indicated they
may go beyond demarcation lines in the Minsk protocol of 2014 that
quelled the conflict between Ukraine and the Russian-backed separatists
in Donetsk and Luhansk.]{.underline}

"[If we bring it]{.underline} '**[weak']{.underline}**

we're going to get a better NATO reply here than not."

#### Russia threats have no backing -- squo thumps the link and proves only a risk deterrence is true

**Burns 22** - Robert Burns is a reporter for the Associated Press.
(Robert Burns, \"Russia has yet to slow a Western arms express into
Ukraine,\" AP NEWS, 4-13-2022,

"It's **[not as easy]{.underline}** [to stop this assistance flow as it
might seem]{.underline}," said Stephen Biddle, a professor of
international and public affairs at Columbia University. "Things like
**[ammunition and shoulder-fired missiles]{.underline}** [can be
transported in trucks that look just like any other commercial
truck]{.underline}. And the [trucks carrying the munitions the Russians
want to interdict are just a **small part of a much larger flow of
goods** and commerce **moving around in Poland and Ukraine and across
the border.**]{.underline}

"So the [Russians have to find the needle in this very big haystack to
destroy the weapons and ammo they're after and not waste scarce
munitions on trucks full of printer paper or baby diapers or who knows
what."]{.underline}

Even with this Western assistance [it's]{.underline}
**[uncertain]{.underline}** [whether Ukraine will ultimately prevail
against a bigger Russian force. The]{.underline} [Biden administration
has]{.underline} **[drawn the line at committing U.S. troops to the
fight]{.underline}**. It has opted instead to orchestrate international
condemnation and economic sanctions, provide intelligence information,
bolster NATO's eastern flank to deter a wider war with Russia and donate
weapons.

In mid-March, a Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said
arms shipments would be targeted.

["We warned the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [that pumping weapons into Ukraine]{.underline}
from a number of countries as it has orchestrated isn't just a dangerous
move but an action that [turns the respective convoys into legitimate
targets]{.underline}," he said in televised remarks.

But **[thus far]{.underline}** [the Russians appear **not to have put a
high priority on arms interdiction**]{.underline}, [perhaps because
their air force is leery of flying into Ukraine's air defenses to search
out and attack supply convoys on the move]{.underline}. They have struck
fixed sites like arms depots and fuel storage locations, but to limited
effect.

On Monday, the [Russians said they destroyed]{.underline} four S-300
[surface-to-air missile launchers]{.underline} that had been given to
Ukraine by an unspecified European country. Slovakia, a NATO member that
shares a border with Ukraine, donated just such a system last week but
denied it had been destroyed. On Tuesday, the Russian Ministry of
Defense said long-range missiles were used to hit two Ukrainian ammo
depots.

As the fighting intensifies in the Donbas and perhaps along the coastal
corridor to the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, Putin may feel
compelled to strike harder at the arms pipeline, which Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called vital to his nation's survival.

In the meantime, [a]{.underline} **[staggering]{.underline}** [volume
and range of war materiel is **arriving almost daily.**]{.underline}

"[The scope and speed of our support to meeting Ukraine's defense needs
are unprecedented in modern]{.underline} times," said John Kirby, the
Pentagon press secretary. He said the approximately \$2.6 billion in
weapons and other material that has been offered to Ukraine since the
beginning of the Biden administration is equivalent to more than half of
Ukraine's normal defense budget.

One example: [The Pentagon says it has provided more than **5,000
Javelin missiles**]{.underline}, [which are among the world's most
effective weapons against tanks and other armored vehicles --- and can
even take down a low-flying helicopter]{.underline}. The missile, shaped
like a clunky dumb bell and weighing 50 pounds (23 kilograms), is fired
by an individual soldier; from its launch tube it flies up at a steep
angle and descends directly onto its target in what its known as a
curveball shot --- hitting the top of a tank where its armor is weakest.

The Pentagon said Wednesday that an unspecified number of additional
Javelins are to be delivered by Thursday, and the U.S. will complete the
delivery of 100 armed Switchblade "kamikaze" drones this week.

The [specific routes used to move the U.S. and other Western materials
into Ukraine are secret for security reasons]{.underline}, but the basic
process is not. Just this week, two U.S. military cargo planes arrived
in Eastern Europe with items ranging from machine guns and small arms
ammunition to body armor and grenades, the Pentagon said.

When the leaders of **[France]{.underline}**, **[Germany]{.underline}**,
**[Italy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Romania]{.underline}**
visited Kyiv on June 16th, they came bearing gifts. They endorsed
Ukraine's bid to become a candidate for membership of the European
Union, a position echoed the following day by Ursula von der Leyen,
president of the European Commission. They also [offered
**full-throated**]{.underline} [support]{.underline} f[or Ukraine's
military effort.]{.underline} "[We are doing **everything** so that
Ukraine wins this war]{.underline}," declared Emmanuel Macron, France's
president. [And they pledged **more of the weapons** that Ukraine says
it desperately needs to make that happen.]{.underline} Mr Macron vowed
to send six more state-of-the-art caesar artillery pieces "in the coming
weeks", on top of the dozen delivered so far. Unwilling to be outshone,
Boris Johnson, Britain's prime minister, turned up to Kyiv a day later
and promised a big new military-training programme.

[Such help is]{.underline} **[desperately needed]{.underline}**. In
recent weeks [Ukraine has made some gains in southern Kherson
province]{.underline}, and on June 17th it claimed to have sunk a
Russian vessel reinforcing Snake Island, a small Russian-occupied
fortress in the Black Sea. [But these are small consolations next to the
steady gains that Russia's army has made in the eastern Donbas region,
where fighting is concentrated.]{.underline} Russia now controls
two-thirds of Severodonetsk, a town that lies deep in a Ukrainian
salient under attack from three sides, with resistance confined to an
industrial zone in the west. Russian forces are also making gains west
of Severodonetsk around Slovyansk, attacking the same salient from the
north.

Rochan Consulting, a firm that tracks the war, says that the settlements
of Bohorodychne, Dolyna and Krasnopillya, to the north-west of
Slovyansk, are crucial (see map). "[It is possible that the Ukrainian
defence in this area could collapse if the Russians maintain their pace
of ground and artillery attacks]{.underline}," a recent update stated.
Even north-east of Kharkiv, where in May Ukrainian counter-attacks had
pushed Russian troops almost back over the border, Vladimir Putin's
troops are on the offensive once again.

One reason for these setbacks is that [Russia's army is concentrating
its forces and using them more methodically than it did in the first
stage of the conflict]{.underline}---when it attacked along several
different axes at the same time, dispensing with some of the rudimentary
principles of warfare. Russia also has a big advantage in raw firepower.
On June 14th Anna Malyar, Ukraine's deputy defence minister, said that
Ukraine was firing 5,000-6,000 shells a day, one-tenth of Russia's
barrage. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr
Zelensky, adds that in some places Ukraine's artillery is outnumbered
ten to one.

Russia is also using long-range rockets, which allow it to strike
Ukrainian positions while remaining safe from retaliatory fire. [Ukraine
is largely **out of ammunition** for]{.underline} [its own Soviet-era
Smerch and Uragan rocket-launchers]{.underline}, which can fire much
further than conventional artillery. It has also run out of Tochka
ballistic missiles. A recent video showed Ukrainian soldiers operating a
diy rocket-launcher---an aircraft rocket pod strapped to a truck-towed
trailer---revealing both ingenuity and scarcity.

[Ukrainian casualties have reached]{.underline} **[shocking
levels.]{.underline}** On June 9th Mr Podolyak said that [**100-200
Ukrainian soldiers were dying a day**, a]{.underline} figure that Mark
Milley, America's top general, described as "in the ballpark" of the
Pentagon's assessments. [Ukraine's call for more arms has thus reached a
new intensity]{.underline}. "[Today **we have about 10% of what Ukraine
has stated that we need**]{.underline}," complained Ms Malyar.

On June 15th an American-led group of nearly 50 countries met on the
sidelines of a meeting of nato defence ministers in Brussels to
co-ordinate assistance to Ukraine (see chart). General Milley and Lloyd
Austin, America's defence secretary, tried to allay Ukraine's concerns.
The country's appetite was, in one sense, insatiable, suggested Mr
Austin, pointing to his own experience in the field: "General Milley and
I have been in a number of fights, and when you're in a fight you can
never get enough. You always want more." Some Western officials hint
that what Ukraine demands in public is not the same as what it asks for
in private.

In fact [Ukraine has got what it wanted]{.underline}---**[and then
some]{.underline}**, claimed General Milley. It [had asked for ten
battalions of artillery and received a dozen, along with half a million
rounds of ammunition]{.underline}. It wanted 200 tanks and got 237. The
97,000 anti-tank weapons Ukraine had received were "more...than there
are tanks in the world", he pointed out, though neglecting to mention
that they are used against other targets. The speed of support had been
"without comparison"---often mere days would elapse between the
authorisation of a Ukrainian request and the delivery of a weapon into
Ukrainian hands. On the same day as the gathering in Brussels the White
House promised \$1bn of new weapons, on top of almost \$6bn in military
aid already supplied.

[Further weapons are in the pipeline]{.underline}. Around **[ten
rocket-launchers]{.underline}**---American himars and British
mlrs---[are due to arrive shortly, and the Biden administration is
considering whether to send four more.]{.underline} These fire-guided
missiles have a range of up to 84km. Some Ukrainian crews have already
been trained in Germany, and more are being taught. General Milley said
that the quality of these weapons would eventually show on the
battlefield: "The Russians are just doing mass fires without necessarily
achieving military effect...The Ukrainians, on the other hand, are using
much better artillery techniques." Germany, which has been criticised
for its reluctance to send heavy weapons, is also sending mlrs and said
on June 14th that it had nearly finished training Ukrainian troops to
use the Panzerhaubitze 2000, a potent self-propelled howitzer with a
range of 40km.

In public, at least, American and European [leaders sound hawkish about
sustaining this flow of arms]{.underline}. "**[We will stay focused on
this for as long as it takes]{.underline}**," insisted Mr Austin in
Brussels. "As [long as necessary, until peace returns to a free and
independent Ukraine, we will remain committed,"]{.underline} tweeted Mr
Macron. In private, there are doubts. [nato countries are]{.underline}
**[clean out]{.underline}** [of the sort of ammunition needed by
Ukraine's Soviet-era weapons]{.underline}: "**[It's gone already in
three months,"]{.underline}** says one European defence official. ["It
doesn't exist anymore]{.underline}." The plan, to be formalised at a
nato summit starting on June 27th, is to help Ukraine's armed forces
switch more fully to nato kit. That is a huge undertaking, and will take
time.

[Europe's own stocks of munitions are low, and finding extra workers and
components for complex weapons, like the Javelin or Stinger
anti-aircraft missile, takes time]{.underline}. Moreover, as countries
like Germany and Poland rearm at breakneck pace, [demand
will]{.underline} **[outstrip defence manufacturers' capacity to
produce]{.underline}**. Shortly before his trip to Kyiv, Mr Macron
warned that France had entered a "war economy in which I believe we will
find ourselves for a long time". The 18 caesars that France has sent or
promised to Ukraine comprise almost a quarter of the country's entire
stock.

There are other anxieties, too. Insiders say that the [fear of
escalation among Ukraine's partners is still constraining the flow of
arms]{.underline}. American officials are carefully watching how Ukraine
uses its powerful new himars launchers---it has promised not to target
Russian soil---and how Russia responds, a policy that risks giving the
Kremlin undue influence over future arms supplies. On June 16th Mr
Macron repeated his claim, originally made in March, that nato had
informally agreed not to provide Ukraine with "certain weapons, such as
planes or tanks"---a red line that must presumably refer to Western-made
tanks, rather than the ex-Soviet ones given to Ukraine by the Czech
Republic and Poland.

[America and its European allies have demonstrated **extraordinary unity
over nearly four months of war**]{.underline}. [Almost all want to see
Ukraine emerge as a secure and sovereign state]{.underline}. But what
that means in practice is not always clear, and seems to be shifting
over time. In April Mr Austin said that America's goal was to sap
Russia's strength: "[We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that
it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading
Ukraine]{.underline}." At a gathering of defence ministers the next day
he added, "Ukraine clearly believes that it can win, and so does
everyone here." Last week he was more circumspect, saying cryptically
that America's aim was a "democratic, independent, sovereign and
prosperous Ukraine". Twice America's defence secretary was asked whether
he still wanted Ukraine to win. Twice he ducked the question.

"I think the [international community has done a **pretty good job of
providing that capability**]{.underline}. [But it's]{.underline}
**[never enough]{.underline}**," Mr. Austin said. "And so we're going to
continue to work hard to move as much capability as we can as fast as we
can."

But **[promising weapons]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[delivering
them]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[two different
things.]{.underline}**

It's [one thing to get a large]{.underline} howitzer or [tank or
thousands of artillery shells to Ukraine's western borders]{.underline}.
But given that NATO countries do not want to risk direct confrontation
with Russian forces, transport from there must be done by Ukrainians or
private contractors.

[Simply getting the weapons across Ukraine to the eastern battlegrounds
depends on railroads and transport networks that are being bombed and
shelled by Russian forces to disrupt supply.]{.underline}

[Ukraine's military is **running very low on shells for its artillery
based on Soviet designs**]{.underline}, [some of it dating to the Soviet
era,]{.underline} [and Western countries **do not make compatible
ammunition**]{.underline}. Former Soviet bloc countries like Poland have
only so many munitions that are familiar to Ukrainian soldiers and work
with their guns.

[More modern Western equipment **requires training,**]{.underline} [done
in other countries, with those Ukrainians trained sent back to operate
equipment or train others.]{.underline}

[Modern weapons also require **sophisticated maintenance**]{.underline},
[which takes further training, and American weapons generally do not use
the metric system, which means different tools and
wrenches.]{.underline}

And [different NATO member countries have **varying equipment requiring
varying training and tools**]{.underline}. [The French have provided
Ukraine some of the most sophisticated artillery in the world, the
Caesar self-propelled howitzer. Like the American M777, it fires 155-mm
shells, but operating the two guns is not the same.]{.underline}

And [not only are sophisticated weapons systems expensive, but the
**supply is limited and production is often slow.**]{.underline} [Some
countries sending arms to Ukraine have expressed fears of depleting
their own stocks and weakening their national security, and some have
secured commitments from the United States and others to provide
replacements.]{.underline}

Of course, [there is a]{.underline} **[tremendous
difference]{.underline}** [between small arms that have been handed out
to civilians as compared to more sophisticated weaponry provided to
government forces]{.underline}. But the risks are real and the potential
negative legacy of arms transfers need to be acknowledged and addressed.
We've seen time and time again how arms aimed at aiding an ally in one
conflict have found their way to the frontlines of unforeseen
battlefields, often in the hands of groups at odds with U.S. interests
or those of civilians. [This is especially true for]{.underline}
**[small arms and light weapons]{.underline}**, [which hold some of the
highest risks of loss, diversion into the illicit market, or
misuse.]{.underline} From Afghanistan to Iraq to Colombia,
well-intentioned transfers have a habit of outliving their political
contexts, and risk fueling new conflicts, being captured by illicit
groups, or contributing to enduring ecosystems of insecurity. In the
end, it may well be the case that a thoughtful, and dispassionate
assessment of the risks and rewards of arms transfers to Ukraine offers
a strategically sound case for sending more weapons to combat the
Russian invasion. [But the risks of these arms transfers must be
considered, and, where possible, mitigated.]{.underline} **[Any weapons
transfers]{.underline}** -- particularly small arms and light weapons --
[need to have appropriate end-use monitoring mechanisms

that the U.S. is not the benign influence abroad that it likes to
believe, and the order that it created is a corrupt scam, not worth the
cost of preserving.

Now elements of the right say much the same thing. This sentiment ranges
from Senate candidate J.D. Vance pointedly declaring that he doesn't
care what happens in Ukraine to right-wing commentator Candace Owens
saying we are at fault for the conflict. Undergirding it all is a sense
that the U.S. needs to mind its own business, and perhaps even treat
China as a "civilizational equal."

But Pax Americana isn't an act of charity. It holds distinct advantages
for the United States. We'd be less safe, prosperous, and free without
it.

What we are witnessing is, in broad brush, a civilizational challenge.
[China and Russia **don't**]{.underline} [have a formal alliance and
their current cooperative arrangement may well break down over
time]{.underline}, [but they **share the same interest in ending the
long era of Western preeminence.**]{.underline}

[Russia can punch above its weight]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
fundamentally [represents]{.underline} [a regional threat,]{.underline}
in particular [to]{.underline} a **[NATO]{.underline}** alliance that
has been a keystone of Western security. [Moscow seeks to divide
European countries from one another and diminish U.S. influence in
Europe]{.underline}, toward the end of reversing the post-Cold War
settlement that was the fruit of the West's triumph over the Soviet
Union.

[What Putin seeks is consequential, but not nearly as sweeping as
Beijing's goal of supplanting the United States at the top of the
hierarchy of nations]{.underline}. [China wants nothing less than to
**restore itself as the Middle Kingdom, owed the respect and obeisance
of the rest of the world.**]{.underline}

[What unites Russia and China is that they are two civilizations that
feel they were humiliated and trampled by the West]{.underline} (Russia
at the end of the Cold War, China from the middle of the 19th century to
the middle of the 20th) and need to regain their rightful place in the
sun. There is an ideological element to the growing challenge, as these
two authoritarian regimes confront the democratic world, but the crux of
the matter is cultural---neither Russia nor China has ever been a
liberal democracy and each country is reacting against international
norms they've never embraced.

Can't we just make way for a more ambitious Russia and China? Within
limits, but their maximal demands are an obvious threat to our
interests.

[Through our system of alliances]{.underline}, [we have
been]{.underline}, in effect, **[sponsoring international
peace]{.underline}**. [Should]{.underline}, say, [NATO
unravel]{.underline}, [there is no reason that Europe]{.underline}
[would not eventually once again become **red in tooth and
claw**]{.underline}, [as it has been through much of its
history]{.underline}. Even if we could ignore or at least stay out of
any future conflict, the loss of a vast zone of free, prosperous and
allied counties would be a blow.

[If it is expensive]{.underline} and burdensome [to underwrite the
security of countries around the]{.underline} [world, it
would]{.underline} be even **[more expensive]{.underline}** and
burdensome [if a global U.S. exit or diminishment created the conditions
for a major wa]{.underline}r[, or if]{.underline} some other
power---i.e., **[China]{.underline}**---**[replaced us at the apex of
world power]{.underline}**.

There are so many advantages to our preeminent position that we take for
granted. In an essay titled "After Hegemony," former Trump official
Elbridge Colby notes some of them: "Think how the American-born internet
supported Silicon Valley, and vice versa, leading to a World Wide Web
governed by formal laws and informal norms almost entirely of American
design. Think how the desire for access to American capital markets
gives American regulators de facto control over global accounting
standards, or how the need to transact with American institutions allows
U.S. Treasury officials to freeze the assets of designated targets
anywhere in the world. Think how Americans take for granted that English
is the universal language and that everyone accepts dollars. Think how
the American university degree has become the preeminent global academic
credential, with searching implications for everything from global
educational standards to measures of professional success."

[The American order has also been, in the main, **just**]{.underline}.
[It is based on the sovereignty of borders and democracy as a
nor]{.underline}m, and hence has been a boon to self-governing peoples
around the world. We can be overbearing and even bullying---as well as
greedy, shortsighted, and wrong-headed---[but U.S. leadership **hasn't
been based on coercion.** By and large, our allies trust us, and find
our model more congenial than anything else on offer.]{.underline}

The [previous hegemonic power]{.underline}, **[Britain]{.underline}**,
[had a soft landing because]{.underline} [Pax Britannica was replaced by
Pax Americana,]{.underline} run by a partner that shared similar values
and mindsets. [The same wouldn't be true if **we hand the baton over to
China**.]{.underline}

Consider the seas. As the navalist Jerry Hendrix notes, [the U.S. Navy
has made the seas safe and free over the last 70 years in a way they
never had been before]{.underline}. It's no accident that there's been a
surge of global trade over the course of these decades that has made
countries around the world more prosperous. Russia and especially China
are a threat to this system, seeking greater control of the seas for
their own purposes.

[China wants to define a swath of the Western Pacific and the Indian
Ocean as its territorial waters. If the U.S. lacks the resources or will
to resist this Chinese aggrandizement, the rules of the road of
international commerce will change drastically in China's
favor]{.underline}. An enormous proportion of global trade flows through
the South China Sea and East China Sea. With control of the key choke
points, China would be in a position to create restrictions and fees for
everyone else's trade and privileged status for its own. [Imagine a kind
of perpetual supply-chain crisis imposed by China as a matter of
policy.]{.underline}

Indeed, [China doesn't want to be a leading country among other leading
countries]{.underline}. [It wants to have its system of government
**considered superior to liberal democracy**]{.underline}. It wants free
access to markets, while constraining everyone else. [It wants to
dominate the setting of technical standards, and so influence how new
technologies are developed to suit its own interests]{.underline}. The
Belt and Road Initiative is a reflection of its vision, with China at
the center and other countries in a subsidiary role.

[If China achieves mastery in Asia and a position of global
predominance]{.underline}, **[it won't leave us alone to enjoy tending
our garden at home]{.underline}**. "[Building upon such economic
advantages]{.underline}," Colby writes, "it [could intrude into and
shape our national life, using its position to coerce, bribe, and cajole
companies, individuals, and governments to do its will, diminishing our
economic vitality and, through that, our freedoms."]{.underline}

[Resisting these]{.underline} growing civilizational [challenges will
require continued engagement around the world and the return in certain
respects to a Cold W]{.underline}ar footing, especially when it comes to
the chronically underfunded defense budget. [Ducking our leadership role
will, eventually, mean inevitable decline and the **creation of a more
hostile world. Countries don't become more prosperous and secure on
their way down.**]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Taiwan I/L

#### Supplying Taiwan with more PGMs is [key]{.underline} to deter China. These munitions provide vital [shore-]{.underline} and [sea-denial]{.underline} capabilities, which [thwarts]{.underline} Chinese landings.

**Erickson** and Collins 4-18-20**22**, Andrew Erickson, professor of
strategy in the U.S. Naval War College's China Maritime Studies
Institute, Gabriel Collins, Baker Botts Fellow in Energy & Environmental
Regulatory Affairs at Rice University's Baker Institute, \"Eight New
Points on the Porcupine: More Ukrainian Lessons for Taiwan\", War on the
Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/eight-new-points-on-the-porcupine-more-ukrainian-lessons-for-taiwan/,
DL

**[Sea-Denial Fires]{.underline}**

[Taiwanese forces should pursue a **three-layered
approach**]{.underline} [to defending Taiwan's coastline from amphibious
attack. The **outermost layer** would involve munitions]{.underline}
[capable of striking Chinese **staging areas** and ports, as well as
**petroleum, oil**, and **lubricants** tanks to **disrupt an invasion**
force]{.underline} and potential follow-on waves. Taiwan has for more
than a decade fielded a 600km-range land-attack cruise missile (the
Hsiung Feng IIE) capable of such interdiction missions as well as an
air-launched cruise missile (the Wan Chien) with a 240km-range, but only
small numbers of rounds.

[American assistance should]{.underline} thus be structured to
**[rapidly augment]{.underline}** [existing Taiwanese indigenous systems
and **amplify their deterrent** effect through]{.underline} the prospect
of **[expanding them]{.underline}**. [Taiwan plans to double advanced
missile production]{.underline} to a total of nearly 500 per year in
2022. [But as Ukraine]{.underline}'s example [shows, that may only
amount to **days of supply**]{.underline} [during a high-end war, making
**imported weapons**]{.underline} [an]{.underline} **[important
component]{.underline}** of pre-conflict preparation. [In 2020, the
United States approved the sale of 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack
Missile Expanded Response]{.underline} units to Taiwan for approximately
\$1 billion[. These high-precision, 300km-range weapons]{.underline} are
air-launched, combat-proven, carry an 800lb warhead, and [offer Taipei
the ability to **interdict Chinese military** support infrastructure and
vessels **in port**.]{.underline}

To ensure second-strike capability, [Taiwan]{.underline} likely [needs
**several times**]{.underline} [its current inventory of these missiles,
**dispersed to highways** and other **forward-operating** points that
could **survive a surprise** ballistic and cruise missile
strike]{.underline} by China. [Taiwan should]{.underline} attempt to
[obtain Harop-type long-range **loitering munitions**]{.underline} as
well. U.S. defense contractors could potentially produce the latter
under license from Israeli Aircraft Industries [to **blunt** potential
Chinese pressure]{.underline} --- sales of Spike missiles and other
hardware to Taiwan could provide an incentive for the deal.

[The second layer entails stockpiling]{.underline} and deploying
anti-ship missiles and [precision-guided munitions to deny China the
ability to **reach Taiwanese ports**]{.underline}. Again, [the intent
would be for **American-origin** systems **to amplify** Taiwan's
indigenous capabilities]{.underline}, such as the 120--150km-ranged
Hsiung Feng III supersonic anti-ship cruise missile. The United States
has already approved the sale of 100 Harpoon land-based coastal defense
cruise missile launchers, 400 missiles, and 25 associated radars to
Taiwan. With a range of 124km, Harpoon Block II missiles could engage
Chinese vessels soon after they leave port. If China begins posturing
for an invasion, [Washington should facilitate Taipei purchasing even
**more launchers** and **missile rounds**]{.underline}, perhaps even
through a lend-lease arrangement.

On April 13, 2022, two [Ukrainian]{.underline} Neptune anti-ship cruise
[missiles struck the cruiser]{.underline} [Moskva, Russia's Black Sea
flagship, causing it to catch fire and sink. Moskva's sundering shows
how coastal anti-ship cruise missiles can be **hard to see** coming in
sufficient time to defend against if ships are operating **close to
land**. Losses inflicted on the **British Royal Navy** by **Argentine
Exocet** missiles during the Falklands War and the near-loss of **USS
Stark** after two Exocet strikes in 1987 suggest that]{.underline}
[**rapidly maximizing** the **quantity** and **survivability** of
Taiwan's long-range anti-ship missile inventory could **seriously
challenge** People's Liberation Army Navy operations near the
island.]{.underline}

**[Shore-Denial Fires]{.underline}**

[The **third layer** of coastline defense should rely on **precision
fires**]{.underline} to [turn Taiwan's nearshore **waters and beaches**
into **kill zones**]{.underline}. [Taiwanese forces need multiple-launch
rocket artillery with submunitions]{.underline} (for example
High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems) [to target any **landing force**
close to Taiwan's coast]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the High-Mobility
Artillery Rocket Systems platform could employ Saab's Ground-Launched
Small Diameter Bomb, whose 150km-range and **high precision** would
allow rocket systems **dispersed throughout Taiwan** to target a Chinese
landing force.]{.underline} The United States has already agreed to
deliver at least 11 High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems by 2027 --- a
number that should be substantially increased to accommodate combat
attrition and ensure sufficient mass of fire against a potential
invasion attempt.

[Taiwanese forces should]{.underline} also [stockpile]{.underline}
relatively [high-volume,]{.underline} **[lower-cost]{.underline}**
[**p**recision-**g**uided **m**unitions to **overwhelm invaders** near
or on its beaches. AGM-114 Ground-Launched Hellfire-Light missiles
deployed in anti-ship mode from mobile platforms]{.underline} (such as a
modified Humvee chassis) [offer one option. This Littoral Combat Ship
surface module concept could also be fitted to **commercial fishing**
vessels to threaten and **destroy small boats**, such as **amphibious
assault craft.**]{.underline}

[The United States should]{.underline} also [help Taiwan]{.underline} to
[acquire substantial numbers of **Javelin missiles**]{.underline} [and
additional advanced versions of the BGM-71 Tube-launched, Optically
tracked, Wire-guided **anti-tank missile**, with rounds **pre-positioned
in hardened** locations near likely landing areas. **Ukraine's fight**
thus far suggests that **repelling an intense** multi-vector invasion
attempt can realistically require **thousands of anti-armor**
munitions.]{.underline}

[The war in Ukraine has already **absorbed a significant** portion of
U.S. **Javelin and Stinger** stockpiles. This means supplying Taiwan
would require investing in the American **munitions industrial base** to
substantially increase production capacity.]{.underline} Incoming
Undersecretary for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante's recent
Senate confirmation hearing testimony suggests that such investments
could be forthcoming soon. The White House and Congress should also
consider license-manufacturing of certain systems in Taiwan to bolster
domestic support on the island and allow U.S. plants to more rapidly
replenish America's own stocks.

### 2AC -- Turkey

#### Drones are becoming less effective in Ukraine now. PGM cooperation with Turkey gives drones teeth.

Tanmay **Kadam** 4-8-20**22**, Geopolitical Researcher, \"[Washington To
Arm Ukraine\'s]{.underline} Bayraktar [TB2 Drones With **Laser-Guided
Rockets** To Target Russian Tanks With **Pinpoint
Accuracy**]{.underline}\", Eurasian Times,
https://eurasiantimes.com/us-to-arm-turkish-bayraktar-drones-with-laser-rockets/,
DL

Traditionally, any rocket with a guidance system is called a missile
however in the US military 'guided rocket' refers to the stock of 70
mm/2.75-inch Hydra 70 unguided rockets that have been turned into
precision-guided munitions (PGMs) using laser guidance kit.

[[So far, the Ukrainian resistance has **impressively employed** its
small fleet of]{.mark} TB2 [drones]{.mark}]{.underline} against the
invading Russian military which happens to be one of the world's largest
armed forces.

[The Turkish-made drones have become a]{.underline} sort of
**[legend]{.underline}** in Ukraine's guerrilla force making headlines
every day and social media is proliferated with posts of numerous video
footage from Bayraktar drones either itself striking or guiding the
artillery strikes against Russian military targets.

[[The]{.mark} Ukrainian [military has used TB2 for
recon]{.mark}]{.underline}naissance, [surveillance, suppression of enemy
air defenses]{.underline} (**[SEAD]{.underline}**) [operations, and
battlefield destruction]{.underline}.

[[TB2s]{.mark} **have [destroyed]{.mark}**]{.underline} Russian Buk
medium-range surface-to-air missile ([[SAM]{.underline}]{.mark})
[launchers]{.underline} [enabling the Ukrainian air force to continue
operating]{.underline} for more than a month into the war; **[struck
[Russian convoys]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thereby [hindering]{.underline}
the [much-needed supplies]{.underline} to the frontlines; [[and]{.mark}
**neutralized Russian [tanks]{.mark}** and]{.underline} various other
types of [armored vehicles]{.underline}, etc.

Meanwhile, Russia has claimed that its armed forces have destroyed 37 of
the Ukrainian Bayraktars, the evidence so far exists only for three of
these and the TB2s still appear to be operating.

**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of late, [[fewer videos]{.mark} have
[appeared of TB2]{.mark} strikes]{.underline} as more of them are seen
identifying targets and directing the artillery fire towards them,
[[suggesting a]{.underline}]{.mark} date
**[[shortage]{.underline}]{.mark}** of laser-guided MAM missiles also
supplied by Turkey.

While the US and European countries have been actively providing Ukraine
with weapons since the beginning of the Russian invasion, Turkey has
refrained from supplying arms possibly because of Russian pressure.

Turkey supplied an extra consignment of Bayraktars shortly before the
invasion but the country finds itself in a difficult position between
supporting Ukraine and opposing Russia because of its dependence on the
latter for its energy needs.

Turkish officials have maintained that the drone sale was a private deal
between a Turkish company and Ukraine and not military assistance from
the government.

In such a situation, [[the US]{.underline}]{.mark} seems to have come up
with a [[solution to **give**]{.mark} **the [teeth]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
Ukraine's fleet of [TB2s by arming them with]{.mark}]{.underline} its
lightweight, [laser-guided Advanced Precision Kill Weapon,]{.underline}
or [[APKWS]{.underline}]{.mark} which is an upgrade for the US
military's vast stocks of old Hydra 70 rockets.

These 25-pound 70 mm rockets were developed way back in the 1940s,
carried in pods of seven or nineteen by attack aircraft and helicopters,
and fired in volleys to cover an entire area. The US used them
extensively in Vietnam and Russian helicopters are still firing pods of
similar unguided rockets in Ukraine.

In 2005, the US Army started a new development program called APKWS II
and BAE Systems was selected as the prime contractor for the program,
while other contractors included General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman.

The BAE systems fitted the APKWS with its distributed aperture
semi-active laser seeker (DASALS) guidance and control system to convert
the unguided Hydra 70 rocket into precision munitions which enables them
to engage soft and lightly armored targets in restricted areas with
minimal collateral damage.

The semi-active laser-guided rocket system consists of 3 main components
which include M151 / MK152 and M282 warheads, M423 / MK435 fuse, and a
standard MK66 rocket motor.

The rocket system has wing assemblies and folding fins with a low-cost
laser seeker located on the leading edge of these folding fins working
in unison as a single seeker which allows existing warheads from the
Hydra 70 system to be used without the need for a laser seeker in the
nose of the missile.

The weapon system is also fitted with a MEMS inertial measurement unit
and advanced digital signal processing technique for improved
communication.

The system works with standard laser designators which involve the
operator highlighting the target for the rocket to home in on it. It is
known to have a range of over 4.83 km from a helicopter or 11.27 km from
a fixed-wing aircraft which has been increased by 30% after a software
upgrade by BAE Systems in 2021.

[[The]{.mark} rocket [system can be deployed against **ground, air, and
sea**]{.mark}-based [threats]{.mark} and can also be used for close
**air support operations**.]{.underline}

The Bayraktar drones have never fired an APKWS before but it is said to
be able to fire the CİRİT missile made by Turkish company Roketsan which
is also a 70mm laser-guided rocket compatible with NATO standard laser
designators and can be launched from existing aircraft-mounted rails and
pods.

CİRİT missile made by Turkish company Roketsan (Turkish Media)

Also, [[the APKSW is light]{.mark} in weight as [compared to]{.mark} the
[current MAM missiles]{.mark} used by Ukrainian TB2s [that]{.mark} can
[allow the drone to carry]{.mark} 6 or [more]{.mark} APKWS instead of 4
MAM]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- NATO I/L -\> Taiwan

#### Increased NATO cooperation deters Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

Philip **Anstrén** 6-30-20**21**, fellow in the Taiwanese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, \"The case for greater US-EU collaboration on Taiwan\",
Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-case-for-greater-us-eu-collaboration-on-taiwan/,
DL

[NATO should prepare **contingency plans** in the event of **Chinese
aggression** against Taiwan]{.underline}. Because they don't have even
the ambiguous security commitments toward Taiwan that the United States
does, European members of NATO would be loath to send military assets to
assist a US intervention in the Taiwan Strait. However, [European
members of NATO could commit to stepping up their **military
responsibilities** in the North Atlantic should the United States have
to come to the defense of Taiwan. The goal would be to **backfill
Washington**, **freeing it up** to act in the Taiwan Strait and
**maximizing its capacity** to **deter China**]{.underline}. A similar
effect could be achieved by having European countries step up their
security role in the Indo-Pacific, as countries like Germany, France,
and the UK are increasingly trying to do.

All these moves would risk antagonizing China. But [Beijing, faced
with]{.underline} the **[united strength]{.underline}** of the EU and
the United States, [would have little room to retaliate except
rhetorically]{.underline}. That would be especially true if the EU and
United States limit themselves, as recommended, to deterrent moves
showing what they would do in the event of a cross-strait crisis. After
all, China would inflict great harm on itself as well by, for instance,
imposing trade sanctions against the United States and the EU---its
largest trade partners.

The dawn of the Biden administration has created new hope for
[greater]{.underline} EU-US [cooperation]{.underline}. Both sides should
make sure that this revival **[extends to Taiwan]{.underline}**.

### 2AC -- AT: PGMs Bad For Taiwan

#### Taiwan needs more precision guided munitions to deter China. Ukraine proves the efficacy of asymmetric warfare that PGMs provide.

**Yu** 3-11-20**22**, Matt Yu and William Yen citing Su Tzu-yun, an
associate research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and
Security Research, \"Cost-effective, guided missiles \'key to asymmetric
warfare in Taiwan\'\", Focus Taiwan,
https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202203110018, DL

Taipei, March 11 (CNA) [Taiwan should leverage cost-effective
precision-guided munitions to bolster its counter-invasion **asymmetric
warfare capabilities**]{.underline}, a researcher from the Institute for
National Defense and Security Research said Friday.

Su Tzu-yun (蘇紫雲), an associate research fellow at the Taipei-based
think tank, told CNA that [affordable precision-guided air
defense]{.underline} and anti-ship missiles [would be key to giving
Taiwan an **advantage over** an invading military force.]{.underline}

Su\'s comments come after Mara Karlin, [United States assistant
secretary of defense]{.underline} for strategy, plans, and capabilities,
[said]{.underline} in a Senate hearing Thursday that [**Taiwan should
strengthen** its asymmetric capabilities]{.underline}, as a preparatory
measure, [in the event of an attack by China.]{.underline}

\"I think the situation we\'re seeing in [Ukraine]{.underline} right now
[is a very **worthwhile case study**]{.underline} \... about why Taiwan
needs to do all it can to build asymmetric capabilities, to get its
population ready, so that it can be ready as quickly as possible should
China choose to violate its sovereignty,\" Mara said in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

Asymmetric warfare, which has been used to varying degrees of success
throughout history, has been put to use again during the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, Su said.

However, Su noted that while [Ukraine has mainly been a land
war]{.underline}, an invasion of [Taiwan would likely include sea and
air engagement, necessitating a **different approach**]{.underline} to
asymmetric warfare.

[Despite the differences, the logic remains the same]{.underline}, Su
said, in that \"[the key to asymmetric warfare is the **difference in
cost**]{.underline}.\"

[Using cheaper but precise munitions to destroy enemy forces would
**follow the example** set by Ukrainian forces, which have employed
Javelin missiles to take out armored vehicles, and Stinger missiles to
shoot down helicopters]{.underline}, Su said.

Because of the differences in terrain between Taiwan and Ukraine, it
would be possible to use anti-ship missiles to offset enemy naval power
and anti-aircraft missiles to take down enemy fighter planes, Su said.

Ukraine has claimed 12,000 Russian soldiers have died since the
beginning of hostilities on Feb. 24, along with the loss of 49 fighter
jets, 81 helicopters, and 335 tanks, figures that have been disputed by
Moscow.

[**Even though** U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have continued]{.underline}
throughout both the Donald Trump and Joe Biden administrations,
[including precision-guided weapons, acquisition of material **needs to
accelerate** as the threats are]{.underline} also [growing]{.underline},
Su said.

WASHINGTON, June 22, 2022 - [The State Department has made a
**determination approving** a]{.underline} possible [Foreign Military
Sale to the NATO Support and Procurement Agency of Precision Guided
Munitions]{.underline} and related equipment for an estimated cost of
\$22.7 million. [The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the
required certification notifying Congress]{.underline} of this possible
sale today.

[NATO Support and Procurement Agency as Lead Nation **has requested**
the]{.underline} possible [sale]{.underline} of two hundred thirtynine
(239) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs, Increment I; two hundred four (204)
FMU-152 fuzes; two hundred four (204) MK-82 500LB General Purpose Bombs;
and fifty (50) BLU-109 2000LB Hard Target Penetrator Bombs, that will be
added to a previously implemented case. The original FMS case, valued at
\$1.87 million, included forty (40) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs,
Increment I. Therefore, this notification is for a total of two hundred
seventy-nine (279) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs, Increment I; two
hundred four (204) FMU-152 fuzes; two hundred four (204) MK-82 500LB
General Purpose Bombs; and fifty (50) BLU-109 2000LB Hard Target
Penetrator Bombs. Also included are smoke signal cartridges; engineering
and technical support and assistance; and other related elements of
logistical and program support. [The total estimated cost is \$22.7
million]{.underline}.

[This proposed sale supports the foreign policy and national security of
the United States by **increasing the flexibility** of Belgium, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, twelve NATO
nations and one NATO enhanced opportunity partner nation, to contribute
to overseas contingency operations. This sale **increases the quantity**
of **p**recision**g**uided **m**unitions within NATO and allows for
their pre-coordinated transfer in support of national and NATO
requirements.]{.underline}

[The proposed sale will **improve NATO\'s capability** to meet current
and future ground **threats with precision**. NATO will use the enhanced
capability as a deterrent to regional threats, and to **increase
interoperability** within contingency operations. Many of the purchasing
nations **already have** precision-guided munitions in their inventories
and will all have **no difficulty absorbing** these munitions into its
armed forces.]{.underline}

The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic
military balance in the region.

The principal contractors for production are the Boeing Corporation, St
Louis, MO; and Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ. The principal
contractor for integration is unknown and will be determined during
contract negotiations. There are no known offset agreements proposed in
connection with this potential sale.

Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of
any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to NATO.

[There will be **no adverse impact**]{.underline} [on U.S. defense
readiness]{.underline} as a result of this proposed sale.

Here autonomy is limited to the ability of a system to act without

### 2AC -- AI -- General

#### Security cooperation with NATO over AI is expanding tech that performs tasks that typically require human intelligence

**Lockman and Christie 21** -- Zoe Stanley-Lockman is an Innovation
Officer in the Emerging Security Challenges Division in NATO's
International Staff, and focuses particularly on Artificial Intelligence
and Autonomy. Edward Hunter Christie is the owner and founder of AI
Policy Consulting and served as lead consultant to NATO in the
preparation of NATO's AI Strategy. He was formerly Deputy Head of
Innovation in NATO's International Staff and the author of NATO's
Artificial Intelligence White Paper. ("An Artificial Intelligence
Strategy for NATO,\" NATO Review, 10-25-2021,
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/10/25/an-artificial-intelligence-strategy-for-nato/index.html,
Accessed 6-19-2022, LASA-SC)

One does not have to look far to see how **[Artificial
Intelligence]{.underline}** (AI) -- [the ability of machines to
**perform tasks that typically require human intelligence**]{.underline}
-- [is transforming the international security environment in which NATO
operates]{.underline}. Due to its cross-cutting nature, [AI will pose
a]{.underline} **[broad set]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[international security challenges,]{.underline} affecting both
traditional military capabilities and the realm of hybrid threats, and
will likewise provide new opportunities to respond to them. [AI will
have an impact on all of NATO's core tasks of collective defence, crisis
management, and **cooperative security.**]{.underline}

With new opportunities, risks, and threats to prosperity and security at
stake, the [promise and peril]{.underline} associated with this
foundational technology [are too vast for any single actor to manage
alone]{.underline}. As a result, **[cooperation]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} inherently [needed]{.underline} [to equally mitigate
international security]{.underline} risks, as well as to capitalise on
the technology's potential to transform enterprise functions, mission
support, and operations.

The [continued ability of the Alliance to deter and defend against any
potential adversary and to respond effectively to emerging crises will
**hinge on its ability to maintain its technological
edge**]{.underline}. Militarily, futureproofing the comparative
advantage of Allied forces will depend on a common policy basis and
digital backbone to ensure interoperability and accordance with
international law. [With the fusion of human, information, and physical
elements increasingly determining decisive advantage in the battlespace,
**interoperability becomes all the more essential**.]{.underline}
Further, [as competitors and potential adversaries invest in AI for
military purposes, **ensuring that Allies develop common responses to
ensure their collective security will only become more
urgent.**]{.underline}

With the formal adoption of the NATO AI Strategy, [Allies have committed
to the necessary cooperation and collaboration to meet these very
challenges in both defence and security, naming NATO as the primary
transatlantic forum]{.underline}. The aim of NATO's AI Strategy is to
accelerate AI adoption by enhancing key AI enablers and adapting policy,
including by adopting Principles of Responsible Use for AI and by
safeguarding against threats from malicious use of AI by state and
non-state actors.

By acting collectively through NATO, Allied governments also ensure a
continued focus on interoperability and the development of common
standards. Overall, with innovation ecosystems implicating different
actors and faster technology lifecycles than typically included in
traditional capability development systems, the NATO AI Strategy is also
a recognition that exploitation of AI will require new efforts to foster
and leverage the Alliance's innovation potential, including through new
partnerships and mechanisms. [Taken together, these efforts will in turn
strengthen the Alliance's ability to pursue cooperative security efforts
and to engage with international partners and other international
organisations on matters of international security.]{.underline}

#### AI is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Military applications of AI include tracking and engaging targets.

Edward Hunter **Christie** 3-31-20**22**, former Deputy Head of NATO's
Innovation Unit, Senior Research Fellow at the Finnish Institute of
International Affairs, Founder of AI Policy Consulting, and author of
NATO's Artificial Intelligence White Paper, \"[Defence cooperation in
artificial intelligence]{.underline}: Bridging the transatlantic gap for
a stronger Europe\", SAGE Journals,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17816858221089372, DL

Artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [is the ability of machines
to perform tasks that typically **require human
intelligence**]{.underline}---for example, [**recognising patterns**,
learning from experience, drawing conclusions, **making predictions** or
taking action]{.underline}---[whether digitally or as the smart software
behind autonomous physical systems]{.underline} (Reding and Eaton 2020,
14).

[The range of potential military applications is]{.underline} at least
[as vast as the range of tasks that **require human
cognition**]{.underline}, [for example analysing]{.underline} and
classifying visual [data]{.underline}, [organising logistics, operating
support vehicles, or tracking and]{.underline} **[engaging hostile
targets]{.underline}** (Christie 2021b, 84). States are racing to
achieve superiority in the AI domain (Lin-Greenberg 2020). Furthermore,
like other digital technologies, AI diffuses rapidly and cheaply across
areas of human activity and across borders. Nevertheless, as with other
technological transformations, states with greater resources and levels
of effort, and better policies, will reap the benefits of technology
adoption more rapidly than others.

[In an alliance context, matters pertaining to cooperation and
interoperability take centre stage.]{.underline} The good news is that
Europeans are not starting from scratch. European states that are
members of NATO can rely on decades of experience with the Alliance's
mechanisms of consultation and collaboration. In addition, European
states that are members of the EU can pursue collaborative activities
through the European Defence Agency (EDA). Furthermore, EU funding is
available through the European Defence Fund for defence research and
capability-development activities.

### 2AC -- AT: Not Semi-Autonomous

#### AI includes semi-autonomous systems.

Director for Science Programs for the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of
Bioethics, \"Artificial Intelligence in Service of Human Needs:
Pragmatic First Steps Toward an Ethics for Semi-Autonomous Agents\",
PubMed, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32228385/, DL

[The ethics of]{.underline} robots and artificial intelligence
([AI]{.underline}) [typically centers on \"giving ethics\"
to]{.underline} as-yet imaginary [AI with human-levels of
autonomy]{.underline} in order to protect us from their potentially
destructive power. It is often assumed that to do that, we should
program AI with the true moral theory (whatever that might be), much as
we teach morality to our children. This paper argues that [[the focus
on]{.mark} AI with [human-level autonomy is
misguided]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} robots and
[[AI]{.mark} that we have [now]{.mark} and in the near future
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} \"**[[semi-autonomous]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"
[in that their ability to make choices and to act is limited across a
number of dimensions.]{.underline} Further, [[it may be **morally
problematic** to create AI with]{.mark} [human-level
autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if it becomes possible. [As such,
[any useful approach to]{.mark} [AI]{.mark}]{.underline} ethics [[should
begin with]{.underline}]{.mark} a theory of giving ethics to
[[semi-autonomous agents]{.underline}]{.mark} (SAAs). In this paper, we
work toward such a theory by evaluating our obligations to and for
\"natural\" SAAs, including nonhuman animals and humans with developing
and diminished capacities. Drawing on research in neuroscience,
bioethics, and philosophy, we identify the ways in which AI
semi-autonomy differs from semi-autonomy in humans and nonhuman animals.
We conclude on the basis of these comparisons that when giving ethics to
SAAs, we should focus on principles and restrictions that protect human
interests, but that we can only permissibly maintain this approach so
long as we do not aim at developing technology with human-level
autonomy.

#### AI enables both autonomous engagement/semi-autonomous weapons and fully autonomous weapons. PGMs fall under autonomous engagement.

**BAE Systems**, international defense, aerospace and security company,
\"What is Autonomous Engagement?\",
https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/definition/autonomous-engagement, DL

[[Autonomous Engagement is a weapons]{.mark} system's technological
[ability to **identify, engage, and destroy**]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
identified [target without human intervention, based on]{.mark}
**specific [targets]{.mark}** or aim designations [**chosen by human**
operators]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This is]{.underline} often [referred to as]{.underline} "[fire and
forget]{.underline}," a capability that has been continuously evolving
for more than 70 years. [U.S. weapon systems have been flying with
autonomous functionality]{.underline} since the 1940s, [with levels of
self-governed capabilities, including target identification, target
cueing, target prioritization, and terminal guidance increasing over
time. To be clear]{.underline}, however, the U.S. Department of Defense
([[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} long
[[classified these]{.mark} weapons systems [as
**semi-autonomous**]{.mark} or n**ot autonomous**, because they require
human involvement in identifying and choosing their intended target or
group of targets.]{.underline}

Advances in [artificial intelligence]{.underline}
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and machine learning (ML) have [**[paved
the way]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} more accurate **target detection**,
recognition, and discrimination, leading to improved and more autonomous
weapons system targeting effectiveness.]{.underline} Completely
autonomous capability removes the technological need for
human-in-the-loop (HITL) and human-on-the-loop (HOTL) decision-making,
which makes sense because human decision-making and communication cannot
match the short time scales -- measured in seconds -- required for
terminal homing. [Weapons equipped with [autonomous engagement]{.mark}
capabilities become even more valuable when employed in collaborative
weapons operations]{.underline}, enabling target sharing, target attack
prioritization, and coordinated strike capabilities to overwhelm enemy
defenses. While there are still ethical considerations about pushing
human decision-making further out of "the loop," the DoD and allies also
must consider that against significant pushes into AI-directed
autonomous weapons by near-peer potential rivals of the U.S., including
China and Russia.

Why is Autonomous Engagement important?

When activated, munitions and guided-weapon systems progress through an
orchestrated sequence of actions from launch to target engagement,
including navigation, target acquisition, target identification and
tracking, target prioritization, and terminal homing to target impact.
This set of actions is often called the "detect to engage" sequence or
the "kill chain." With deployment in increasingly contested operational
settings, including anti-access/aerial denial (A2AD) regions and
degraded communication environments, weapons systems must be able to
execute their missions with limited in-flight communication. Recent
technological advances in sensors, processing hardware, and data
processing, including automated target detection and
[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[enabled weapons]{.mark} systems [to
be]{.mark} more capable, **[more autonomous]{.mark}**, and more precise
[than]{.mark} ever [before]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Who uses Autonomous Engagement?

[Various levels of autonomous engagement capabilities are built into
weapons systems]{.underline} deployed by every major country in the
world, and many smaller countries, even if only for defensive purposes.
Modern weapons systems are computer controlled, so especially
considering today's smaller and smaller digital systems, combat control
systems using autonomous engagement can be on the ground, in the air, at
sea, and basically anywhere a country needs them to be. The bigger
question lies in what levels of sophistication a force's autonomous
engagement system is using. Out-of-date autonomous engagement systems
can make a pilot, a captain, or even an entire fighting force vulnerable
to threats if its sensors cannot detect, identify, and track targets
accurately or quickly enough. Since they are also likely to fire less
accurately, they may not only miss targets, but also may inflict
unintended collateral damage such as on a civilian aircraft or urban
streetscape. With that in mind, dramatic advances in the accuracy of
recent autonomous systems make it inexplicable for countries to not
update their autonomous engagement technologies.

What systems are Autonomous Engagement used on?

[Weapons systems using **[Autonomous Engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}
vary by country, platform, and reach, but
**[[include]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

[Precision-Guided Munitions]{.underline}
(**[[PGMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)

Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS)

Networked Collaborative Weapons

Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPFs)

Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)

Brilliant Anti-Armor Technology (BAT) submunitions

[FMS is a program that allows your government to purchase defense
articles and services as well as design and construction services, from
the U.S. Government (USG)]{.underline}. This program is operated on a
"no-profit" and "no-loss" basis to the USG and requires an authorized
representative from your government to submit a Letter of Request (LOR)
to the USG for the desired defense articles and services.

[Under FMS]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} U.S. Department of Defense
(**[DoD]{.underline}**) [procures defense articles and services for your
country using the same acquisition process used to procure for its own
military needs]{.underline}. This acquisition process is governed by the
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement (DFARS). You, [the foreign purchaser, benefit from
U.S. **DoD technical and operational expertise**, **procurement**
infrastructure, **and purchasing practices**]{.underline}. [Your country
also benefits from the lower unit costs that result when the U.S. DoD is
able to combine your purchase with one of its own to achieve greater
economy of scale]{.underline}. In addition, the U.S. [DoD ensures your
purchase **takes into consideration all of the necessary training,
support, and sustainment to give you the lasting operational capability
you seek**]{.underline}, known as the "Total Package Approach". Finally,
a major FMS program increases your country's interoperability with U.S.
military forces, creating potential opportunities for joint training,
joint exercises, cooperation in humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief, and peacekeeping operations.

[FMS requires]{.underline} a **[government-to-government]{.underline}**
[agreement]{.underline}, known as a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)
and also referred to as an "FMS case". [When your U.S. counterparts
speak of "writing a case", they are talking about drafting an
LOA.]{.underline} The LOA is written by the USG and must be formally
accepted by your government. The LOA specifies the items and services to
be provided to your country and an estimated cost and timeframe for
doing so. [The USG may supply items from its own stocks or it may enter
into a contract with a defense contractor to obtain the items on your
behalf]{.underline}. Any contracts with U.S. defense contractors, if
needed, will be written by the USG using standard USG competitive
contracting procedures, to include robust oversight and auditing. The
contract will be between the USG and the U.S. defense contractor. [The
USG then provides the equipment or service to your country as agreed in
the government-to-government LOA]{.underline}. FMS customers are not
legal participants in the procurement contract.

### 2AC -- AT: DCS CP

#### DCS can't solve [government relations]{.underline} and it gets [struck down]{.underline}.

**DSCA 22** -- The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, as part of the
United States Department of Defense, provides financial and technical
assistance, transfer of defense matériel, training and services to
allies, and promotes military-to-military contacts. ("SECURITY
COOPERATION OVERVIEW," 6-23-2022,

Accessed 6-25-2022, LASA-SC) \*\*date accessed through
https://httpstatus.io/

[DCS involves]{.underline} **[commercial contracts]{.underline}**
[negotiated directly between your country and a U.S. defense
contractor]{.underline}. [DCS agreements are]{.underline} **[not
administered]{.underline}** [by the USG and do not involve a
government-to-government agreement.]{.underline} Instead, you deal with
the U.S. contractor and that contractor is responsible for obtaining an
export license from the Office of Defense Trade Controls, within the
U.S. Department of State, to conduct each sale. The regulations for DCS
are contained in the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR).

DCS is sometimes selected as an alternative to FMS when: a purchasing
government\'s military requirements are significantly different from
standard U.S. configurations; a purchasing government has a sufficiently
sophisticated procurement staff with experience in defense systems; or
when a purchasing government is seeking to establish a relationship
between a U.S. manufacturer and its own domestic industry.

An extensive comparison of the advantages of FMS and DCS has been
compiled and published by the Defense Institute of Security Cooperation
Studies (DISCS -- formerly known as DISAM) in Chapter 15 of its
textbook, "The Management of Security Cooperation" - also referred to as
"The Green Book".

[The U.S. DoD is **generally neutral as** to whether a sale should be
accomplished using the FMS or the DCS process. However]{.underline}, as
a matter of policy, the USG will not engage a potential FMS case with
your country if you are already engaged in DCS discussions with a U.S.
contractor. Please refer to the DSCA Policy Letter on concurrent FMS and
Commercial Negotiations

[There are times when the DoD **requires that a purchase be accomplished
through the FMS system**. For example, the DoD requires **all U.S.
military training to be obtained through FMS.**]{.underline} The DoD may
also require defense articles to be sold "FMS-only." T[wo common reasons
for this are to ensure the security of **sensitive technologies and the
control of weapons and munitions to prevent
proliferation**]{.underline}. The cognizant U.S. MILDEP (Army, Navy, Air
Force), or the U.S. manufacturer, will tell you whether or not a
particular item is FMS-only.

Accessed 6-25-2022, LASA-SC)

Beyond being a government-to-government process, [FMS differs from DCS
in several **key ways.**]{.underline} [The first is]{.underline} in
**[economy-of-scale buying power.]{.underline}** [When buying through
the U.S. military, a country may be able to leverage a purchase that a
particular Military Service is already buying for its own use to get a
**cheaper unit price** than they would otherwise]{.underline}.
Alternatively, [the country may be able to **pool with the purchase of
another country** that is also working within the FMS
process]{.underline}. This provides benefit to our Military Services and
promotes our ability to build meaningful partner capacity overseas.

Another reason [a country might choose to use FMS is that it may not
have the capability or capacity within its government to effectively
oversee the acquisition]{.underline}, **[so they are paying DoD to do it
for them]{.underline}**. [DoD provides contracting support,
**requirements evaluation, logistics support, and works directly with
the U.S. supplier**]{.underline}. [As the exporting party in a Foreign
Military Sales case is the United States Government, **FMS sales are
exempt from the requirement for export licenses.**]{.underline}

[FMS provides]{.underline} what is called "**[the total
package]{.underline}** approach," [which includes]{.underline} the
aforementioned services as well as **[sustainment, technical support,
training, and software/hardware updates]{.underline}**. [The total
package approach may make an FMS purchase more appear more expensive on
the front end, but the country is receiving much more than a defense
article.]{.underline}

Finally, [there are many countries that appreciate the transparency that
comes with the U.S. system. For them, demonstrating to its public that
the acquisition is free of corruption is a significant selling point of
the FMS system.]{.underline}

In instances where the USG is neutral regarding purchase by FMS or DCS,
SAMM C4.3.6 permits U.S. defense firms to designate a preference that a
sale of their products or services be on a DCS basis. [When a company
receives a request for proposal from a country and prefers a direct
commercial sale, the company may request DSCA issue a DCS preference for
that particular sale.]{.underline} Approved DCS preferences are valid
for one year and are held within security cooperation offices (SCOs) and
at the item-manager level to allow screening of future letters of
request. If the applicable implementing agency (IA) receives a request
from the purchaser for a DCS preference item, the IA notifies the
purchaser of the DCS preference and advises the purchaser to contact the
applicable company directly. Support of a DCS preference is a "best
effort" commitment by the DoD. This means that any failure on the part
of the IA to comply with the DCS preference will not invalidate any
resultant FMS transaction. [Items provided on blanket order lines and
those required in conjunction with a system sale's total package
approach (TPA) do not normally qualify for DCS preference.]{.underline}
[Customers funding a purchase using **Foreign Military
Financing**]{.underline} (FMF) [funds may be **required to purchase by
FMS**.]{.underline} [The Director, DSCA, may also recommend to the DoS
that it **mandate FMS for a specific sale.**]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Hotlines CP

**Hotlines fail**

of Chicago*, April 30^th^, Available Online at
<http://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/cpost/i/docs/Pape_Policy_Memo.pdf>)

[In 1989, [after]{.mark} the [Tiananmen]{.mark} Square
protests]{.underline}, President George [[Bush attempted to contact
Deng]{.mark} Xiaoping via phone]{.underline}. There was no hotline in
place, and [**[the]{.mark}** President's [**call was
unanswered**.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}This incident highlighted
the need for such a hotline to be established. In 1997, President Bill
[[Clinton]{.mark} and]{.underline} President Jiang [Zemin [announced an
agreement to establish a presidential hotline]{.mark}, so that, as
President Clinton said, they "may confer on a moment's notice." In May
19[99]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates accidentally [bombed
the Chinese Embassy]{.mark} in Belgrade]{.underline}. [[Clinton
attempted to contact]{.mark} Chinese President Jiang [Zemin]{.mark}, but
**[the call was not answered]{.mark}**,]{.underline} despite the fact
that their presidential hotline had been made operational in 1998. This
underscores the difficulty in communicating via any hotline in direct
crisis situations. As a further insult to the United States, [President
Jiang spoke directly with Russian President Boris Yeltsin later that day
on the China-Russia hotline. In February [2008]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark} signed a formal
agreement to [establish]{.mark} a new hotline]{.underline}, [called [the
Defense Phone Link]{.mark}]{.underline}, but the agreement was
negotiated and signed following 4 talks between David Sedney, the US
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia, and Chinese defense
ministry official Qian Lihua. [It has only been used four times. The
inadequacies of these hotlines offer key insights into the construction
a new hotline proposal]{.underline}. [[The 2008]{.mark} hotline
[agreement]{.mark} with China [arranges for a call to be routed through
the]{.mark} Zhongnanhai telecommunications
[directorate]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which then chooses to forward the

very [[difficult]{.mark}]{.underline} Secretary of Defense Robert Gates
noted that President Hu was unaware that the PLA was carrying out a test
flight of a new jet fighter in 2011, an action that could easily be
misinterpreted by American foreign policy officials. [The new Chinese
National Security Council attempts to remedy this disconnect in
authority.]{.underline} Moreover, [[the **C**]{.mark}hinese
**[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty [rules dictate that the
**Standing Committee vote** prior to conveying info]{.mark}rmation [to

[difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline} China also has a history of cutting
communication during times of crisis to demonstrate anger.

### 2AC -- AT: Negotiate CP

#### Negotiations fail -- other allies don't want them, Putin says no, and it greenlights further aggression

Wars end. Many, if not most, end with negotiation. That might be what
happens with the war Russia launched against Ukraine on Feb. 24, too,
though one former Moscow regime member **[warn]{.underline}**s
[**against** urging Ukraine to negotiate while]{.underline} President
Vladimir [Putin is still bent on more conquest]{.underline}. "[You
just]{.underline} **[can't make peace now]{.underline}**," Boris
Bondarev, who recently resigned from his mid-level Russian Foreign
Ministry post to protest the war, said in an interview with Puck. "If
[you do, **it will be seen as a Russian victory**]{.underline}." [That
would just encourage the Putin regime to **exploit a cease-fire to
rearm**]{.underline}, [then resume the war]{.underline}, Mr. Bondarev
argued: "**[Only a total and clear defeat that is obvious to everyone
will teach them]{.underline}**."

Mr. Bondarev makes a compelling point. [It would be]{.underline} **[a
disaster]{.underline}** --- both moral and strategic ---
[if]{.underline} Mr. [Putin were invited to]{.underline} talks before
his major war objectives had been thwarted. Clear enough to a junior
practitioner of international affairs, this wisdom seems to escape
ostensibly more seasoned figures. Former U.S. secretary of state Henry
A. Kissinger said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
that Western governments should push Ukraine into talks with Mr. Putin
in the next 60 days, as well as support permanent Ukrainian territorial
concessions, lest the conflict turn into a destabilizing "new war
against Russia itself." Similar thinking seems to be at work in Italy
and Hungary, which are reportedly urging the European Union to advocate
a cease-fire and peace talks at its summit next week. Our colleagues on
the New York Times editorial board have called on President Biden to
counsel Kyiv not to "chase after an illusory 'win.'"

[This remains a]{.underline} **[minority view]{.underline}** [within the
Western alliance, and it should be]{.underline}. As European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen made clear at Davos: "[Ukraine **must win
this war**,]{.underline} a[nd Putin's aggression must be a strategic
failure]{.underline}." [To be sure, **the war is terribly
costly**]{.underline} --- [for the whole world. It must end as soon as
reasonably possible.]{.underline} Ukrainian President Volodymyr
**[Zelensky]{.underline}** has indicated that he [will talk with Mr.
Putin]{.underline} --- as [soon as Russia withdraws to the prewar lines,
under which it held Crimea and a swath of additional
territory.]{.underline} Mr. Zelensky also insists, appropriately, that a
false peace would be worse than useless and that premature talk of a
settlement must not undercut Ukraine's military efforts.

As Mr. Kissinger and others rightly note, [Moscow has **ample means to
escalate the war**]{.underline} --- not [least by using nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Yet what's remarkable about the past three months
of war is how little [appetite Mr. Putin has actually **shown for
confrontation with the West**.]{.underline} [NATO's red lines, public
and private, seem to be holding]{.underline}. [Nor does Mr. Putin show
signs of interest in a deal such as the one Mr. Kissinger seems to
assume he would accept, **as opposed to the outright seizure of all
Ukraine that Mr. Putin has repeatedly openly pursued.**]{.underline}

Backfiring,\" WSJ, 6-17-2022,

Accessed 6-25-2022, LASA-SC)

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia---In a combative speech, Russian President
Vladimir [Putin criticized the West for failing to recognize the rise of
new power blocs]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, [and warned
that its **sanctions on Moscow had backfired, creating a growing
economic crisis in Europe.**]{.underline}

"[The idea was clear: crush the Russian economy violently]{.underline},"
Mr. Putin said at the annual St. Petersburg International Economic
Forum, which Russia pitches as an alternative to the World Economic
Forum in Davos to drum up investment in its economy. "**[They did not
succeed.]{.underline}** [Obviously, that didn't happen."]{.underline}

The Kremlin leader acknowledged that Russia's economy had been buffeted
since the U.S. and Europe introduced sweeping sanctions in response to
its invasion of Ukraine in February. Hundreds of Western companies
suspended operations or withdrew from the Russian market, while
high-level political, religious and business figures were all targeted,
with the goal of isolating Russia from the global financial system. Mr.
Putin noted how inflation had risen to over 16%.

The [sanctions have so far **failed to dent Moscow's war
effort**]{.underline}, [and its economy has been bolstered by a windfall
through the rising value of its energy exports, providing less of an
incentive for Russia to negotiate an end to the conflict]{.underline},
though poverty is spreading and inflation is eroding the spending power
of ordinary Russians. [Mr. Putin said that Europe, in contrast, was
seeing worsening economic distress from what he said were the West's
misguided policies**, warning that the crisis could ultimately lead to
famine in some of the world's poorest countries.**]{.underline}

"European countries have already served a serious blow to their own
economies," he said, pointing to what he said was an increase in food
and fuel prices and the degradation of living standards in Europe.
"Direct losses of the \[European Union\] from sanctions fever could
exceed \$400 billion a year...Eurozone countries aren't conducting any
special military operations and their inflation is high."

The EU has repeatedly dismissed Russia's claims that the West is
responsible for the grain crisis, saying it is Russia that is blockading
Ukraine's ports and has destroyed grain storage sites in Ukraine.
Brussels has also said its choice of economic sanctions has been guided
by the principle that the measure should hurt Russia more than Europe.

Some EU leaders, like Viktor Orban, have echoed Mr. Putin's comments.
[The Hungarian leader, who held up the bloc's oil embargo decision
against Russia for a month, argued that six rounds of EU sanctions on
Russia have imposed **equal pain on the European economy as on
Russia.**]{.underline}

Mr. [Putin]{.underline} also [accused the West of **intentionally**
trying to undermine Russia and that the U.S., having declared victory in
the Cold War]{.underline}, was now proclaiming itself "to be the
messenger of God on Earth" and that its interests are sacred.

"They do not seem to notice that new powerful centers have formed on the
planet," the Russian leader said. "We are talking about revolutionary
changes in the entire system of international relations. These changes
are fundamental and pivotal."

Mr. Putin's remarks were delayed for almost two hours after being struck
by what the Kremlin said was a cyberattack on its accreditation system.
Members of the Russian business community who were attending said
isolation from the West could present opportunities for collaboration
with other former Soviet states, along with countries in the Middle East
and China. Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was present,
while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi and China's President Xi
Jinping addressed the gathering by video link.

Mr. [Xi told the plenary that **cooperation between China and Russia was
growing**, and that trade between the two countries in the first five
months of the year had passed \$65 billion]{.underline}. By the end of
the year, Mr. Xi said, trade between the two countries would hit new
records, demonstrating the resilience of ties between Beijing and
Moscow.

Earlier in the week, the [Chinese leader again offered his support for
Moscow's security concerns in his second phone call with Mr. Putin since
the invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

Mr. Putin was speaking a day after the leaders of France, Germany, Italy
and Romania met with Ukrainian President

### 2AC -- AT: Humiliation DA

#### Even if it's unintended, allowing the Ukraine War to rage on risks WWIII the longer it continues

**Powell 22** -- Alvin Powell is a Harvard Staff Writer. (Alvin Powell,
\"What does Russia really want?\" Harvard Gazette, 2-24-2022,

[With Russian troops in]{.underline} **[full-scale assault against
Ukraine]{.underline}**, a [key step for the U.S. and its NATO allies
should be]{.underline} tripling combat-ready troops in the [**Baltics**
and **NATO-allied eastern Europe to deter any thought of a Ukraine-style
incursion there**]{.underline}.

Retired Brigadier Gen. Kevin Ryan, a senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer
Center for Science and International Affairs, said even though it is
unlikely that Russia would invade Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, their
NATO membership, [Lithuania's borders with Russia-friendly Belarus, and
Estonia and Latvia's with Russia **raise the stakes of a broader
conflict**]{.underline}. He said concrete [steps to deter]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin should be taken.]{.underline}

Ryan and other Russia experts at Harvard say that [it's difficult to
predict **exactly what Putin's next move will be**]{.underline}. But it
seems likely that he will avoid taking on NATO directly as that could
lead to a nuclear standoff, and so will avoid member states. [Much will
depend, however, on how much resistance he meets in Ukraine **and how
unified NATO remains through the crisis.**]{.underline}

"[Putin is not about messaging as much as he is about doing something,
and we should focus more on deeds than words]{.underline}," Ryan said.
"It sends a message to Putin if we increase troop presence in the
Baltics and Poland and so on. But more than that[, the important thing
would be to have]{.underline} those troops be combat-ready, have
[ammunition in a storage site nearby, have them be integrated into war
plans and the defenses of those NATO countries]{.underline}. So, they're
not going to visit schoolchildren and have training on the weekends,
they're going there to be a valid reinforcement to the defenses that are
already there."

For the short term, however, the experts agreed, [Russia **is going to
have its hands full with Ukraine**]{.underline}. [Russia's larger and
far superior military would likely overwhelm Ukraine's in head-to-head
combat, but it seems likely the Ukrainians will continue to offer armed
resistanc]{.underline}e. Beyond that, [it's still unclear what Putin's
ultimate objectives are.]{.underline} Does he want to carve out
territory, like the Russian-speaking eastern regions, which border
Russia? He has said that he has no plans to occupy Ukraine, but will he
at least try to install a Russia-friendly government?

"[Ukrainians are doing the best that they can]{.underline}, **[but you
can't stop the larger, better-equipped, probably better-trained Russian
army moving in on three sides from basically getting to its
objective]{.underline}**," said Alexandra Vacroux, executive director of
Harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. "[But what are
they going to do after that? We can say that there's no way the
Ukrainian army can stop them, but we can also say that there's no way an
army of even 200,000 Russian troops is going to be able to hold a
country of 43 million people]{.underline}."

The large cities may prove a particular problem, Vacroux said.

"The Russians learned in Chechnya the same lesson that we learned in
Mosul, which is it's extremely difficult to hold cities," Vacroux said.
"It's gruesome and bloody and requires a huge amount of human force. I
just don't see the 'day after' strategy, from the Russian point of
view."

Experts said in the days and weeks to come, they'd be looking for things
like how much of a fight the Ukrainian army puts up and whether they can
drag the battle out and increase the Russian body count. Can the
Russians take the capital of Kiev, and, if so, what happens there, both
to the city itself and to the government?

Another key is the final package of sanctions from Western nations that
get passed and their effect on Russia. And how well do NATO nations
opposing Putin hang together? Putin, Vacroux said, has long said that
the West has become weak and fractured.

"In many ways, the administration learned the lessons of the mistakes we
made after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, where we impose some sanctions
and nothing much happened," Vacroux said. "The [Russians concluded that
they could basically do this again if they wanted. The West wasn't going
to be spending money and personnel and materiel defending
Ukraine."]{.underline}

Vacroux said releasing intelligence about Russia's moves and motives,
which Russia first denied and then confirmed once they were executed,
removed the element of surprise and seemed to unsettle Putin. She said
she was stunned how much events unspooled as predicted.

"[Even if you're expecting something, **you can still be surprised by
it**,"]{.underline} Vacroux said. "I [think we're all surprised at how
overwhelming the Russian invasion has been. It's a little bit like
watching a car crash happen. You can't do anything to stop it, and you
still feel terrible watching it happen]{.underline}."

Experts said it is **[too early]{.underline}** [to know Putin's
long-range plans, but if he has designs on other nations, Moldova, which
borders Ukraine to the west, and Georgia, which once also flirted with
NATO membership, are possible targets]{.underline}. Most other countries
that might otherwise be candidates --- Poland and the Baltics --- are
already NATO members.

"[If he threatens those countries]{.underline}, **[he's threatening
NATO, and he's declaring World War III]{.underline}**," said Thomas
Nichols, University Professor at the U.S. Naval War College and an
instructor at Harvard Extension School. "As reckless as Putin has
become, he's not that reckless."

That said, [once shooting starts]{.underline}, [the threat of the crisis
escalating into nuclear war, while remote, nonetheless
**exists**]{.underline}. [Both the U.S. and Russia have a history of
signaling with their nuclear-capable forces, as Putin did in the days
leading up to the invasion by conducting nuclear force
drills]{.underline}. The message, Nichols said, was don't send NATO
forces into Ukraine, or Russia, for that matter.

Though the U.S. has the more powerful military overall, Nichols said
it's something like comparing apples and oranges, since the Russian
military is a large, mostly land-based force, while the U.S. military is
designed to project force far from home. [The danger of a nuclear war
between the two nations --- Russian nukes could obliterate the Northern
Hemisphere if it came to that --- almost makes the differences in their
conventional forces beside the point.]{.underline}

Historically, [experts said there are similar examples of heading to the
brink from the past]{.underline}: the Yom Kippur War of 1973, when it
was the U.S. that ran nuclear drills to keep the Soviet Union from
intervening in the Middle East; the **[Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.underline}**, which [this conflict, from a nuclear
confrontation standpoint, doesn't yet approach; even the Korean War,
which began when Stalin gave the North Koreans permission to try to take
the whole country]{.underline}. It was only a few years ago when Turkey
shot down a Russian jet over the Syrian border, which both countries
decided not to escalate. Nichols asked: **[What happens
now]{.underline}**, [however]{.underline}, [amid heightened tensions, if
**Russia shoots down a German or Dutch jet on Ukraine's
border?**]{.underline}

"We're not there yet," Nichols said of comparisons to the Cuban Missile
Crisis. "But I also admit to having kind of a pit, a lump in my stomach.
[We're talking about the biggest war in Europe since World War II and
anytime you put this many troops in motion, bad things, unintended
things can happen. That's what really worries me, **is that this becomes
a bigger crisis by accident.**]{.underline}"

Russian President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** [offered his

speech littered with contrived grievances and a self-serving perversion
of history. [Putin's address can only be characterized as **unhinged and
reminiscent of the worst Soviet-era propaganda**]{.underline} in which
white is black and the aggressor is a victim. He proclaimed the
independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, regions in eastern Ukraine held by
Kremlin-backed rebels. He negated Ukraine's sovereignty, culture, and
identity.

Then on Thursday, announcing the start of the invasion, he described
Ukraine's government as an illegitimate junta and the country's turn
away from Moscow since the Maidan square protests of 2014 as the outcome
of a coup orchestrated by the West. If the world wasn't staring at a
great tragedy, Putin's bizarre tone and awkward efforts to project
(forced) consensus through a televised meeting of the country's security
council would have been stunning political theater.

opinion]{.underline}. Apart from the severe tremors already being felt
across energy and financial markets and in international trade, Western
Europe should brace itself for an inevitable rush of refugees.

For the most part, [concerns about Moscow's intentions]{.underline}
(that are now confirmed) [have until now **fallen** on deaf ears in
Southern Europe, where Russia has traditionally enjoyed
empathy]{.underline}. Without a history of direct confrontation with
Russia, it has been easy for the region to hold onto romantic notions.
This, despite a series of close historical parallels to the current
crisis: the July Crisis of 1914 that led to World War I, Hitler's
occupation of the Sudetenland, the spheres of influence created by the
Yalta Conference, the Cold War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

[Most analyses of Russia's behavior focus exclusively on Putin---what he
thinks or wants, his temperament and personality. What's missing is a
more profound assessment of broader Russian society that decodes the
social contract between citizens and the country's autocratic
leadership.]{.underline} Regardless of whether they agree with Putin's
description of the collapse of the Soviet Union as "the greatest
geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century," [Russians **share a
nostalgia for their nation's past greatness and global
power.**]{.underline}

So we must recognize the alternative reality that has come to
characterize a significant percentage of Russian society, from its
litany of grievances to the twisted perspective on historic events that
guides Moscow's willingness to disregard international law. It's a
feeling of being slighted that goes back all the way to Catherine the
Great. As evidence, Russians point to the "inadequate" recognition of
their role in defeating Nazi Germany. More [recently, Russians often
blame the country's economic chaos of the 1990s to the West's
determination to "bring Moscow to its knees."]{.underline} These views
are, of course, not unanimous, and there is evidence of opposition to
the current conflict---as seen in the antiwar protests that reportedly
led to nearly 1,400 arrests across Russia on Thursday.

But this biased---when not totally false---retelling of history now has
a foreign audience too, as Russia adeptly leverages tools like its gas
and the bot armies that we see marching through social networks beyond
its borders. Russia Today (RT), the country's key, government-sponsored
foreign (televised) weapon, is central to those goals, and its
importance is unlikely to diminish as the Kremlin seeks to consolidate
its malicious presence in other theaters, such as Africa and Latin
America. [Russia's diplomatic advances in countries like **Nicaragua,
Venezuela, Cuba, Brazil, and Argentina**---many of which have had
complicated relations with the United States and, consequently, are
particularly susceptible---has allowed it to embed military technical
advisors there.]{.underline}

As for cyber warfare, the United States has long been worried about
attacks on its critical infrastructure: US President Joe Biden and Putin
even held a bilateral summit including discussions on this subject last
June. We in Europe should take note. The virtual world bears the imprint
of our free societies and holds the potential to empower people.
However, it can also serve as the West's Achilles' heel. Too often, our
cyber defense is woefully inadequate. Individual countries and the
European Union (EU) need to shore up the security of companies and other
organizations---especially those involved with critical infrastructure.
The cyber defense of NATO---and of the West in general---is also
paramount.

[The Kremlin routinely cites the Iraq War and NATO's intervention in
Kosovo to counter questions about its violations of international
law]{.underline}. Even though there's no legitimate comparison between
Kosovo and the Donbas (and Putin's claims of a genocide in Donetsk and
Luhansk are fabricated), "whataboutism" continues to define Russia's
official narrative and shape public opinion.

[Amid what threatens to become an extended conflict in Ukraine, the West
must be clear-eyed about its approach to Russi]{.underline}a. [Putin has
attacked the **very foundations of the European security order with an
intent to demolish it.**]{.underline} He [aims to recreate a sphere of
influence by turning Ukraine and Belarus into buffer
states]{.underline}. [There's a **real risk** that the **Baltic
states**]{.underline}, [which are members of both NATO and the EU, could
also get pulled into this crisis]{.underline}. We would be mistaken to
follow in British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's footsteps of
appeasement from the 1930s, hoping that Putin's ambition is limited to
Europe. Ultimately, it is the international liberal order and its norms
that he is after.

With recent attempts to constructively engage with Moscow failing, [the
West's priority should be to strengthen **its deterrence and defense**,
while building its resilience. **It's going to be needed.**]{.underline}

#### Ukraine loses now but the aff solves it

**DePetris 22** -- Daniel DePetris is a foreign affairs columnist for
Newsweek and a fellow at Defense Priorities, a thinktank that advocates
for restraint in foreign interventions. (\"The war in Ukraine has
entered a new, and more difficult, phase,\" 6-23-2022,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/23/the-war-in-ukraine-has-entered-a-new-and-more-difficult-phase,
Accessed 6-24-2022, LASA-SC)

Wars are a series of twists and turns. [Momentum can shift and **quickly
alter fortunes on the battlefield**]{.underline}, [and intangible
elements like leadership and motivation can shred the assessments of the
most seasoned military analysts.]{.underline} Military campaigns that
look promising initially can, over time, turn into quagmire, as mistakes
accumulate, terrain changes and the adversary alters its tactics. The
war in Ukraine is a textbook case in point.

[During the war's first two months]{.underline}, the
[Ukrain]{.underline}ian army [proved to be formidable, courageous and
highly innovative against a better-armed Russian foe, which military
experts had almost unanimously expected would prevail.]{.underline} A
day after Russia's invasion began, the US intelligence community was
concerned that Russian forces would capture Kyiv in a matter of days.
[Vladimir Putin probably assumed a quick and relatively painless
operation.]{.underline}

[As it turned out, the Russian army, which had not conducted a major
ground invasion since the calamitous war in Afghanistan four decades
ago, **resembled a disorganized horde of amateurs**. Supply lines,
stretched to the breaking point, doomed Russia's attempt to overrun
Kyiv]{.underline}; miles-wide Russian armored columns were stalled on
the road, empty of fuel. [There were reports of low morale, unforced
surrenders, even desertion in the Russian ranks.]{.underline}
**[Ukrainian troops, by contrast, proved to be fierce, committed
fighters who deftly used the urban terrain to ambush Russian tanks,
turning them into burnt-out husks.]{.underline}** As many as 15,000
Russian soldiers may have been killed in the first month of the war.

Yet not only have the Russians persisted despite embarrassing defeats,
they've adapted to these setbacks. While some commentators suggested
that Russia's withdrawal from the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy
regions in early April illustrated the systemic weaknesses of the
Russian army, [those retreats turned out to be just another phase in the
war -- one that has turned out to be far less favorable, and much more
brutal, to the Ukrainians.]{.underline}

Since the slow, grueling and methodical Russian capture of Mariupol in
May, [the war's momentum has, unevenly and incrementally, shifted **in
Russia's favor.**]{.underline} While Russian forces continue to sustain
severe casualties and losses of equipment, including more than 760 tanks
and 185 artillery pieces, unrelenting Russian artillery fire is
gradually grinding down Ukrainian forces and reportedly even eroding
morale.

How has Russia learned from its errors in the initial stage of the war?
[First, instead of trying to attack all of Ukraine from multiple angles,
a gambit that strained supply lines and left troops exposed to attacks
from the rear, it has focused its campaign on Ukraine's east, using
long-range artillery, air and missile strikes on a massive scale against
a smaller range of targets.]{.underline} The Russians have also been
willing to destroy large parts of towns in order to seize or surround
them. The agile urban fighting that the Ukrainian army excelled at is
minimized in the Donbas, whose relatively flat terrain favors armored
warfare, airpower and missiles. These weapons, as well as the ratio of
soldiers there, favor Russia by a wide margin.

In Sievierodonetsk, [Russian tactics]{.underline} -- which often destroy
entire urban districts before sending in ground troops -- [have
presented Ukrainian commanders with a conundrum: retreat and live to
fight another day, or stand their ground and possibly see some of their
best troops killed or captured]{.underline}. The outlook for Ukraine in
Sievierodonetsk looks grim at best and preordained at worst. About 70%
of the city is now under Russian control, and US defense officials
assess that Russia could take all of Luhansk within weeks.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his advisers seem to believe that with enough
time, heavy weaponry, economic aid and political commitment from
Ukraine's western partners, its army can turn the tide and nullify the
Russian military's recent gains. While Kyiv insists that diplomacy is
the only way the war can end, Zelenskiy himself has declared that any
peace talks with Moscow will have to wait until after Russian forces
withdraw to pre-24 February lines.

Yet at a time when Russia has captured as much as a fifth of Ukraine's
territory, Zelenskiy's stance may become less and less tenable. Russian
forces will not voluntarily vacate territory they have captured at such
great cost simply to begin a negotiation on ending the war, not least
because Putin now sees the momentum favoring his forces. In fact, the
Kremlin seems to be digging in for a long-term presence. In parts of
Russian-occupied territory, like the Kherson oblast, rumors of a
referendum incorporating the area into Russia are prevalent. In the
cities of Kherson and Melitopol, Russian passports are being handed out
to residents, hardly a sign that Russia is thinking about pulling out.

[If Russian troops hunker down behind heavily fortified lines and Putin,
in an effort to sow disunity among Ukraine's western backers, declares
an end to his "special military operation", Ukrainian forces will face
the much harder task of evicting Russian troops from territories in
which they are well ensconced.]{.underline}

To do that, [Ukraine will require the sorts of weapons **it lacks in
significant numbers**]{.underline}. [Ukraine's military will, in short,
have to build up the capacity for a large-scale offensive]{.underline}
-- and at a time when it is losing many of its most battle-tested
soldiers. As many as 200 Ukrainian troops are dying in combat every day
-- that's 6,000 a month. [These casualty numbers would be difficult to
sustain for any army, let alone one engaged in a high-intensity, bloody
war of attrition against a foe with an advantage in
firepower.]{.underline}

Ukraine must also reckon with the prospect that Putin will respond to
its efforts to claw back lost land with air and missile attacks intended
to add to the colossal economic damage Ukraine has already sustained --
as much as \$600bn and, as early as March, \$100bn in damaged or
destroyed infrastructure alone, according to the UN.

[Ukraine's military success is **inextricably linked to continued US and
European arms shipments.**]{.underline} Washington alone has sent more
than \$5bn in military equipment to Kyiv since the war began and is on
track to ship four Himars long-range rocket systems, 15,000 artillery
shells, 1,00 more Javelin anti-tank missiles and five counter-battery
radars as part of the latest tranche of weaponry.

[But the longer the war proceeds, the greater the likelihood the west
will lose some of its unity against Russia, especially as soaring energy
prices, rising inflation, and worries about a recession lead western
politicians to focus on the home front]{.underline}. Even today, there
is some dissension in the west about what the objectives in Ukraine
should be. In contrast to the leaders of the Baltic states, Poland, and
the United Kingdom, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German
chancellor, Olaf Scholz, are not committed to ensuring that Russia is
defeated militarily, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has
proposed a peace framework, with an immediate ceasefire at the top of
the agenda.

[Will this divide, deepened by Ukraine fatigue, grow as the war
proceeds, Ukraine's victories become fewer and less frequent, and the
economies of Europe and the United States face increasing economic
headwinds?]{.underline} None of this is foreordained. [But **it would be
foolish not to recognize that the war in Ukraine has entered a new, more
difficult phase**]{.underline} -- [not just because of events on the
battlefield but also due to economic and political trends in countries
that have been Ukraine's biggest supporters.]{.underline}

#### Letting Ukraine lose will NOT solve Russia

**Stanovaya 22** -- Tatiana Stanovaya is a nonresident scholar at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. (Tatiana Stanovaya, \"What
The West (Still) Gets Wrong About Putin,\" Foreign Policy, 6-1-2022,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/01/putin-war-ukraine-west-misconceptions/,
Accessed 6-24-2022, LASA-SC)

[Imagine a situation where Ukraine accepts most of Russia's
demands]{.underline}: It recognizes Crimea as Russian and the Donbas as
independent, commits to a slimmed-down army, and promises to never join
NATO. **[Will that end the conflict?]{.underline}** [Even if, to many,
the answer appears to be an obvious "yes," **they are
incorrect.**]{.underline} [Russia may be locked in a battle with
Ukraine, but geopolitically, it sees itself as waging war against the
West on Ukrainian territory]{.underline}. In the Kremlin, [Ukraine is
seen as an anti-Russian weapon in Western hands]{.underline}---and
[destroying it **will not** automatically]{.underline} [lead to Russia's
victory in this anti-Western geopolitical game.]{.underline} For Putin,
[this war is **not** between Russia and Ukraine]{.underline}---and
Ukrainian leadership is not an independent actor but a Western tool that
must be neutralized.

So, [whatever concessions Ukraine could make]{.underline} (regardless of
how politically realistic they may be), [Putin will]{.underline}
continue **[escalat]{.underline}**ing the war [until the West changes
its approach to the so-called Russian problem and admits
that]{.underline}---as Putin sees it---the [roots of Russian aggression
are the result of Washington ignoring Russian geopolitical
concern]{.underline}s for 30 years. This has been Putin's real objective
for a long time, and it remains unchanged. [Unrealistic Russian demands
rejected by Kyiv are even a way for the Kremlin to increase the stakes
in a Russia-West confrontation, testing the West's ability to stay
united and consistent]{.underline}. The West today is looking at the
problem in the wrong light[: In seeking to stop Russia's war, it focuses
on Moscow's artificial pretexts for its invasion of Ukraine and
overlooks Putin's obsession with the so-called Western threat as well as
his readiness to use escalation to coerce the West into a dialogue on
Russian terms]{.underline}. **[Ukraine is only a hostage.]{.underline}**

#### Backing down enables [more]{.underline} Russian aggression NOT the other way around -- endless war

**Applebaum 22** -- Anne Applebaum is a staff writer at The Atlantic.
(Anne Applebaum, \"The War Won't End Until Putin Loses,\" Atlantic,

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/why-ukraine-must-defeat-putin-russia/629940/,
Accessed 6-24-2022, LASA-SC)

The third assumption is that this [Ukrainian government]{.underline}, or
any Ukrainian government, is politically able to [swap territory for
peace]{.underline}. [To do so would be to **reward Russia for
invading**]{.underline}, [and to accept that Russia has the right to
kidnap leaders, murder civilians, rape women, and deport anybody it
chooses from Ukrainian territory.]{.underline} What Ukrainian president
or prime minister can agree to that deal and expect to stay in office?
[Russian cruelty also means that any territory that is temporarily ceded
will, sooner or later, **become the source of an
insurgency**]{.underline}, [because no Ukrainian population can promise
to endure that kind of torture indefinitely]{.underline}. Already,
guerrillas in the city of Melitopol, occupied since the first days of
the war, claim to have killed several Russian officers and carried out
acts of sabotage. [An underground is emerging in occupied Kherson and
will appear in other places too]{.underline}. [To concede territory for
a deal now **will simply set up another conflict later
on**]{.underline}. [The end of one kind of violence will lead to other
kinds of violence.]{.underline}

This does not mean that the war can or should go on forever, or that
diplomacy has no place at all. Nor does it mean that Americans and
Europeans should be blind to the real challenges that a long conflict
will pose to Ukraine. [The Western coalition backing Kyiv could
certainly fray; the wave of adrenaline that has so far propelled the
Ukrainian army and leadership could crash]{.underline}. Ukraine's
economy could grow worse, making the fight much harder or even
impossible to sustain.

But even so, off[-ramp remains the wrong metaphor and the wrong
goal.]{.underline} [The West **should not aim to offer Putin an
off-ramp**]{.underline}; [our goal, our endgame, **should be
defeat**]{.underline}. In fact, [the only solution that offers some hope
of long-term stability in Europe is rapid defeat]{.underline}, or even,
to borrow Macron's phrase, humiliation. In truth, the [Russian president
not only has to stop fighting the war; he has to conclude **that the war
was a terrible mistake**, one that can never be repeated]{.underline}.
More to the point, the people around him---leaders of the army, the
security services, the business community---have to conclude exactly the
same thing. The Russian public must eventually come to agree too.

[Defeat could take several forms]{.underline}. **[It might be
military:]{.underline}** [The White House should now increase not just
the level but the speed of its assistance to Ukraine; it should provide
the long-range weapons needed to take back occupied territory and
perhaps also assistance with quicker distribution of those
weapons.]{.underline} Defeat could be economic, taking the form of a
temporary gas-and-oil embargo that finally cuts Russia off from the
source of its income, lasting at least until the war ends. Defeat could
involve the creation of a new security architecture, one based on new
kinds of security guarantees for Ukraine, or even some type of NATO
membership for Ukraine. [Whatever form that takes, it has to be
substantially different from the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which
Ukraine was offered security "assurances" that meant nothing at
all.]{.underline}

Defeat could also include broader sanctions, not just on a few select
billionaires but on the entire Russian political class. The
Anti-Corruption Foundation led by the jailed Russian dissident Alexei
Navalny has drawn up a list of 6,000 "bribe-takers and
warmongers"---that is, politicians and bureaucrats who have enabled the
war and the regime. The European Parliament has already called for
sanctions on that group. If others follow, maybe some in the ruling
elite will finally be persuaded to start looking for new jobs, or at
least start talking about how to make changes.

Although saying so is considered undiplomatic, the [American
administration clearly knows that the defeat, sidelining, or removal of
Putin is the only outcome that offers any long-term stability in Ukraine
and the rest of Europe]{.underline}. "**[Putin]{.underline}**," said Joe
Biden in March, "**[cannot remain in power."]{.underline}** In April,
Lloyd Austin said that he hoped "to see Russia weakened to the degree it
can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine." Both
of these statements by the American president and his defense secretary
were treated as gaffes or as policy mistakes---thoughtless remarks that
might irritate the Russians. In truth, they were half-articulated
acknowledgments of an ugly reality that no one wants to confront: Any
[cease-fire that allows Putin to experience any kind of victory will be
inherently unstable, **because it will encourage him to try
again**]{.underline}. [Victory in Crimea did not satisfy the Kremlin.
Victory in Kherson **will not satisfy the Kremlin either.**]{.underline}

I understand those who fear that, [confronted with an impending loss,
Putin will seek to use chemical or nuclear weapons]{.underline}; **[I
worried the same]{.underline}** [at the start of the war]{.underline}.
But the [retreats from Kyiv]{.underline} and Kharkiv [indicate that
Putin is **not irrational after all**.]{.underline} [He understands
perfectly well that NATO is a defensive alliance, because he has
accepted the **Swedish and Finnish applications without
quibbling**]{.underline}. His generals make calculations and weigh
costs. They were [perfectly capable of understanding that the price of
Russia's early advances was too high]{.underline}. The price of using
tactical nuclear weapons would be far higher: They would achieve no
military impact but would destroy all of Russia's remaining
relationships with India, China, and the rest of the world. There is no
indication right now that the nuclear threats so frequently mentioned by
Russian propagandists, going back many years, are real.

By contrast, [a true defeat could force the reckoning that should have
happened in the 1990s, the moment when the Soviet Union broke
up]{.underline} but Russia retained all of the trappings and baubles of
the Soviet empire---its UN seat, embassies, diplomatic service---at the
expense of the other ex-Soviet republics. The year 1991 was the moment
when Russians should have realized the folly of Moscow's imperial
overreach, when they should have figured out why so many of their
neighbors hate and fear them. But the Russian public learned no such
lesson. Within a decade, Putin, brimming with grievances, had convinced
many of them that the West and the rest of the world owed them
something, and that further conquests were justified.

[Military loss could create a real opening for national self-examination
or for a major change, as it so often has done in Russia's
past]{.underline}. [Only failure can persuade the Russians themselves to
question the sense and purpose of a colonial ideology that has
repeatedly impoverished and ruined their own economy and society, as
well as those of their neighbors, for decades]{.underline}. Yet
**[another frozen conflict]{.underline}**, [yet another temporary
holding pattern, yet another face-saving compromise will not end the
pattern of Russian aggression or bring permanent peace.]{.underline}

#### Status quo is enabling further Russian expansion

**Zagorodnyuk 22** -- Andriy Zagorodnyuk is a former Ukrainian defence

Accessed 6-24-2022, LASA-SC)

[Many armed conflicts do end with a compromise]{.underline}, [but it
would be **illogical** to assume **all of them should**]{.underline}.
The [only reason for this invasion was **Putin's obsession with
subjugating Ukraine**]{.underline}. [What compromise is possible when
your adversary's goal is that you should not exist?]{.underline} The
unspeakably brutal way in which Russians treat our occupied towns and
villages is known throughout the world. True peace can only be secured
when the invader leaves our country.

As the old saying has it, the night is darkest just before the dawn.
[Russia is now applying **maximum available force**]{.underline}, but
the evidence of 1960s tanks being dusted off for battle, use of
conscripts and the patching up of new military units without collective
training demonstrate that it has exhausted its options. That is why
Russia is pushing the idea of a compromise. [It needs a pause to show
gains to the Russian public and to give itself time to recover before
moving on further with its attempt to subjugate Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Ukraine's forces **are more efficient than Russia's**.]{.underline}
[With **more equipment and ammunition**, pushing]{.underline} [Russia
back and out of the country **is a realistic prospect**]{.underline}.
[The flow of western help is only beginning and will
increase.]{.underline} Putin's desperate attempts to intercept the
supplies from the west by bombing rail lines and fuel depots are
strikingly similar to Hitler's attempts to attack allied convoys in the
Atlantic. [But they are failing to affect the overall situation, and
equipment is successfully getting to the frontline]{.underline}. US
weapons from the unprecedented \$40bn aid package, which we expect will
include much-needed multiple rocket launch systems, will start arriving
soon.

[The free world **has decided to stop accepting Russia's bullying
behaviour**]{.underline}, [but it must be consistent in its application
of that approach]{.underline}. For many years, [western leaders
**tolerated Russian aggression**]{.underline}: [invading]{.underline}
**[Georgia]{.underline}**; [invading]{.underline}
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**; occupying Crimea; [occupying]{.underline}
**[the Black Sea]{.underline}**; [carrying out targeted **assassinations
in the UK**]{.underline}; [carrying out cyber-attacks]{.underline};
a[llegedly meddling with elections; abusing human rights]{.underline}.
Every time it was said: "It is Russia. It has always been like that."

[Ukraine must negotiate **from a position of strength**. But the world's
attention is fading]{.underline}

[It is time to **stop accepting such injustices**]{.underline}. How
often have people been told to tolerate something because "it has always
been like this"? Racial discrimination, sexual abuse, domestic violence,
corruption, social inequality and organised crime have been endemic in
societies. [The only time things]{.underline} [have changed is when
people have challenged the old ways and refused to accept them any
more.]{.underline}

#### Russia is a revisionist power using NATO as an excuse for expansion

**Chupryna 22** -- Oleg Chupryna is PhD student at the Centre for
European and Eurasian Studies. (Oleg Chupryna, \"The Truth behind the
Myth of Russia 'Threatened' by NATO,\" Balkan Insight, 4-1-2022,

Accessed 6-24-2022, LASA-SC)

So [what's the **real reason**]{.underline} [for Russia's aggressive
**anti-Western politics**]{.underline}?

It sits in plain view, if one takes the time to read the speeches,
interviews or articles of Putin and other public figures in Russia.

[Russia's revanchist rhetoric takes in not just the former Soviet
Union's subjects but those of the Tsarist Russian empire
too]{.underline}; It seeks to drag into Russia's sphere of dominance
Central and Eastern Europe and Finland too, while weakening or breaking
up the EU and NATO.

In this context, [one must not forget the **centuries of Russian
expansion**]{.underline}, [starting when the tiny Duchy of Moskovy
devoured lands around it to become an enormous empire that at its height
occupied a fifth part of the planet's dry land.]{.underline}

It is also worth remembering [that the **Kremlin's actions speak louder
than its words**.]{.underline}

[Ukraine is **not the first** of Russia's neighbours to be
invaded]{.underline}. The [Kremlin has repeatedly demonstrated its
neo-imperialists intentions]{.underline} since the early 1990s, whether
directly, as it in the cases of **[Transnistria]{.underline}** [in the
1990s]{.underline}, **[Georgia]{.underline}** [in 2008 and]{.underline}
**[Crimea]{.underline}** [in 2014,]{.underline} or indirectly such as in
[**Abkhazia** and]{.underline} **[South Ossetia]{.underline}** [in the
1990s]{.underline} [and Ukraine's **Donbas**]{.underline} [since
2014.]{.underline}

In Ukraine, [Russia is committing atrocities similar to those it
perpetrated in the 1990s in Chechnya]{.underline} -- wide-scale,
[indiscriminate bombing of residential areas in Ukraine's predominantly
Russian-speaking cities of **Mariupol, Kharkiv and others**]{.underline}
and the torture, rape, and mass murder of hundreds of Ukrainian
civilians again reveal the true nature of the contemporary Russian
regime and society.

This [alone and without doubt debunks all of Russia's false allegations
regarding NATO's alleged threat to its security]{.underline}. Russia
itself remains an 'evil empire'. [Constantly threatening to use weapons
of mass destruction, it remains a deadly threat to its neighbours, to
freedom, and to the whole of humanity]{.underline}.

#### Ukraine is the [tip of the iceberg]{.underline} -- Russia is on something

**Kapetas 22** -- Anastasia Kapetas is the National Security Editor at
The Strategist. (Anastasia Kapetas, \"Why Putin might be pleased with

Accessed 6-24-2022, LASA-SC)

As we reflect on the 100-day mark of the Russo-Ukrainian war and what
we've learned, we need to understand that [the West has **fundamentally
misunderstood Russia**]{.underline} [and continues to do
so]{.underline}, argues Kyle Wilson, visiting fellow at the Centre for
European Studies and former Australian diplomat who had postings in
Russia, China and Poland.

This is why many in the commentariat are failing to appreciate that
Russian President Vladimir [Putin is **probably happy with how his
invasion of Ukraine is turning out**]{.underline}, he says.

The [Western foreign policy community has assumed for a long time that
Russia under Putin had similar notions of what it means to be a world
power]{.underline}, had more or less accepted the rules of the
post--World War II international order, and was moving---albeit with
setbacks---on a similar neo-liberal economic trajectory.

But, argues Wilson, [something]{.underline} **[completely
different]{.underline}** [has been going on in Putin's
mind]{.underline}. [He has only]{.underline} been **[marginally
interested]{.underline}** [in building stability]{.underline} [and
prosperity as the West would understand it.]{.underline} Rather,
[his]{.underline} **[entire project]{.underline}** [has been about
building Russia's ability to be a **coercive, expansionist and
undeniably great power**]{.underline}, [with control concentrated in the
hands of one person.]{.underline}

The Russian translation of 'great power' is velikaya derzhava, the
second part of which is a cognate of a verb that means to seize or to
hold, and [Putin's worldview represents a continuum of Russia's imperial
mythos.]{.underline}

Wilson points to the work of historian Stephen Kotkin, who has
calculated that, over a period of about 450 years, Russia expanded
outwards at a rate of 100 to 150 square kilometres a day, in the process
engulfing 184 different nationalities or ethnic groups.

[And]{.underline} **[that expansion continues]{.underline}**, Wilson
says: [Russia now claims roughly half of the Arctic]{.underline}.

This imperial worldview has always been in evidence, he says.

For example, in [2005]{.underline}, [Putin]{.underline} established a
commission to [rewrite Russian history textbooks]{.underline}. 'It
produced a textbook for history teachers. In that book was the
remarkable paragraph that said most of the Russian politically conscious
class rejects the present boundaries of the Russian Federation. They are
inadequate to protect Russia's security.'

Then, in [2008]{.underline}, [Putin invaded **Georgia** and seized
territory]{.underline}. And the Russians continue to 'gradually move
their barbed wire further and further into Georgia,' says Wilson.

Six years later, in [2014]{.underline}, [Putin invaded **Ukraine** for
the first]{.underline} time, and Russian forces shot down a Malaysian
commercial passenger jet, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, in the process.

'Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who was then the secretary-general of NATO, goes
to Moscow, and says to Mr Putin, "I've come with a package of proposals
to reform Russian NATO relations." [And Putin says to him on
camera]{.underline}, "I [don't want to reform Russian NATO relations.
**I want NATO abolished**]{.underline}."'

Also in that year, Wilson notes, a senior Russian official came to
Chatham House in London. The official said, '[Putin is not so silly as
to think that he can recreate the Soviet Union, but there is a core of
the former Soviet Union that is properly ours---Belarus, Ukraine and
northern Kazakhstan. And it would be nice to have it back.]{.underline}'

In 2018, Putin unveiled what Wilson describes as a 'rather frightening
array of new doomsday weapons, including a nuclear-armed torpedo that
says, "[You didn't listen to us. **Look at these weapons and listen to
us now**."]{.underline}'

All of this was accompanied by 'lurid and strident propaganda 24/7 on
Russian television, pushing anti-Western messages,' explains Wilson. An
important part of this propaganda campaign was the idea that Ukraine is
not a country or a people. 'Putin said that very early on to George
Bush. Again, we didn't listen,' he says.

During the past decade, Putin also accelerated the remilitarisation of
Russia.

'[Under Putin, the military receives one in five roubles of revenue, but
the security services and the national guard---a 350,000-strong riot
police---also receive the same]{.underline}. So essentially **[three out
of every five roubles of state revenue is going to
contro]{.underline}**l: an army to smite your foreign enemies and a
domestic army to smite the traitors, the fifth column within.'

It's therefore likely that [Russia believes it is now demonstrating
strength on its own terms by being able to wage what Wilson refers to as
the 'Russian way of war']{.underline}.

'There's an expression in Russian that translates as "To be
tender-hearted does not become a sword",' says Wilson. What this means
in practice is the exercise of extreme brutality towards civilians,
combined with an indifference to Russia's own casualties.

Putin is likely to be equally indifferent, at least in the medium term,
to Russia's sanctions-induced economic suffering. Wilson argues that we
shouldn't be defining the health of the Russian economy in GDP terms.

'Russia occupies about a fifth or a sixth of the world's land surface.
According to BHP Billiton, Russia sits on between 5% and 25% of almost
everything on the planet, with exceptions like uranium and rare earths.
Lake Baikal contains one-sixth of the world's fresh water.

'Oil and gas will remain important sources of revenue for the next 30
years. And the decline in Russia's labour force is compensated for by
Central Asian migration.'

On the economic front, while Russia has two big weaknesses---corruption
and the brain drain of the best and brightest---Wilson says it is
dangerously self-delusionary to argue that Russia has a weak economy.

[Putin will also be encouraged by cracks in European support for
Ukraine, as well as by the distinct lack of enthusiasm for Kyiv's
struggle among much of the developing world.]{.underline}

[This will be feeding into the perception, endlessly peddled by Russian
propaganda, that democratic nations **don't have the stomach for the
Russian way of war and that Russia**]{.underline}, as part of its
exceptionalism, [has an ability to suffer in a prolonged way that
Western countries simply don't have,]{.underline} Wilson says.

So right now, [Putin may not be feeling dissatisfied with the way things
are going, despite all the assertions that the invasion is a disaster
for him]{.underline}.
