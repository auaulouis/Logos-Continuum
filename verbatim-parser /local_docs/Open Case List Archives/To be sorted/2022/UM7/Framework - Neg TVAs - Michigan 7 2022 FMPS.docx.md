Introduction

The rise of [[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline} is
largely due to an increase in power, memory and speed of computers, and
the availability of large quantities of data about many aspects of our
lives.i Through the commercial [application of big-data]{.underline}, we
are [increasingly being sorted into different **classifications** and
**stereotypes**]{.underline}. In its most benign form, this stereotyping
is being used to sell us products via targeted advertising, however, [in
its most egregious application, we see the **[weaponization]{.mark}** of
new information technologies utilize similar classifications based on
**biased algorithms**]{.underline}, to which the [**consequences**
[for]{.mark} certain [**communities** could be
**deadly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this paper I focus on fully
autonomous weapons [that are currently being developed for
**[military]{.mark}** and **law enforcement** purposes]{.underline}; and
their potential [[**threat** to]{.mark} the **human rights** of
**marginalized communities**, in particular **[persons of color]{.mark}
intersectionally**]{.underline} ii . This paper will also consider the
systemic nature of racism and how racism would be reinforced and
perpetuated by fully autonomous weapons.

Racism in Artificial Intelligence

[Fully autonomous weapons can select and attack targets without
meaningful human control, they operate based on algorithms and data
analysis programming.]{.underline} In essence, this means that machines
would have the power to make life-and-death decisions over human beings.

The trend towards more autonomy in weaponry without adequate human
oversight is alarming especially when we know that [digital technologies
are **not racially neutral**.]{.underline} Moreover, when it comes to
[artificial intelligence]{.underline} (AI) there is an increasing body
of evidence that shows that [[**racism** operates at **every level** of
the **design process**]{.mark} and continues to emerge in the
**production**, **implementation**, **distribution** and
**regulation**]{.underline}. In this regard **[AI]{.underline}** not
only embodies the values and beliefs of the society or individuals that
produce them but acts to [**amplify** these **biases** and the **power
disparities**]{.underline}.iii

One example of [racism **manifesting** in **AI** is the
under-representation problem in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics]{.underline} (STEM) fields, [which in itself is a
**manifestation** of **structural racism** and **patriarchy** in western
society]{.underline}. [**[Tech]{.mark}nologies** in the west are mostly
[**developed** by **white males**]{.mark}, and thus [**perform better**
for this group]{.mark}.]{.underline} A 2010 studyiv by researchers at
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the
University of Texas, found that [algorithms designed and tested
in]{.underline} East Asia are better at recognizing East Asians, while
those designed in [Western countries are more accurate at **detecting
Caucasians**]{.underline}. Similarly, [sound detecting devices perform
better at detecting **male**, **Anglo-American voices** and **accents**,
as opposed to **female** voices, and **non-Anglo-American**
accents.]{.underline}

Research by Joy Buolamwini,v reveals that [race, skin tone and gender
are significant when it comes to facial recognition.]{.underline}
Buolamwini demonstrates that [facial recognition software recognizes
**male faces** far more accurately than **female faces**, especially
when these faces are **white**. For **darker-skinned people** however
the **error rates** were over **19%**, and unsurprisingly the systems
performed especially badly when presented with the **intersection**
between **race** and **gender**, evidenced by a 34.4% error margin when
recognizing dark-skinned women.]{.underline}

Despite the concerning error rates in these systems, commercially we
already see adaptations of faulty facial recognition systems being
rolled out in a variety of ways from soap dispensers to self-driving
cars. The issue here is [what happens if **law enforcement** and
**[national security]{.mark}** become [**reliant** on]{.mark} a
[**system** that]{.mark} can **recognize white males** with just **1%
error rate** yet [fails to recognize **dark-skinned women**]{.mark} more
than one-third of the time?]{.underline}

These types of [applications of new information technology **fail people
of color intersectionally** at a disturbing rate]{.underline}. The fact
that these systems are commercially available reveals a blatant
disregard for people of color, [it also [positions]{.mark}
\"**[whiteness]{.mark}**]{.underline}\"vi [[as]{.mark} the
**[norm]{.mark}**, the **[standard]{.mark} for objectivity** [and
**reason**]{.mark}.]{.underline} These applications of new information
technology including their [**weaponization** favors **whiteness** at
the **expense** of all **others**, it is not merely a **disempowerment**
but an **empowerment**]{.underline}. In real terms, racism bolsters
white people\'s life chances. vii

[As we all grew up [in a **white-dominated world**]{.mark} it is not
surprising that the **vast majority** of **white people** operate
within, benefit from and reproduce a system that they barely notice.
This is a **long-held reality** and it is a **fundamental problem** that
we now see **infiltrate technology**.]{.underline}

[Historical or latent bias in data is another issue, this is created by
**frequency of occurrence**]{.underline}, for example in 2016 an MBA
student named Rosaliaviii discovered that googling \"unprofessional
hairstyles for work\" yielded images of mainly black women with
afro-Caribbean hair, conversely when she searched \"professional hair\"
images of mostly coiffed white women emerged, similar google search
results are still seen today. This is due to [machine learning --
[algorithms]{.mark}]{.underline}; it [[collects]{.mark} the most
[**frequently submitted entries** and]{.mark} therefore
[reflects]{.mark} **[statistically popular racists
sentiments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These [learnt biases are further
strengthened, thus racism continues to be reinforced.]{.underline}

A more perilous example of this is in data-driven, predictive policing
that uses crime statistics to identify \"high crime\" areas and then
subjects these areas to higher and often more aggressive levels of
policing. Crime happens everywhere, however when an area is over-policed
such as communities of color that results in more people of color being
arrested and flagged as \"persons of interest\" thus the cycle
continues. In 2017, Amnesty International launched a report called
\"trapped in the Matrix\",ix the report highlighted racially
discriminatory practices by the UK police force and their use of a
database called the \"Gangs Matrix\" which inputs data on \"suspected\"
gang members in London. As of October 2017, there were 3,806 people on
the Matrix, 87% of those are from black, Asian and minority ethnic
backgrounds and 78% are black, a disproportionate number given that the
police\'s own figures show that only 27% of those responsible for
serious youth violence are black.

Amnesty stated that some police officers in the UK have been acting like
they are in the \"Wild West\", making false assumptions about people
based on their race, gender, age and socioeconomic status. As a result,
individuals on the Matrix database are subject to chronic over-policing.
With black people six times more likely to be stopped and searched than
white people, and ten times more likely to be convicted of drug-related
offenses. This system not only interferes with their right to privacy,
Amnesty claims that the police often share the Matrix with other local
agencies such as job centers, housing associations, social services,
schools and colleges. In several cases, this has led to devastating
impacts on people\'s social and economic lives because they are listed
as \"nominal\" gang members, a label which is deliberately vague and
stigmatizing.

The nature of systemic racism means that it is embedded in all areas of
society, the effects of this type of oppression doesn\'t easily
dissipate. Through the continual criminalization and stigmatization of
people of color, systemic racism operates by creating winners and losers
regardless of what people actually do. This is also the way that it
redistributes opportunities and resources based on nothing other than
privilege.

Given that the UK, as well as five other countriesx are developing fully
autonomous weapons to target, injure and kill based on data-inputs and
pre-programmed algorithms, we can see how long-standing inherent biases,
pose an ethical and human rights threat. Where some groups of people
will be vastly more vulnerable than others, fully autonomous weapons
would not only act to further entrench already existing inequalities but
could exacerbate them and lead to deadly consequences.

Legalities

As AI technology advances, the question of who will be held accountable
for human rights abuses is becoming increasingly urgent. Machine
learning and AI, effect a range of human rights including privacy,
freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, the right to
non-discrimination and equality, the right to life and the right to
human dignity.

[Holding those responsible for the **unlawful killings** of **people of
color** by **law enforcement** and the **military** is already a huge
challenge in many countries]{.underline}, however, [this issue would be
**further impaired** if the **unlawful killing** was **committed** by a
**fully autonomous weapon**. Who would be held responsible: the
programmer, manufacturer, commanding officer, or the machine itself?
[**Lethal force** by]{.mark} these [weapons]{.mark} would [make it even
**easier** for **people of color** to be at the **mercy** of **unlawful
killings** and]{.mark} far more [**difficult** to **obtain
justice**]{.mark} for **victims of color** and their
**families**.]{.underline}

Conclusion

According to Reni Eddo-Lodge racism perpetuates partly through malice,
carelessness and ignorance, it acts to quietly assist some, while
hindering others.xi It is within this framework that we must grapple
with race and the weaponization of new information technologies. In this
regard, we should ask ourselves who controls these technologies and what
do they think they know about the people they are \"classifying\"? What
are the politics of these relationships and the deeply-rooted systemic
forms of discrimination? Who benefits from these technologies and how?

[There is a [**long history** of]{.mark} **people of color** being
**experimented** on for the sake of **[scientific advances]{.mark}**
from which they have suffered greatly but do not benefit]{.underline}.
An example of this is from [James Marion Sims, known as the father of
gynecology for reducing maternal death rates in the US, in the 19th
century. He conducted his research by performing **painful** and
**grotesque experiments** on **enslaved black women**]{.underline}.
\"All of the early [important **reproductive health** advances were
[**devised** by **perfecting experiments** on **black
women**]{.mark},]{.underline}\".xii Today, the maternal death rate for
black women in the US is three times higher than it is for white women.

Thus, [when it comes to **new information technology**, facial
recognition systems, **algorithms** and automated and interactive
machine decision-making, **communities of color** are often both
**deprived** of their **benefits** and **subjected** to their
**consequences**]{.underline}. This paradox where [[**science** is
**inflicted** on **communities of color** rather than **aided**]{.mark}
by it must be **addressed**.]{.underline}

We must be vigilant against deeply rooted social problems taking root in
the technical infrastructure that we create. We must work towards a zero
policy on racism in technology, and not weaponize racism in technology.
[If **racism** and **killer robots** are allowed to **co-exists** these
**weapons** will be used **discriminately** against **people of color**
and other **marginalized groups**]{.underline}.

For these and [[many]{.mark} other ethical, moral, human rights, legal
and humanitarian reasons the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, numerous
governments, regional groups, tech workers, experts, scholars and the UN
Secretary-General are all [calling for a **legally binding instrument**
to **prohibit fully autonomous weapons**]{.mark}.]{.underline} xiii

We call on the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism,
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to condemn
fully autonomous weapons and the human rights threat they pose to people
of color; and to support a **[prohibition treaty]{.underline}** that
[will preserve **meaningful human control** over the **use of force**
and **prohibit** fully **autonomous weapons**]{.underline}. xiv

1\. Modularity

[While a **handful of countries have built impressive, tightly
integrated digital stacks**,]{.underline} these outliers are the
exception rather than the rule. Both technically and politically, it is
usually easier and less expensive to create smaller solutions that can
be easily reconfigured and optimized as circumstances change. Just like
a set of Legos, modular platforms can be reassembled to address needs
and opportunities that may not have been anticipated when they were
first created.

[UK Notify demonstrates these benefits. After the solution was initially
deployed in the UK, it was adapted to meet new challenges by the
Australian Digital Transformation Agency, the **U.S. Department of
Veteran Affairs**, and the Canadian Digital Service.]{.underline} Along
the way, the system developed new capabilities. For example, [Canadian
engineers added French language support to the original
tool.]{.underline} Doing so not only fulfilled a national mandate to
make the software available in French and English, but also [provided
new functionality that the UK and French-speaking communities might be
able to draw on in the future. The flexibility of modular solutions is a
huge advantage at a time when technology and public needs are both
evolving rapidly.]{.underline}

**[2. Open Source]{.underline}**

[Most of the work performed by governments is similar regardless of
whether it is in New York, New Delhi, or Freetown. Almost all
governments have to provide public benefits and services, collect taxes,
maintain registries, and carry out a pretty well-defined set of other
responsibilities that could be streamlined using
technology]{.underline}. As the example above illustrates, [governments
are slowly waking up to the opportunity to develop and share **open
source solutions** to power the public sector rather than building
duplicative solutions of varying quality]{.underline}. Along with
modular design, **[open source development can help governments
cooperate to develop best-in-class solutions, adapt them to meet their
own needs, and quickly scale them across borders to benefit other
communities at minimal extra cost.]{.underline}**

[One of the benefits of open source development is that it allows civil
society **to examine the systems governments implement and point out
design flaws, security risks, and threats to privacy and civil
rights**.]{.underline} A contact tracing app deployed in India was found
to have numerous security bugs and led public authorities to open source
the code for additional review by the global security community. Since
then, hundreds of security flaws have been identified and fixed thanks
to the power of crowdsourced engineering talent made possible by open
source. [DIGI's Building and Reusing Open Source Tools in Government
report provides a guide for how open source solutions can foster
innovation in the public sector.]{.underline}

Prohibition Regime\",

Cluster munitions constitute a substantial part of the military arsenals
of all major powers. Their [development, procurement and stockpile are a
central hard component of national security]{.underline}. Yet, in less
than two years, [[cluster munitions were **banned**]{.mark} by an
**international** [treaty]{.mark} negotiated outside the **normal**
channels]{.underline}, the United Nations (UN), and spectacularly, in
less than two years. The treaty is the Convention on Cluster Munitions
(CCM) signed in Oslo in December 2008, by almost one hundred states, and
quickly enforced force (August 2010). Realists would dismiss such cases
and say that the politics of national security is impervious to change
and influence. A few prominent scholars have demonstrated the role of
other actors beyond the state in bringing change to other issues that
are close to the national security of states. [The case of the powerful
convention that banned landmines in 1997 proved to be the first hard
case in which an issue of [national security was **brought** to
chang]{.mark}e by the penetrating and [coordinated influence of]{.mark}
non-governmental organizations (**[NGOs]{.mark}**)
worldwide.]{.underline} Differently from landmines, [cluster
[munitions]{.mark} are a **highly [profitable industry]{.mark}** and
have a vital place in the [military doctrines of t]{.mark}he North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.mark}**) allies and
others.]{.underline} One element that fundamentally differentiates
landmines from cluster munitions is economic. The latter are much more
costly to produce and the trade is substantially more profitable. A
major part of global artillery arsenals is made up of cluster bombs.
Eighty per cent of United States (US) artillery ammunition, for
instance, consists of such munitions. Russia, China and the US are the
biggest producers. Marchers at the May 2008 Dublin Diplomatic Conference
on Cluster Munitions that produced the Convention on Cluster Munitions
Marchers at the May 2008 Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster
Munitions that produced the Convention on Cluster Munitions I argue that
[[the ban]{.mark} on cluster munitions [was brought to life by]{.mark} a
stout [global **prohibition** regime by a more complex set of
arrangements a]{.mark}nd coalitions than the landmines case [and it
represents a **moral prohibition regime**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
cluster munitions ban case, few states were as progressive as NGOs. The
ban was brought to fruition by the exceptional combination of state and
non-state activism, a new form of diplomacy for the 21st century, and
the commanding moral force of international humanitarian law (IHL) as a
robust and compelling previously existing normative structure. Clearly,
the Convention that banned cluster bombs went beyond IHL but benefited
from this powerful normative framework. Demonstrators at the May 2008

Convention on Cluster Munitions Demonstrators at the May 2008 Dublin
Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions that produced the Convention
on Cluster Munitions [The ban of cluster bombs is about military
doctrines succumbing to the higher authority of moral and humanitarian
concerns.]{.underline} In 1997, the International Campaign to Ban
Landmines (ICBL), led by Nobel Peace Laureate chief negotiator Jody
Williams, leading civil society worldwide, successfully banned
antipersonnel landmines with the Ottawa Treaty. Yet once again, another
set of weapons, namely cluster munitions, has gained prominence on the
international agenda. Jody Williams, said upon receiving the Nobel Peace
Prize: the landmine does not recognize the peace, after the war is over,
it keeps on killing. Cluster munitions also present the same
indiscriminate elements with the same 'unnecessary suffering\' component
to civilian populations. In summer 2006, the world watched in dismay,
the brief but devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah when the
Israeli army fired as many as four million cluster bombs into Lebanese
territory during the short-lived war. [Unfortunately, de-mining experts
say, up to 1 million cluster bombs failed to explode **immediately** and
continue to **threaten civilians**.]{.underline} Although the war ended
in a month, [Lebanese citizens continue to live in fear of leftover
munitions; unexploded cluster bomb remnants that remain scattered across
the country. Due to [anti-personal characteristic of **cluster**
**munitions**]{.mark}, which often leaves children as victims,
[advocates for banning the weapons created a united
voice]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[international outcry for]{.mark} the
catastrophic [humanitarian consequences]{.mark} of deploying these
weapons in densely populated areas,]{.underline} in the summer 2006,
helped spark the global movement to ban cluster munitions and to create
a global prohibition regime. Some of the [other serious precedent
situations include during the Cold War, Laos, most prominently. After
the end of the Cold War Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya, Kosovo, and the
EthiopiaEritrea conflict were some of the most notable cases.
It]{.underline} is important to notice that the [process towards a ban
is more than a century]{.underline} old. However the focus of this
article will be since the summer 2006. What happened then in Lebanon
constituted the shock event that [[triggered all the action for global
prohibition treaty-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} I use primarily the
framework of the illuminating theory of global prohibition regimes to
start explaining how this has happened. The ban process started with the
creation of the \"Oslo Process\", a track-two diplomacy course of
action, i.e. with the government of Norway\'s call to negotiate a ban on
clusters outside the UN in November 2006. The Oslo Process started with
46 states who committed to begin negotiations in February 2007 towards
creating an international instrument to ban the use of cluster munitions
(Oslo Conference on Cluster Munitions, 2008). Over the following year
and a half, several conferences around the world were held to continue
to craft the prohibition regime on banning cluster munitions. Three
months after Oslo, states met again in Lima in May 2007, and again in
Vienna in December[. Discussions were held to work towards creating a
treaty, with negotiations that spanned from specific definitions of
cluster munitions to the extent of the assistance to
victims.]{.underline} By February 2008, states met in New Zealand
reaching an agreement known as the Wellington Declaration. This was a
commitment by states to attend the Dublin conference three months later,
setting final negotiations for a treaty to ban cluster munitions. The
conference in Dublin lasted 10 days in May 2008 resulting in 107 states
that signed and decided upon a final treaty.

Facilitate civilian cyber activities. Civilian hacking groups, including
Anonymous, have already begun independently targeting Russia and Belarus
by crashing government websites, leaking classified documents, and
hacking state-run media outlets. These grassroot cyberattacks are
certainly eye-catching. Yet they are unlikely to fundamentally blunt
Russia's war effort, if only because they are being executed by a
loose-knit community of cyber activists that possess high levels of
technical skills but lack the contextual knowledge to maximize the
damage of their efforts. [NATO can help fill this gap by finding ways to
"guide from behind" to coordinate what will otherwise amount to a series
of disparate and uncoordinated attack]{.underline}s. Russia takes this
approach to an extreme by employing private actors as cyber auxiliaries.
During their 2007 distributed denial-of-service attacks on Estonia,
Russian intelligence agencies provided software and guidance to ordinary
citizens or "patriotic hackers" who wanted to punish Estonia for
removing a World War II-era statue memorializing the Red Army's victory
over Nazi Germany. NATO should take a different approach. Because many
hackers---especially those affiliated with groups like Anonymous---are
deeply distrustful of government authority, NATO should not recruit
cyber activists to work for U.S. or European government agencies.
Instead, **[NATO should adopt a hands-off approach that maximizes
plausible deniability and avoids antagonizing hackers who harbor
anti-government sentiments]{.underline}**. Rather than hire hackers and
direct their operations, **[NATO can suggest cyber objectives that just
so happen to be of particular strategic importance.]{.underline}** For
example, **[NATO cyberunits could set up front organizations that
identify lesser-known Russian government agencies,]{.underline}**
Russian companies that produce military components, and organizations
that are known fronts for Russian cyber efforts. More controversially,
**[NATO could also facilitate knowledge transfers by finding creative
ways to leak bits of code or zero-day exploits that can help hackers
engineer attacks on Russian networks]{.underline}**. NATO member states
should also begin to consider ways to protect hackers operating on their
territory from legal liability and prosecution by Russia and its
allies.a.

War,\" New Yorker,
https://www.newyorker.com/news/essay/the-war-in-ukraine-is-a-colonial-war

When Vladimir [Putin denies the reality of the Ukrainian
state]{.underline}, he is [speaking the familiar language of
empire.]{.underline} For five hundred years, [European conquerors called
the societies that they encountered "tribes," treating them as incapable
of governing themselves]{.underline}. As we see in the **[ruins of
Ukrainian cities]{.underline}**, and in the **[Russian practice of mass
killing, rape, and deportation, t]{.underline}**he claim that a nation
does not exist is the rhetorical preparation for destroying it.
[Empire's story divides subjects from objects]{.underline}. As the
philosopher Frantz **[Fanon]{.underline}** **[argued]{.underline}**,
**[colonizers see themselves as actors with purpose]{.underline}**, and
the colonized as instruments to realize the imperial vision. **[Putin
took a pronounced colonial turn]{.underline}** when returning to the
Presidency a decade ago. In 2012, he described Russia as a
"state-civilization," which by its nature absorbed smaller cultures such
as Ukraine's. The next year, he claimed that Russians and Ukrainians
were joined in "spiritual unity." In a long essay on "historical unity,"
published last July, he argued that Ukraine and Russia were a single
country, bound by a shared origin. His vision is of a broken world that
must be restored through violence. Russia becomes itself only by
annihilating Ukraine**[. As the objects of this rhetoric, and of the war
of destruction that it sanctions, Ukrainians grasp all of
this]{.underline}**. Ukraine does have a history, of course, and
Ukrainians do constitute a nation. But empire enforces objectification
on the periphery and amnesia at the center. Thus modern Russian
imperialism includes memory laws that forbid serious discussion of the
Soviet past. It is illegal for Russians to apply the word "war" to the
invasion of Ukraine. It is also illegal to say that Stalin began the
Second World War as Hitler's ally, and used much the same justification
to attack Poland as Putin is using to attack Ukraine. When the invasion
began, in February, Russian publishers were ordered to purge mentions of
Ukraine from textbooks. Faced with the Kremlin's official mixture of
fantasy and taboo, the temptation is to prove the opposite: that it is
Ukraine rather than Russia that is eternal, that it is Ukrainians, not
Russians, who are always right, and so on. Yet Ukrainian history gives
us something more interesting than a mere counter-narrative to empire.
We can find Ukrainian national feeling at a very early date**[. In
contemporary Ukraine, though, the nation is not so much anti-colonial, a
rejection of a particular imperial power, as post-colonial, the creation
of something new]{.underline}**.

A strategy for defense and deterrence in warming waters

While these developments may seem far away and far off to many NATO
allies, a Russian A2/AD bubble along the Alliance's northern flank
should be a critical concern for an Alliance with an obligation to
defend its Arctic member states. That different Arctic allies have
different views on the role NATO should play makes a consensus approach
difficult.7 Nevertheless, the absence of an overarching security concept
for the Arctic is an obvious and increasingly urgent lacuna for the
Alliance. NATO's Article 5 requirement for collective defense makes it
imperative that it take a more active role in confronting actions that
jeopardize its ability to protect its member states.

To that end, [NATO should develop a comprehensive Arctic strategy that
is focused on deterrence of competitors and defense of its member
states. This strategy should be one that is sensitive to and accounts
for the diverse array of unique Arctic equities, such as environmental
issues and the **rights of indigenous peoples**]{.underline}. Such a
strategy would have military, political, and environmental components
and should detail approaches for establishing and maintaining a concept
for credible deterrence in the Arctic. In the military dimension,
specifically, the Alliance should undertake a number of actions to
advance the following priorities:

[Build political consensus.]{.underline} As recommended in 2017 by the
NATO Parliamentary Assembly's Political Committee, in order [to address
Arctic security matters, NATO should establish an Arctic Working Group
to settle disagreements on the Alliance's role in the
Arctic]{.underline}. It might also sponsor an Arctic Security Forum for
Arctic stakeholders both inside and outside government.

[Enhance domain awareness. Increasing intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance operations in the North Atlantic and establishing
mechanisms to enhance information sharing on Arctic matters]{.underline}
is both necessary and noncontroversial.

[Ensure allies can operate effectively and jointly]{.underline}. There
are several avenues for building Arctic competency and interoperability.
These include:

Conducting a feasibility study on the utility of establishing a NATO
Joint Force Command for the Arctic or Arctic Command to coordinate NATO
military operations in the Arctic region;

Establishing a specialized NATO Arctic Rapid Reaction Force comprised of
air, ground, and maritime assets from Canada, Denmark, Norway, the
United Kingdom, the United States, and others capable of responding to
both military and humanitarian crises in the region;

Increasing the frequency and complexity of NATO military exercises, such
as Trident Juncture 2018, in the region; and

Focusing on polar icebreaker capabilities and encouraging Arctic allies
to build additional icebreakers to address Russia's large numerical
advantage and China's in-progress icebreaker program.

[Maintain stability. Establishing an Arctic security dialogue with
Russia through the NATO-Russia Council will promote transparency about
NATO's actions in the Arctic and mitigate adverse
reactions.]{.underline} Such a dialogue could explore the development of
a "military code of conduct" for the Arctic with the goal of reducing
the risk of confrontation or miscalculation. This could include advance
notification of military exercises as well as routine air and naval
activity, in addition to protocols for respecting the region's
biodiversity.

Finding a credible voice

An effective defense and deterrence posture for the Arctic must draw on
successful approaches and activities in NATO's east and south while
accounting for the Arctic's unique, historic disassociation from
security issues. To be an accepted and credible actor in the Arctic,
NATO must utilize both its political and military tools. It must serve
as a bridge between the security community and an array of longstanding
Arctic stakeholders which have a vested interest in promoting regional
stability and prosperity. For instance, [NATO's credibility will be
strengthened by **acknowledging the Arctic strategies of indigenous
groups** and by incorporating their insights on regional trends,
including their ideas on habitation and presence that are conducive to
longevity.]{.underline}8 NATO must equally account for the importance of
efforts such as environmental protection, scientific exploration, and
natural resource development.

Even as the changing security environment necessitates ramping up NATO's
role in the Arctic, [the Alliance must also respect the unique set of
existing Arctic consultative fora, which serve productive purposes and
where NATO's presence would be counterproductive and antithetical to the
purpose of keeping Russia, and occasionally China, constructively
engaged]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the eventual establishment of a
formal Arctic Security Forum where NATO as an institution is an accepted
actor should be a long-term goal. To that end, NATO should encourage the
development of these talks through a forum such as the Arctic Security
Roundtable, held annually at the Munich Security Conference through
joint efforts by the Wilson Center and the Norwegian Institute of
International Affairs (NUPI). This off-the-record, high-level setting
includes China and could be utilized to facilitate a candid Arctic
security dialogue geared toward the establishment of a formal security
forum.

Overall, the growing military-security dimension in Arctic affairs
requires NATO to urgently shore up its defense and deterrence posture in
the region lest it risk losing relevance and the ability to protect its
members. NATO's recent agreement to establish operational coordination
mechanisms between NATO Maritime Command (MARCOM) and the Danish Joint
Arctic Command (JACO), which has responsibility for the defense of
Greenland and the Faroe Islands, is a step in the right direction.9 But
moving forward comprehensively will require the Alliance to navigate the
complex and politically sensitive interlocking relationships among
existing Arctic stakeholders. To do this successfully, NATO needs a
carefully planned Arctic strategy that can forge consensus among Arctic
allies around specific military activities that guarantee access to the
region in any circumstance. The time is now for NATO to be an Arctic
actor.

**[Drones as Techno-Legal Assemblages]{.underline}**

This section gives an account of drones as techno-legal assemblages. It
argues that the drone assemblage implements remote techniques of social
control, and these techniques reflect the broader history of colonial
warfare. [The technological character of law allows the US to use it for
the efficient ordering of the space of drone wars. **Drone wars map onto
colonial cartographies** and position the subjects of **killing as
legitimate targets** without legal protection]{.underline}. Thus, drone
strikes are not a radical break from the past but are grounded in the
history of colonial war and necropolitics.

An assemblage is 'a multiplicity which is made up of many heterogeneous
terms and which establishes liaisons, relations between them'.100 These
terms include both material aspects, such as the technological practices
of the drone, and formal aspects of language, such as legal terms.
Deleuze states that assemblages consist of an interaction between
content and form, where 'form' refers to expressions or utterances, and
'content' refers to what the expression is combined with, or the
material aspects of the assemblage.101

[Drone scholars have generally conceived of the drone as **a
surveillance assemblage**]{.underline}.102 These scholars draw on the
work of Kevin Haggerty and Richard Ericson, who emphasise the way modern
surveillance [works by 'abstracting human bodies from their territorial
settings and separating them into a series of discrete
flows']{.underline} to be 'reassembled into distinct "data doubles"
'.103 [The drone as a surveillance assemblage fits into what scholars
have identified as **the 'racialised surveillant assemblage**', an
assemblage that identifies bodies as 'terrorists' **using racialised
logics**]{.underline}.104 Joseph Pugliese notes that [surveillance data
is coded with **bioinformational categories such as skin colour,
ethnicity, gender, height and weight**]{.underline}.105 These are [coded
by the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense['s
screening systems, inserting predetermined categories into the
data]{.underline}.106 The Department [combines its coded information
with uncoded]{.underline} (or not-yet-coded) [metadata collected by the
N]{.underline}ational [S]{.underline}ecurity [A]{.underline}gency, [to
form a 'categorical hybridization across different
disciplines']{.underline}.107 This hybrid of 'soft biometric'
information and hard metadata [merges the biological into the
algorithmic and results in a form of '**bioinformational
stereotyping'**]{.underline}.108 While Pugliese's work focuses on
articulating what can count as a victim of military violence, his
delineation of categorical hybridisation in the drone assemblage is
useful for this paper's focus on the enmeshing of law and technology,
since it connects technical processes to legal thresholds.

Under the influence of the drone assemblage, [drone wars
become]{.underline} what Jolle Demmers and Lauren Gould call ['liquid
war']{.underline}.109 Liquid wars [occur across vast and discontinuous
stretches of space, concerning a theatre of war that is moving and
moveable]{.underline}, and involve a disparate set of entities.110 In
this context, [the mechanisms of biopolitical control of whole
populations become less effective than modular and remote forms of
control]{.underline}.111 These are the forms of control that Deleuze
describes as making up societies of control.112 For Deleuze, these are
methods that are more concerned with information than with
individuals.113 Rather than locating individuals within a mass, [these
methods treat individuals as 'dividuals'**, breaking them down into
information**]{.underline} [that can be used in a piecemeal fashion to
achieve changing purposes]{.underline}.114

Paul Kahn has argued that [drone war 'no longer looks like
war']{.underline}.115 Kahn's conception of what w[ar looks like involves
sovereign states engaging in combat with their regular armed forces
using methods that involve mutual risk]{.underline}.116 Since [drone
wars are **not waged against other territorially bound sovereign
states**, **or** against a group resembling **armed forces, and without
mutual risk**, Kahn places drone wars in a zone of exception that is
**neither regulated by normal law nor ordered by the laws of
war**]{.underline}. 117 However, drone wars as asymmetrical conflicts
against non-sovereign groups are not a 'new form of violence'.118
Rather, as Samuel Moyn observes, they are a successor to colonial
warfare.119 Taking a broader perspective heeds the call of Deleuze, for
whom 'the machines don't explain anything, you have to analyze the
collective apparatuses of which the machines are just one component'.120
[What separates drone wars from prior conflicts is]{.underline} not,
Moyn argues, the technology itself, or who uses it against whom, but
rather [the place of the law]{.underline}.121 [Before 1977, he notes,
the laws of war did not apply to insurgents, while **today they are
'highly legalized'**]{.underline}.122 Drones are part of a larger
trajectory in which the laws of war apply to more subjects, in more
spaces, rather than fewer.

Ioannis Kalpouzos notes that [**lawyers are involved 'in decision
making** at different levels and stages of the targeting
process']{.underline}.123 Military lawyers based at the Combined Air and
Space Operations Center are part of a plethora of individuals who watch
the drone and provide advice.124 [These lawyers are **called on to
dispense immediate advice**: 'target prosecutions must be completed in a
matter of minutes]{.underline}.'125 They also provide policies and
'provide training products so aircrews and (joint terminal attack
controllers) are prepared to operate rapidly'.126 [The place of lawyers
in the drone assemblage highlights what David Kennedy calls the
'war-generative functions of law': **the military 'turns to law** to
discipline the troops, **to justify, excuse, and privilege battlefield
violence**, to build the institutional and logistical framework from
which to launch the spear']{.underline}.127 In 2011, a single drone
required up to 185 personnel to operate128 across different bases and
continents---an operation that resembles the complexity of an aircraft
carrier, 'requiring a complex and entrenched culture of standard
practices and shared experiences, of rules and discipline'.129 Drone
operations are so specialised that they are producing new forms of legal
expertise.130

[This insertion of the law into the kill chain encloses what might
otherwise be extrajudicial killing in a **cloak of
lawfulness**]{.underline}. Giorgio Agamben notes that the law includes
'what is simultaneously pushed outside',131 and others acknowledge this
expanding character of the law to cover more subjects and things that
are outside itself.132 [The vision of legal experts doing ondemand
technical work to grease the wheels of the kill chain also echoes Carl
Schmitt's image of the state as a technical machine]{.underline}.133
[The state, on this conception, is analogous to a sophisticated machine
in which all parts work according to order]{.underline}. This was
required of the state, for Schmitt, to guard against the state of
nature.134 To succeed, the state needs to be an efficient instrument
that can exercise the utmost control, which requires it to be neutral of
all norms and technically perfect.135 [**The drone assemblage, tangled
with legalities, reflects this picture of the law** as pervasive,
technical, efficient and neutral]{.underline}. However, for Schmitt, the
technical machine only encompassed the state and ordered its interior,
not its exterior.136 Law's expanding trajectory indicates that its
technical pervasiveness goes beyond what Schmitt imagined.

[The pervasive, expanding, technical character of the law **reveals law
as technology**. Technology, too, has been viewed by some as
all-pervasive, even reaching mythical status]{.underline}.137 For Martin
Heidegger, the essence of [technology is a way of understanding the
world as something to be calculated, ordered and
manipulated]{.underline}.138 [This technological worldview sees
everything as 'readyto-hand']{.underline},139 everything as some tool
for using to achieve some purpose. All things, in this view, become
merely some resource that can be replaced and exchanged.140 The paradigm
example, for Heidegger, is modern industrialised technology, which draws
all resources into supply chains to further the aims of economic
efficiency.141 Law, too, is 'ready-to-hand', a set of rules to achieve
whatever purpose most efficiently.142 But law itself is also
technological, as a worldview that sees everything as a resource to be
ordered to further the aim of technical efficiency. Heidegger calls this
pervasive technological worldview 'enframing'.143 [Thinking of law as
technology emphasises the pervasiveness of law, that it results in a
closed hermeneutic that purports, like technology, to be able to order
everything, to govern everything, and this pervasiveness is also **at
work through the drone**.]{.underline} We can see the expansion of the
laws of war to technically govern the subjects of drone strikes in the
development of targeted killing.

However, this one form of control forms part of a greater collective of
control assemblages. Kalpouzos144 identifies it as part of what Marianna
Valverde and Michael Mopas call 'targeted governance'---'linked to the
idea of efficient, apolitical, knowledge-driven, "evidence-based"
policy'.145 This links targeted killing to ideas of law and control. Law
as efficient and calculative is woven into the kill chain to make
assessments of proportionality and distinction on demand. Control as
targeted echoes the mechanisms of the society of control, converting
individuals into the dividuals of signatures and patterns of life. This
form of legalised killing developed in the 1990s before the armed drone
existed, indicating it is part of a broader trajectory of law, though
the drone became the cypher for the law of war's new justification of
lethal forms of control.146

[The development of targeted killing follows the trajectory of
**colonial warfare that flows through the drone**]{.underline}. Kahn and
other [scholars are preoccupied with anxiety over the 'vanishing
battlefield']{.underline},147 [the transformation of war that 'no longer
looks like war']{.underline},148 [the creation of a space of exception
where neither peacetime law nor the laws of war apply]{.underline}. This
[preoccupation is influenced by a '**territorialist
epistemology'**]{.underline}.149 This perspective [privileges the
Westphalian concept of sovereignty and the imagined idea that
i]{.underline}nternational [law is built to facilitate interactions
**between sovereign states of equal standing**]{.underline}.150 It fails
to recognise the 'differentiated sovereignty' that developed in
international law to suppress and manage the non-European world.151 Th[e
use of drones in war maps onto 'imperial cartographies', revealing this
form of legitimised violence as a continuation of the imperial logic of
i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline}.152 Campbell Munro notes
that drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia do not occur across
the entire territory of these states, but are localised to areas on the
'imperial periphery', regions of historically contested sovereign
borders that are administered as less than sovereign.153 According to
Munro, the [legitimation of violence in drone wars continues at least
three lines of imperial legal reasoning]{.underline}.154 One sees the
[Eurocentric laws of war as applying only between sovereign states,
which the **colonial other was not**: '\[t\]o characterize any conduct
whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the laws of
nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the
subject]{.underline}.'155 This logic [continues in the concept of
targeted killing]{.underline}, which allows the subject of drone strikes
to be a legitimate target, but does not offer them legal protection.
[Another line of imperial legal reasoning sees the reinscription of
'differentiated and layered sovereignties' insofar as the areas targeted
coincide with the imperial periphery]{.underline}.156 The [third line of
reasoning sees **mechanised war equated with legitimate war**, as
embodied in the technoscientific practices of the drone]{.underline}.157

The three extensions of imperial legal reasoning mentioned above
[characterise a necropolitical space of legal ambiguity]{.underline}.
Achille [Mbembe writes that in the colony, ' "**peace**" is more likely
to take on **the face of a "war without end"**]{.underline} '.158 [This
is due]{.underline}, he insists[, to 'the creation of a European
juridical order' in which states are equal and cannot rule outside their
own borders]{.underline}.159 This turnsthe colony, outside European
state borders, into a zone of indistinction, where states need not
follow any law of equality, including the laws of war.160 Laws do make
their way into the colony, but are premised on the idea that the colony
is not sovereign, so the laws are imposed by its European occupier, and
on the idea that the people are not fully legal subjects, so they may
belong to others as slaves but have no rights themselves.161 Thus, [the
colony is an ambiguously lawful place where a colonising power combines
laws and unlawfulness to dominate the racially distinguished 'others'.
This **necropolitical logic is at work in drone wars**, in the way that
**targets are racially distinguished, legally killable but not legally
protected, and managed under a regime of differentiated
sovereignty**]{.underline}. [The entire collective of apparatuses of
which the drone is a part makes drone wars spaces of legal
ambiguity]{.underline}. Thus, the US continues to follow the
necropolitical logic of colonial expansion to justify its killing.

The laws of war, considered from the standpoint of enframing, order and
are ordered by the imperial logic of international law. Within this
picture, [the drone is a cypher for the laws of war as part of a
collective of assemblages of control]{.underline}. Far from representing
a break from old forms of warfare with their imagined European
chivalrous legality, [drones continue the project of colonial warfare by
legitimising violence using the law. The extension of legality to the
subjects of drone strikes is another mechanism in the technical machine
that is the **law of progress, order, efficiency and
neutralit**y]{.underline}. The ambiguous (non-) distinction between
targets, the legal ambiguity of differentiated sovereignty and targeted
killing, and the blurring of the boundary between peace and war are
[individual aspects of collective assemblages of control that are part
of a continuum of the law, not a radical break from it]{.underline}.
This picture of the inescapability of the law echoes so many dystopian
visions, including Deleuze's and Guattari's vision of a universal
computer that tracks every movement and may decide at any moment not to
allow someone access to parts of the city.162 They issued a warning
about the societies of control, insisting that their mechanisms amount
to the 'coils of a serpent'.163 The drone assemblage is one of them.

Fully autonomous weapons can select and attack targets without
meaningful human control, they operate based on algorithms and data
analysis programming. In essence, this means that machines would have
the power to make life-and-death decisions over human beings. [The trend
towards more autonomy in weaponry without adequate human oversight is
alarming especially when we know that digital technologies are not
racially neutral.]{.underline} Moreover, when it comes to artificial
intelligence (AI) there is [an increasing body of evidence that shows
that racism operates at every level of the design process and continues
to emerge in the production, implementation, distribution and
regulation]{.underline}. In this regard AI not only embodies the values
and beliefs of the society or individuals that produce them but acts to
amplify these biases and the power disparities.iii [One example of
racism manifesting in AI is the under-representation problem in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, which in itself
is a manifestation of structural racism and patriarchy in western
society]{.underline}. Technologies in the west are mostly 2 developed by
white males, and thus perform better for this group. [A 2010 studyiv by
researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
and the University of Texas, found that algorithms designed and tested
in East Asia are better at recognizing East Asians, while those designed
in Western countries are more accurate at detecting Caucasians.
Similarly, sound detecting devices perform better at detecting male,
Anglo-American voices and accents, as opposed to female voices, and
non-Anglo-American accents.]{.underline} Research by Joy Buolamwini,v
[reveals that race, skin tone and gender are significant when it comes
to facial recognition.]{.underline} Buolamwini demonstrates that facial
recognition software recognizes male faces far more accurately than
female faces, especially when these faces are white[. For darker-skinned
people however the error rates were over 19%, and unsurprisingly the
systems performed especially badly when presented with the intersection
between race and gender, evidenced by a 34.4% error margin when
recognizing dark-skinned women]{.underline}. Despite the concerning
error rates in these systems, commercially we already see adaptations of
faulty facial recognition systems being rolled out in a variety of ways
from soap dispensers to self-driving cars. [The issue here is what
happens if law enforcement and national security become reliant on a
system that can recognize white males with just 1% error rate yet fails
to recognize dark-skinned women more than one-third of the
time?]{.underline} These types of applications of new information
technology fail people of color intersectionally at a disturbing rate[.
The fact that these systems are commercially available reveals a blatant
disregard for people of color, it also positions \"whiteness\"vi as the
norm, the standard for objectivity and reason. These applications of new
information technology including their weaponization favors whiteness at
the expense of all others, it is not merely a disempowerment but an
empowerment.]{.underline} In real terms, racism bolsters white people\'s
life chances. Vii

#### AI is used in AFRICOM

"Pentagon's Big AI Program, Maven, Already Hunts Data in Middle East,
Africa". Breaking Defense. 5/1/18.
https://breakingdefense.com/2018/05/pentagons-big-ai-program-maven-already-hunts-data-in-middle-east-africa/

[Just a year after its birth, the Pentagon's cornerstone artificial
intelligence effort, Project Maven, has already been **deployed to half
a dozen locations in the Middle East and Africa**]{.underline}, [where
it is helping military analysts sort through the mountains of data their
sensors and drones soak up]{.underline}.

Military leaders have said for months that the [program was being used
to organize and analyze video and data pulled from drones in the Middle
East. But its early success and the push from Washington to move out on
AI as quickly as possible has led the Pentagon **to expand to
AFRICOM**]{.underline}, one military official involved in the program
said on Tuesday.

"We're in five or six locations in AFRICOM and CENTCOM," Lt. Col. Garry
Floyd said at a technology conference in Washington. The AI program is
working on data pulled in from small ScanEagle drones in Iraq, and there
are plans to move to small, tactical drones as well as larger Predator
and Reaper drones later this year.

"[**Data is like iron ore**, there's mountains of it,"]{.underline}
Floyd said, adding that the key is shaping it and understanding it,
something that the Maven team is working to train the code to do.

While public acknowledgement of the Africom deployment is new, Floyd
said the Maven technology has been in use there since December, where
early on the team was able to update the algorithm about six times in
five days.

[That flexibility is exactly what the Pentagon is looking for. The
military is full of horror stories about clunky and slow technology that
drive users up the wall. But]{.underline}, Floyd said, [there's
literally a button on the Maven interface that can help]{.underline}
with that.

The button simply [says "Train AI."]{.underline} This [allows for the
retraining and improvement of the algorithm, and it's a critical piece
of the system]{.underline}. "It's not all that different, if you think
about it, than a young airman," Floyd said. "On their first day of work
it's going to take them a little while to understand what's going on, to
understand the mission." It's the same with machine learning.

There is no such thing as perfect technology, and AI is no different,
but the Maven team is trying to make that a feature, rather than a bug.

"[With AI, if you give that airman in the field an 80 percent
capability, and a good user guide," **both the user and the tech have
room to grow**]{.underline}, Floyd said. "You want to give them ability
to improve it on the fly, and we're inventing some of those processes to
do that. You deploy something that's not 100 percent, you know that on
day one you're going to retrain it, and then you go from there."

In order to do that, the system needs to remain relatively open and
available to accept rapid and frequent upgrades from a variety of
sources. Proprietary approaches to deploying data aren't going to work
anymore, as threats and opportunities change too rapidly not to plug in
upgrades on the move.

"We need to be able to plug algorithms in and take them out. We need
algorithms from different sources," he said. "We need to be able to use
algorithms that the soldiers and airmen are going to develop themselves.
Open needs to be the standard and the expectation."

[The ultimate aim of the program isn't to build an all-seeing
Skynet-type capability]{.underline}, military officials insist. [The
Pentagon has **been careful to keep their distance** from talk of
autonomous weapons, or calling for completely autonomous surveillance
systems that can do everything on their own. "We don't see
\[technology\] as replacing the airmen, we're trying to free up time for
allowing them to focu]{.underline}s on other tasks. We don't want them
to have to stare and count anymore," Floyd said.

The enthusiasm for Maven, and its rapid deployments, have come at a
cost, however. Earlier this year, the project made a big splash after
3,100 Google employees signed a letter protesting their company's
involvement in the program. Google execs were quick to assure its
unhappy engineers that the company would never participate in building
weapons, but the episode exposed the deep cultural divide between
Silicon Valley wunderkinds and the US military.

Pushing back slightly, Floyd said that "I think what you'll see is there
will be those who will partner with us and will help us do the things
that we need to do to be successful. Because success revolves around
accomplishing the mission rapidly so we can all come home safe and so
that we keep collateral damage to a minimum."

Several representatives from the defense industry told Floyd that
they're eager to help, even if the Googles of the world may not be as
enthusiastic. But the cultural disconnect --- which former defense chief
Ash Carter tried to bridge with his DIUX offices plopped in the middle
of tech hotbeds in California, Austin and Boston --- is very real.
Making it even more problematic, China and Russia face no such
limitations. China, in particular, can simply order its tech firms to
work on government projects.

Maven only kicked off in April 2017, when then-Deputy Defense Secretary
Bob Work established the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team,
which is overseen by the Defense Undersecretary for Intelligence (known
as the USDI). The small team initially incorporated its AI tools into 10
sites, with plans to incorporate them into 30 sites by mid-2018,
according to a new government assessment of the program.

[Maven is also only **one of hundreds** of AI initiatives being pursued
across the Pentagon]{.underline}. So many programs spread out over such
a large organization can be the stuff of nightmares for military
planners, but the building's hard-charging new undersecretary for
research and engineering, Michael Griffin, said recently that he is
[setting up a **Joint Artificial Intelligence Center** that will will
tie together the military's efforts with those of the Intelligence
Community]{.underline}, allowing them [to combine efforts in a breakneck
push to move government's AI initiatives forward.]{.underline}
