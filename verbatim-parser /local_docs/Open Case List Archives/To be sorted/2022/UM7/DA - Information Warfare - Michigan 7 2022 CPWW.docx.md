[In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia has **excluded
media outlets** based in the U.S. and allied countries.]{.underline}
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Radio Free Europe, Deutsche Welle, BBC,
and other news sources are no longer legally available there. [A
self-imposed ***digital iron curtain*** has descended **across Europe**,
enforced in part by the new draconian Russian law criminalizing the
**distribution of "false information"** about the Ukraine
conflict.]{.underline}

But [the closing of the information space has not been one-sided. The
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [has banned Russian state
media in Europe and U.S. companies have made it more difficult to access
these media outlets in the U.S.]{.underline}, thereby [**reducing** the
range of **info**rmation sources available to the public here in the
West.]{.underline}

In my view, [these voluntary and legal exclusions of Russian state media
are **unnecessary** and **harmful** attempts to mobilize society for the
wartime emergency in Ukraine.]{.underline} Such [restrictions **should
be ended a**s **s**oon **a**s **p**ossible and not reimposed or extended
to other state-backed media, except perhaps under the gravest
circumstances of actual war and blatantly unjustified
aggression.]{.underline} These exclusions limit the view of the world
available to the U.S. public and policymakers, and, by a well-understood
and predictable process, [they lead to the **demonizing** and silencing
of **valuable internal critics** whose insights could help to improve
the effectiveness of foreign and domestic policy.]{.underline} It would
be a mistake to continue down such a dangerous and counterproductive
path.

THE NEW U.S. RESTRICTIONS

In the wake of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, [several U.S.
companies **banned Russian state media** from their
systems.]{.underline} Apple removed the RT News app from its app store.
YouTube blocked the RT news channel. DirecTV dropped RT America, which
led the English-language 24-hour Russian news channel based in the U.S.
to shutter its operations.

Senator [Mark Warner sent a public letter to tech company CEOs urging
them "to prevent misuse of their platforms by Russia and Russia-linked
entities."]{.underline} But the companies were free to ignore such
policymaker pressure---and some did. Facebook still allows RT to
function on its U.S. platform while continuing to label it as "Russia
state-controlled media." Twitter also permits RT on its platform, with a
warning that the account is "Russia state-affiliated media." Moreover,
the RT website is still easily accessible from any computer or mobile
device in the United States.

The result of this private sector management of their own systems is
that people in the U.S. interested in getting Russia's perspective on
the current Ukraine crisis, or anything else, have a number of more
cumbersome---but still relatively easy---ways to access it.

THE EUROPEAN OVERREACTION

In contrast, [the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [reacted
much more forcefully.]{.underline} On March 2, the Council of Europe
issued an amendment to its 2014 package of Russia sanctions [banning the
Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik in Europe.]{.underline}

This ban is **[extraordinarily sweeping]{.underline}**, applying to
"transmission or distribution by any means such as cable, satellite,
IP-TV, internet service providers, internet video-sharing platforms or
applications, whether new or pre-installed." In a follow-up
clarification, European Union officials said that the order applies to
search results and to posts from individuals who "reproduce" content
from RT or Sputnik on any social media platform.

Part of [the stated basis]{.underline} for blocking Russian state media
organizations [is that they are state-controlled and engage in
propaganda]{.underline} to further Russian foreign policy aims. But
these organizations have always been state-controlled and have always
echoed Russian government propaganda. The new element is the emergency
of the Ukraine war, where Russian propaganda could aid its war effort by
undermining the domestic will to fight in Europe and Ukraine. This
suggests that the legal ban on RT makes sense only as a huge exception
to a background policy of openness.

[European officials should **make it clear** that its **legal
interdiction of Russian state media is a rare exception**]{.underline},
justified in their view only by the extreme circumstances of undeniable
aggression and actual war in Ukraine. In a move in this direction, an
unnamed EU official said, "This is not a normal situation, and that's
what makes this case so entirely different from any other restriction on
freedom of information." To be clear, I think the European ban is an
overreaction even in wartime circumstances, but now that it is done, it
is vital to cabin it and prevent it from becoming a precedent for
further legal media bans.

But [there is a **risk** that **Europe will expand** on its exclusionary
approach instead of treating it as a unique measure
justified]{.underline}, if at all, only by rare wartime circumstances.
The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell and the European Parliament are
considering a new mechanism that would allow the EU to sanction
government-backed disinformation actors. MEP Sandra
[Kalniete]{.underline}, who is leading this effort, [suggested it would
target "Russia, China, and other authoritarian regimes..."]{.underline}
This appears to be an alarming move to institutionalize a system to
exclude all state media of foreign adversaries from Europe's information
space.

THE DANGER AHEAD FOR THE U.S.

In 2020, Laura Rosenberger, now with the National Security Council
(formerly, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a senior
fellow at The German Marshall Fund) [urge]{.underline}d [the U.S. to
"work systematically with the private sector and civil society" to meet
the challenge of **information competition** with Russia and
China.]{.underline}

Refining the system of public-private coordination on national security
issues, as Rosenberger suggests, is a worthwhile initiative. But
extending it to include coordination between national security agencies
and private media and tech companies aimed at delinking the U.S. from
hostile state media sources would pose great dangers for an open
society.

[An **embargo** on information sources under the control of foreign
adversaries]{.underline}---even if arranged through a shared
understanding with national security agencies rather than through
compulsion---[would create and maintain damaging **information black
holes**. It might even be **unconstitutional** state
action.]{.underline} It would certainly [limit knowledge of global
developments]{.underline} at a crucial time [when the U.S. public and
policymakers **need the clearest possible picture** of the rest of the
world, including Russia and China.]{.underline} And [this includes
understanding how these countries see themselves, how they view the U.S
and its allies]{.underline}, and their vision of their own place in the
international community. [Seeing them only through the **filter of
domestic media** is almost certainly a **recipe for misunderstanding**
and ill-informed decisions.]{.underline}

[Shutting out state media from foreign adversaries also makes it easier
to treat domestic critics of U.S. policy as agents of a hostile power
who are amplifying the enemy's talking points.]{.underline} If it is
legitimate to silence state media as agents of foreign propaganda
because of what they say, [commentators and policymakers are likely to
think that it must be legitimate to label anyone who says the same thing
as also an agent of a foreign power.]{.underline}

But this is a mistake. [Internal critics **should be encouraged to
engage** in constructive, fact-based criticisms of U.S. policies both
here and abroad.]{.underline} These criticisms will often resemble
criticisms by foreign adversaries since these adversaries are adept at
pinpointing the weaknesses of the U.S system. But [it is vital not to
repeat the redbaiting mistakes of the first Cold War by silencing or
discounting analyses and proposals from internal critics because of this
similarity.]{.underline}

The example of [i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
[scholar]{.underline} John [Mearsheimer illustrates the
risks.]{.underline} He is perhaps the foremost exponent of the idea that
the U.S. policy of NATO expansion contributed significantly to the
current crisis in Ukraine. While his view has not been censored in the
West, the warning signs of redbaiting are beginning. Respected
commentator Adam Tooze describes how the Pulitzer-prize-winning
historian Anne Appelbaum accused Mearsheimer of providing a narrative
useful to the Kremlin, and how students at Mearsheimer's employer---[the
University of Chicago---published a letter **accusing him of being on
the Russian payroll.**]{.underline}

Mearsheimer is so well established that these minor incidents will not
tarnish his reputation. Indeed, he is enjoying a rare moment of internet
fame, as his 2015 YouTube speech about Ukraine has received 24 million
views to date. While he is not at all a victim of oppression or
exclusion, [other less-established critics might not be so
resilient.]{.underline} These examples illustrate a dangerous tendency
that policymakers and commentators alike should reject: [a style of
debate and discussion that, while not at all the same as government
suppression of speech, creates an atmosphere of fear that can silence
the expression of views at variance with government policy.]{.underline}
This dangerous tendency is made to seem legitimate by a coordinated
policy of exclusion of foreign state media.

For generations, U.S. communications policy has been premised on the
idea, articulated in the Supreme Court's 1945 Associated Press decision,
that "the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and
antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public." Rather
than organized suppression and redbaiting, this policy of transparency,
openness, and the free flow of information continues to be the best
weapon in the U.S. struggle against foreign adversaries.

[**Reporters getting killed** while chasing a story. Online **attacks
against women journalists**, including death and rape threats.
**Targeted electronic surveillance** to intimidate and silence
investigative journalism.]{.underline}

This is the dangerous reality for many journalists around the world as
[media freedom and safety have diminished in the digital age with a
grave impact on **human rights**, **democracy** and **development**, a
UN expert warned.]{.underline}

["The decline of media freedom and the rise in threats to the safety of
journalists is a **worldwide trend**]{.underline}, most sharply evident
[in backsliding democracies and recalcitrant totalitarian
States,"]{.underline} said Irene Khan, UN Special Rapporteur on the
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and
expression. ["The consequences for human rights, democracy, public
participation and development are worrying."]{.underline}

In a report to the Human Rights Council, [Khan said digital technology
has opened great opportunities for journalists and media freedom,
including ground-breaking investigative reporting, cross-border
collaboration, fact-checking with audiences, and access to treasure
troves of data and sources.]{.underline}

However, Khan pointed out the digital age also poses serious challenges
and threats. As examples, she cited online and offline attacks and
killing of journalists with impunity; criminalisation and harassment of
journalists; and the erosion of independence, freedom and the plurality
of voices and opinions in state and corporate media, including digital
companies.

["Silencing journalists]{.underline} by killing them [is the **most
egregious form of censorship,"**]{.underline} Khan said, urging the
Council to consider measures to address impunity, including an
international taskforce on the prevention, investigation and prosecution
of attacks against journalists.

She cited a database site compiled by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that reported that 455
journalists had been killed while doing their jobs between 2016--2021.
In more than eight out of ten cases, the perpetrators have not been
brought to justice.

Online attacks against women journalists

The report draws special attention to online attacks against women
journalists, which are often vicious, coordinated and highly sexualized,
and target women from religious and ethnic minorities or gender
non-conforming people.

"Such violence inflicts very real psychological injury, chills public
interest journalism, kills women's careers and deprives society of
important voices and perspectives," the report says.

"A free, independent and diverse media fulfils society's right to know,
as well as journalists' right to seek, receive and impart information."

\- IRENE KHAN, UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF
THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION

The old practice of abusing laws -- from libel laws to anti-terrorism
legislation \-- to punish journalists and suppress media freedom has
been revived by some States with a new ferocity, the report adds.

Khan cited the case of Philippine Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa,
who has faced an onslaught of legal actions in the Philippines for her
critical reporting of former president Rodrigo Duterte.

Erosion of independence and pluralism

[Khan also pointed to the erosion of independence, pluralism and
economic viability of media in the digital age.]{.underline}

In a number of countries, including in Central and Eastern Europe,
[there is a **creeping trend** towards State control over public media
and in favouring privately-owned media that serves the political or
economic interests of those in power.]{.underline}

Khan also said [media viability is a matter of **human rights**, not
just a question of economics.]{.underline} The collapse of the
advertising-based news media business model in the digital age has [led
to staff cutbacks and closures of news outlet in many
countries.]{.underline} While some national and international news
providers and niche news producers are managing through subscriptions,
paywalls, reader contributions and subsidies, many others could face a
media extinction.

"In a world where disinformation increasingly masquerades as news and
authoritarian and populist leaders attack journalists and media outlets
to sow public distrust, [**critical independent journalism produced in
the public interest is essential.** Its absence or decline in many
countries represents a major assault on media freedom," the report
warns.]{.underline}

[The world will neither rebuild from the pandemic, nor have any chance
of tackling wider existential threats such as climate
change]{.underline}, until leaders once more instill a sense of hope in
political and civic life. Fortunately, the Universal Declaration of
[Human Rights offers a **roadmap** to help humanity chart a path
forward.]{.underline}

DUBLIN -- The COVID-19 pandemic has recast the world for millions of
people. Or, more correctly[, the pandemic has exposed and aggravated
deep inequalities of race, gender, and class across societies, and
**highlighted the inability of many political systems to** respond in
ways that **protect individual human rights and dignity.** The world
will neither rebuild from this crisis, nor have a]{.underline}ny [chance
of tackling]{.underline} wider [**existential threats** such as climate
change, until we can once more instill a sense of hope]{.underline} in
political and civic life.

Fortunately, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, [a roadmap
already exists to help humanity chart a path forward.]{.underline} The
declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, is
as relevant today as it was amid the physical and moral devastation
caused by World War II.

Article 1 of the declaration states an abiding truth with resounding
clarity: ["All human beings are born free and equal in **dignity and
rights."**]{.underline} To realize this vision today, [***we must push
leaders*** to go beyond warm words and commit to meaningful, feasible,
and measurable actions.]{.underline} In particular, they need to ensure
equitable global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and provide adequate
financial support to countries most vulnerable to the ravages of climate
change.

For starters, [high-income countries must]{.underline} take steps to
achieve the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment target of
[provid]{.underline}ing at least one billion [vaccine doses]{.underline}
to the world's poorest countries no later than September 1, 2021, and
more than two billion doses by mid-2022.

[It is]{.underline} both morally [unjust and]{.underline} -- in health
and economic terms -- [myopic for rich countries to hoard COVID-19
vaccines for their own populations.]{.underline} The longer the
coronavirus persists and mutates in poorer countries with fewer
resources, the further away humanity as a whole will be from fully
vanquishing the threat to lives and livelihoods.

In the same spirit, G7 and G20 leaders should support calls at the World
Health Organization and the World Trade Organization for voluntary
licensing and technology transfer for production of vaccines. Failing
that, they should back an immediate waiver of certain
intellectual-property rights under WTO rules -- a move that US President
Joe Biden recently supported.

Sadly, at their recent summit in the United Kingdom, G7 [leaders failed
to show an understanding of the scale of their responsibility to
address]{.underline} the [inequalities exacerbated by the
pandemic.]{.underline} More broadly, [COVID]{.underline}-19 [has exposed
the shortcomings of narrow nationalism and populist policies that
disdain scientific evidence and empathy.]{.underline} No country,
regardless of its power or size, can tackle the public-health threat
effectively on its own.

It is essential that leaders learn from their mistakes and heed the
recommendations of the expert Independent Panel for Pandemic
Preparedness and Response. Only properly financed, integrated, and
organized health systems will be able to withstand future pandemics and
health emergencies.

As matters stand, however, [the rich world's failures in tackling
COVID-19 have increased the **trust deficit** between the Global North
and South.]{.underline} This in turn will make it more difficult to
reach an agreement at the next critical international diplomatic
gathering: the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.

[All countries need to ratchet up their near-term emissions-reduction
targets ahead of COP26, and we are still waiting for the major emitters
to do so.]{.underline} In addition, [rich countries must **rebuild
trust** by showing]{.underline} how they will increase [their climate
finance contributions]{.underline} -- including a greater share for
adaptation -- to deliver the long-pledged \$100 billion per year to help
developing countries combat global warming and its effects.

Two common threads run through the [shared challenges we face in
defending human rights, overcoming the pandemic, and tackling the
climate crisis]{.underline}: the need for vigilance against complacency,
and the responsibility to act for the greater good. In these testing
times, we can all draw inspiration from a leader who never wavered in
his commitment to human rights and justice: Nelson Mandela.

It is a historical irony that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
was adopted in the same year that South Africa established its apartheid
regime. But Mandela immediately saw the declaration's power and
potential. Speaking in 1997 as president of South Africa, he reflected
that, "For all the opponents of this pernicious system, the simple and
noble words of the Universal Declaration were a sudden ray of hope at
one of our darkest moments."

Today more than ever, we need to rediscover and reassert the
declaration's principles of solidarity and common endeavor that Mandela
so powerfully articulated throughout his life. Our task now is not to
"build back better," because we cannot build back from a status quo ante
that produced inequitable and dysfunctional systems. Rather, [we must
"build forward better,"]{.underline} marshaling our efforts with hope,
discipline, and determination to build a sustainable, peaceful, and just
world [for **future generations.**]{.underline}

#### Europe's a [double-turn]{.underline} on free speech\-\--language vagueness, exceptions, and President Macron

Yesterday, vice president of the European Commission for Values and
Transparency Věra [Jourová addressed]{.underline} the E.U.--U.S. Defense
and Future Forum in Washington, D.C. ["Do not throw away your shot, and
help us protect democracy from the risk coming from both the online and
offline world,"]{.underline} she urged attendees. She implored Americans
to take actions similar to those of the E.U. against "information
manipulation."

[Anyone who heard what Jourová had to say should be
**dubious**.]{.underline} Most countries in [the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [do **not share the same commitment to free
speech**]{.underline}, whether online or offline, and we in the United
States should not be taking advice from people who do not hold the right
as highly as we do.

Jourová's [comments come in the wake of the E.U.'s adoption of a
**Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation**, which will "be a
more efficient instrument in fighting disinformation" online. **What is
"disinformation,"** according to the code?]{.underline} [The E.U. uses
it as a **catch-all term** for "false or misleading information" spread
either **knowingly or unknowingly.**]{.underline} Like other measures of
this type, [the definition is **dangerously vague.**]{.underline} Most
of our social-media elites view the belief that "men can not become
women" as false or misleading.

[The code does include the caveat that regulatory efforts "should
strictly respect freedom of expression and include safeguards that
prevent their misuse."]{.underline} One such misuse would be "the
censoring of critical, satirical, dissenting, or shocking speech."
[Still, it makes a **sharp distinction** between **legitimate**
political speech and **impermissible** speech, and Europe and America
**disagree** on **where** to draw that **line.**]{.underline}

We can see an example in the speech laws of Jourová's home country, the
Czech Republic. Like many countries in Europe, [Czech law guarantees a
right to freedom of expression but then **waters it down** with
**exceptions.** Czechs may not instigate "**hatred** towards any nation,
race, ethnic group, religion, class or another group of people." Notice
the language; it does **not** prohibit specifically **violence**, but
all hatred.]{.underline}

This standard is expectedly un-American. **[Hating
anyone]{.underline}**, especially for immutable characteristics [is
immoral and unadvisable, but it **is a person's right**.]{.underline}
This is the moral imperative for protecting hateful speech, but there is
also a practical one. [**Allowing explicitly racist speech** -- "black
and white people are not equal to each other "-- **buffers legitimate
speech** on race issues -- "America is not systemically racist -- that
some may **falsely consider** to be **hateful.**]{.underline}

If we move a few miles to the West, we see similarly poor standards.
["Freedom of expression has its limits," said German]{.underline}
then-[chancellor Angela Merkel]{.underline} in a 2019 speech. ["Those
limits begin where hatred is spread. They begin where the dignity of
other people is violated."]{.underline} During her term as chancellor,
Merkel had enormous influence over the rest of the E.U., and [America
should look at the confederacy's speech recommendations with
**skepticism**]{.underline} when its former de facto leader holds these
standards of speech.

[The new person to hold]{.underline} that much [influence]{.underline}
over the E.U. [will]{.underline} likely [be]{.underline} newly reelected
French president [Emmanuel Macron, who is no defender of free speech,
either]{.underline}. Like other countries, [France says]{.underline}
that [it guarantees]{.underline} its citizens rights to [free
speech]{.underline}. Unlike the other countries, [however]{.underline},
instead of limiting or qualifying the right, [it just unapologetically
**infringes** on it.]{.underline} Most conspicuous is its [ban on
religious symbols]{.underline} in public buildings such as schools and
courtrooms, [which]{.underline} often [affects Muslim women]{.underline}
who wear hijabs. One of America's great virtues is its defense of the
rights of both political and religious minorities, something sorely
lacking across the Atlantic.

[America]{.underline} is exceptional in many ways, not least among them
in its commitment to the protection of First-Amendment rights. For that
reason, we [should be]{.underline} incredibly [**skeptical** when
bureaucrats who do not share our values]{.underline} want to preach to
us about controlling them.

Cultural institutions in the [US and Europe]{.underline} have the right,
of course, to express their symbolic opposition to the war by
[blacklist]{.underline}ing [Russian artists]{.underline}. However, they
must consider the full implications. Today's cultural institutions are
full of artists and performers from countries across the globe.
[**Should all these artists be held responsible** for the misdeeds of
their political leaders? **Should they be asked to publicly condemn
these leaders** when doing so **puts** them and members of **their
family at risk** of retaliation by their governments? Banning Russian
artists based on their]{.underline} political views or, worse, solely
because of their [nationality, while welcoming artists from

[The people of a nation are **not identical** with its leadership and

be **allies** in opposing a repressive regime from within.]{.underline}
Among the Russian [artists blacklisted]{.underline} today [are **people
who have been critical of the war.**]{.underline}

[US institutions have so far limited their action to artists who refuse
to condemn the regime]{.underline}, the more restrained path still
fraught with questions likely to haunt these institutions for a long
time. [Blacklisting artists based solely on their political views is a
**tactic associated with the Cold War and the McCarthy era.** That era
also demanded **"loyalty oaths"**]{.underline} -- similar to current
demands on artists to denounce the Putin regime or be canceled. [Only
this time artists are also asked to **face risks in their home country**
by making such denunciations.]{.underline}

[There are better ways for cultural institutions in Western democracies
to get involved in the current political crisis.]{.underline} Rather
than banning artists associated with Putin, [they should **support
dissident cultural workers** within Russia, as well as Ukrainian artists
and institutions, by **highlighting their work** and offering them
platforms to **amplify their voices**. If, after 30 years of open global
cultural exchange, **an iron curtain falls again**, art and cultural

It\'s easy to overstate, but attitudes towards freedom of action differ
in the United States and the European Union. [Americans tend to believe
that people have a right to make their own decisions and are better
trusted to do so than coercive governments; Europeans place more faith
in the state]{.underline}, allowing room for personal choice only after
officialdom installs guardrails and files away sharp edges. Yes, that
exaggerates the case and there are plenty of dissenters under both
systems, but it captures the treatment of speech and online conduct in
the EU\'s new Digital Services Act.

[\"Today\'s agreement on the Digital Services Act is
historic]{.underline}, both in terms of speed and of substance,\"
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen commented on April
23. \"The DSA will upgrade the ground-rules for all online services in
the EU. It will ensure that the online environment remains a safe space,
safeguarding freedom of expression and opportunities for digital
businesses. It gives practical effect to the principle that what is
illegal offline, should be illegal online. The greater the size, the
greater the responsibilities of online platforms.\"

There\'s a lot in the proposed law, as you would expect of wide-ranging
legislation paired with a companion bill addressing digital markets.
[The overall tone is of **micromanagement** of online spaces with **dire
consequences** for platforms that fail to protect users from \"illegal
and harmful content\"]{.underline} as [**defined** by the
**government.** Those who violate]{.underline} the [rules
by]{.underline}, for example, [repeatedly failing to scrub forbidden
material in timely fashion, face massive fines or expulsion from the EU
market.]{.underline} Of course, no matter official assurances, [speech
**hemmed** in by *red tape* and subject to official oversight in
monitored spaces **isn\'t** especially **\"free\"** at all, which is a
contradiction]{.underline} recognized by critics.

[\"The DSA does **not strike** the]{.underline} right [**balance**
between countering **genuine**]{.underline} online [harms and
**safeguarding free speech,\"**]{.underline} Jacob Mchangama, the
executive director of Copenhagen-based human-rights think tank Justitia,
warns in Foreign Policy. [\"It will]{.underline} most likely [result in
a **shrinking space** for **online expression**, as social media
companies are incentivized to delete massive amounts of perfectly legal
content.\"]{.underline}

Mchangama is the author of the recently published Free Speech: A History
From Socrates to Social Media, which Katrina Gulliver reviewed for the
May issue of Reason. He\'s familiar with differing attitudes towards
speech around the world. In particular, he understands that [the
American approach leaves speakers more room, while the European approach
favors those who impose constraints.]{.underline}

\"While free speech is protected by both the EU Charter of Fundamental
Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, these legal
instruments offer governments much greater leeway than the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution when it comes to defining categories,
such as hate speech, that can be regulated,\" he adds in the Foreign
Policy piece. \"Nor does European law provide as robust protection
against intermediary liability as Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act, which shields U.S. online platforms from liability for most
user-generated content.\"

[But the danger]{.underline} isn\'t just to Europeans who voice edgy
opinions or manage online forums; [it\'s to the whole world through the
*\"Brussels Effect.\"* That is, it\'s easier for large platforms like
Facebook to **apply Europe\'s tight rules to *everybody*** than it is
for them to vary rules by country, which is complicated]{.underline} and
risks the wrath of EU regulators [when speech inevitably **bleeds**
across **digital borders.**]{.underline}

Of course, some people hope that the Digital Services Act becomes a
global standard. Just as Mchangama is a European who sees free speech as
a right that favors the powerless over those in authority, there are
American fans of the EU approach who want officialdom to exercise more
control.

Reacting to the announced sale of Twitter to Elon Musk, The New
Yorker\'s John Cassidy objects that \"Musk seems intent on taking
Twitter back to the not at all distant era when social media was a
free-for-all.\" He sniffily dismisses that prospect as unacceptable. For
proper regulation of speech, he suggests \"the E.U. has just provided a
road map for how it could be done: by putting the onus on social-media
companies to monitor and remove harmful content, and hit them with big
fines if they don\'t.\"

\"Musk would surely object to the U.S. adopting a regulatory system like
the one that the Europeans are drawing up, but that\'s too bad. The
health of the Internet---and, most important, democracy---is too
significant to leave to one man, no matter how rich he is.\"

But, as the Competitive Enterprise Institute\'s Clyde Wayne Crews Jr.
warned in 2019, \"the dangers of social media company, legislative and
\'watchdog\'-backed mandates to censor speech and otherwise regulate
\'harmful content\' are themselves the harms facing the Internet of
today and the splinternet of tomorrow. Some authoritarian-minded
interventionists seek a pre-ordained deplatforming of unpopular ideas
and controversial debate and even pretend they protect democracy.\"

Such [restrictions put the **definition** of \"harmful\" in the
**hands** of **self-serving** political operatives and favor large
established and, yes, **rich companies**, for whom compliance is easier,
over smaller firms.]{.underline}

[\"Social media giants and international governments engaging in
**censorious**]{.underline} consultative [**alliances** and frameworks
incorporating politically derived norms **threaten free expression**
even in the U.S.,\"]{.underline} Crews added.

Justitia made a similar point about Germany\'s censorious 2017 NetzDG
law. \"In under a year, the number of countries copy-pasting the NetzDG
matrix to provide cover and legitimacy for digital censorship and
repression has almost doubled to a total of 25,\" the think tank noted.
The German law inspired copycat \"measures to combat vaguely defined
categories of hate speech and fake news by placing responsibility on the
social media platforms for user content.\"

Beyond the framework of individual rights, the practical argument for
free speech is that the powers-that-be can\'t be trusted to distinguish
\"good\" speech from \"bad speech\" and to ban only that which is
harmful. As Justitia emphasizes, that has already happened with NetzDG.
There\'s no reason to expect a less authoritarian outcome from the
Digital Services Act which borrows much from the German law.

Mchangama proposes using human-rights law as a benchmark for speech
regulation, though he concedes that it\'s \"not a panacea.\" More
promising is his suggestion for \"distributed content moderation\"
including \"voluntary filters that individual users could apply at
will.\" People could decide for themselves what is \"harmful\" and block
or engage as they pleased. That might satisfy everybody except those
most invested in controlling others.

[**Fans** of **regulated speech** always seem to envision the regulators
as sharing their own sensibilities in the exercise of censorship powers;
they **never imagine** themselves **being muzzled.**]{.underline} But
the \"free for all\" to which they object means freedom for them as much
as for everybody else, and if they get what they want they may come to
miss it as much as the rest of us.

I. SPEECH THAT CRITICIZES THE GOVERNMENT

The paradigm violation of the First Amendment is a law forbidding
citizens to criticize public officials and policies. In the entire
history of the United States, the national government has never
attempted to punish criticism of government officials or policies,
except in times of war. This makes clear that, [in order to understand
free speech, one must **understand free speech in
wartime.**]{.underline} War excites great passions. Thousands, perhaps
millions, of lives may be at risk. [The nation]{.underline} itself [may
be **at peril.** If ever there is a time to pull out all the stops, it
is surely in wartime.]{.underline} [In war, the government may conscript
soldiers]{.underline}, commandeer property, control prices, ration food,
[raise taxes, and freeze wages. May it also limit the freedom of
speech?]{.underline} It is often said that dissent in wartime is
disloyal. This claim puzzles civil libertarians, who see a clear
distinction. In their view, [dissent in wartime can be the **highest
form of patriotism.**]{.underline} Whether, when, for how long, and on
what terms to fight a war are among the most profound decisions a nation
encounters. [**A democratic society must debate those issues.** Dissent
that questions the conduct and morality of a war is, on this view, the
**very essence** of responsible and courageous
**citizenship.**]{.underline}

#### Democracy solves extinction

Carla Zoe **Cremer &** Luke **Kemp 21**, The Future of Humanity
Institute, Oxford. Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Cambridge.
\"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential
Risk\" <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2201/2201.11214.pdf> //pipk

[There is an intimate]{.underline} and neglected [relationship between
existential risk and democracy]{.underline}. **[Democracy must be
central to efforts to prevent and mitigate catastrophic
risks.]{.underline}** It is also an antidote to many of the problems
manifest in the TUA. Do those who study the future of humanity have good
grounds to ignore the visions, desires, and values of the very people
whose future they are trying to protect? [Choosing which risks to take
must be a democratic endeavour]{.underline}.

We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in accordance with Landemore
[as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively [diverse many who are
entitled to equal decision-making power and partake in a democratic
procedure that includes both a deliberative element and one of
preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority voting)45,115.
Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or non- democratic,
but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less democratic,
inclusive, and diverse.

We posit [three reasons]{.underline} for why we should democratise
research and decision-making in existential risk: [the nature of
collective decision-making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or crafting a desirable
long-term future, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**. Scholars of
existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo sapiens are
choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain views are
excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

**[Democracy will improve our judgments in both the governance and the
study of existential risks]{.underline}**. [Asking how our actions today
influence the long-term future is one of the most difficult intellectual
tasks to unravel, and if there is a right path, **democratic
procedures** will **have the best shot at finding it**]{.underline}.
Hong and Page116,117 demonstrate **[both theoretically and
computationally that a diverse group of problem-solving agents will show
greater accuracy than a less diverse group, even if the individual
members of the diverse group were each less accurate.]{.underline}**
**[Accuracy gains from diversity trump gains from improving individual
accuracy]{.underline}**. Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a
probabilistic argument that **[inclusive democracies will, in
expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies or even
the wise few]{.underline}**. This is [supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the
world]{.underline} 118. [In the long run, democracies should commit
fewer mistakes than alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}.
If this is true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decision-making. We are more likely to make accurate predictions about
the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if
the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional
structures, and avoids conflicts of interest.

Thereare many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects. To get close to replicating the cognitive diversity found among
humans, we must begin by inviting different thinkers with different
values and beliefs into the field.

**[Democracies can limit harms]{.underline}**. [Any approach to
mitigating existential threats could create response risks]{.underline},
and the TUA seems particularly vulnerable to this. [Despite good
intentions and curiosity-driven research, it could justify violence,
dangerous technological developments, or drastically constrain freedom
in favour of (perceived) security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore
ideas but minimise harms, [democracies can]{.underline} be used to
[moderate]{.underline} the [measures taken in response to harmful
ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for example, vanishingly unlikely that a
diverse group of thinkers or even ordinary citizens would entertain the
idea of sacrificing 1 billion living, breathing beings for an
infinitesimal improvement in reaching an intergalactic techno-utopia. In
contrast, the TUA could recommend this trade-off.

[The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}.

[Empirically]{.underline}, this fail-safe mechanism [seems to
work]{.underline}. [Even deeply imperfect democracies, like the ones we
inhabit now, often avert detrimental outcomes.]{.underline} [Democracies
prevent famines]{.underline} 119 (although not malnutrition)120. They
[make war]{.underline} --- a significant driver of GCRs --- [less
likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of diverse preferences in
democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved through women's
suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.underline}** 123--125, **[but
strong support for action against climate catastrophe]{.underline}**
126--128. We can further show that **[when citizens deliberately engage
with the subject at hand, their concern and readiness for action often
increases]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies on
climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes.

**[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought. Navigating humanity
through crises will involve many value-laden decisions under deep
uncertainty.]{.underline}** Democratic procedures can deal with such
hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be represented amongst
scholars of ERS. Recommendations on [policies that would reduce risk
should be passed through deliberative assemblies and await the approval
of a wider pool of ordinary citizens, as they will be the ones who will
bear this risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts attempting to
directly influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

As war envelops Ukraine, [Russian sources have strived to create a
**miasma** of disinformation about the invasion.]{.underline} Among
ample efforts to distort reality, [the Russian Ministry of Defense
**asserted** recently that **U.S.-backed labs** in Ukraine have been
**developing bioweapons.**]{.underline} Outlandish as this falsehood may
be, Fox's Tucker Carlson gave it credence by arguing that the U.S.
government's response was a "cover-up."

[As the Russia-Ukraine war intensifies, so too will]{.underline} the
flow of [disinformation. This is an **age-old strategy**]{.underline}
Russia has long history of employing, and a playbook that others, most
notably anti-vaccine activists, have borrowed from liberally. Yet,
[rather than focusing effort on convincing people of a falsehood, the
Russian strategy takes a tack reminiscent of a strategy long employed by
the tobacco industry: to sow **so much doubt**]{.underline} about what
is true [that it sends people into **decision paralysis.**]{.underline}
Faced with a cacophony of wild and conflicting claims, [people do
nothing, unsure of what is right.]{.underline}

Despite constituting only a small part of our media diet, disinformation
campaigns, in our digital world, can be devastatingly effective. [We are
intrinsically biased towards information that is **emotionally
visceral.** We afford more weight to content that **frightens** or
outrages us]{.underline}, with the ability to induce anger serving as
the single greatest predictor of whether content goes viral. [This
propels the most visceral, divisive narratives to the **forefront** of
discourse]{.underline}, creating a sound and fury of passionately
debated claims and counter claims. In that atmosphere, [it becomes
**increasingly difficult** to ascertain what to **believe**, and easy to
abandon]{.underline} the task of [discerning the truth.]{.underline}

If we are not to fall victim to such rank dishonesty, [it is crucial now
that we question our sources]{.underline} more [carefully]{.underline}
than ever before.

Indecision and distraction have long been central to Russia's
dezinformatsiya (disinformation) policy, a term Stalin himself is
credited with coining. While an ancient concept, [Russia]{.underline}
had by the imperial age mastered dark obfuscation techniques refined for
the era of mass communication. By the dawn of the Soviet empire, they
realized this potential on an industrial scale, [establishing the
world\'s first office dedicated to disinformation in 1923.]{.underline}
In the 1960s, the KGB covertly sponsored American fringe groups,
amplifying conspiratorial narratives about everything from the
assassination of president John F. Kennedy to water fluoridation.

The goal, as KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin elucidated in 1998, was "not
intelligence collection, but subversion: [active measures to **weaken**
the West, to **drive wedges** in the Western community alliances of all
sorts, particularly **NATO**, to **sow discord** among allies, to
**weaken** the United States **in the eyes** of the people of Europe,
Asia, Africa, Latin America\...."]{.underline}. [Operation
INFEKTION]{.underline}, a mid-1980s clandestine effort to spread the
myth that AIDS was a CIA-designed bioweapon, was but one infamous
exemplar. While utterly fictious, it [resonated with communities ravaged
by HIV and neglected by the callous indifference of the Reagan
administration.]{.underline} Despite Russian intelligence taking
responsibility for this lie in 1992, the legacy of AIDS denialism
persists to this day worldwide.

[During the Cold War]{.underline}, the doctrine of ["active measures"
was the **beating heart** of Soviet intelligence]{.underline}. This
philosophy of political and information warfare had wide remit,
including front groups, media manipulation, counterfeiting, infiltrating
peace groups and even the occasional assassination.

And in our media-saturated era, [Russia has been, by far,
disinformation's **most enthusiastic user.** Take the 2016 U.S.
presidential election and the contentious Brexit
referendum]{.underline}; Russia appears to have influenced both via lies
and distortions.

But disinformation is not solely confined to geopolitics. By summer
2020, the European Commission identified a concerted Russian drive to
propagate COVID disinformation worldwide. From the outset of the
pandemic, [Kremlin-backed]{.underline} troll farms pushed the narrative
that COVID was an engineered bioweapon, peddling the explosive [fiction
that **5G radio frequencies** caused the **virus**]{.underline}---a lie
that resulted in dozens of arson attacks on cell towers worldwide.

There is a dark irony in the observation that conspiracy-minded people
can be weaponized in plots to which they're entirely oblivious. The
enduring popularity of the virus-as-a-bioweapon mantra is a stark
reminder that in the age of social media, such manipulation has become
ever easier and more effective. Perhaps the most odious example of this
is the cynical rise of anti-vaccine propaganda.

The sheer efficacy of vaccination is scientifically incontrovertible,
and after clean water, immunization is the most life-saving intervention
in human history. Despite this, the last decade has witnessed
precipitous drops in vaccine confidence worldwide. The renaissance of
once-virtually-conquered diseases prompted the [WHO]{.underline} to
[declare vaccine hesitancy a **top-10 threat** to public
health]{.underline} in 2019.

Vaccine hesitancy is a spectrum rather than a simple binary, and
[exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories ***nudges*** recipients
towards rejection.]{.underline} But critically, [many who decline
vaccination are **not dyed-in-the-wool** anti-vaccine zealots, but
simply]{.underline} scared by what they have heard, [**unsure** what to
believe.]{.underline} Our tendency towards the illusory truth effect
exacerbates this inertia, as the mere repetition of a fiction is enough
to prime us to accept it, even if we know it to be false on an
intellectual level. [While Russia has often amplified anti-vaccine
conspiracy theories to increase tensions, the anti-vaccine movements
exist independently of these efforts,]{.underline} and are masters at
sowing the seeds of doubt with torrents of conflicting and emotive
claims.

[This illustrates]{.underline} the grim reality [that disinformation has
**no need for consistency** and **zero commitment to objective
reality**; claims are]{.underline} frequently [**contradictory**,
arguing **both sides** of the coin]{.underline} in exaggerated and
divisive ways. [This "Russian firehose" model]{.underline} of propaganda
[is **high-output**, **contradictory** and
**multichannel**]{.underline}. The stream encourages us to sleepwalk
into apathy, distrustful of everything. [This **renders us** supremely
**malleable**, and dangerously **disengaged**.]{.underline}

When it comes to vaccination, concerned parents often opt to stay with
the devil they know, delaying or even rejecting vaccination rather than
sifting through the symphony of conflicting claims to which they're
subjected. Similarly, the outpouring of fictions about Ukraine, its
president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and [the war is designed to **overwhelm
our capacity to analyze**, inducing us to **implicitly accept
uncertainty** over aggressor and aggrieved---a manufactured doubt
benefitting Russia and other nations.]{.underline}

[**Conviction** is **not** the chief **goal** of disinformation;
**instilling doubt is**. This is why anti-vaccine activists have been so
**successful online**, and why **Russian troll-farms** push **ample
resources** into **hawking lies** virtually everywhere. The ubiquity of
these fictions gives them]{.underline} an implicit veneer of
[legitimacy, fueling polarization and distrust.]{.underline}

[This is the strategy Putin **continues to pursue**]{.underline};
already [Russian propaganda has tried to **paint Ukraine** (or NATO /
America) as **aggressors** with **staged disinformation.**]{.underline}
This has been rendered less effective by the Biden administration's
creative approach of releasing intelligence prior to the operation.

doubt, efforts that **will** only **intensify**]{.underline} as the war
wages on. [**Truth**, the old adage insists, is the first **casualty of

[Open source intelligence can be **vital** in the fight against

assesses the impact of novel and emerging technologies on the spread of
false information during the Ukraine war. [While open data can be
harnessed positively to fight disinformation, those deploying it must
also be **aware of the risks**, security experts say.]{.underline}

[The report]{.underline}, entitled 'The Information Battlefield:
Disinformation, declassification and deepfakes' [was
released]{.underline} today [to mark the]{.underline} launch of the
Centre for Emerging Technology and Security ([CfETS]{.underline}), [a
new research centre at the Alan Turing Institute for
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence [which aims to boost
the UK's security by giving policy makers **better information** about
**emerging technologies.**]{.underline}

CfETS will aim to take an 'innovative approach' in a bid to help
'maintain the UK as a leading voice in international security'.

["The launch of this centre comes at a crucial time -- technology is
advancing at an increasingly rapid rate and emerging technologies
present both opportunities and threats to UK national
security,"]{.underline} said Sir Adrian Smith, director of The Alan
Turing Institute. "Our centre will bring together defence and security
expertise from around the world to ensure that policymakers have access
to the highest quality analysis and research. It will provide us with
new opportunities to keep the UK safe."

Open source intelligence and the war in Ukraine

The inaugural report from CfETS looks at the role of [disinformation
used by Russia during the war in Ukraine, and how emerging technologies
have helped and hindered its spread. Russia]{.underline} has
[used]{.underline} well-[established tactics to try and influence both
Russian and Ukrainian citizens, spreading disinfo]{.underline}rmation
[through social media using misleading posts and videos.]{.underline}

Open source intelligence (OSINT), publicly available data which can be
analysed by professionals and citizens alike, has played a significant
role in countering these false statements. "Data about this conflict
have been more accessible to western audiences than ever before,"
explain the authors. "Commercial satellite imagery showed Russia's
military build up around Ukraine's borders in the weeks preceding the
invasion."

They cite the example of Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management
System, which uses satellite imagery to detect active fires. It showed
in near real-time the location of heat spots indicative of Russian
attacks, at a time when the Russian government was denying the war and
blaming attacks on Ukrainian terrorist groups.

"I think [open source intelligence is one of the biggest **thorns** in
the **Russian side**,"]{.underline} says Alexi Drew, senior analyst in
defence, security and infrastructure at thinktank RAND Europe.
["Particularly in the way that we've adapted to debunking and
pre-emptively engaging with some of the false narratives that Russia has
tried to set loose on the international stage."]{.underline}

This effort has been encouraged by Western intelligence agencies
declassifying and releasing sensitive material into the public domain,
the report says. "By outlining Russia's plans for invasion and revealing
Russia's attempts at falsifying a pretext for action, these
declassifications have helped to counter Russia's disinformation among
Western audiences," it says.

[Facebook's poorly implemented content moderation strategies leave those
most at risk of real-world violence **unprotected** and consistently
succeed at only one thing: angering everyone.]{.underline}

Last October, I came forward with a simple message:
[Facebook]{.underline} knew it [was **cutting corners** to make more
money]{.underline}, and the public was paying the price. In over 20,000
pages of documents that I disclosed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission and to Congress, the public learned what Facebook already
knew --- [its products were **spurring hate and division**]{.underline},
leading teenagers into rabbit holes of self-harm and anorexia, leaving
millions of users without basic safety systems for hate speech or
violence incitement and, at times, were [even used to **sell humans**

Global companies had chosen profit-maximizing strategies at the expense
of the public interest before. We've seen it with pollution in the

How the new European law is carried out will be just as important as
passing it. It is a broad and comprehensive set of rules and standards,
not unlike food safety standards for cleanliness and allergen labeling.
But what is also remarkable about it is that it focuses on oversight of
the design and implementation of systems (like how algorithms behave)
rather than determining what is good or bad speech.

The law requires that Facebook and other large social platforms be
transparent about what content is being amplified and shared virally
across the platform. And it must apply consumer protections to features
that, among other things, spy on users, addict kids or weaken public
safety. With transparency finally required, it will be easier for
European regulators and civil society to verify that companies are
following the rules.

These rules are like systems in the United States that compel
pharmaceutical companies to keep drugs safe and to allow the Food and
Drug Administration to independently verify the results. Most people
aren't aware of them, but we're all glad they are there.

[The new requirement for access to data will allow **independent
research** into the impact of social media products on public health and
welfare.]{.underline} For example, Facebook, Instagram and others will
have to open up the black box of which pages, posts and videos get the
most likes and shares --- shining light on the outcomes of the
algorithms.

This will allow thousands more people, not just those who work at these
companies, to address the complex problems of how information markets
change social outcomes. As an algorithmic specialist and data scientist,
I'm most excited by this. No longer will we depend on taking the
companies' word for it when they say they are trying to fix a safety
problem. Democratic and investor accountability and oversight of big
companies boils down to whether we can accurately diagnose the problems
their products are causing, devise solutions and verify that the
industry is actually following through with them. The era of "just trust
us" is over.

Why did this happen in Europe? Why not right here in America, which
birthed these incredible technologies? Europe knows Facebook's
censorship strategies fail societies where many languages are spoken
because they require censorship systems to be built one language at a
time. Only the strategy of focusing on product safety works equitably in
every language, even less-spoken ones.

[Europe is approving changes Congress has been trying to secure --- with
a slate of bipartisan bills --- for several years.]{.underline} But, in
the United States, Facebook's and Instagram's owner, Meta, invests
heavily in lobbyists and communications specialists in response to
concerns about hate speech, conspiracy theories and misinformation.

[The industry has **falsely framed** the way forward as a choice between
**free speech** and **safety.**]{.underline} Meta claims it would love
for everyone to be safe, but that safety would come at the cost of free
speech. [The documents in my disclosures paint a different picture: Meta
knows that the product choices it's made give the most reach to the most
divisive and extreme ideas, and it knows how to unwind those choices to
prioritize having **human judgment** direct our attention **instead of
just computers.** Ideas include **cracking down on robots** that
**amplify disinformation**, requiring users to **click a link before
resharing it**, or helping more intentionally drive the distribution of
information by having users copy/paste content shared outside friends of
friends. These are **product choices** that can **reduce** hate speech,
harmful content and **misinformation.**]{.underline}

So [why hasn't Facebook fully implemented them? These changes add
friction and **slightly delay** the spread of **content**]{.underline},
which also means slightly slowing down the growth of Facebook's profits.
[Facebook's **laser focus** on **quarterly returns** has stolen an
opportunity to build for long-term success]{.underline}; we're more
likely to be using Facebook 10 years from now if it's safe and enjoyable
to use. [**Arguing** over censorship works only to **further Facebook's
self-interest** --- while also wrapping our friends, neighbors and
legislators into **angry knots** that are impossible to
untie.]{.underline}

III\. HRBADs and Organisational Change Logically preceding a solid
understanding of the complexity of social change is the need to better
understand what it takes [for an organisation to introduce an
HRBAD]{.underline} with a view to bring about social change successfully
in the first place. Both in change theory and organisations theory, it
has been emphasised that [views on change and on how organisations
change are very often based on **implicit assumptions**.]{.underline}
Both sets of [theories also point out the **complexity** of
(organisational) change]{.underline}, and [the existence of many
different and often **competing approaches** or **"schools"**, with some
emphasising **structural constraints**]{.underline} (i.e. constraints
based on durable social structures) [and others **individual
agency**]{.underline}. Both dimensions are important and often operate
in tandem.33 Moreover, a distinction is to be made between formal
structure and actual day-to-day activities, [for the assumption that
organisations function according to **formal blueprints** is **not
supported** by empirical research]{.underline},34 hence [the emphasis
again on the **need** for much **more empirical work**]{.underline}. In
the case example of UNICEF that follows, we look in particular into
internal reflection and planning, and leadership and true believers as
explanatory entry points for the (lack of) organisational change
accompanying the introduction of an HRBAD. [In addition to]{.underline}
these [drivers of change]{.underline}, we shall [pay attention to the
**spoilers** of change, such as lack of **capacity** or staff
**turnover**, and to the **tension** between HRBAD and RBM]{.underline}.
Attempts at [introducing HRBAD by the UN]{.underline} at the country
level by states and by non-governmental organisations seem to [show
similar trends]{.underline} at first sight, though much more research is
needed before firm conclusions can be reached.
