### File Navigation + Strategy Tips

Pro-tips:

- Make sure you integrate the applicable cards from various feminist IR
  files. For example, most of the link cards in those files can serve as
  Ks of disads for this aff.

- You should also integrate generic cards from other files. We've done
  this for most other relevant files, but there may be other useful
  cards we missed. For example, a lot of the ethical AI aff/neg cards
  will be useful.

[Many such technologies are already in use. Many more are right around
the corner. And because of our singular focus on headline-grabbing
killer robots, they have largely gone ignored.]{.underline}¶ Militaries
and spy services have long been developing and deploying [software for
autonomously finding "unknown unknowns"---potential targets who would
have otherwise slipped by unnoticed in the torrent of data from their
growing surveillance arsenals. One particularly spooky strand of
research seeks to build algorithms that tip human analysts off to such
targets by singling out cars driving suspiciously around a surveilled
city.]{.underline}¶ [Other lethality-enabling technologies can translate
intercepted communications, synthesize intelligence reports, and predict
an adversary's next move---all of which are similarly crucial steps in
the lead-up to a strike. Even many entry-level surveillance devices on
the market today, such as targeting cameras, come with standard features
for automated tracking and detection.]{.underline}¶ For its part, the
U.S. [Department of Defense, whose self-imposed rules for autonomous
weapons specifically exempt nonlethal systems, is allowing algorithms
dangerously close to the trigger.]{.underline} The Army wants to equip
tanks with computer vision that identifies "objects of interest"
(translation: potential targets) along with recommendation
algorithms---kind of like Amazon's---that advise weapons operators
whether to destroy those objects with a cannon or a gun, or by calling
in an airstrike. [All of these technologies fall outside the scope of
the international debate]{.underline} on killer robots. [But their
effects could be just as dangerous]{.underline}.¶ [The widespread use of
sophisticated autonomous aids in war would be fraught with unknown
unknowns. An algorithm with the power to suggest whether a tank should
use a small rocket or a fighter jet to take out an enemy could mark the
difference between life and death]{.underline} for anybody who happens
to be in the vicinity of the target. An algorithm with the power to
suggest whether a tank should use a small rocket or a fighter jet to
take out an enemy could mark the difference between life and death for
anybody who happens to be in the vicinity of the target. But different
systems could perform that same calculation with widely diverging
results. Even the [reliability of a single given algorithm could vary
wildly depending on the quality of the data it ingests.]{.underline}¶
[It is also difficult to know whether lethality-enabling artificial
intelligence---prone as computers are to bias---would contravene or
reinforce those human passions that all too often lead to erroneous or
illegal killings. Nor is there any consensus as to how to ensure that a
human finger on the trigger can be counted on as a reliable check
against the fallibility of its algorithmic enablers.]{.underline}¶ As
such, in the absence of standards on such matters, not to mention
protocols for algorithmic accountability, there is [no good way to
assess whether a bad algorithmically enabled killing came down to poor
data, human error, or a deliberate act of aggression against a protected
group.]{.underline}¶ [A well-intentioned military actor could be led
astray by a deviant algorithm and not know it; but just as easily, an
actor with darker motives might use algorithms as a convenient veil for
an intentionally insidious decisions.]{.underline}¶ Automation's vast
potential to make humans more efficient extends to the very human act of
committing war crimes.¶ If one system offers up a faulty conclusion, it
could be easy to catch the mistake before it does any harm. But [these
algorithms won't act alone.]{.underline} A few months ago, the U.S. Navy
tested a network of three AI systems, mounted on a satellite and two
different airplanes, that collaboratively found an enemy ship and
decided which vessel in the Navy's fleet was best placed to destroy it,
as well as what missile it should use. The one human involved in this
kill chain was a commanding officer on the chosen destroyer, whose only
job was to give the order to fire.¶ Eventually, [the lead-up to a strike
may involve dozens or hundreds of separate algorithms, each with a
different job, passing findings not just to human overseers but also
from machine to machine. Mistakes could accrue; human judgment and
machine estimations would be impossible to parse from one another; and
the results]{.underline} could be [wildly unpredictable.]{.underline}¶
These questions are even more troubling when you consider how [central
s]{.underline}uch technologies will become [to all future military
operations. As the technology proliferates, even morally upstanding
militaries may have to rely on autonomous assistance, in spite of its
many risks, just to keep ahead of their less scrupulous AI-enabled
adversaries.]{.underline}¶ Once an AI system can navigate complicated
circumstances more intelligently than any team of soldiers, the human
will have no choice but to take its advice on trust¶ And [once an AI
system can navigate complicated circumstances more intelligently than
any team of soldiers, the human will have no choice but to take its
advice on trust]{.underline}---or, as one thoughtful participant at a
recent U.S. Army symposium put it, targeting will become a matter of
simply pressing the "I-believe button." In such a context, assurances
from top brass that their machines will never make the ultimate lethal
decision seem a little beside the point.

#### Lethal autonomous weapons are impossible to ban but trying to ban them trades off with countermeasures. 

**Scharre, 17** \[Paul Scharre is the vice president and director of
studies at the Center for a New American Security, 12-22-2017, accessed

https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-you-shouldnt-fear-slaughterbots\]/ISEE

Killer drones in the hands of terrorists massacring innocents. Robotic
weapons of mass destruction breeding chaos and fear. A video created by
advocates of a ban on autonomous weapons would have you believe this
dystopian future is right around the corner if we don\'t act now. The
short video, called "Slaughterbots,\" was released last month coinciding
with United Nations meetings on autonomous weapons. The UN meetings
ended inconclusively, but the video is getting traction. It\'s gotten
over 2 million views and has sparked dozens of news stories. As a piece
of propaganda, it works great. As a substantive argument for a ban on
autonomous weapons, the video fails miserably. Obviously, a world in
which terrorists can unleash swarms of killer drones on innocent
civilians would be terrible, but is the future the video depicts
realistic? The movie\'s slick production quality helps to gloss over its
leaps of logic. It immerses the viewer in a dystopian nightmare, but
let\'s be clear[: It\'s very much science fiction.]{.underline} The
central premise of "Slaughterbots\" is that in the future militaries
will build autonomous microdrones with shaped charges that can fly up to
someone\'s head and detonate an explosive, killing the person. In the
film, these "slaughterbots\" quickly fall into the hands of terrorists,
resulting in mass killings worldwide. The lethal microdrones depicted in
"Slaughterbots\" use facial recognition to identify their targets, then
fly up to them and detonate shaped explosives.Image:
Slaughterbots/YouTube The basic concept is grounded in technical
reality. In the real world, the Islamic State has used off-the-shelf
quadcopters equipped with small explosives to attack Iraqi troops,
killing or wounding dozens of Iraqi soldiers. Today\'s terrorist drones
are largely remotely controlled, but hobbyist drones are becoming
increasingly autonomous. The latest models can navigate to a fixed
target on their own, avoid obstacles, and autonomously track and follow
moving objects. A small drone equipped with facial recognition
technology could potentially be used to autonomously search for and kill
specific individuals, as "Slaughterbots\" envisions. It took me just a
few minutes of searching online to find the resources necessary to
download and train a free neural network to do facial recognition. So
while no one has yet cobbled the technology together in the way the
video depicts, all of the components are real. I want to make something
very clear: [There is nothing we can do to [keep]{.mark} that
[underlying technology out of the hands of]{.mark} would-be
[terrorists]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is upsetting, but it\'s very
important to understand. [Just like how terrorists can and do use cars
to ram crowds of civilians, the underlying **[tech]{.mark}nology** [to
turn]{.mark} hobbyist [drones into crude autonomous weapons is already
too **ubiquitous** to stop]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is a genuine
problem, and the [best response is to [focus on defensive measures to
counter]{.mark} drones [along with surveillance]{.mark} to catch
would-be terrorists ahead of time.]{.underline} The "Slaughterbots\"
video takes this problem and blows it out of proportion, however,
suggesting that drones would be used by terrorists as robotic weapons of
mass destruction, killing thousands of people at a time. Fortunately,
this nightmare scenario is about as likely to happen as HAL 9000 locking
you out of the pod bay doors. The technology shown in the video is
plausible, but basically everything else is a bunch of malarkey. The
video assumes the following: These assumptions range from questionable,
at best, to completely fanciful. Of course, the video is fictional, and
defense planners do often use fictionalized scenarios to help
policymakers think through plausible events that may occur. As a defense
analyst at a think tank and in my prior job as a strategic planner at
the Pentagon, I used fictional scenarios to help inform choices about
what technologies the United States military should invest in. To be
useful, however, these scenarios need to at least be plausible. They
need to be something that could happen. The scenario depicted in the
"Slaughterbots\" video fails to account for political and strategic
realities about how governments use military technology. First, [[there
is no evidence]{.mark} that governments are [plan]{.mark}ning [to
mass-produce small drones to kill civilians]{.mark} in large
numbers]{.underline}. In my forthcoming book, Army of None: Autonomous
Weapons and the Future of War, I examine next-generation weapons being
built in defense labs around the world. Russia, China, and the United
States are all racing ahead on autonomy and artificial intelligence. But
the types of weapons they are building are generally aimed at fighting
other militaries. [They are "counter-force\" weapons, not
"counter-value\" weapons that would target civilians. Counter-force
autonomous weapons raise their own sets of concerns, but they aren\'t
designed for mass targeting of civilians, nor could they be easily
repurposed to do so.]{.underline} Second, in the video, we\'re told the
drones can defeat "any countermeasure.\" TV pundits scream, "We can\'t
defend ourselves.\" This isn\'t fiction; it\'s farce. [Every military
technology has a countermeasure, and countermeasures against small
drones aren\'t even hypothetical. T]{.underline}he U.S. government is
actively working on ways to shoot down, jam, fry, hack, ensnare, or
otherwise defeat small drones. The microdrones in the video could be
defeated by something as simple as chicken wire. The video shows
heavier-payload drones blasting holes through walls so that other drones
can get inside, but the solution is simply layered defenses. Military
analysts look at the cost-exchange ratio between offense and defense,
and in this case, the costs heavily favor static defenders. In a world
where terrorists launch occasional small-scale attacks using DIY drones,
people are unlikely to absorb the inconveniences of building robust
defenses, just like people don\'t wear body armor to protect against the
unlikely event of being caught in a mass shooting. But if an enemy
country built hundreds of thousands of drones to wipe out a city, you
bet there\'d be a run on chicken wire. The video takes a plausible
problem---terrorist attacks with drones---and scales it up without
factoring in how others would respond. If lethal microdrones were built
en masse, defenses and countermeasures would be a national priority, and
in this case the countermeasures are simple. Any weapon that can be
defeated by a net isn\'t a weapon of mass destruction. Third, the video
assumes that [[militaries are incapable]{.mark} of preventing terrorists
[from getting access to military-grade weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
[we don\'t give terrorists hand grenades, rocket launchers, or machine
guns today.]{.underline} Terrorist attacks [with drones are a concern
precisely because they involve DIY explosives strapped to readily
available technology]{.underline}. This is a genuine problem, but again
the video scales this threat up in ways that are unrealistic. Even if
militaries were to build lethal microdrones, terrorists are no more
likely to get their hands on large numbers of them than other military
technologies. Weapons do proliferate over time to nonstate actors in war
zones, but just because antitank guided missiles are prevalent in Syria
doesn\'t mean they\'re commonplace in New York. Terrorists use airplanes
and trucks for attacks precisely because successfully smuggling
military-grade weapons into a Western country isn\'t that easy. In
"Slaughterbots,\" AI-powered microdrones are built en masse, and there
seems to be no defenses and countermeasures to stop them.Image:
Slaughterbots/YouTube Fourth, [the video assumes terrorists can carry
out coordinated attacks at a scale that is not plausible. In one scene,
two men release a swarm of about 50 drones from the back of a
van.]{.underline} This specific scene is fairly realistic; one of the
challenges of autonomy is that a small group of people could launch a
larger attack than might otherwise be possible. Something like a truck
full of 50 drones is a reasonable possibility. Again, though, the video
takes this scenario to the absurd. The video claims that 8,300 people
are killed in simultaneous attacks. If the men in the van depict a
typical attack, then this level of casualties would equate to over 160
coordinated attacks worldwide. Terrorist groups often launch coordinated
attacks, but usually on the scale of single digit numbers of attacks.
The video assumes not just superweapons but ones that are in the hands
of supervillains. The movie uses hype and fear to skip past these
crucial assumptions, and in doing so it undermines any rational debate
about the risk of terrorists acquiring autonomous weapons. The video
makes clear we\'re supposed to be afraid. But what are we supposed to be
afraid of? A weapon that chooses its own targets (which the video is
actually ambiguous about)? A weapon with no countermeasure? The fact
that terrorists can get ahold of the weapon? The ability of autonomy to
scale up attacks? If you want to drum up fears of "killer robots,\" the
video is great. But as a substantive analysis of the issue, it falls
apart under even the most casual scrutiny. The video doesn\'t put
forward an argument. It\'s sensationalist fear-mongering. Of course, the
whole purpose of the video is to scare the viewer into action. The video
concludes with UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell warning of the
dangers of autonomous weapons and imploring the viewer to act now to
stop this nightmare from becoming a reality. I have tremendous respect
for Stuart Russell, both as an artificial intelligence researcher and as
a contributor to the debate on autonomous weapons. I\'ve hosted Russell
at events at the Center for a New American Security, where I run a
research program on artificial intelligence and global security. I have
no doubt Russell\'s views are sincere. But in attempting to persuade the
viewer, the video makes assumptions that are not supportable. [Even
worse, the proposed solution---a legally binding treaty[bann]{.mark}ing
[autonomous weapons---**won\'t** solve the real problems]{.mark}
**humanity** faces as autonomy advances in weapons. A ban
[won\'t]{.mark} stop [**terrorists** from fashioning crude DIY
**robotic** weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nor would a [[ban on the kinds
of weapons]{.mark} the video imagines do anything to address the risks
that arise from counter-force autonomous weapons.]{.underline} (In fact,
it\'s not even clear whether a ban would prohibit the weapons shown in
the video, which are actually fairly discriminate.) By focusing on
extreme and implausible scenarios, [the video actually [**undermines**
progress on real concerns about autonomous weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Nations who are leading developers of robotic weapons are likely to
dismiss the fears raised in "Slaughterbots\" out of hand. The video
plays into the hands of those who argue that these fears of autonomous
weapons are overhyped and irrational. Autonomous weapons raise important
questions about compliance with the laws of war, risk, and
controllability, and the role of humans as moral agents in warfare.
These are important issues that merit serious discussion. When Russell
and others engage in spirited debate on these topics, I welcome the
conversation. But that\'s not what "Slaughterbots\" is. The video has
succeeded in grabbing media attention, but its sensationalism undercuts
the kind of serious intellectual discourse that is actually needed on
autonomous weapons.

**De Carvalho, 18** \[Juliana Santos de Carvalho is a research associate
at the Public International Law and Policy Group, Spring Issue 2018,
accessed on 6-21-2022, Amsterdam Law Review, "A Male Future? An Analysis
on the Gendered Discourses Regarding Lethal Autonomous Weapons",
<https://amsterdamlawforum.org/articles/10.37974/ALF.320/galley/450/download/>\]/ISEE

The current examination of the inter-relations between [[**gendered**
discourses]{.mark} and robotic **[warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline} is
focused on [their ability to [**mutually** shape and influence **each**
other]{.mark}]{.underline}. To comprehend such [relation]{.underline}
[between gendered [**discourses** and robotic
**warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}, there is a need to first understand
some key-theoretical concepts from [which feminist literature on
**[war]{.mark}** and [militarism]{.mark} [stems]{.mark}]{.underline},
namely the idea of [hegemonic masculinity and its **interplay** with
militarisation/militaris]{.underline}m. To understand hegemonic
masculinity, [the concept of gender **performativity** is
pivotal]{.underline}. Pursuant to the [theoretical prepositions of
philosopher and gender theorist]{.underline} Judith Butler, [gender does
not follow from sex or "natur]{.underline}e". Rather, it is
[performatively and socially produced, as well as enforced by „the
**regulatory** practices of gender **coherence**‟]{.underline}.
Masculine and feminine attributes are so[cially constructed within
frames of]{.underline} masculine [domination]{.underline}, which in turn
operate through [[regulated **processes** of repetition that
consolidate]{.mark} and perpetuate [**gender**
hierarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Within this context, "hegemonic
masculinity" is a constructed and idealised notion of certain attributes
socially linked to the male gender, which subordinates and marginalises
all other practices that do not conform to such ideal. Scholar Frank J.
Barrett explains that the current [hegemonic ideal of
[masculinity]{.mark} in Western societies is that of the
[**independent**, risk-taking, aggressive]{.mark}, heterosexual and
rational [man]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, a hierarchy is created
not only between women and men, but also between the men who are
coherent with hegemonic masculinity ideals and those who are not. In
this regard, current hegemonic masculinity language applied to the
military can actually demean and criticise robotic warfare. As these
novel military technologies require no physical strength, no courage to
"be in the battlefield" and no risk for the individual soldier, it
alleviates the "dirty work of war", and therefore can be considered as
coward and feminine. A very telling example of this is the case of the
"Nintendo Medal", as explained by professor in women and gender studies
Lorraine Bayard de Volo. In this instance, Leon Panetta, U.S Secretary
of Defence in 2013, had proposed the Distinguished Warfare Medal to laud
robotic pilots for "extraordinary achievements". However, the medal was
met with a huge backlash from the overall military community, as they
argued that medals of honour should not be endowed to coward
"button-pushers". This is particularly interesting when one analyses the
role of "sacrifice" to the "formation of the soldier-citizen as an
archetype of heroic masculinity". As explained by gender studies scholar
Bianca Baggiarini, [military [sacrifice]{.mark} [publicises the
death]{.mark}, injury and suffering of [soldiers]{.mark} that put
**themselves** in harm's way for the „[greater good of the national
communit]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark} and subsequently [the life of
the body **politic**]{.underline}‟. [Soldier's]{.underline} lives then
[become gendered, as their value is located in the **public**
sphere]{.underline} -- often seen as the „male‟ realm, in contrast to
the private, family and domestic domain associated with [feminine
roles]{.underline}. This does not mean to say that [such **sacrificial**
effort is expected only from male-bodied soldiers]{.underline}: this is
an [overarching **gendering** of the commitment of soldiers -- male and
female]{.underline} -- to take risks for the national good, which
grounds itself in the masculinised domain of the public to validate such
endeavour. [[**Drone** war,]{.mark} for its turn, [can]{.mark} [distance
the **military**]{.mark} enterprise from "public sacrifice", and
[potentially "**emasculate**" military heroism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Commission]{.underline}** \"The Commission is not glorifying the
prospect of AI-enabled warfare, \[but\] [adopting AI for defense and
security purposes is an urgent national imperative.\"]{.underline}
WASHINGTON: The [US military should adopt artificial intelligence
urgently without letting debates over ethics and human control "paralyze
AI development]{.underline}," a congressionally mandated panel says.
"[In light of the choices being made by our strategic competitors, the
United States must also examine AI through a military lens]{.underline},
including concepts for AI-enabled autonomous operations." (Emphasis
ours). In what will likely be controversial on Capitol Hill, the interim
report released yesterday by the the [bipartisan National Security
Commission on Artificial Intelligence is full-throated in its defense of
the pursuit of autonomous, AI-driven military systems as not only
ethical but essential for future US military operations.]{.underline}
Even in the military, some commanders have been publicly reluctant to
trust AI --- especially for anything related to nuclear weapons. \[Read
about the independent Defense Innovation Board's call for ethical
military AI\] Notably, nowhere does commission use the phrase 'human in
the loop,' the language currently favored by the Pentagon to assert that
a human would always have ultimate control over any autonomous system."
That phrase, in turn, is an oversimplification of the current Department
of Defense policy on autonomous systems, DoD Instruction 3000.9 ---
which also goes remarkably unmentioned, referenced in a single footnote
to one of its 101 pages. "[Ethics and strategic necessity are compatible
with one another]{.underline}," the report says. "Defense and national
security agencies [must develop and deploy AI in a responsible, trusted,
and ethical manner]{.underline}.... [Everyone desires safe, robust, and
reliable AI systems free of unwanted bias, and recognizes today's
technical limitations. Everyone wants to establish thresholds for
testing and deploying AI systems worthy of human trust and to ensure
that humans remain responsible for the outcomes of their
use.]{.underline} Some disagreements will remain, but the Commission is
[concerned that debate will paralyze AI development."]{.underline}
"[Inaction on AI development raises as many ethical challenges as AI
deployment]{.underline}," the report continues. "There is an ethical
imperative to accelerate the fielding of safe, reliable, and secure AI
systems that can be demonstrated to protect the American people,
minimize operational dangers to U.S. service members, and make warfare
more discriminating, which could reduce civilian casualties." "[Adopting
AI for defense and security purposes is an urgent national
imperative]{.underline}," is one of the seven consensus-agreed
principles agreed to be the commissioners. "The Commission is not
glorifying the prospect of AI-enabled warfare," they write. "But new
technology is almost always employed for the pursuit of power. In light
of the choices being made by our strategic competitors, the United
States must also examine AI through a military lens, including concepts
for AI-enabled autonomous operations." The [concept]{.underline} of
fully autonomous weapon systems [is highly controversial]{.underline},
both in the US and among US allies. As we reported back in August, the
International Campaign to Stop Killer Robots nearly doubled its
membership over the past year, to 113 NGOs in 57 countries as well as
The Vatican and Palestinian Authority. A total of 90 nations have called
for negotiations towards some kind of ban. In addition, an August report
by the Congressional Research Service found that there is a widespread
consensus at the United Nations that "appropriate levels of human
judgement must be maintained" over any lethal autonomous weapon even
though there is not agreement on a ban. The commission's seven guiding
principles were agreed as a method for shaping the robust US debate
about the linkage of AI to national defense and military systems, the
report explains. Others include making global leadership a national
security priority with a robust government investment strategy in order
to maintain the US technological edge; investing in domestic STEM
eduction and recruiting foreign talent; and maintaining free and open
academic research. The commission stressed, however, that the 101-page
report is not final and thus does not make "final recommendations,
suggest major organizational changes, or propose specific investment
priorities in rank order attached to dollar figures." The final report
is due to Congress in October 2020. NSSL 7 may 2020 ULA pic Recommended
With billions at stake, lobbying heats up for future rights to Space
Force launches "Key for us is allowing on-ramps, allowing for some
smaller launches to have a chance," a senior Space Force official told
Breaking Defense, in order to avoid billion-dollar "Titan-era prices."
By THERESA HITCHENS The commission was established by the 2019 National
Defense Authorization Act. Chaired by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt,
who also chairs DoD's Defense Innovation Board, it has 15 members
including Bob Work, former DoD deputy secretary who serves as vice
chairman. "[The development of AI will shape the future of
power]{.underline}," the report states bluntly. "The nation with the
most resilient and productive economic base will be best positioned to
seize the mantle of world leadership. That [base increasingly depends on
the strength of the innovation economy, which in turn will depend on AI.
AI will drive waves of advancement in commerce, transportation, health,
education, financial markets, government, and national
defense."]{.underline} It identifies "five fundamental lines of effort
that are necessary to preserve U.S. advantages: [Invest in AI Research
and Development (R&D); Apply AI to National Security Missions; Train and
Recruit AI Talent; Protect and Build Upon U.S. Technology Advantages;
and Marshal Global AI Cooperation."]{.underline} The report explains
that the commission's work so far has focused on four major issues:
foreign threats to our national security in the current AI era; [how AI
can improve the government's ability to defend the country, cooperate
with allies, and preserve a favorable balance of military power in the
world; the relationship between AI and economic competitiveness as a
component of national security, including the strength of our scientific
research community and our larger workforce; and ethical considerations
in fielding AI systems for national security purposes.]{.underline}
Threats posed by AI misuse, the report says, include disinformation that
undermine democratic systems; erosion of privacy and civil liberties;
increasing cyber attacks; and increased potential for catastrophic
accidents. It also posits the benefits of AI for homeland defense, the
Intelligence Community (IC) and the military: For homeland defense, the
report says, **[AI-enable tools can assist with border protections,
cybersecurity, protection of critical infrastructure and natural
disaster response]{.underline}**. For the Intelligence Community, "**[AI
algorithms can sift through vast amounts of data to find patterns,
detect threats, and identify correlations. AI tools can make satellite
imagery, communications signals, economic indicators, social media data,
and other large sources of information more intelligible. AI-enabled
analysis can provide faster and more precise situational awareness that
supports higher quality decision-making]{.underline}."** On future
battlefields, the [**military "could use AI-enabled machines, systems,
and weapons to understand the battlespace more quickly; develop a common
joint operating picture more rapidly; make relevant decisions faster;
mount more complex multi-domain operations in contested environments;
put fewer U.S. service members at risk; and protect innocent lives and
reduce collateral damage."**]{.underline} Of course, if those
applications, however appealing, require relinquishing or even reducing
human control, the controversy will be intense.

points that suggest LAWS would make wars worse: • LAWS have limited
judgment and common sense, which will lead to errors and to carrying out
orders that violate the law of war. • Killing is made easier if the
command can be passed on to an autonomous system, so proportionality is
under threat. 3.3.3. Making war more likely There are some points that
suggest LAWS would make wars more likely: [Autonomous Killer Robots Are
Probably Good News]{.underline} 12/16 • [With LAWS, a war can be
expected to result in less death and injury to the soldiers on the side
that has them available (but only slightly, if compared to
remote-controlled systems]{.underline}). • They [make wars less bad,
generally, and thus wars are more likely to be cho-sen as a
means]{.underline}. • They make a particular military action easier to
decide for a military com-mander (see Krishnan 2009). [• Fewer losses of
soldiers' lives reduce the political hurdle for wars and esp. military
action short of war.]{.underline} • Finally, they ma[ke it easier to
maintain a 'low level' war for some time, espe-cially if it is an
asymmetric war.]{.underline} 3.3.4. Utility, fairness and arms races The
reasons why LAWS make a war more likely apply equally to
remote-controlled weapons; in fact they apply to any weapon that acts at
a distance. Such weapons have always resulted in relative safety for the
first users: Goliath probably thought David's sling unfair; the Lateran
Council of 1139, Canon 29, banned use of the large cross-bow
\[ballista\] and archery against fellow Christians. [The criticism that
LAWS lower the risk for attackers and thus make wars and other killings
more likely]{.underline} is thus correct, but [applies to any weapon
that the one side has, but the other does not: In other words, it is the
result of an on-going arms race.]{.underline} As soon as the other side
has acquired the new weapon, the risk of war goes down again. This is
not to say that I think LAWS are part of an unstoppable arms race. Some
weapons systems have been banned (anti-personnel mines, chemical
weapons) and with nuclear weapons the arms race is highly controlled. We
can stop developing these weapons---the question is whether it is right
to do so, given that they seem to save lives. Let us note that the
reasons why LAWS make wars less bad do not apply to all weapons at a
distance. This is so especially for weapons of mass destruction or
weap-ons with poor accuracy---and thus with poor compliance to the
humanitarian law requirements of distinction and proportionality. If
killer robots become cheap and easy to obtain or make, then the
consequences would certainly be bad -- as in any case of a weapon
becoming more widely available (see Müller 2015) -- so we would do well
to prevent this spread. 3.3.5. Utility Overall So, what is the overall
utility count? As usual with utility in the long run, this is very hard
to say but it seems quite clear that LAWS would do something to reduce
the human cost of war. Some reduction is extremely valuable, given how
serious the suf- Autonomous Killer Robots Are Probably Good News 13/16
fering of war is. [Further, while LAWS do raise the probability of wars
in the short run, there is no reason to think they will do so in the
long run]{.underline}. [The overall utility calcula-tion depends on the
balance of how much less bad wars become and how much more likely they
become]{.underline}. How bad the short run raise in probability will
turn out depends mainly on which the first parties to acquire them are.
Given current military spend-ing, we know who these are: USA, China,
Russia. It also depends on how big the dif-ference to remote-controlled
systems is, which currently looks minimal. If they do not substantially
increase the probability of war, then [killer robots are good news for

### 1NC\-\--Turn\-\--Deterrence 

#### Autonomous weapons reinforce red lines for deterring hostilities. 

Amatai **Etzioni and** Oren **Etzioni,** May-June 20**17**, "Pros and
Cons of Autonomous Weapons", Military Review,
https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/May-June2017/Pros-and-Cons-of-Autonomous-Weapons-Systems/

Why to begin. However, one should note that [**human-out-of-the-loop
arms** are very effective in **reinforcing a red line**.]{.underline}
[Declaration by representatives of one nation that if another nation
engages in a certain kind of hostile behavior, swift and severe
retaliation will follow, are open to misinterpretation by the other
side, even if backed up with deployment of troops or other military
assets]{.underline}. [Leaders, drawing on considerable historical
experience, may bet that they be able to cross the red line and be
spared]{.underline} because of one reason or another. [Hence, arms
without a human in the loop make for much **more credible** red
lines.]{.underline} (This is a form of the "precommitment strategy"
discussed by Thomas Schelling in Arms and Influence, in which one party
limits its own options by obligating itself to retaliate, thus making
its deterrence more credible.) We suggest that [nations might be willing
to forgo this advantage of fully autonomous arms in order to gain the
assurance that once hostilities ceased]{.underline}, they could avoid
becoming entangled in new rounds of fighting because some bombers were
still running loose and attacking the other side, or because some
bombers might malfunction and attack civilian centers. Finally, if a ban
on fully autonomous weapons were agreed upon and means of verification
were developed, one could aspire to move toward limiting weapons with a
high but not full measure of autonomy.

#### LAWs provide credible threat of retaliation, accelerating nuclear disarmament

**Umbrello et. al 19** \[Steven Umbrello, Phil Torres, and Angelo F. De
Bellis. Umbrello works for the Institute for Ethics and Emerging
Technologies and the University of Turin. Torres is an employee at the
Project for Future Human Flpurishing. De Bellis is a Professor at the
Universiy of Edinburgh. 01/24/2019, "The future of war: could lethal
autonomous weapons make conflict more ethical?", Journal of AI &
Society, doi:10.1007/s00146-019-00879-x\]

To begin, one of the most compelling reasons for opposing nuclear
non-proliferation efforts is that the [destructive potential of nuclear
weapons increases the threshold of use]{.underline} (Jürgen 2008; Wilson
2012). Thus, only in extreme circumstances would rational actors deem
their use to be either morally or strategically acceptable. [This
strongly **contrasts with the case of LAWs**, whose cost would be small
compared to the cost of paying military personnel.]{.underline}
Consequently, states could maintain stockpiles of LAWs that are far
larger than any standing army. The low cost of LAWs would also make them
more expendable than human soldiers (Jacoby and Chang 2008; Singer
2009a, b; Jenks 2010), and they could strike the enemy with greater
precision than human scolders can currently achieve (Thurnher 2012;
Ekelhof and Struyk 2014). These four properties---low cost, military
effectiveness, expendability, and precision---could drive proliferation
while lowering the threshold for use and, therefore, undermine
geopolitical security. Incidentally, similar claims could be made about
anticipated future nanotech weaponry (see Whitman 2011). The
attractiveness of LAWs is apparent in the US's use of "unmanned aerial
vehicles" (UAVs, also known as "drones") in Iraq and Syria. These
semi-autonomous systems offer a cheap, effective, and relatively precise
means for conducting surveillance and targeting enemy combatants
\[despite unsatisfied infrastructural needs to sustain the drone
program\] (McLean 2014). As a result, the US drone program has grown and
the frequency of drone use against terrorist organizations like the
(now-defunct) Islamic State has steadily increased in the past decade
(Higgins 2017). Yet the proliferation of LAWs discussed in this paper is
different in important respects from the proliferation of current UAV
devices. LAWs are theoretically capable of becoming moral actors capable
of making life and death decisions without human intervention. The
absence of a human operator suggests that LAWs will be even cheaper than
current UAVs and, as such, more vulnerable to proliferation. But this
might not be undesirable given that, for example[, ethical LAWs
will---almost by definition---not serve to glorify or extend war efforts
beyond the initial scope.]{.underline} Furthermore, UAVs still require
human intervention and, as we will soon discuss, the emotional
volatility of humans could lead to overspending and high death tolls.
More generally speaking, [the growing use of UAVs in conflict situations
is consistent with a broader trend toward high-precision weaponry and
away from larger, more destructive weapons like those in the world's
nuclear arsenals]{.underline} (Wilson 2013). There are some reasons for
welcoming this shift. For example, [the **use of high-precision weapons
like LAWs to achieve a state's military objectives could reduce the
probability and proportion of indiscriminate harm**]{.underline}, thus
violating the LoW and "rules of engagement" (RoE) less than might
otherwise have been possible. [Even more, the "ease-of-use" of LAWs that
are fully autonomous could enhance the "balance of terror" that prevents
conflict from breaking out by providing a credible means for
retaliation: "If you strike me first, I will unleash a swarm of LAWs
that devastate your infrastructure, poison your streams, set fire to
your farms, destroy your armies, and assassinate your
leaders]{.underline}." [The precision and effectiveness of LAWs could
also **accelerate the process of nuclear disarmament**,]{.underline}
seeing as the conception of LAWS regards them as agents capable of
conventional weapons use rather non-conventional weapons platforms.
First, consider that research on [the potential climatic consequences of
a nuclear war resulted in the replacement of MAD ("mutuallyassured
destruction") with **SAD ("self-assured destruction**").]{.underline}
The reason is that an exchange of nuclear weapons---even a regional one
\[citation\]---could initiate a "nuclear winter" that causes global
agricultural failures, widespread starvation, the spread of infectious
disease, and other catastrophic sequelae that cannot be contained within
national borders (Mills et al. 2014; Xia et al. 2015). Consequently, a
nuclear war would all but guarantee the self-annihilation of states
involved. As Seth Baum (2015) notes, though, [LAWs could provide a kind
of "winter-safe deterrence" by providing states with a credible threat
of retaliation without the global catastrophic risks of nuclear
conflict]{.underline}. [Thus, **LAWs could render the world's nuclear
arsenals irrelevant** and, in doing so, lower the overall risk of human
annihilation]{.underline}. Distinguishing valid targets As mentioned
above and discussed further below, the most significant obstacle to the
development and acceptance of LAWs is their current inability to
reliably distinguish between valid and invalid targets. This is a
crucial shortcoming because, as previously alluded, the Geneva
Conventions require that attacks must be exclusively directed at
military rather than civilian entities (United Nations 1979). As Article
51(3) of Sect. 1 of the Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention
states, "civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this Section,
unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities"
(United Nations 1979). Complicating the situation further is an
ambiguity about what exactly counts as a "civilian"---eg., some
civilians engage in combative activities, some of which are not clearly
overt, thus making it a matter of interpretation whether such
individuals should fall within the "combatant" or "noncombatant"
categories.

#### Nuclear disarmament reduces the risk of war

**Baum 15** \[Seth Baum, 7/27/15, "Breaking down the risk of nuclear
deterrence failure", Bulletin of the Nuclear Scientists,
https://thebulletin.org/2015/07/breaking-down-the-risk-of-nuclear-deterrence-failure/\]

Which risk is larger? This is where the empirical details come in. Risk
can be quantified as the probability of some harm times the severity of
that harm if it were to occur. That means we are comparing four
quantities: the probability of war with nuclear weapons, the probability
without them, the severity of war with them, and the severity without
them. The probability of any war is a very difficult number to pin down.
The causes of war are complex and contingent on many case-specific
factors, and the historical record is murky and limited. But at least
one thing is clear: [The **probability of nuclear war is not
zero**]{.underline}. [Nuclear deterrence can fail.]{.underline} [It is a
fallacy to presume that just because no nuclear war has occurred since
the post-World War II advent of nuclear deterrence, therefore it will
never happen]{.underline}. The historical record contains [several
near-misses in which nuclear war was narrowly avoided due in no small
part to luck]{.underline}. When these points are raised in disarmament
debates, there is no significant international divide. When pushed,
everyone seems to agree that nuclear deterrence can fail. Like nuclear
weapons, conventional weapons can also act as deterrents, discouraging
states from going to war by presenting a counter-threat. So [how does
the probability of deterrence failure with nuclear weapons compare to
the probability without them?]{.underline} This is a much harder
question, and not one commonly considered in the debates. Several
studies have attempted to answer it by looking at data on the history of
war between states that do and do not have nuclear weapons. A 2009 study
by Robert Rauchhaus found a lower probability of war between states that
both have nuclear weapons but a higher probability when only one has
them. However, a 2015 study by Mark Bell and Nicholas L. Miller finds no
significant difference in the relative probabilities. These studies are
helpful but inconclusive. Such an important policy decision should
ideally rest on more robust research. (I would welcome any reader
comments on these two studies or suggestions for additional ones.) The
relative severity of nuclear and non-nuclear war is also complex and
uncertain, but easier to compare. In principle, either war could result
in few or many deaths depending on how it proceeded. In practice, there
is reason to believe that nuclear war would be vastly more severe.
Non-nuclear war could result in many millions of deaths, as in the two
World Wars, but the unparalleled explosive force of nuclear weapons
makes great harm much easier to cause and therefore more probable. [By
far the biggest difference between nuclear and non-nuclear war would be
that the former would likely result in nuclear winter. Nuclear
explosions send smoke up past the clouds, into the stratosphere, which
causes global environmental problems for years. Crop failures could
ensue in every country, no matter where the war occurred. **The survival
of human civilization could be at stake**.]{.underline} Nuclear winter
could astronomically dwarf the potential harm of a non-nuclear war,
unless the latter involved some other weapon of global destruction, such
as contagious biological weapons. (Those are already banned by treaty
and not in active deployment). The relative severity of nuclear and
non-nuclear war is likewise not a point of international disagreement.
While awareness of nuclear winter remains low, all sides concur that the
impacts of the former would be catastrophic, and the impacts of the
latter not as bad. Taking nuclear winter into account, the ambiguity
about the probabilities of whether war will occur becomes less
important[. That is, even if nuclear weapons significantly improve
deterrence, **nuclear disarmament** still **reduces the risk of
war.**]{.underline} Thus, while it is understandable that nucleararmed
states would want to avoid disarmament in order to avoid war, the world
will ultimately be safer without nuclear weapons. In other words,
nuclear disarmament should proceed rapidly.

[Gender as a social construct and the binary of sex difference embedded
within gender identity has been translated into many areas of
international law and IHL is not exempt from this critique]{.underline}.
It is a regime that predominantly prioritises men, relegating women to
the status of victims and child-bearers. This discrimination and bias
can be seen especially in the principle of distinction.¶ Masculinity in
war is associated with a natural 'protector' dynamic; the combatants
embodying the image of chivalric, just warriors as a direct result of
patriarchal norms within society. Women are regularly placed in the same
group as children when their experiences within war is considered. In
turn, this analogises women with the perceived vulnerability and
innocence that children bear in society. [It is therefore **expected
from men's gendered roles that their duty is to fight in wars to protect
women and children. This hegemonic masculinity sustains the patriarchal
military structure.**]{.underline}¶ The reality is that many women do
act as combatants in armed conflicts, defying the gendered narratives of
war. However, their role as combatants is often over-looked by many
participants. The generalisation of women as civilians also serves to
ignore their unique experiences of war as victims of gender-based
violence, perpetrated in armed conflict to ensure maintenance of the
subordination of women.¶ [The use of **AWS** may present an opportunity
to rid the gender bias embedded within the principle of
distinction]{.underline}; the phrase "robots do not rape" is one that
has been used in arguments that propose the use of AWS. [Their use
**presents an opportunity to eliminate gender-based violence as a way of
upholding the patriarchal military structure.** Rather than viewing
women as innocent subordinates, AWS warfare could result in the
emancipation of the traditional gender roles prescribed to men and women
during wartime. The protector and protected dyad would cease to
continue, as all genders would be protected during war by
AWS.]{.underline}

[Approximately 10% of Soldiers]{.underline} and Marines [report
mistreating noncombatants]{.underline} (damaged/destroyed Iraqi property
when not necessary or hit/kicked a noncombatant when not necessary).
Soldiers that have high levels of anger, experience high levels of
combat or those who screened positive for a mental health problem were
nearly twice as likely to mistreat non-combatants as those who had low
levels of anger or combat or screened negative for a mental health
problem. 2. [Only 47% of Soldiers]{.underline} and 38% of Marines
[agreed that noncombatants should be treated with dignity]{.underline}
and respect. 3. [Well over a third of Soldiers]{.underline} and Marines
[reported torture should be]{.underline} allowed, whether to save the
life of a fellow Soldier or Marine or to obtain important information
about insurgents. 4. [17% of Soldiers]{.underline} and Marines agreed or
strongly [agreed that all noncombatants should be treated as
insurgents]{.underline}. 5. Just under 10% of soldiers and marines
reported that their unit modifies the ROE to accomplish the mission. 6.
45% of Soldiers and 60% of Marines did not agree that they would report
a fellow soldier/marine if he had injured or killed an innocent
noncombatant. 7. Only 43% of Soldiers and 30% of Marines agreed they
would report a unit member for unnecessarily damaging or destroying
private property. 8. [Less than half of Soldiers and Marines would
report a team member for an unethical behavior.]{.underline} 9. A third
of Marines and over a quarter of Soldiers did not agree that their NCOs
and Officers made it clear not to mistreat noncombatants. 10. Although
they reported receiving ethical training, 28% of Soldiers and 31% of
Marines reported facing ethical situations in which they did not know
how to respond. 11. Soldiers and Marines are more likely to report
engaging in the mistreatment of Iraqi noncombatants when they are angry,
and are twice as likely to engage in unethical behavior in the
battlefield than when they have low levels of anger. 12. [Combat
experience, particularly losing a team member, was related to an

[Militaries have long used weapons with autonomous capabilities and are
likely to increasingly use autonomous weapons as their effectiveness is
demonstrated.]{.underline} Autonomous weapons predate remotely operated
weapons in most domains. The air domain is instructive in this regard,
as the invention of television in the 1930s disrupted prior work on more
autonomous aircraft by allowing for the remote operation of aircraft out
of sight from the pilot. Remotely operated systems are likely to
continue to be generally preferred by militaries, but those systems will
have increasingly autonomous capabilities, particularly in targeting
enemy systems that disrupt their command and control links. This
suggests [rather than viewing "autonomous weapons" as a distinct class
of systems, instead we should consider the autonomous capabilities of a
weapon and how it is controlled by its user. Correctly considering
autonomy in weapons begins with recognizing weapons are
tools,]{.underline} and like all tools have a user. "Full autonomy," in
the sense of absolute independence, is not a desirable property of a
tool. Rather, users will maintain some control over their tools to
ensure they are accomplishing their desired purpose. [Instead of trying
to distinguish between what is autonomous and what is not, we should
focus on the relationship between the user and the tool.]{.underline} To
paraphrase David Mindell: "Where are the \[users\]? Who are they? What
are they doing? When? Why does it matter?"152 [Unencumbered with trying
to distinguish between what is autonomous and non-autonomous allows
analysis to instead focus on autonomy in executing particular
functions.]{.underline} Recognizing militaries have long used autonomous
weapons makes predicting their future use a matter of identifying the
capabilities militaries have sought to achieve through autonomous
weapons in the past, and how technology is changing what is possible.
Considering this history, autonomous weapons have predominately been
used to address at least one of four challenges: the mundane, the fast,
the denied, and mass. [Autonomous weapons aid militaries in
addressing]{.underline} the mundane, or [long duration, by providing
greater persistence in observing and reacting to events over an extended
period]{.underline} than is efficiently achieved with a manned system.
In terms of both reaction speed and at high accelerations, [autonomous
weapons can operate at speeds exceeding what people are capable of. A
particularly attractive feature of autonomous weapons is the ability to
operate in denied environment,]{.underline} either due to environmental
conditions or enemy action, that present unacceptable risk to manned
systems or to the control channels for remotely operated systems.
Finally, [autonomous weapons provide increased mass, like most any
military technology, by increasing the military power of a
state]{.underline} relative to its available population for military
service.

The normative and ethical considerations related to autonomous weapons
are an area that needs further research. [Existing literature on the
ethics of autonomous weapons tends to describe them as a potential
future capability not an existing capability, which may create a status
quo bias in arguing against autonomous weapons]{.underline}. It also
appears a substantial element in some moral arguments against autonomous
weapons is a reaction to a challenge in what it means to be human.
[There seems to be a deeply held moral intuition that humans ought to
have control over killing other humans. Autonomous weapons may be a key
means for providing for that control, for example by targeting systems
to disrupt command and control channels. If autonomous weapons are seen
not as a means to kill humans, but as a means to target adversarial
military systems that undermine control over who is killed, I suspect it
fundamentally alters normative perspectives.]{.underline} [It also
suggests rather than seeking to ban autonomous weapons, to seek
banning]{.underline} electronic warfare and other [systems that erode
control over the use of force.]{.underline}

Of course, those familiar with the debate over AWS in kinetic warfare
have already heard arguments about potential upsides for efficacy. Yet
the nature of the cyber battleground, and especially cyber defense, will
provide strong incentives to employ autonomous offensive cyber systems.
The cyber theater consists in whole or in part of computerized systems,
where the speed of movement is not constrained by the physical
limitations of feet and engines and rockets, and where the scope and
scale of combat may proceed beyond the ability of human observers to
comprehend in real-time. [As Dorothy Denning argues, "\[a\]t the speed
of cyber, placing **humans in the loop at every step is neither
practical nor desirable**."]{.underline} As a result, in direct analogy
to defense systems such as anti-missile systems, **[\[m\]ost

goes into the signature database, and they install and configure the
security software. The processes of signature distribution, malicious
code and packet detection, and initial response are automated, but
humans may be involved in determining the final response. **[Effective
cyber defenses, in short, will have to rely upon automatic
routines.]{.underline}** Further, to date, [the technological
development and practical adoption of autonomous weapons systems for
defense has progressed further than that of autonomous offensive

[In a 2010 paper, Bradley J. Strawser offers a convincing
argument]{.underline} in favor of the use of remotely piloted but
uninhabited aerial vehicles (i.e., drones) provided the war being fought
is a just one. On his view, [drones are just another in a long list of
weapons that remove soldiers further from harm's way. The use of spears,
guns, tanks, planes, and drones are all justified,]{.underline}
[according to Strawser, by the Principle of Unnecessary Risk (PUR). PUR
says (roughly) that a state and its agents should avoid exposing their
soldiers to unnecessary lethal risk.]{.underline} Regardless of the
weaponry wielded by the enemy, if the war is just, then governments,
armies, and [commanders ought to provide their soldiers with whatever
weapon(s) will most shield them from unnecessary lethal risk while still
being able to get the job done.]{.underline} Applying PUR to drones
gives us the following conditional: "For any just action taken by a
given military, if it is possible for the military to use \[drones\] in
place of inhabited aerial vehicles without a significant loss of
capability, then the military has an ethical obligation to do so" (2010,
p. 346). Worrying that such a principle might be used to argue in favor
of AWS, Strawser tells us that this "fails to appreciate that PUR,
although a strong at first view moral principle, can be overridden by a
strong enough countervailing normative reasons," and he finds the
"principled objections \[to AWS\] to be sufficiently strong such that
they override the moral demands of PUR" (ibid., p. 350). One might
further point out that drones already provide a lot of coverage when it
comes to lethal risk: Can it really get any safer than bombing the enemy
from a bunker in Nevada? And would the additional coverage that
(perhaps) comes from taking humans further out of the loop be enough to
outweigh the objections to AWS?¶ I think Strawser unfairly stacks the
deck against AWS by focusing on lethal risk. Lethal risk is not the only
type of risk that soldiers must deal with. [Depression, anxiety,
post-traumatic stress disorder, and feelings of guilt have a severe and
negative impact on the well-being of our soldiers. Due to this, I
suggest the following extension of PUR (EPUR): The state and its agents
should avoid exposing their own soldiers to unnecessary moral,
psychological, and lethal risk. If we have some technology that could
reduce such risk, while remaining as effective as alternatives, we ought
to use it. Moreover, if a military technology might seriously reduce the
moral, psychological, and lethal risk of soldiers in the future if only
we were to develop it, then we have strong reasons to spend some time
and money doing so.]{.underline}¶ [I contend that a state and its agents
would avoid exposing their own troops to unnecessary moral,
psychological, and lethal risk by deploying AWS, and that there is no
other feasible way of achieving these decreased levels of
risk.]{.underline} Therefore, a state and its agents are obligated to
deploy technologically sophisticated AWS. A technologically
sophisticated autonomous weapon is one that matches the average
performance of human-in-the-loop systems (e.g., drones) when it comes to
acting in accordance with the laws of war (e.g., distinctness,
surrender, proportionality). In other words, if we were to create AWS
that can reliably adhere to the laws of war, we would have strong moral
reasons to use them. Utilizing such systems would reduce psychological
risk by reducing the number of humans on the ground (or in Nevada)
making life and death decisions. Fewer pilots and soldiers means less
psychological harm.

### 1NC\-\--Turn\-\--NATO Bad for Feminism

#### NATO is inherently patriarchal -- gendered violence, trafficking, and decreased social welfare programming. This makes it impossible for the aff to solve conflict by preserving excess militarization and intentionally viewing "weak" countries through a feminine lens; thus, "proper" manhood is synonymous with violence. This infiltrates every aspect of the affirmative and turns any aff claim of solvency.

[What is our 'feminist case' against NATO? In many ways it's the same
case we make against militarism and war in general. That's to say, we
note the adverse ways they impact on women, and the damaging gender
roles, active and passive, into which they draw both sexes. We point up
the fact that gender relations, as we know and live them, are relations
of power and inequality, founded in violence. They involve the social
construction of masculinity as combative. Proper manhood requires a
readiness to use force in defence of 'honour', while femininity is
associated with passivity and victimhood.]{.underline} Women who want to
escape the feminine stereotype have little choice but to imitate the
masculine model. This dichotomous gender culture is one of the
long-term, underlying, causes of war, because it [predisposes our
societies to see taking up arms as a normal and acceptable way of
dealing with political conflicts.]{.underline} Consequently, feminist
activists call for the transformation of gender relations as a necessary
element of the movement to end war.¶ So how does this apply in the
struggle against NATO? It's important to stress that, for sure, all the
women on our 'Women Against NATO' e-list are making exactly the same
base-line case as all other opponents of NATO. Briefly, that [NATO is a
Cold War instrument that should have been closed down when the Warsaw
Pact folded; that it is primarily a vehicle for the economic and
military interests of the USA and to a lesser extent those of the
post-colonial Western European states; and that its current strategy of
enlargement and its increasingly 'expeditionary' mode make it a growing
threat to peace on a global scale. Furthermore, NATO's existence flouts
international law and United Nations principles; it chimes with
increasing militarization of the European Union; and it locks member
states into the nuclear weapons and MDI systems on which the USA
continues to insist.]{.underline}¶ However, beyond this general critique
of NATO, [we perceive the alliance in gendered terms. NATO is a massive
military alliance of nation states. Nira Yuval-Davis and other feminist
theorists have shown how the concept of 'nation' is gendered, how
nationalism and patriarchy are interlocked, and how nations and
nationalists use and exploit 'women'. NATO is the product of Cold War
thinking that saw the globe as divided into two 'blocs' of nation
states, champions of rival ideologies. Some feminist contributions to
the Strasbourg workshop talked about the 'patriarchal logic' of blocs, a
brotherhood of nations in arms seeking out fantasy enemies long after
the Cold War has ended.]{.underline}¶ [Secondly, women have been making
a feminist case against NATO's military bases, installations and
production facilities in our countries.]{.underline} Although, for the
most part, these belong to the national armed forces of member states,
they are in effect part and parcel of NATO resources in Europe. Several
women wrote workshop papers about the damaging effect of military
installations on the lives of women in neighbouring communities. They
described [women's non-violent direct action outside the razor wire and
security checkpoints, protesting against the toxic pollution, the danger
of radiation, the noise and blighted areas entailed by the military use
of land. Women also protest against sexual exploitation and violence
against women by military personnel.]{.underline} In Bosnia and Kosovo,
[UN and NATO-led forces not only generated a massive sex industry, but
individual soldiers -- along with NATO contractors and UN police -- were
actively involved in the trafficking process]{.underline}, receiving
trafficked women and girls at borders, smuggling them into military
bases and acting as pimps. Although NATO adopted, in 2004, a Policy
Against Human Trafficking, [no suspected NATO traffickers have been
prosecuted]{.underline}.\[2\]¶ [Third, the persistence of the 'NATO
system' after the collapse of the Soviet Union has prevented each
European country cashing in 'the peace dividend' by reducing its armed
forces and humanizing its international posture. It has required them to
sustain a high degree of militarization that masculinizes and deforms
everyday life. It has, what's more, fostered the militarization of the
European Union, so that an economic alliance we joined as a guarantor of
cooperation and harmony is turning into yet another war-fighting
machine. It has been argued that the EU is converting to this 'hard'
image in response to the chiding of US policy-makers that Europe is a
feminine, soft, civilian power. European leaders want to play 'with the
big boys'.\[3\] A commitment to contribute to a European force as well
as to NATO calls for high military expenditures in EU member states.
Feminists argue that this drains funds from the education, health and
housing services badly needed by women, the sex that still carries a
very high proportion of the burden of domestic life and
care.]{.underline}¶ [Finally, feminist antimilitarists make a case
against NATO as a perpetrator of wars. The effects of war are
dramatically gendered. There is a growing trend to civilian casualties,
disproportionately women and their dependants. Women are the majority of
the displaced and refugees, trying to maintain their families in
impossible circumstances. Thousands are widowed, deprived of a viable
existence. Sexual violence redoubles in and after war. We see all this
in NATO's war in Afghanistan.]{.underline}¶ Improbable as it may seem,
[NATO prides itself on 'mainstreaming' gender into its structures and
activities. 'NATO and its Partners', they say on their website, 'are
promoting the role of women within NATO-led operations and missions' and
increasing the knowledge and skills available on 'gender and
diversity'.]{.underline} Last year the Strategic Commands received
guidelines for the integration into the NATO Command Structure of UN
Security Council Resolution 1325 on 'Women, Peace and Security'. There
is a NATO Office on Gender Perspectives, and gender advisers have been
appointed. An implementation report is to be published in time for the
Lisbon Summit.\[4\]¶ [Given the implications for women of NATO's
campaign Afghanistan, the Alliance's self-professed gender sensitivity
can only deepen feminist cynicism about 'gender
mainstreaming'.]{.underline} Here is an alliance of powerful Western
states exploiting the notion of 'liberating Afghan women from oppression
by the Taliban' as one of its devious justifications for invading the
country. Women's insecurity is multiplied in the chaos and brutality of
a decade of armed conflict. Then the intruders announce plans to make
their escape by negotiating the re-entry to power of -- the Taliban.
[Afghan women certainly have a feminist case against NATO. So do women
in NATO member states.]{.underline}

#### NATO is ineffective at gender mainstreaming

Jody M **Prescott**, 10-30-20**13**, \"NATO Gender Mainstreaming,\"
Taylor & Francis,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03071847.2013.847722

As currently constructed, however, [NATO gender mainstreaming has two
significant flaws that will likely prevent its effective
institutionalisation for some time to come]{.underline}. The [first of
these is the apparent overtasking and underresourcing of the personnel
held most responsible for incorporating a gender perspective into NATO
military operations: the gender advisors]{.underline}. The [second flaw
is its current approach to the conduct of operations,]{.underline}
characterised by an emphasis on international human rights law, which,
as it applies outside contexts of armed conflict[, tends to neglect the
importance of factoring gender into kinetic military
operations]{.underline}. As such, NATO should devote greater numbers of
qualified personnel to gender mainstreaming and its members' forces
should adopt a holistic approach in incorporating a kinetic appreciation
of gender into their doctrine and education, training and exercises,
information gathering and intelligence analysis, and planning and
operations in order to truly effect gender mainstreaming. Directive 40-1
and the Roles of the Gender Advisors The NATO gender-mainstreaming
programme suggests a three-tiered advisory hierarchy. In static
headquarters, Gender Advisors provide advice and expertise on gender
matters. In field headquarters, Gender Field Advisors perform this
function, while in subordinate tactical units, Gender Focal Points
receive the mission as another assigned task. Whilst comprehensive in
the sense that the programme sets out a staffing mechanism that would
appear to provide for gender expertise at the different levels of
command, [the directive's implementation is likely to be marred by
certain flaws in its provisions regarding training, the terms of
reference of the gender advisor as a staff officer, and the large number
of specific and complex tasks gender advisors would be expected to
accomplish.]{.underline} As to the training to be undertaken by gender
advisors, Directive 40-1 identifies both mandatory and recommended
courses and posits a learning programme consisting of online 'advanced
distributed learning' courses with classroom instruction. [Although it
is intended that advisors participate in operational planning groups as
part of their wider role, the directive only 'recommends' courses in
this area, rather than making them mandatory.]{.underline} 14 However,
experience suggests that not only should these operational planning
courses be required so that advisors in static and field headquarters
can participate in actual planning with a sufficient degree of expertise
and credibility as staff officers in this function, there should also be
a requirement that trainee advisors actually participate in a number of
exercises, if not operations, as full-time members of operational
planning groups before being certified as Gender Advisors or Gender
Field Advisors. Directive 40-1 states that the roles and
responsibilities of the Gender Advisor and Gender Field Advisor will be
set out by a standard operating procedure, and that ordinarily they are
expected to report directly to the commander, because such access would
highlight to the rest of the staff the importance of the gender advisors
and their multidisciplinary function. [Depending on the nature of the
operation, and the size of the headquarters, however, such access might
be infrequent at best. To be accepted by the rest of the staff asspecial
staff advisors who add value, the Gender Advisors and Gender Field
Advisors will likely find themselves attending many different
meetings]{.underline} and working group sessions over the course of a
typical day -- meetings in [which]{.underline} they might [have no
substantive role to play]{.underline} but which they cannot afford to
miss because they will otherwise not be seen as part of the team.
Furthermore, the directive, quite properly, requires gender advisors to
establish a technical chain among superior and subordinate gender
advisors within the command structure.15 The directive does not,
however, set out what the responsibilities and obligations of superior
and subordinate gender advisors are in relation to each other[. This
could become problematic when contingents from different
troop-contributing nations begin implementing their own versions of
gender mainstreaming in accordance with their respective national action
plans and guidance.]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\--Turn\-\-- Positive LAWs

#### Specifically, a fear of accidents will limit nuclear LAWs to only positive ones.

**Horowitz, 2019 -- prof of Political Science at Univ of Pennsylvania**
\[Michael with Paul Scharre, and Alexander Velez-Green "A Stable Nuclear
Future? The Impact of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence"

TA\]

Many of these ways that autonomous systems could increase the resiliency
and accuracy of NC2 are speculative, however. [Existing automation, as
the Petrov incident shows, already creates the risk of automation bias.
Knowledge of this will probably make most nuclear-armed states unlikely
to further automate the early warning or command-and-control processes,
with two exceptions: first, in situations where human-machine teaming
might be further integrated to mitigate potential false alarms; second,
in situations where a state fears for its secure second strike, and
believes that further automation would reinforce deterrence of a
potential aggressor]{.underline}. It is also possible, though less
likely, that more automation could occur via a highly risk-tolerant
nuclear-armed state that believes automated NC2 protocols would improve
its ability to manage escalation.

#### When ethical robots go to war, they place themselves in harms way, rather than human soldiers. The proliferation of LAWs will dramatically decrease casualties of war. 

**Del Re, 2017 -- US Army Major** \[Amanda "Lethal Autonomous Weapons:
Take the Human Out of the Loop A paper submitted to the Faculty of the
US Naval War College in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the

[Lethal Autonomous Weapons]{.underline} (LAWS) should be employed by the
United States on the field of battle. LAWS [will save lives because they
are potentially more proficient on the battlefield than humans. There
will not be as many combat-related deaths or injuries which will result
in a healthier, more resilient military.]{.underline} It behooves the
United States to employ this emerging technology because other nations
already are. [As a superpower, the United States bears the burden of
setting the example in warfare]{.underline} and foreign policy. A Lethal
Autonomous Weapon is a robot that is designed to select and attack
military targets without direct intervention by a human operator. The
idea of not having a human operator is called "human-out-of-the-loop."
Autonomous weapons also have the capability of operating with a
"human-in-the-loop" (like a drone and drone operator) or a
"human-on-the-loop" in which a human operator supervises the targeting
process and can intervene at any time during the cycle. Currently, the
US employs both human-in-the-loop and human-on-the-loop weapons in
combat. Lethal autonomous Weapons are also called LAWS, LARS (lethal
autonomous robots), robotic weapons, or killer robots. For these
purposes, LAWS, robots, or lethal autonomous weapon will be used. This
study will present a somewhat unrepresented argument, that LAWS should
be developed and employed by the United States on the battlefield. There
are several premises to support this conclusion. First, humans are
overall inferior on the battlefield as compared to robots. Historically
humans deal poorly with the traumatic effects of combat resulting in war
atrocities, posttraumatic stress disorder, increased veteran suicide and
homelessness; robots would not be negatively affected by combat like
humans are. Additionally, human soldiers are more expensive in the long
run than robots. 7 Second, the United States needs to stay on the
cutting edge of technology especially in warfare. History provides
examples of the United States using ethically questionable strategies in
war such as unrestricted submarine warfare and strategic bombing, both
in WWII, without having had the chance to fully examine the potential
ramifications of those strategies prior to the heat of conflict.
Moreover, other nations are already employing LAWS. The United States
needs to lead the development of these weapons in terms of technological
capabilities and ethical standards so that an international agreement
can be achieved before they are misused by another nation.

Since [the end of the last world war, the global economy has witnessed
tremendous change]{.underline}. This was driven by developments in
computing and (mechanical, genetic, electrical, chemical and materials)
engineering, which we call 'technology' for the purposes of this issue.
The resulting impact on social, behavioural and economic changes were
shaped in large part by post war ideology that scalable inventions could
make human life extend further, act faster, and work cheaper.4 With the
evolution of proxy warfare during and after the Cold War (and resulting
war-weariness among the populations of the Great Powers), the capacity
for states to exercise their influence, both remotely and diffusely, has
been driving the global military research agenda. The second half of the
twentieth century thus saw the invention of the internet, the
[[development of **cybernetics**]{.mark}/**artificial intelligence a**nd
the creation of new materials (genetic, programmable) and laser
weaponry]{.underline}. This century such technologies have evolved to
produce the likes of drones ([[l]{.mark}ethal [a]{.mark}utonomous
[w]{.mark}eapons]{.underline}) and other military landbased autonomous
and semi-autonomous robots.5 Not only has the [[**transformation** of
armed conflict]{.mark} through such inventions impacted on targeting
methods,]{.underline} but it has also [materialised [an apocalyptic
vision of everyday surveillance warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline}6 This has
provoked sustained global debate, both in international law and
international policy fora. In [a telling example from late 2017, a UC
Berkeley-based computer scientist and the Campaign to Stop Killer
Robots]{.underline} advocacy organisation used a United Nations platform
to screen a dystopian futuristic film, 'Slaughterbots', to call greater
state attention to [the perils of autonomous weapons systems while
lobbying for an international treaty to **ban** their use.]{.underline}
8 The event illustrates how overlapping communities [-- academics,
humanitarian [activists]{.mark} and state representatives -- [turn to
legal forms as]{.mark} sites of potential [regulation]{.mark} and
redress for [technological]{.mark} developments in armed [conflict that
are seen to threaten human well-bei]{.mark}ng]{.underline}. It also
invites critical [reflection: about the [relation]{.mark} between the
[**human** and the non-human]{.mark} (or indeed **post-human**); the
broader political [**economies** of armed conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
in which such weapons may be used; the role of [legal architectures in
constraining -- and at times enabling -- the use of force and
[**methods** of warfare; and on what other forms]{.mark} of
[suffering]{.mark} [remain hidden from view when **spectacular**]{.mark}
forms of [violence **determine** political agendas]{.mark}.]{.underline}
We think there is a pressing need for [further examination of the
interplay between]{.underline} these [emerging inventions against
existing international laws]{.underline} and the changing backdrop of
[contemporary armed conflict.]{.underline} Importantly, the role of
gender in their creation, production and deployment is under-theorised:
this special issue is an invitation to others to think with us. 9 The
contributors to this issue undertake their analyses alongside, but not
within, existing legal debates, which predominantly concern matters of
procedure and classification. The articles here look outwards, at more
amorphous but no less important forces on law and war: the interplay
between rhetoric, images, ideology, and affect. What matters of concern
appear within this constellation? 10 As the following articles
illustrate, [triangulating gender, war and technology as a field of
inquiry produces a wide domain of analysis, with topics ranging from
human enhancement technologies to autonomous weapons systems,
surveillance and aerial bombardment, artificial intelligence and big
data. The]{.underline} three terms themselves invite interpretation and
debate. [11 'Gender', for example, has been used in the context of
international humanitarian law to signify vulnerability; women are
treated as a group that may require further protectio]{.underline}n,
where [gender operates as a qualified identity that supplements the
category of civilian]{.underline}.12 Yet some of the articles considered
here adopt a more reflexive approach informed by feminist scholarship,
considering issues of agency, difference, and intersectionality, and
contesting gendered constructions that presuppose femininity, ethnicity,
and passivity. Animated by concern about this and other technological
inventions described earlier -- and by the relative shortage of
scholarly feminist perspectives on technology and conflict -- this
special issue emerged from out of an international workshop organised by
Emily Jones in June 2016 at SOAS University of London that sought to
address this gap.

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Definition 

#### States that utilize LAWs have an incentive to disagree over definitions

**Thornton, 2019 - Senior Lecturer in the Centre for Defence Education
Research and Analysis, King's College** \[Rod, "One to ponder: the UK's
ethical stance on the use of Artificial Intelligence in weapons systems

Acc 4/16/22 TA\]

Given its declared position, it might seem logical for the UK to push
for an international ban on the use of LAWS. Trying to level the playing
field so that no other state possessed them would seemingly work to the
UK's advantage. A ban is also the favoured UN option. UN Secretary
General António Guterres has, for instance, described LAWS as 'morally
repugnant'. Within the UN, however, the UK is part of a group of states
(alongside Australia, Israel, Russia and US) that has collectively
stated that currently they do not want to see any regulation that
forbids the use of LAWS. To explain the UK's position, an MOD
spokesperson said that, 'We believe a pre-emptive ban is premature as
[there is still no international agreement on the characteristics of
lethal autonomous weapons systems'. We are thus back to the thorny
problem of definitions. If we do not know what something is then how can
it be banned?]{.underline} The question here, though, is why is the UK
trying to prevent a ban on a weapon it has 'no intention' of developing
itself? This does not look very ethical or, indeed, sensible. It seems
to be giving licence to potential adversaries to continue with their own
development of LAWS while the UK sits on its AI hands. Whatever the UK's
position, it seems that LAWS will prove impossible to ban anyway.
Firstly, [because the world's major states will be seeing the benefits
of LAWS there will probably (and maybe conveniently?) never be an
internationally agreed definition on them]{.underline}, which would then
allow any ban to accrue. Secondly, the technology that underpins any
'killer robot' will come to be developed anyway in the civilian sector
-- with systems designed, for instance, to deliver parcels or to tackle
forest fires. Any military organisation could simply buy such systems
off the shelf and convert them readily into LAWS. The genie will thus be
out of the bottle on LAWS fairly soon anyway and can never be put back
in. It will therefore, and unfortunately, be very hard for the UK to
maintain a credible stance as a 'pioneer in ethical AI'.

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Bans Fail

#### Lack of international support for bans ensures they fail

[A significant number of countries supports a new legally binding treaty
that would ban the development and use of LAWS.]{.underline} The
Campaign to Stop Killer Robots has circulated a list of 26 states that
support a ban. However, [most of the states supporting a new legal
instrument are developing countries that do not possess sophisticated AI
technology sectors or have military forces with extensive AI
capabilities. Meanwhile, most of the **major military powers perceive
significant value in military AI and do not wish to create new
international constraints** that could slow its technological
development. The United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, and other
countries hold that existing international law]{.underline}, including
LOAC, [already provides significant humanitarian protections regarding
the use of LAWS]{.underline}, and thus no new treaty instruments are
necessary.¶ China, conversely, has proposed a ban on LAWS modeled on the
UN protocol prohibiting the use of blinding laser weapons, but it seems
to define LAWS so narrowly that a ban on this class of weapons would not
apply to systems currently under development. China has also suggested
that concepts such as meaningful human control should be left up to
sovereign determination, rather than defined through international
processes. Thus, it appears that China's professed support for a new
legal instrument would not actually constrain the development or use of
military AI. ¶ In addition, [some states have **questioned what
verification and monitoring measures would be associated with any new
international ban.** Given the inherent lack of transparency of many AI
systems, states have expressed concern that signatories to any ban might
not live up to their international commitments]{.underline}. As a
result, many governments, including those of France, Germany, and other
European states, have supported simply developing a nonbinding political
declaration that would articulate the importance of human control being
designed into and exercised across the acquisition, development,
testing, and deployment life cycle of military AI systems. A nonbinding
declaration or code of conduct of this sort would be easier to reach
than a new treaty, but other states have expressed doubt that it would
be useful, since it could not be enforced.¶ [Given the resistance of
several major military powers and the need for their acquiescence to a
new treaty, **the international community is not likely to** agree to a
**ban or other regulation in the near term**]{.underline}. However,
there is a view broadly resonant among many countries, including the
United States, key allies, and important stakeholders, such as the
International Committee on the Red Cross, that further international
discussion regarding the role of humans in conducting warfare is
necessary.

Conclusion In this article, we set out to answer how an international,
legally binding regulation of LAWS can be brought about. Humanitarian
advocacy campaigns wield significant influence in general; the Campaign
to Stop Killer Robots does so in particular. We thus focused on its
strategy in engaging the international community at the CCW in Geneva,
the epicenter of the debate surrounding a possible regulation of LAWS.
We found the campaign's strategy to be less than optimal. As our
comparative analysis of three humanitarian disarmament processes
revealed, [the **campaign against LAWS is modeled after past successes,
despite weapon autonomy differing** from blinding lasers or landmines in
several important ways. These differences **limit the portability of
some tried-and-tested strategy components.**]{.underline} Actor-related
components such as awareness-raising, dissemination of expertise, and
coalition-building are similar in the three campaigns against LAWS, BLW
and APL, and appear to be [conducive to the goal of a ban on LAWS
too]{.underline}. However, rehashing [the issue- and institution-related
components of the BLW and APL campaign strategies creates **weak spots
in the case of LAWS.** The "killer robots" frame, for instance, while
attempting to convey a simple and dramatic message, also renders the
issue futuristic and, thus, less urgent.]{.underline} The prominent
focus on the indiscriminateness of LAWS is an attempt to activate an
argument that proved powerful against APL and CM, but might turn out to
be obsolete in the case of LAWS due to technological improvements. Most
importantly, [LAWS are portrayed as a category of weapons, which is not
accurate because weapon autonomy is an elusive function in a
human-machine system.]{.underline} Lastly, due to the lack of critical
mass and "champion state" leadership, the LAWS process is not (yet) ripe
for a venue shift. Our approach confirms the necessity of the components
we studied, but it cannot (nor was it designed to) specify their
relative importance or identify sufficient combinations. That said, our
findings do highlight an aspect that deserves further attention: the fit
of the framing to the issue. This insight is less trivial than it may
seem. In theoretical literature thus far, the framing's fit has been
considered almost exclusively with regard to different audiences and
normative environments. The issue itself has remained neglected. Having
shown how a mismatch between the framing and the issue's key
characteristics can compromise a campaign's message, we suggest
exploring the relevance of the framing/issue fit in additional cases.
[Our findings also suggest that modifying the substance of the argument,
the expected regulatory design, and the institutional factors would
increase the likelihood of the KRC's strategy achieving its stated
goal.]{.underline} In terms of substance, the most straightforward
argument against LAWS is not a legal but an ethical one, namely, the
argument that delegating life and death decisions to machines infringes
upon human dignity. We therefore propose moving further away from the
KRC's initial messaging, which was heavily focused on the
indiscriminateness of LAWS, their incompatibility with IHL, and the
plight of civilians. Shifting toward more fundamental ethical concerns
will, first, make the case against LAWS less susceptible to
consequentialist counter-positions (which argue that the illegality of
LAWS will be remedied by technological progress). Second, it makes it
more likely that the general public will react viscerally and reject
LAWS more sharply (Rosert & Sauer, 2019; Sharkey, 2019, p. 83).

#### It is impossible to ban LAWs because there is no solid definition of LAWs.

The Current Impasse [The current impasse on autonomous weapons might be
traced to at least two factors. The first concerns definitions. There
are widely differing conceptions of autonomous weapons and their
technical characteristics]{.underline} (at least for purposes of the
GGE). [And there is also a divergence on sequencing, especially whether
States must first agree on minimal definitional elements before taking
more concrete steps]{.underline} or, alternatively, whether countries
can develop a political declaration (or even a legal instrument) without
first establishing agreement on what specific technologies are of
concern. The second factor is a significant difference of views on what
international law already permits, mandates, and prohibits in practice
and corresponding positions on whether or not the law is satisfactory.

approach to the international debate on autonomous weapons.¶ [Lack of

Australia\'s key allies to ban autonomous weapons, for example, will
likely never be overcome.]{.underline}¶ For instance, [if the US were to
agree]{.underline} to regulation, [it would come with conditions --- in

weapons provide a powerful means for troops to rapidly protect

no major conflicts are on the horizon, and that trade dependencies
remain effective at stopping international violence before it occurs.¶
[Autonomous weapons might even have limited applications in peacekeeping
operations.]{.underline}¶ [Rogue regimes will always acquire

bombs have also been used since World War I.¶ More advanced systems like
the Phalanx close-in weapon system, capable of protecting naval ships
from incoming enemy planes, have been used for decades without moral
qualms, so why ban killer robots altogether?¶ Unlike nuclear, chemical

need.]{.underline}¶ Robots can do nothing without a human¶ Meanwhile, if
a ban were to go ahead, law-abiding nations would be deprived of weapons

autonomous weapons merely serves to detract attention from the fact that

how human beings frame the lethal decisions of robots through code and
algorithms and how they are written and engineered by fallible human

the fear mongering of certain proponents of a complete moratorium.¶ Can
we not investigate proactive technical solutions to ameliorate potential
misuses of AI technologies?¶ [Such refocusing might reveal the true
positive potential autonomous weapons.]{.underline}¶ Imagine if we could
automate the recognition of protected symbols such as the Red Cross and

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Circumvention 

#### Circumvention is easy\-\--there is no [difference]{.underline} between highly autonomized systems and completely autonomous systems.

Waxman, 2014, accessed on 6-27-2022,90 INT'L L. STUD. 386, Stockton
Center for the Study of International Law, \"Adapting the Law of Armed
Conflict to Autonomous Weapon Systems\",
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA613290.pdf\]/ISEE

Before addressing some of the enforceability problems and dangers of any
effort to prohibit autonomous weapons, it is important to understand the
proposed formulas do not, as it may seem initially, contain [a bright
line that would be useful for promoting adherence]{.underline}. Lawyers
experienced in the law of armed conflict will quickly see that each of
these seemingly clear-cut definitions leaves many open questions as to
what systems would be banned under any particular formulation.
[[Even]{.mark} something as [seemingly **plain**]{.mark} as "lethal
decision making" by a [machine does not address,]{.mark} among other
things, the **lawfulness** of targeting a tank, ship or aircraft which
is ultimately the source of the threat, but inside of which is a human
combatant]{.underline}. Beyond definitions, the technology and [[basic
architecture]{.mark} [of]{.mark} an [autonomous system and]{.mark} [a
nearly autonomous]{.mark}, highly automated system are **[basically the
same]{.mark}**---if you can build a system that is nearly
autonomous,]{.underline} for example [with human overr]{.underline}ide,
then you can probably reprogram it to eliminate that human role.
Moreover, whether a highly automated system---say, [one with a human
supervisor who can override proposed firing decisions---is in practice
operating autonomously depends on how it is being manne]{.underline}d,
how operators are trained and how effectively oversight is exercised. It
also depends on operational context and conditions, which may limit the
degree to which the human role is in any way meaningful. [For these and
other reasons, a fully autonomous system and a merely highly-automated
system will be virtually [**indistinguishable** to an observer without
**knowing**]{.mark} a lot about how that [system]{.mark} is used in
particular operational conditions.]{.underline} The [difference might
not matter very much in practice, given the variable **performance** of
human operators.]{.underline} In any case, these systems will be easily
transitioned from one to the other. [The blurriness of these lines means
that [it]{.mark} will be very [**difficult** to draw and enforce
**prohibitions**]{.mark} on "fully" autonomous systems or mandates for
minimum levels of human decision making]{.underline}. Given the great
practical difficulty of distinguishing between autonomous and highly
automated systems, applying a legal ban on autonomous systems [would be
relatively [**easy to circumvent** and very difficult to
enforce]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, and as alluded to above,
[imposing a general [ban on autonomous systems]{.mark} could carry some
[highly unfavorable consequences]{.mark}--- and possibly
dangers.]{.underline} These could include [[providing a clear advantage
in autonomous weapon technology]{.mark} to those States [which generally
would not join]{.mark} (or in reality comply with) [such a
ban]{.mark}]{.underline}. They could also include losing out on the
numerous potential advantages of autonomous systems of improving
decision making on the battlefield, including through avoiding
emotion-based response; improving system accuracy, thereby probably
minimizing collateral injuries; and possibly limiting human loss of life
on both sides and among civilians.

#### Even in the best-case scenario the process of negotiating the AFF takes too long, and bans will have no [effect]{.underline}.

\*\*Card edited for ableist language\*\*

Those calling for a ban on LAWS argue that regulation will not be
enough, as there is always the risk of abuse of the technology by groups
which do not respect IHL or international human rights law. As Stuart
Russell states, "you can't logically state that well-trained soldiers
from civilised nations are so bad a following \[IHL\] that robots could
do better, and state at the same time that rogue states, dictators and
terrorist groups are so good at following \[IHL\] that they will never
use robots in a way which doesn't respect \[IHL\]."175 A ban would
stigmatise the weapon and severely curtail research and development into
it, which regulation would not do. A ban is opposed by several
theorists,176 and may be inadvisable for multiple reasons. Firstly, as
discussed in Part II, the line between LAWS and other, highly automated,
systems is extremely blurry. This makes a ban "relatively easy to
circumvent and very difficult to enforce",177 as it will be difficult to
"demarcate permissible from impermissible weapon systems."178 Secondly,
[an outright [ban]{.mark} "[trades]{.mark} whatever risks
\[[LAWS]{.mark}\] might pose in war for the real, if less visible, [risk
of **failing** to develop forms of automation that]{.mark} might [make
the use of **force** more precise and less **harmful** for
civilians".179]{.mark}]{.underline} A ban could be short-sighted, [when
research and development into them is only a couple of decades old, and
therefore not conclusive.18]{.underline}0 The argument to ban
[[LAWS]{.mark} made by the Losing Humanity report are said to "\[make\]
[notional and very speculative assumptions]{.mark} about the
[development, evolution and employment]{.mark} of future technology not
yet currently available]{.underline}".181 Thirdly, Reeves and Johnson
argue that a [pre-emptive ban is]{.underline} likely to ~~retard~~ the
development [of more [**discriminative** technology]{.mark} which [could
be **beneficial** for the protection of civilians]{.mark} and civilian
objects]{.underline}, drawing a historical analogy to the prohibition
[against [aerial bombardment]{.mark} at the turn of the 20th
Century]{.underline}.182 That historical [prohibition]{.underline}
~~retarded~~ [the [development of more discriminative
**technologies**]{.mark} for bombing, [leading in part to the high
levels of civilian casualties]{.mark} sustained in World War
Two]{.underline}.183 Finally, [[treaties take a **long time to draft and
negotiate**]{.mark}, with [states]{.mark} [needing time]{.mark} to sign
and ratify an agreement. It is seen as "[unrealistic to suspend
all]{.mark} autonomous weapons [testing and development until a
**leg**]{.mark}**al** and regulatory framework is
[created]{.mark}...]{.underline} because the technological advances
require a contemporaneous dialogue on the topic".184 Furthermore, [those
states who do not wish to be subject to a ban [would simply **not**
ratif]{.mark}y the treaty. Without ratification, states **are not bound
by it,** under the principle of pacta sunt servanda.]{.underline} 185
[This [severely limits the utility of ban given that the states most
likely to be **opposed**]{.mark} to a ban are those which will develop
or use **LAWS** in future.]{.underline}

#### Lack of brightline over "human control" makes enforcement [null]{.underline}.

Perspectives for Arms Control The human brain needs time for complex
evaluation and decision-making processes, time that it cannot be denied
in the interaction between human and machine if the human role is to
remain relevant, in other words, if the decision-making process is
merely to be supported, not dominated, by the machine. [Establishing
[where to draw]{.mark} that [line is **shaping** up to be the key
challenge]{.mark} in Geneva]{.underline}. Arriving at a decision in that
regard would also mean [[producing the first definition of]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}utonomous [w]{.mark}eapons [s]{.mark}ystems in terms of
international law.]{.underline} At the CCW meetings, the almost
mantra-like repetition of a shared commitment to retain ["meaningful
human control" over the use of force by states-parties and civil society
actors has become pivot]{.underline}al. Keeping weapons systems under
meaningful human control and banning autonomous weapons systems are two
sides of the same coin[. The concept of meaningful human control
introduced at the end of 2013 by Article 36, a member of the Campaign to
Stop Killer Robots, has since been taken up by governments.]{.underline}
It goes beyond the "appropriate levels of human judgment" approach
specified by the 2012 Pentagon directive. Thus, the argument that human
control over life-and-death decisions must always be in place in a
significant or meaningful fashion, as more than just a mindless pushing
of a button by a human in response to a machine-processed stream of
information. [According to current practice, [a human weapons operator
must have sufficient information]{.mark} about the [target and
sufficient control]{.mark} over the [weapon]{.mark} and must be able to
assess its effects in order to be able to make decisions in accordance
with international law.]{.underline} At the same time, modern weapons
systems are already highly computerized and automated, a trend that is
only accelerating[. So, determining [how much **human judgment** can be
replaced by algorithms]{.mark} before [human control is no longer
"meaningful"]{.mark} involves various technical[, legal, ethical, and
political considerations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Lack of clarity over [definitions]{.underline} of LAWs mean that there is no [enforcement]{.underline} mechanism for the aff.

One product of the development\[ii\], following Polimpung's formula, is
the incorporation and development of artificial intelligence (AI)---and
other disruptive technologies---in the military. The intended result is
the hard to define Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems
([LAWS]{.underline}). Perhaps it is easier to get out of the way of what
LAWS is not---yet. They are not Terminators, Decepticons, Ultron, or HAL
9000. They [are [weapons]{.mark} that can, with the **[help]{.mark}** of
AI]{.underline}, identify and engage [[targets without
**intervention**]{.mark} by a human operator]{.underline}. LAWS can take
[**[shape]{.mark}** in a [drone, a sentry gun, a missile system]{.mark},
[etc]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [**[difficulty]{.mark}** in
**[defining]{.mark}** these types of [**weapons**
stem]{.mark}]{.underline} from the degree of [[separation]{.mark} of
humans from the interaction, [are they **only** highly
automated]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} are they [**actually**
autonomous]{.mark}]{.underline}?

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Human Control

#### No solvency - human control is vague which prevents it from establishing a norm.

**Bode, 2021 - Professor of International Relations at the University of
Southern Denmark** \[Ingvild June 25, AutoNorms "Reflecting on the
Future Norms of Warfare"
https://www.autonorms.eu/reflecting-on-the-future-norms-of-warfare-2/
Acc. 5/27/22 TA\]

We may therefore continue to have two parallel processes shaping the
norms of war and conflict that do not necessarily overlap. Further[,
even if states agree on setting a legal norm defining a necessary
quality of human control, that legal norm is likely going to be
ambiguous in character, providing states with a significant amount of
leeway]{.underline}. States may therefore continue to engage in use of
force practices with AWS in much the same way as before the legal norm
was in place[. Norms that have emerged as part of practices
of]{.underline} designing and [using AWS therefore run the risk of
undercutting deliberative legal efforts]{.underline}. To counter these
dynamics, it is vital that such silent norm-making processes are closely
examined closely and publicly expressed. Autonomous weapon systems and
an emerging norm of human control The debate about autonomous weapons
systems poses fundamental questions to the extent to which the use of
force in conflict and warfare, as well as the very application of
international law, remains in human hands. At first glance, practically
all states parties addressing the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on
emerging technologies in the area of LAWS highlight the importance of
maintaining human control over the use of (lethal) force. The most
substantial outcome of the GGE yet, the Guiding Principles on LAWS,
includes a principle on human-machine interaction. We can therefore
observe the potential making of a new legal norm, if states proceed
towards a negotiation stage. This option has arguably gathered steam
after the ICRC's clear positioning in favour of new international law
around LAWS in May 2021. But [any consensus on what quality of human
control is appropriate is yet to emerge. Many states favour a long-term
view on human control as something that should be present throughout the
entire life cycle of a weapon system from design to operation. Further,
the US and Australia have argued that autonomous features can enhance
human control in specific use of force situations by "effectuating the
intent of commanders".]{.underline} This perspective treats AI as a
straightforward extension of human agency. [Such thinking downplays the
complexity of human-machine interaction and how this challenges the
decision-making capacity of humans operatin]{.underline}g (or working in
teams) with AI-driven weapon systems. Indeed, we must consider the
extent to which the technology itself, having been designed and
conceptualised in a certain way, can itself become a change agent for
shaping (new) legal norms.

### 2NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Human Control

#### No solvency -- it is easy to circumvent the human control norm -- weapons can shift easily from autonomous to non-autonomous.

**Kania 2018 - fellow with the Technology and National Security Program
at the Center for a New American Security** \[Elsa B. "China's Strategic
Ambiguity and Shifting Approach to Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems"

<https://www.lawfareblog.com/chinas-strategic-ambiguity-and-shifting-approach-lethal-autonomous-weapons-systems>
Acc 12/27/20 TA\]

China argues that [lethal autonomous weapons are characterized
by]{.underline}: [lethality; autonomy, "which means absence of human
intervention]{.underline} and control during the entire process of
executing a task" "impossibility for termination" such that "once
started there is no way to terminate the device"; ["indiscriminate
effect,"]{.underline} in that it will "execute the task of killing and
maiming regardless of conditions, scenarios and targets"; [and
"evolution,"]{.underline} "through interaction with the environment the
device can learn autonomously, expand its functions and capabilities in
a way exceeding human expectations" (emphasis added throughout).
[Banning weapons systems with those characteristics could]{.underline}
be a symbol, while [implicitly legitimizing the development of
semi-autonomous or even fully autonomous systems that do not possess
such qualities. By such a standard, a weapons system that operates with
a high degree of autonomy but involves even limited human involvement,
with the capability for distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
targets, would not technically be a LAWS]{.underline}, nor would a
system with a failsafe to allow for shutdown in case of malfunction.
Interestingly, this particular definition is much more stringent than
the Chinese military's own definition of the concept of "artificial
intelligence weapon." According to the dictionary of People's Liberation
Army Military Terminology, an artificially intelligent weapon is "a
weapon that utilizes AI to automatically \[\] pursue, distinguish, and
destroy enemy targets; often composed of information collection and
management systems, knowledge base systems, assistance to decision
systems, mission implementation systems, etc.," such as military
robotics. Because this definition dates back to 2011, the Chinese
military's thinking has evolved as technology has advanced. It is
important, therefore, to consider that there may be daylight between
China's diplomatic efforts on autonomous weapons and the military's
approach.

#### No solvency -- it is impossible to verify human control

**Horowitz, 2019 - Professor of Political Science, University of
Pennsylvania** \[Michael C. May 2"When Speed Kills: Autonomous Weapon
Systems, Deterrence, and Stability" <https://ssrn.com/abstract=3348356>
Acc 12/27/20 TA\]

Jervis argues that arms races occur due to a security dilemma when
states have the ability to measure each other's capabilities, but not
their intentions.57 [LAWS could be especially risky in this regard
because of potential opacity about capabilities]{.underline}, in
addition to the "normal" opacity that exists about intentions. First,
[it will be extremely difficult for states to credibly demonstrate
autonomous weapon capabilities. The difference between a
remotely-piloted system and an autonomous system is software, not
hardware, meaning verification that a given country is operating an
autonomous system at all would be difficult]{.underline}. Second,
uncertainty about the technological trajectory of machine learning and
specific military applications means that countries might have
significant uncertainty about other countries' capabilities. Thus,
countries might invest a lot in artificial intelligence applications to
military systems due to fear of what others are developing.

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Human Dignity

#### No solvency -- ALL weapons violate human dignity -- not just autonomous weapons

**Pop, 2018 -- diplomat for the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign
Affairs** \[Ariadna April 10 "Autonomous weapon systems: A threat to
human dignity?"
<https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2018/04/10/autonomous-weapon-systems-a-threat-to-human-dignity/>
Acc 12/27/20 TA\]

Human dignity in anti-AWS arguments As we have seen above[, anti-AWS
arguments frequently employ Kantian terminology when invoking the
concept of human dignity. Unfortunately, however, in none of these
arguments do we get an account of how exactly human dignity is violated
by the employment of AWS. This is not satisfactory]{.underline}. Unless
it can be shown why the concept of human dignity mandates the
prohibition of AWS, such a prohibition is not justified. [Let us
therefore assume that human dignity stands for unconditional, intrinsic
value]{.underline}. Let us assume further that [this intrinsic value has
its source in our autonomy, understood as our ability to make
self-determined choices]{.underline}. What can plausibly follow from
such an understanding regarding the use of AWS? [To be sure, if we are
hurt or killed against our will, it severely impacts our ability to make
our own choices. Hence, to allow AWS to deliver force is certainly
incompatible with the moral value of autonomy. But how are AWS different
in this regard from regular weapons? After all, any type of weapon or
method of warfare, be it a remote-controlled long-distance missile, a
drone, an air strike or conventional ballistic weapon, is designed to
seriously harm human beings.]{.underline} What is it about AWS that
renders them particularly reprehensible from the point of view of human
dignity? I fail to see what the relevant argument could look like and
have also not found any satisfactory explanation in the literature. Note
that I am not saying that there are no morally questionable aspects in
the employment AWS, there certainly are. My point is simply that [if the
morally significant dimension is taken to be human dignity, and if human
dignity is understood as a value that has its source in our capacity for
self-determination, then the relevant incompatibility is not restricted
to a specific weapon system,]{.underline} but is shared by any type of
force that harms our agency.

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--ILAW Fails

Finally, the invested role of law appears throughout this terrain. As a
field that deals in classification and categorisation, it holds out the
promise of permitting and prohibiting certain behaviours, drawing the
line between the licit and the illicit across battlefields and
populations. It promises to do this through international treaties
banning certain methods and weapons of warfare, for example, and by
crystallising the norms of acceptable conduct. Yet [there are
[challenges to this **ambition**]{.mark} on multiple fronts:
the]{.underline} field of [**[i]{.mark}nternational** [law]{.mark}
not]{.underline} only notoriously suffers from problems with compliance,
but also from the more [fundamental issue that it [enables **violence**
whilst seeking to **constrain** it]{.mark}.15]{.underline} Critical
scholars of international law experiencing a [nostalgic [desire for
faith]{.mark} in **[legal]{.mark}** forms might think of the opposition
to the 2003 Iraq invasion that was based upon its illegality, when '[all
it would have taken to]{.mark} make the [war legal was Security Council
**authorizat**]{.mark}**ion'**. 16]{.underline} Our research agenda
concerning gender, war and technology[, regards [law's role]{.mark} from
a standpoint of critical distance: as [a vehicle for]{.mark} projecting
**strong** [state power]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[facilitating]{.mark}
'**proportionate'** [violence]{.mark} grounded [in 'military
necessity',]{.mark} as well as a possible means of constraining warfare
and providing redress]{.underline}. Kazan, for example, suggests that
[war torts be created in international law to provide some
accountability]{.underline} in the case of the use of autonomous weapons
systems[, at the same time arguing for a radical change to the way in
which law thinks about evidence]{.underline}. 17 Arvidsson suggests that
the binary-gendered notion of the 'human' in IHL (combatant/man,
civilian/woman), [as well as the [privileging of the 'human']{.mark} and
human agency in IHL more generally, requires us to rethink the
[boundaries of accountability where violence is enacted]{.mark} in the
course of armed conflict.]{.underline} In the praxis section Clare Brown
offers a practitioner's account the use of ICTs in conflict and
peacebuilding situations, including messaging and data collection
technologies, in her article 'The Use of CTs in Conflict and
Peacebuilding: A Feminist Analysis'. Brown argues that in spite of the
proliferation of new technological forms that are designed to respond to
and document armed conflict[, many of these ICTs have [**failed** to
incorporate]{.mark} the lived experiences of **[women]{.mark}**, let

The [**NATO** reflection group repor]{.underline}t has a **[patriarchy
problem]{.underline}**. Given that NATO is primarily a military
alliance, this is not surprising. But for a report that is looking ahead
for the next decade, it offers retrogressive views not just on human
security and the so-called Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, but
also in terms of how it [addresses concepts such as "cohesion" what it
considers to be the biggest threats to NATO]{.underline}, and how it
thinks the alliance should best deal with those challenges. Overall, the
report [embraces patriarchal approaches to "security", dissention within
NATO]{.underline} and where the alliance should go from here. The
recommendations [**further entrench NATO members in** a militarist
**pursuit of dominance,**]{.underline} rather than true community and
cooperation either internally or internationally. NATO members should
reject this approach. The [**abolition of NATO** would be the most
straightforward way to **allow its individual members to
pursue**]{.underline} genuine **[collective security with
others]{.underline}.** In the interim, [NATO members that authentically
care about peace, justice, international law, human rights and dignity,
and cooperation need to renounce the violent masculinities]{.underline}1
espoused in this report, including by rejecting nuclear weapons and
working to remove all weapons of mass destruction from NATO's doctrine.
They could also [withdraw from NATO and adopt feminist foreign
policies,]{.underline} finding common ground with other members of the
world community for the **[nonviolent pursuit of peace and
justice]{.underline}**. NATO, WPS and human security A one-page section
in the 67-page report deals with "Human Security and Women, Peace and
Security" (WPS). These subjects come across as an afterthought of the
report's authors, who were perhaps [seeking to check the 'gender
box']{.underline} that is increasingly a staple of checklists within
many intergovernmental agencies. This suspicion deepens when reading the
text, in which [NATO both simultaneously **positions itself as a
progressive leader in** respecting "human dignity" while making it clear
that any efforts within these agenda items are **exclusively for public
point-scoring,** not for serious policy development]{.underline}. The
report urges NATO members to promote the alliance's "work" on human
security by including it in public messaging, especially to the "younger
generation". It suggests NATO should "leverage existing partnerships
with civil society organisations" in order to "build a group of
emissaries for its work in human security and in WPS, including female
role models from countries where NATO has made a positive contribution".
It goes on to assert, "The personal stories, experiences, and engagement
of such a group would provide NATO with a strong asset in ongoing
efforts to raise awareness of the Alliance's constructive role in
promoting stability and addressing drivers of conflict" (p.43). Note
that it [doesn't suggest NATO actually address drivers of
conflict]{.underline}---just that it should spend more time telling
people that it does. However, **[NATO does not address root causes of
conflict]{.underline}**. NATO members themselves [drive many of the
ongoing conflicts in the world]{.underline}. Their [**individual and
collective policies of militarism**, and the violent masculinities these
policies reflect and further entrench]{.underline}, are part of the root
causes of [conflict]{.underline}. Rather than working within the human
security and WPS agendas in order to prevent conflict, or seek
nonviolent, non-militarised solutions to conflict, [NATO reflexively
turns again and again to weapons, war, aggression, and threats in order
to promote and protect its interest]{.underline}s. The challenges posed
by institutionalising WPS The WPS agenda has, to a large extent, become
about strategically [instrumentalising women's participation in order to
legitimise existing practice]{.underline}. Academics Marie Bell and
Milli Lake have well-articulated this problem, noting that
"[Adding]{.underline} certain [excluded groups]{.underline} into
existing institutions will ultimately [reinforce the same patriarchal,
capitalist, and militarist logics of hierarchy]{.underline} and
exclusion that denied those groups access to power in the first place".2
While women's participation---and gender diverse people---is imperative
and should be automatic, the way that the WPS agenda has been
implemented over the past twenty years unfortunately has reinforced
rather than challenged or changed the underpinnings of militarism
throughout security discourse and practice. Rather than challenging the
patriarchal structures and systems that have created the militarised
world order, once inside these systems, most women tend to actively
maintain it in order to maintain their positions. Nor do many of these
women believe they should have to "carry the burden" of changing
policies or structures. In a study from New America about women's
participation in the US nuclear weapon complex, for example, several
women interviewed felt they were dismissed by male colleagues on the
assumption that they would favour weapon cuts or disarmament. They had
to prove, as former NATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller said
she sought to do, that "women aren't afraid of nuclear weapons".3 As
feminist scholar Cynthia Enloe says, "[You can militarise anything,
including equality]{.underline}".4 You can also apparently whitewash
anything, including [NATO's role as an aggressor in international
politics]{.underline}. In its section on human security and WPS, the
reflection group's report asserts that "emphasising the value of human
dignity and security differentiates NATO from authoritarian rivals and
terrorist groups, which are among the world's human rights abusers"
(p.43). Yet NATO members have led and been involved in bombing raids
that have killed civilians and destroyed cities and towns leaving
civilians without housing, hospitals, food, schools, or basic water and
sanitation.5 NATO members are also, for the most part, hostile towards
or lacklustre about the current international political process to end
the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, which is essential for
protecting civilians and achieving human security.6

\*WPS\*=women peace and security agenda\*

Specifically, this article takes a critical feminist approach to
conceptualise [NATO as an 'institution of international hegemonic
masculinit]{.underline}y' through the way the [alliance invokes the
masculinist protection logic in its engagement with WPS]{.underline} and
[acts as a '**teaching machine'** shaping the value]{.underline} placed
on WPS by NATO members and a growing number of partners (Wright et al.,
2019). In this article, I develop this framework through situating civil
society within it and, in so doing, contribute something new to
understanding how [NATO functions through its move to active engagement
on the international stage with the WPS agenda]{.underline}. In
addition, this framework enables interrogation of how the WPS agenda can
become militarised despite civil society engagement. In order to do so,
I focus on how civil society engaged in WPS work perceive NATO and,
specifically, NATO's intentions. I seek to understand whether and how
NATO's attempts to engage civil society through the creation of CSAP in
2014 have influenced civil society perceptions of the alliance and in
turn whether such engagements have the potential to support
transformative understandings of WPS at NATO. My analysis proceeds as
follows. First, I introduce my method and approach drawing on an
understanding of NATO as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity. Next, I engage with the concept of civil society and the
relationship with the WPS agenda, before moving on to interrogate why
NATO has until recently remained an outlier in global governance with
its lack of formal policy engagement with civil society. The article
then moves to introduce the WPS architecture at NATO and specifically
the role of the Secretary General's Special Representative (SGSR) on WPS
in relationship building with civil society on WPS. Next, the article
turns to examine the motivations for civil society engagement with NATO,
before moving to interrogate the value civil society perceive NATO gains
from CSAP. Finally, I examine how encounters with **[NATO's bureaucracy
and security apparatus shape civil society perceptions of
NATO]{.underline}.** [NATO as an **institution of international
hegemonic masculinity**]{.underline}: method and approach NATO is a
political-military alliance built on [consensus
decision-making]{.underline}. Moving beyond its Cold War origins, the
alliance's remit has expanded significantly beyond a sole focus on
collective defence to include crisis management and cooperative
security. This has seen NATO's focus enlarge from a regional one to a
global one, with recent engagements in Afghanistan, Libya and Kosovo,
for example. Its status as a multilateral institution means it is
limited by its members' priorities and therefore sensitive not to
implicate NATO or NATO member states in wrongdoing (Hebert, 2012). In
centring NATO as an 'institution of international hegemonic masculinity'
(Wright et al., 2019), in this analysis, it is possible to shed light on
the peculiarities of NATO's WPS work to date, against which engagement
with civil society takes place. This has two co-constituting elements,
first, internally, [existing gender norms and expectations of
masculinity]{.underline} and femininity reflective of a [hierarchical
military institution]{.underline} are (re)created and (re)enforced
through NATO's engagement with WPS (Wright et al., 2019: 71). For
example, men working on WPS at NATO navigate both the [**trivialisation
and the feminisation of such work a**nd must (re)negotiate their own
identities.]{.underline} Yet in so doing they [reinforce the importance
of men speaking to and listening to other me]{.underline}n (rather than
women) [**reinforcing** the **gendered status quo**]{.underline} (Wright
et al., 2019: 93; see also Hurley, 2018a). Second, externally, as a
transnational military alliance, [NATO acts as a 'teaching
machine']{.underline} in which member and partner states learn the value
of WPS as a 'military tool' through socialisation with each other
(Wright et al., 2019; see also Enloe, 1981). This means [perpetuating an
understanding of WPS as a means to support operational effectiveness
through]{.underline} 'the **[role of masculinist
protector]{.underline}** which [reinforces hegemonic militaristic,
masculine ideals and norms']{.underline} (Wright et al., 2019: 34). This
patriarchal logic puts '[women and children, in a subordinate position
of dependence and obedience']{.underline} to justify the waging of war
(Young, 2003: 2), for example, [NATO's intervention in
Afghanistan]{.underline} (Wright, 2019). It is [reinforced through the
stories NATO tells internally about]{.underline} its [WPS
engagement]{.underline} (Hurley, 2018b) and externally in public
diplomacy (Wright, 2019) and to support partnerships with other states
but also celebrities (Wright and Bergman Rosamond, 2021) and now civil
society. Thus, interrogating civil society perceptions of NATO in this
context adds an additional dimension to understanding how [NATO seeks to
legitimise itself as a WPS actor]{.underline}, further [constituting its
role as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity]{.underline}. It is worth noting here that CSAP was revised
in late 2019 following an independent review commissioned by NATO,
neither this review, the new Terms of Reference nor full membership have
been made public. This reflects some of the challenges to researching
NATO, [an institution **cloaked in secrecy**]{.underline} by merit of
its purpose as a security and defence alliance (see Wright and Hurley,
2017 for a wider discussion). Therefore, the focus of this article is on
CSAP as it existed prior to this revision, from the first consultation
with civil society on WPS policy in 2014 and the formal establishment of
CSAP in 2016 until its 2019 revision which led to a change in
membership. This lack of transparency has also necessitated the method.
In order to assess civil society perceptions of NATO as a WPS actor, I
use a number of sources. First, I conducted 23 semi-structured
interviews of varying length with civil society actors working on WPS,
including current or former CSAP members. Participants were identified
via their membership of CSAP, as prominent civil society actors working
on WPS (in line with NATO's definition) and via snowballing. The
interviews took place either remotely or in person in locations across
the globe between September 2018 and March 2020. All of the interviews
were conducted on the condition of anonymity to enable participants to
speak as freely as possible. For this reason, no distinction is made
between current and former CSAP members. In addition, the locations of
specific interviews have not been revealed (Appendix 1), and this is
because the relatively small pool of members means doing so would
potentially expose the participants' identities. Second, I conducted a
review of civil society and NATO websites, including features on NATO or
CSAP specifically, along with NATO policy documents where available and
related content to inform my analysis. I used this information to
generate interview questions and also to corroborate interview data
where possible.

[**Abolish military alliances**,]{.underline} build peace alliances
There are ways to achieve collective security that do not necessitate
"military prowess" and rely on the threat of massive nuclear violence.
This [involves building and maintaining real community,
which]{.underline} requires reciprocity, trust, and understanding. It
requires us to live in relationship with others, not simply to demand
that everyone else obey our commands or conform to our way of thinking.
Governments that say they believe in the rule of law, in cooperation and
dialogue--- which is most NATO members---need to embrace plurality
rather than unanimity. The reflection group asserts that without
"cohesion", NATO's members will face all challenges alone. But this is
not how the rest of the world operates; it's not how activists operate.
The [demand for unanimity is a patriarchal]{.underline}, [authoritarian
approach to an alliance]{.underline}--- and it will ultimately fail.
**[NATO should be abolished as an institution]{.underline}**. It has
been corrupted by the military pursuits of its most aggressive members;
[its framework of operation, as is made clear in this report, is one of
violence, fear, and patriarchy.]{.underline} But the m[embers of NATO
could seek to establish a **truly democratic, decolonised denuclearised,
and demilitarised global alliance** for collective security if they so
wished.]{.underline} They could do by withdrawing from NATO and
[establishing feminist policies and partnerships with countries
**committed to nonviolence, equality, and global justice**.]{.underline}
They may find that in such a pursuit, they have more allies around the
world---and [less threats---than they currently see themselves
facing.]{.underline}

The global defense budget exceeded 1.9 trillion dollars in 2019, of
which [NATO represents 54% of that military expenditure]{.underline}
according to the latest report on military spending published by the

fact that many Alliance member states have not been able to invest at
least 2% of their GDP in defense as agreed at the 2014 NATO Summit in
Wales, yet NATO's [total military spending represents more than **half
of the global defense budget**]{.underline}**.** [Reallocating this

President for June, Ms. Nderitu said that even before the start of the
conflict in Ukraine, her office was working with the United Nations
country team to support intercommunal dialogue. She said that, because
determination of [the commission of genocide can only be made by a court
of competent jurisdiction, she could only but reiterate the call to end
the war, ensure protection of civilians and accelerate diplomatic
efforts to make both possible]{.underline}. The Council must do its part
by proposing a road map that considers that "peace itself is a process

that ["[Russia wants to **destroy**]{.mark} [Ukraine]{.mark}", both
literally --- [by **killing** and **raping** --- and]{.mark} in a

"This is exactly what is happening now," she stressed. [While such
[crimes are "the modus **operandi** of the **Kremlin**",]{.mark} the
current war is extraordinary, with the Russian army demonstrating
"barbarity that is difficult to imagine in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}". She urged the Council to understand that the
threat exists not only for Ukrainians but for the entire world. Along
similar lines, Jared Andrew Cohen, CEO of Jigsaw and Adjunct Senior
Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that, for the war on
Ukraine, there are more hours of footage uploaded to YouTube, TikTok and
other platforms than there are minutes of the conflict. "Like land, air
and sea, the Internet has become a critical domain to occupy during
war." Nowhere has this been more evident than Ukraine, he said, where
the Russian Federation has deployed distributed denial-of-service, or
"DDoS", attacks that have taken down connectivity by 15 to 20 per cent,
and on many occasions, dropped Internet connectivity to zero. His team's
research confirms the ability to leverage disinformation to motivate
violence, he added, noting that Russian propaganda that Ukrainians are
"Nazis" likely dehumanized Ukrainians in the eyes of Russian soldiers,
leading to the many war crimes now alleged against them. In the ensuing
debate, several delegates evoked the calamitous consequences of inciting
one group of people against another, with many recalling tragedies
endured during the Second World War, in Rwanda in 1994, in Srebrenica in
1995 and in Myanmar more recently. Leading the discussion, Albania's
delegate spoke in his national capacity to recall how, in the early
1930s, the Nazis used virulently anti‑Semitic newspapers to incite
Germans into persecuting Jews. On the eve of the invasion, Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin described Ukraine as an "artificial creation
of the Bolsheviks", he said, stressing that "what begins with
dehumanizing words ends in bloodshed". Lithuania's representative,
speaking also for Estonia and Latvia, said that for years, Ukraine has
been a target of Russian disinformation campaigns, aimed at justifying
an invasion. "[If there is [no clear and strong
**international**]{.mark} response to stop it, [the aggression against
Ukraine will be just the beginning]{.mark},"]{.underline} he warned, a
point echoed by Slovakia's delegate, who said that the pretexts under
which Moscow invaded [Ukraine resemble past patterns of framing a
targeted group as an existential threat in order to present war as
defensive and inevitable.]{.underline} In turn, the Russian Federation's
delegate blamed Ukraine's propaganda for pushing that country into
Nazism. He denounced the demonizing of his country, as well as hatred of
everything Russian, introduced year after year, with support from the
United States and other Western allies. After the 2014 Maidan coup, the
Kyiv regime incited violence against Russian-speaking inhabitants of
Ukraine, dubbing all those against it as terrorists, separatist puppets
and monsters. The United States delegate, meanwhile, strongly rejected
Moscow's efforts to distort history, noting that the General Assembly
rejected its false narrative on Ukraine and neighbouring countries.
Pointing out that some have ignored that the Russian Federation
illegally invaded its neighbour, he urged the Russian Federation to
immediately withdraw its forces and embrace diplomacy. China's
representative countered, urging certain countries to stop forcing
others to take sides. The cold war mentality, the logic of hegemony and
bloc politics "have long outlived their usefulness", he added. Offering
a word of caution, Ukraine's delegate warned delegates not to be
deceived by Moscow's anti‑fascist rhetoric, denouncing it as "another
manifestation of aggressive mimicry". Noting that, a week ago, President
Putin claimed that "the former Soviet Union was historical Russia", he
asked: "What is next?"

Swarms of robots with the ability to kill humans are no longer only the
stuff of science fiction. Lethal autonomous weapons systems
([[LAWS]{.mark}) are here]{.underline}. In **[Ukraine]{.underline}**,
[Moscow]{.underline} has allegedly [[deployed]{.mark} an artificial
intelligence (AI)-enabled [Kalashnikov ZALA Aero KUB-BLA loitering
munition]{.mark}, while **Kyiv [has used Turkish-made
Bayr]{.mark}**[aktar TB2 drones]{.mark},]{.underline} which have some
[[autonomous capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although it's always
hard to determine whether a weapon's autonomous mode is used, these
technologies have reportedly been employed in at least one conflict:
Last year, a United Nations report suggested Turkey used autonomous
firing by its Kargu-2 drones to hunt fleeing soldiers in Libya's civil
war (though the CEO of the Turkish company that produced the drone
denies it is capable of this). [Unlike traditional drones, these systems
have the ability to navigate on their own, and some can select
targets]{.underline}. Although a human controller can still decide
whether or not to strike, such weapons are acquiring ever more
autonomous capabilities. Now that militaries and paramilitaries
worldwide have taken note, these technologies are poised to spread
widely. The world today stands at the very moment before much more
advanced versions of these technologies become [ubiquitous. So far, at
least Israel, Russia, South Korea, and Turkey have reportedly deployed
weapons with autonomous capabilities---though whether this mode was
active is disputed---and Australia, Britain, China, and the United
States are investing heavily in [developing LAWS with an ever-expanding
range of sizes and capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Already, some LAWS
can loiter in an area to find targets that machine-learning algorithms
have trained them to recognize, including enemy radar systems, tanks,
ships, and even specific individuals. These weapons can look vastly
different: For instance, the Turkish Kargu-2 drone, which was introduced
in 2020 and used in Libya's war, is 2 feet long, weighs around 15
pounds, and can swarm in groups. Autonomous systems can also be much
larger, such as unmanned AI-driven fighter jets like the modified L-39
Albatros, and much smaller, such as rudimentary commercial drones
repurposed with autonomous software. Once these technologies have spread
widely, they will be difficult to control. The world thus urgently needs
a new approach to LAWS. So far, the international community has done
nothing more than agree that the issue needs to be discussed. But what
it really needs to do is take a page from the nuclear playbook and
establish a nonproliferation regime for LAWS.

region.]{.underline} Despite the numerous successes of the TB2 drone,
reports indicate that their usage in the Donbas region has become
limited due to a large number of Russian anti-aircraft systems. [The
importance of [the TB2 drones to the Ukrainians cannot be
**overstated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to Oryx, [a blog that
tracks the destruction of military equipment through open-source
reports, [these **drones** are credited with **destroying**]{.mark} the
following: 6 armored fighting vehicles, 5 towed artillery, 1
multi-rocket launcher, 2 anti-aircraft guns, 10 helicopters, 6 naval
ships, 3 command posts, 1 communication station, 2 logistics trains, and
numerous resupply trucks. The Ukrainian military reportedly started the
war with just 30 of these drones and have lost only 8 in
combat]{.underline}. Additionally, they recently received a gift of
another TB2 drone from the Lithuanians who crowd-sourced funds to
purchase one. [The Ukrainian military used the **TB2 drone to search for
and destroy [key targets behind enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline} lines. In
doing so, the TB2 drone has gained worldwide recognition, with several
analysts claiming that this family of drones has changed the nature of
warfare. Meanwhile, the manufacturers of the drone have stated that the
drones are now in high demand from militaries across the world. UNKNOWN

the Russian military has focused their offense on the Donbas region. In
doing so, they have been able to consolidate their anti-aircraft assets
to that region rather than having them spread out across the country.
The Russian military has now had the necessary time to repair the
systems damaged in the initial invasion, while augmenting their
anti-aircraft batteries with systems that were captured or held in
reserve. Moreover, the Russian military appears to have learned their
lesson from the initial assault, where their anti-aircraft systems were
focused primarily on protecting front-line units, [allowing the
Ukrainians to use the TB2 to target the vulnerable supply lines and
command nodes]{.underline}. With more assets and a consolidated region,
the Russian military is able to provide coverage to most of their forces
including their logistical units. Although much of the anti-aircraft
assets are Soviet-era, the Russian military is likely also implementing
new technology onto the battlefield, especially given their historical
usage of electromagnetic weapons. The Russians first shot down a TB2
drone in mid-March; they have had ample time to study the drone and find
vulnerabilities. By identifying the transmission frequencies and other
electromagnetic signatures, the Russian military can more effectively
detect and target the drones. Furthermore, the Russians could
potentially jam the control signals to drone as well. Bayraktar TB-2
Armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle on runway Given their limited supply of
TB2 drones, the Ukrainian military is unlikely to fly them into areas
where there is a high potential for them to get shot down, thus they are
limiting their usage in the Donbas region. [However, this is not a large
blow to the Ukrainian forces. Given the close range between the Russian
and Ukrainian ground forces, artillery fire can provide similar effects,
albeit less accurate. Meanwhile, the TB2 drones can be used
elsewhere.]{.underline} Recently, these drones featured heavily on the
Ukrainian attempt to reclaim Snake Island, where they destroyed an
ammunition depot, a command post, and a vehicle storage building. [They
were also used in destroying a tugboat in the Black Sea.]{.underline} It
is important to note that although the Russians may have shut down the
drone strikes in the Donbas region, they have not achieved air
superiority. The Ukrainians have been reinforced with new anti-aircraft
weaponry from the international community and are deploying them into
the Donbas region. With neither side having air-superiority, the war
will likely continue to be a slow-moving battle of attrition. [As the
war continues into its fourth month, the Bayraktar [TB2 drone will
likely continue to **play a role** in the conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}
However, it will likely not see the same degree of success that it saw
over the past four months, especially in the Donbas region.

**King 19** King, Iain. Iain King CBE is Defence Counsellor at the
British Embassy in Washington D.C. \"What Do Cognitive Biases Mean for
Deterrence?\" RealClearDefense, 12 Feb. 2019,
www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2019/02/12/what_do_cognitive_biases_mean_for_deterrence_114182.html.

[[Humans make poor decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[not just
sometimes, but [systematically]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and new
[[insights]{.underline}]{.mark} [into these cognitive biases [have
implications for deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. To illustrate just how
important these can be, consider the curious case of Abraham Wald, a
respected Columbia academic who, in 1943, was selected by the U.S. War
Department for an important task.\[1\] The United States Army Air Forces
were losing too many bombers over Europe to anti-aircraft fire and were
considering adding armour plating to the aircraft, but the extra metal
made the aircraft heavier, reducing performance and bomb loads. So,
armouring the whole plane was impossible. Where could extra armour be
placed effectively? Abraham Wald and his study of aircraft armor
(Slideshare) Wald researched where the bombers frequently suffered the
most damage. After an extensive survey of the squadrons returning to
base, Wald discovered most of the damage was to the wings and fuselage,
whereas the engines and cockpits seemed to be hit much less. Initially,
the War Department assumed the armour plating should protect the wings
and fuselage, but Wald explained how they were completely wrong. Armour
placement was needed where there was no damage since bombers hit there
never returned home to be studied. On Wald's advice, the armour plating
was duly placed around the cockpit and engines. Wald demonstrated that
the War Department was making a common mistake now known as survivorship
bias.\[2\] By looking at a skewed sample---in this case, only those
bombers surviving enemy fire---the War Department's logic went awry.
Survivorship bias is one of many deep-rooted and systematic flaws in the
way humans process information. [One might think people take in all the
available information and make the best decisions;]{.underline} in fact,
however, [**we tend not** to. We make bad decisions for many
reasons]{.underline}. For one, [[thinking]{.mark} [takes time]{.mark}
and effort,]{.underline} [and so [we]{.mark} often [go for]{.mark}
**heuristic [short-cuts]{.mark}.**\[]{.underline}3\] For another, [like
pack animals,]{.underline} [[we follow the
herd]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[4\] Furthermore[, we regularly misunderstand
the world in systematic ways. We have deep-rooted attachments to what we
already own, even when we can have something better.\[5\] These traits
have helped us to adapt and stay alive, and we have inherited them from
our ancestors who survived because of them]{.underline}.\[6\] **[[There
are at least fifty of these]{.mark} proven [quirks]{.mark} [that
warp]{.mark} our [decision making]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\[7\] One of
these is [[confirmation bias,]{.mark}]{.underline} where we tend to
underrate new information that challenges what we already believe. There
is also [[optimism bias]{.underline},]{.mark} which makes us
overestimate our chances of getting away with something.\[8\] Next to
these we have [[normalcy bias]{.mark},]{.underline} where we refuse to
plan for a disaster that has never occurred.\[9\] Then there is
[[reactance]{.underline}]{.mark}, a phenomenon is which we do the
opposite of what someone wants us to do just to defy a perceived
constraint on our freedom of choice.\[10\] These biases can influence
life in many ways, from who we marry to bad budgeting choices. But
[some]{.underline} [of the **most profound impacts are on
deterrence.**]{.underline} Promoted Content Mgid To understand the
effect of these systematic mistakes on how we deter unwelcome behaviour,
consider one of the oldest forms of deterrence, the threat of jail time
to discourage theft. In a rationale calculation, a substantial prison
sentence should be enough to deter almost anyone from stealing, but
cognitive biases mean this is not necessarily so. Reactance spurs
rebellious criminals to steal simply because stealing is outlawed. The
normalcy effect makes the ruinous impact of a prison sentence just too
hard to contemplate, so it does not factor properly in the criminal
mind. Criminals who plan a clever theft and escape tune out ways they
might be caught because of confirmation bias. Criminals who know
successful thieves and none of the many others who are caught and locked
up will suffer from survivorship bias if they calculate their own
chances of getting away with crime. And some will suffer from and
optimism bias if they just guess. So, every day punishments are in place
that should deter every right-thinking individual in the world, but
people still try their luck. Every prisoner is proof deterrence can and
does fail. These biases affect us all---not just criminals---and they
affect us much more than we realise. Almost all of us suffer from a bias
blind spot: the proven tendency for people to recognise biases in others
more readily than in themselves.\[11\] Thomas Schelling (EconLib) [Proof
that cognitive biases are real means **several of [the
assumptions]{.mark} [underpinning]{.mark} traditional [deterrence theory
are wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Academics like [Thomas
Schellin]{.underline}g[, who led U.S. thinking on nuclear
deterrence]{.underline} in the 1950s and 1960s and who was a
contemporary of Abraham Wald[, simply applied a standard hypothesis from
economics at the tim]{.underline}e: that people knew how to behave in
their own best interests.\[12\] People might make mistakes, went the
theory, but they'd soon learn how to correct their behaviour because
they would benefit from doing so. [Only in the 1970s, with the so-called
third wave of deterrence theory, was psychology understood in enough
detail to begin to grasp how people make systematic
errors.\[]{.underline}13\] Kremlinology, the study of key figures in the
Soviet system and how they behave and interact, became a key part of the
West's approach to nuclear deterrence. People, not weapons, became the
central focus of Western defence. The science of cognitive bias has
advanced considerably since then. We now know people consistently behave
in ways that go against their best interests in almost every
field.\[14\] Indeed, in the last decade many governments have set up
so-called nudge units, playing on these behavioural quirks to achieve
policy goals, from increasing pension contributions to enforcing traffic
laws.\[15\] [In military matters]{.underline}, [even though the stakes
are usually much higher**, [cognitive errors are]{.mark} still
[rife]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [[history is packed]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} examples of [wars]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [might have been
deterred were it **not for**]{.mark} **strong cognitive [biases]{.mark}
affecting decision make**rs]{.underline}. Consider Argentina in 1982,
which might not have invaded the Falkland Islands if it had a less
distorted view of the United Kingdom's resolve and capacity to respond.
Or consider France in 1870, where military groupthink tipped Napoleon
III into a disastrous war with Prussia. And Europe in the summer of 1914
was a cauldron of cognitive biases, as countries---Austria-Hungary,
Serbia, Russia, Germany, France, and Britain---made a succession of poor
judgments about the deterrence posture of rivals, rivals who, in turn,
provided misleading signals themselves, ultimately leading to a
catastrophe that spread around the world.\[16\] Mgid Signals Of Lung
Cancer Learn More→ According to one study, the weaker power initiates
conflict in some 33% of observations, suggesting military might fails to
deter as much as a third of the time.\[17\] Perhaps the attackers
suffered from restraint bias---the tendency for people and groups to
underestimate how easily they succumb to temptation? Perhaps groupthink
infected the highest levels of combatants' government and armed forces?
Perhaps the parties to conflict missed important signals from an enemy
because confirmation bias meant they were not looking for them? Whatever
the reason, chances are cognitive biases were involved. These tragic
examples of conventional wars contrast with a much better record in
nuclear matters where deterrence has, so far, been entirely successful.
[Nuclear conflict has been deterred for more than seven decades,
p]{.underline}artly because cognitive bias has been almost entirely
squeezed out of it. This suggests the calculus governing our nuclear
deterrent, and the strategic weapons of those who may oppose us, is as
protected from human shortcomings as it can be, thus keeping the world
safe. [We still need to **watch for normalcy bias**, though. [No nuclear
weapons have been used]{.mark} in war since 1945, but **[it is folly to
presume that will always be the case.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Yet, we would argue, such [positions are predicated on an **unfounded
fear** that taking control away from humans will enable robotic weaponry
to **demolish current**, **human-involved warfare practices**.
**[Extrapolating]{.mark} techno-development [trends]{.mark} into the
future**, [it is **reasonable to expect** future]{.mark} robotic
[weapons to]{.mark} acquire the capacity to **[reliably]{.mark}** and
**accurately [differentiate]{.mark}** []{.mark}between [combatants and
noncombatants]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sharkey 2012; Egeland 2016); [this
**could [even]{.mark} occur [in the near future]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(see Guizzo 2016). Indeed, Ronald [Arkin]{.underline} (2008)
[anticipates such [tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}---in particular,
recognition software---[to not only be **developed** but **[surpass
human performance capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see also O'Meara
2011; Egeland 2016). As he writes, "we must protect the innocent
non-combatants in the battlespace far better than we currently do.
Technology can, must, and should be used toward that end." Like Nadeau,
Arkin believes that [[moral LAWs would act in an **ethically superior
way** to humans]{.mark} in war]{.underline}, saying that: The
commonplace occurrence of slaughtering civilians in conflict over
millennia gives rise to my pessimism in reforming human behaviour yet
provides optimism for robots being able to exceed human moral
performance in similar circumstances (Arkin 2015). [One must also take
into account the consequences of **humans personally engaging in
warfare**. **Historical records**]{.underline}, including those of
concurrent military engagements, [recount **numerous acts of barbarism**
as a result of the **harsh conditions** that combatants are exposed
to]{.underline} (Arkin 2015). In fact, Lin et al. (2008) discuss how
[one of the **most attractive prospects** of LAWs is their **inability
to be affected by emotions** on the battlefield]{.underline} (Lin et al.
2008). It is the **[[emotional distress]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
often [[causes combatants to **mistreat the enemy**]{.mark} and **commit
war crimes**]{.underline}. Hence, [the introduction of LAWs that are
**unaffected by such emotional stress** serves as an **incentive for
continued development**]{.underline} (Klincewicz 2015).3 Second, [the
**emotional** and **physical pressures** that human combatants must
endure during wartime have **performance costs**. The [fatigue]{.mark}
of a long and drawn-out battle [affects]{.mark} the ability of
individual [soldiers]{.mark} to **perform optimally**, and thus affects
the **accuracy of their shots**]{.underline} (Burke et al. 2007;
Nibbeling et al. 2014). [[LAWs are]{.mark} **naturally
[unaffected]{.mark}** [by similar physical pitfalls]{.mark} and can
always]{.underline}---as long as the physical infrastructure is designed
optimally from the start---[permit the LAWs to **continually perform
accurately** and **as expected**. The ability for LAWs to engage in
**unwavering**, **precise combat** also **resolves some ethical issues**
that arise from human-waged war]{.underline}. In light of the fact that
LAWs do not possess emotions to guide their behaviors or personal stakes
that affect their combat approaches, [LAWs will always perform duties
accurately under **even the most**]{.underline} physically---or to a
human, emotionally---[**stressful conditions**, thus enabling them
to]{.underline}, at least more often than not, [kill in a **more humane
manner**. [LAWs can be programmed]{.mark} to **only engage targets [in
manners deemed most ethical]{.mark}** based on the dynamics of war at
the time of combat]{.underline}: the changing environment, the weapons
being used by both the aggressor and the defender, and the
characteristics of the target (human, robot, or physical structure).
[**Already**, [computerized weapons]{.mark} platforms [can engage
targets **far more accurately than**]{.mark} **any [human]{.mark}
counterpart can**]{.underline} (Geibel 1997; Shachtman 2007; Katz and
Lappin 2012; United States Navy 2017). Strong arguments can be levied
that [LAWs outfitted with such weapons platforms could engage in
otherwise normal wartime duties but in a means that is **far more
accurate** and thus **ethical**]{.underline}4 [as a consequence of LAWs'
**technological superiority**]{.underline}. [Part of this ethical
prowess exhibited by [LAWs]{.mark} is not only because they **never
tire**, but because they [are **impervious** to]{.mark} the
**[psychological shortcomings]{.mark} of humans**]{.underline}. Though a
contentious topic, [**several high-profile cognitive psychologists**
suggest that [humans **fabricate reasons for their actions after
committing them**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Davidson 1982; Nadeau 2006).
Thus, [[it is human to be **irrational**]{.mark}, to **make unreasoned
decisions** toward an action that is then validated after carrying
through. Such is **not the nature of a robot**]{.underline}. As
mentioned, [[LAWs **do not have**]{.mark} **any particular affinity to**
or **[personal interests]{.mark} in surviving battle**; they **do not
have any drive to exhibit particular harshness** against enemies of a
certain culture; and they **do not**]{.underline}, outside of their
goals, [**worry about winning the war** and heading back home after
using any unsavory methods to do so. What they do mind is their
**particular set of rules**, their **value-laden code** that dictates
**how they are to conduct themselves in an ethical manner** during
combat]{.underline}.

[Even more central to our discussion]{.underline}: [The second feature
of [the nuclear arsenal]{.mark} is that this capacity for unthinkable
levels of injury [resides **in the hands of a**]{.mark} **solitary
person, or a [small handful of persons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in the
United States as well as [in the other nuclear states]{.underline}.
Nuclear weapons strategy in the United States is designed around
"presidential first use," an arrangement that enables one man, the
president, to kill and maim many millions of people in a single
afternoon. [[The key features of]{.mark} nuclear [architecture
are]{.mark}, then, this unthinkably [magnified]{.mark} level of injury
at one end of the weapon and at the other end of the weapon, [an
**unthinkably small number of men**]{.mark} who [determine]{.mark} our
collective fate and [the fate of the planet.]{.mark}]{.underline} What
remains to be seen is whether the people of our own country---and more
generally the people of the earth---will permit these weapons and these
arrangements for presidential first use to remain in place. And then
there is a second key question: If the people of this country do not
wish these arrangements to remain in place, are there legal and
constitutional tools that can help dismantle those arrangements? Support
Progressive Journalism If you like this article, please give today to
help fund The Nation's work. It will be helpful to keep in mind that the
nuclear architecture is a physical architecture, but [the physical
architecture is accompanied by a mental architecture and it is this
mental architecture that keeps the physical architecture in
place.]{.underline} Let me say a few words about each. Click to enlarge.
(Graphic: Nagasaki University, Research Center for Nuclear Weapons
Abolition) As for the physical architecture, we can see from this chart
that 93 percent of the world's total arsenal is possessed by the United
States and Russia. The small wedge at one o'clock is the portion of the
arsenal owned by the other seven nuclear states. North Korea has, by the
most accurate estimates, fissile material for fewer than 20 warheads.
(Here and there estimates have come in as high as 60 warheads, but Hans
Kristensen at the Federation of American Scientists---over time the
single most reliable voice on weapons count---judges 20 or fewer to be
still the best estimate.) The legend on the chart tells us that each
icon represents five warheads. To get an accurate picture of the world
arsenal, we need to multiply the field of icons fivefold. In attempting
to comprehend the vast scale of the United States arsenal, we are
assisted by The New York Times, which recently provided a compelling set
of graphics. It calculated what portion of the US stockpile would be
needed to "decimate" Libya, what portion to "decimate" North Korea, what
portion to "decimate" Syria, Iraq, Iran, China, Russia, and then showed
how many weapons would be left over after we had killed one-fourth of
the population in those seven countries. Their answer: Seventy percent
of the US arsenal would remain. It takes thousands of painstaking small
steps to put a physical arsenal into place, and 99 percent of those
steps have already been completed. We're not waiting for something to
start; we're very late, as the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists's 2
½-minutes-to-midnight tells us. Only the last of the thousand
steps---the launch itself---remains. For example, specific cities all
over the world have specific targets assigned to them. Weapons are
assigned not just to our opponents but to our potential opponents, and
even to our non-opponents. During the most-recent Bush administration,
Vice President Cheney became curious about how many are assigned to each
city: "Tell me, I said to the planners, how many warheads are going to
hit Kiev under the current plan. It was a difficult question to get an
answer to because I don't think anybody had ever asked it before, but I
finally got a report back that under the current targeting plan, we had
literally dozens of warheads targeted on this single city." Until the
Clinton administration, the longitude and latitude of those cities were
programed into the missiles before they were loaded into the Ohio-class
submarines. Out of fear that a hacker would initiate a launch, this
practice was changed so that instead of the geographical coordinates of
cities, the longitude and latitude of uninhabited regions of ocean were
programed into the missiles. It is noteworthy that this ethical change
was brought about not by the application of moral reasoning---not by the
demands of the citizenry or councils of government---but by the very
real possibility of a hacker. Throughout this enlightened shift to
open-ocean targeting, what never changed was the assignment of specified
weapons to specified cities. What about the mental architecture that has
kept this physical architecture in place? Support our work with a
digital subscription. Get unlimited access: \$9.50 for six months. The
mental architecture requires first and foremost that little information
be given to the citizenry. In turn, attempts of the citizenry to protest
can be silenced by pointing out that they are speaking without knowledge
or information. This blackout of information imperils citizenship in the
same way that in earlier centuries depriving people of the art of
reading and writing imperiled citizenship. It has acted as a firm piece
of social control. [Many Americans believe that our nuclear weapons will
be used only in response to a nuclear attack by another country. Nothing
could be further from the truth. We have had first-use arrangements and
a first-use policy throughout the 70 years of the nuclear
age.]{.underline} Most Americans believe that the only time following
Hiroshima and Nagasaki that the United States came close to launching a
nuclear weapon was during the Cuban missile crisis. We now know that
[[Eisenhower twice]{.mark} [considered using an atomic weapon]{.mark} in
the Taiwan Straits]{.underline} in 1954 [and again in Berlin in 1959;
that the [Kennedy]{.mark} administration, according to Robert McNamara,
three times [came within "a hair's breadth]{.mark}" of war with
Russia;]{.underline} [that Lyndon [Johnson]{.mark} [considered]{.mark}
using a nuclear weapon [against China]{.mark} to prevent that country
from getting a bomb; and that [Nixon]{.mark}, by his own account[, four
times contemplated]{.mark} using a nuclear weapon]{.underline}. The
record stops there because only after a 30-year-time-lag when
presidential papers are released do we learn what our leaders planned.
Our current president, President Trump, is for many of us in the country
and for many people throughout the world a particularly reckless figure.
[Yet **[the]{.mark} presidential [first-use structure is
catastrophic]{.mark} even in the hands of the best of me**n. Yes, [it

reckless and irrational; but it continues to be fatal even in the hands

There is a fourth option. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[could develop an NC3 system based on artificial
intelligence.]{.underline} Such an approach could overcome the
attack-time compression challenge. [DARPA's
Knowledge-directed]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over
Schemas [program is an example of how an American NC3 system based on
artificial intelligence might function]{.underline}. [Fusing the
contextual and temporal events of a nuclear attack into an
analytic-based artificial intelligence capability may ensure **rapid
comprehension** and in turn generate associated and prompt **actionable
responses**]{.underline}. [The biggest challenge]{.underline} for such a
system [is its ability to learn and adapt. Unlike]{.underline} the game
of [Go,]{.underline} which the current world champion is a
supercomputer, Alpha Go Zero, that learned through an iterative process,
[in nuclear conflict there is no iterative learning
process]{.underline}. [Thus, a]{.underline} fully empowered "general"
artificial intelligence [system that learns may be far more difficult to
design]{.underline} than a "narrow" artificial intelligence system that
engages in limited analysis and decision-making. Artificial intelligence
is perhaps best poised to assist humans when it comes to the dimensions
of detecting a nuclear attack and deciding which planned option best
meets the criteria designed by programmers. Here, artificial
intelligence may, to a small degree, mitigate the tyranny of attack-time
compression and accelerate wartime decision-making. However, when a
president may have, at most, six minutes to make a decision, time
compression still poses a fundamental problem. [Artificial intelligence
is already being used for target identification, controlling autonomous
platforms, pattern recognition, and a number of other wartime tasks. It
is capable of processing vast amounts of information very quickly and
assessing the pros and cons of alternative actions in a thoroughly
unemotional manner]{.underline}. According to Vincent Boulanin:
[**Recent advances** in artificial intelligence could be leveraged in
all aspects of the nuclear enterprise]{.underline}. [Machine learning
could boost the detection capabilities]{.underline} of extant early
warning systems [and improve the possibility for human analysts to do a
cross-analysis of intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (ISR) [data.]{.underline} Machine learning
could be used [to enhance the protection of the command and control
architecture against cyberattacks and improve the way resources,
including human forces, are managed]{.underline}. Machine learning
advances could boost the capabilities of non-nuclear means of
deterrence: be it conventional (air defence systems), electronic
(jamming) or cyber. However, [artificial intelligence is no
panacea]{.underline}. Its failures are numerous. And the fact that there
is profound concern by well-respected experts in the field that science
fiction may become reality, because artificial intelligence designers
cannot control their creation, should not be dismissed. For the United
States, every option presents significant risk and uncertainty.
[Reality, however, is progressing to a point where the United States
must address the challenge we outlined above]{.underline}. [Russia and
China are not constrained by the same moral dilemmas that keep Americans
awake at night. Rather, they are focused on creating strategic advantage

topic is the development and use of lethal autonomous weapons systems

[U.[S. missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}, like nuclear forces, come
in various forms, with different capabilities, objectives, costs, and
reactions from allies and adversaries. The capabilities and footprint of
U.S. missile defense have expanded continually over the past twenty
years. [Today, they have attained a global reach, increased
technological capability, priority in defense budgets, and adoption by
U.S. allies.]{.underline} (Appendix B contains a record of U.S. missile
defense tests for Aegis and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense systems,
perhaps the most relevant defensive systems to adversary nuclear
postures.) [Still, the technical functionality of missile defenses
against modern missile forces is unknown.]{.underline} The United States
has not used missile defenses against a nuclear-armed adversary. Nor
have Israel's vaunted air defenses been used against advanced cruise or
ballistic missiles. Forward-deployed missile defenses---interceptors
based on land and on ships with warning and communications assets---play
a role in regional deterrence, defending allies and partners, U.S.
forces, and critical military and civilian installations on foreign
territory. The United States uses basing arrangements and foreign
military sales to encourage interoperability and information-sharing
among allies to improve the effectiveness of their missile defenses.1
Missile defenses on and near U.S. territory are supposed to defend the
U.S. homeland from ballistic missile attacks of the scale that North
Korea might be able to launch. In both scenarios, U.S. missile defense
can contribute to defeating and deterring conventionally and
nuclear-armed missile attacks, whether targeted at American cities or
U.S. nuclear and military forces. Because the focus of this review is
nuclear policy, its analysis and recommendations focus on three
conundrums that missile defenses could pose to managing and reducing
nuclear threats. U[.S. regional [missile defense arrangements include
theater]{.mark} missile defense systems, such as
[Patriot]{.mark}]{.underline} and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense), [that are designed [for terminal and "point" defense.]{.mark}
These systems are better suited for [protecting smaller areas where
important military installations and critical infrastructure may be
located.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Longer-range systems, such as
Aegis, also contribute to regional missile defense architectures,
operating off the coasts of U.S. allies in Europe and Asia. In Europe,
NATO allies host a radar site in Turkey, a command center in Germany,
and an Aegis Ashore site where Aegis SM-3 interceptors are deployed on
land in Romania with a planned second site in Poland, as part of the
European Phased Adaptive Approach.2 In Asia, the United States has
deployed THAAD radars and launchers in Guam, Hawaii, and South Korea.3
[All of these systems are [intended to protect U.S. allies as well as
U.S. forces stationed on allied territories]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Notwithstanding the [primary missions of [deterring and countering North
Korean and Irani]{.mark}an missile threats, U.S. military planners and
contractors also envision these systems' potential role in [interdicting
Russian or Chinese conventional and nuclear attac]{.mark}ks on targets
in Europe and East Asia]{.underline}. For instance, the 2019 Missile
Defense Review (MDR) states that "[[missile defense is an element of the
U.S. effort to]{.mark} counter]{.underline} A2/AD \[antiaccess/[area
[denial]{.mark}\] strategies that seek to deter or prevent the United
States from supporting allies in contested regions," implicitly
suggesting that missile defense will blunt Russian and Chinese attacks
associated with their strategies for regional conflicts]{.underline}.4
The November 2020 test of the SM-3 against an ICBM target deepened
Russia's and China's suspicions that U.S. missile defenses will be
directed against them.5 As the presence of Aegis ships and land
installations increase, Russia and China may further lose confidence in
the efficacy of their ballistic missiles. In 2017, China reacted harshly
(including an economic boycott) to the deployment of THAAD radars in
South Korea, claiming the system could help target Chinese ICBMs. These
dynamics raise two conundrums at the regional level. First, the United
States has insisted that regional defenses intended to deter or block
North Korean or Iranian attacks do not pose threats to Russian and
Chinese strategic nuclear deterrents. But Moscow and Beijing profess not
to believe these statements. To the extent that Russia and/or China add
offensive capabilities to counter such defenses, would the benefits of
defenses against regional Iranian and/or North Korean missiles outweigh
the costs? Second, the United States also seeks increased capabilities
to defend its forward-deployed forces and allies and partners from
Russian and Chinese regional missiles. [These capabilities are
especially important in East Asia, where China has steadily increased
its arsenal of short- to medium-range conventionally armed and
dual-capable missiles.]{.underline} Here the major conundrum is that it
is easier and cheaper for China to add missiles of this range than it is
for the United States to add defenses to feasibly counter them.
Moreover, kinetic and perhaps cyber capabilities to target Chinese
missiles and their command and control systems could intentionally or
inadvertently attack (or be perceived to attack) Chinese nuclear command
and control. This could exacerbate risks of escalating a regional
conventional war into a nuclear one. That concern notwithstanding, such
antimissile capabilities also could strengthen deterrence. The third set
of conundrums involves U.S. homeland defenses against ballistic
missiles, and the likelihood that they drive Russia and China to
increase their arsenals of long-range missiles and warheads. When the
United States withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty
in June 2002, the stated reason was the need to develop and deploy
systems that could defend the U.S. homeland from attack by future North
Korean and Iranian ballistic missiles. This reasoning remains the stated
objective of homeland missile defenses. Although Iran still does not
possess missiles that could reach the United States, North Korea has
tested several types of missiles that could improve its capabilities.6
For its part, to potentially counter this threat, the United States
still deploys only a little more than half the number of missile
interceptors on its territory that it would have been allowed had it
remained under the ABM Treaty's maximum of 100. The Ground-Based
Midcourse Defense System (GMD) centered on these interceptors in Alaska
and California cannot singlehandedly defeat a concerted missile attack
from Russia or China. The 2019 MDR acknowledges this fact, stating "[the
United States relies on deterrence to protect against large and
technically sophisticated Russian and Chinese intercontinental ballistic
missile threats to the U.S. homeland]{.underline}."7 Yet the MDR also
states "in [the event of conflict, it \[GMD\] would defend, to the
extent feasible, against a ballistic missile attack upon the U.S.
homeland from any source."8 [Russia]{.mark} is already
[developing]{.mark} and deploying [new long-range]{.mark} nuclear
delivery [systems]{.mark} to defeat current and expected future U.S.
missile defense capabilities]{.underline}. A major question is whether
Chinese leaders genuinely perceive such defenses to threaten the
viability of their growing strategic deterrent force of around 180
missiles, after that force has been attacked by U.S. conventional or
nuclear weapons. If the answer is "yes," then the conundrum is whether
the benefits of maintaining or adding to such defenses are greater than
the costs of doing so, in terms of both expense and the increased
likelihood that Russia and China would counter by greater numbers of
and/or more capable missiles and countermeasures. There are no clear or
easy answers to these conundrums. Since its withdrawal from the ABM
Treaty, the United States has acted as if the benefits of pursuing
defenses outweigh the risks of arms racing with Russia and China and
escalation of regional conflict. These posited benefits, which will vary
based on the actual performance of defense systems, include
strengthening deterrence, limiting the damage adversaries can inflict,
and reassuring U.S. allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East, and
East Asia. Advocates of missile defense do not fully acknowledge that
their programs drive Russia and China to develop and deploy offensive
countermeasures. Instead, they cite the modernization of Russian and
Chinese offensive nuclear forces as justifications for development of
even more modern U.S. missile defenses and offensive weapons, continuing
the action-reaction cycle. However, the unintended
consequences---especially those that impact U.S. nuclear deterrence
relationships with each major adversary---are equally important to
consider. Many of the Russian and Chinese nuclear capabilities that U.S.
nuclear policymakers and politicians decry are, in part, responses to
U.S. missile defense programs and their future potential capabilities.
Russia's much-vaunted new hypersonic weapons, including the
intercontinental-range Avangard HGV and the regional-range Kinzhal ALBM,
are notable not for their speed but their maneuverability, which may
more easily circumvent U.S. defenses than traditional ballistic
missiles. Similarly, the "exotic" Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise
missile and Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo could evade interception
and reinforce Russia's second-strike capabilities. Russian Iskander
deployments in and near Europe, now more than ten years old, were in
response to U.S. and NATO Aegis Ashore plans. For its part, China has
developed ballistic missiles capable of delivering multiple warheads and
penetration aids, including its newest DF-41 ICBM and the still
in-development JL-3 SLBM, and an HGV-equipped medium-range missile, the
DF-17. China's growing numbers of warheads and dual-capable (nuclear and
conventional) missiles and development of hypersonic boost glide systems
reflect a determination to improve the survivability of the country's
relatively small nuclear arsenal against U.S. offensive strikes and
defensive interceptions. Perhaps paradoxically, as Russia and China
develop maneuverable hypersonic weapons and other capabilities to bypass
U.S. homeland missile defenses, they may solve (at least partially) the
deterrence and instability challenges that U.S. ballistic missile
defenses pose. North Korea and Iran are not (yet) capable of deploying
such sophisticated offensive systems. Thus, U.S. homeland defenses
predicated on ballistic missiles of the number that North Korea (and
perhaps someday Iran) could deploy would not threaten forces as
maneuverable as Russia's or China's. However, Moscow and Beijing would
still worry and plan against future U.S. defense technologies,
especially space-based ones. Current U.S. missile defense policy will
suffice if policymakers believe that unconstrained competition in
offensive and defensive weapons is preferable to potential agreements
that would provide transparency and potentially some limits on U.S.
missile defense in exchange for possible Russian and Chinese
concessions. However, U.S. interests and those of allies and the rest of
the world would be better served by exploring what possible trade-offs
could be negotiated between transparency and potential limitations on
some U.S. missile defense capabilities, on one hand, and Russia and
Chinese reductions and/or constraints on some of their current and
prospective offensive capabilities, on the other. The most promising way
to assess these possibilities would be to explore whether and how
regional and/or homeland missile defenses could be designed and deployed
to protect against a lesser scale of missile threats (such as those
posed by Iran and North Korea) without creating the realistic prospect
that the United States could successfully negate a Russian or Chinese
deterrent of U.S. first strikes against either Russia or China.

Despite current trends in military technologies and the ways in which
machines are already helping to make life/death decisions, neither
algorithmic 'independence', nor AI which decides to kill, [[nor any type
of]{.mark} superhuman [soldier would be covered under a pre-emptive ban
of autonomous weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, [a
**[posthuman]{.mark}** approach to [autonomous weapon]{.mark}s would
recognise the [connections between the human and the
machine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such an approach [would not fixate on
[autonomy but would instead work to break down]{.mark} the false
[dichotomies between **autonomy**-automation]{.mark} and
human-machin]{.underline}e, instead focusing on the [ethical
**[implications]{.mark}** of killer **[systems]{.mark}** across these
lines]{.underline}.147 As noted above, [whilst [xenofeminism and
**posthuman** feminism]{.mark} understand the dangers as well as the
[potentials of technology, xenofeminism]{.mark}]{.underline} in
particular does not account for the power of militarism and the
militarism-capitalism assemblage. It seems, therefore, that the risks of
the [[**technologymilitarism**-**capitalism** **assemblage**]{.mark}
need to be further [read into xenofeminism to ensur]{.mark}e that it
stays true to its own aims of [using and appropriating
technology]{.mark} to construct an [intersectional]{.mark} feminist
future]{.underline}. Braidotti's posthumanism pays attention to death
and modes of dying while promoting an [[affirmative posthuman era in the
face of the **necropolitical**]{.underline}]{.mark}.148 In contrast to
[the necropolitical politics of death itself,149 Braidotti proposes '[a
politics of life itself'150]{.mark}]{.underline} which chooses to
[tackle the obstacles of the [posthuman **condition**]{.mark} as they
come]{.underline}. She thus states[: It [is a constant challenge for us
to **rise**]{.mark} to the occasion, to [be 'worthy of our
times']{.mark}, while resisting them]{.underline}, and thus to practise
amor fati affirmatively. It is quite demanding to catch the wave of
life's intensities in a secular manner and ride on it, exposing the
boundaries or limits as we transgress them\... [[**Death** is the
ultimate **transposition**,]{.mark} though it is not final, as zoe
carries on, relentlessly]{.underline}.151 It seems hard, however, to
read autonomous weapons in the [[affirmative when **weapons technologies
kill people**]{.mark} in ever more removed and de-personalised
ways]{.underline}. [Autonomous weapons, are/[will be the **child** of
the military]{.mark} economy]{.underline}. As Braidotti notes, however,
[to analyse in the [**affirmative** is not to deny the horror of our
times]{.mark}]{.underline}. Affirmation 'proposes a different way of
dealing with' such horrors.[152 I propose that [**xenofeminism**
provides an affirmative blueprint for **embracing**]{.mark} the current
[times]{.mark}]{.underline}. I have noted how xenofeminist method works
to [[appropriate **technology** and existing p]{.mark}olitical
structures, bending [them to feminist aims]{.mark}]{.underline}. 153
While the current form of xenofeminism does not fully account for the
links between technology and militarism, this does not mean that
xenofeminism cannot accommodate such concerns. Xenofeminist method is an
affirmative approach in that it notes the contradictions and risks in
the posthuman condition and works to deconstruct them. [Thus, taking an
affirmative [posthuman-xenofeminist perspective]{.mark}, one which
understands the ways [in **which the human and the machine are deeply
interconnecte**d]{.mark}]{.underline}, I wish to use xenofeminist method
-- the appropriation of technology for feminist aims -- to propose a
posthuman-xenofeminist discourse on autonomous weapons. While the XFM
does not explicitly address the threat to life technology could pose,
the wish to define and use technology for feminist aims, I have already
suggested, [inherently includes the wish to ensure that technology
remains ethical]{.underline}. Taking this further, it is important to
note that [anti-militarism is a key part of the feminist
project]{.underline} as exemplified by the Women's Peace Conference of
1915, to the feminist activism of Greenham Common to the ways in which
Haraway, in her early foundational works, highlighted anti-militarism as
a key feminist project.154 While there are many feminists who do not
promote an anti-violence stance, choosing to fight as part of their
feminism, for example, this does not preclude an anti-militarism stance
in the realm of military technologies.155 Neither does an
anti-militarism stance in this area wish to judge those who engage in
fighting as part of their feminist project as 'not feminists', nor to
associate feminism inherently with peace. Rather, in noting the history
of anti-militarism within the international feminist project, [I wish to
suggest that there is a need to promote an ethics of anti-militarism at
the [international **structural** level]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
precisely because of the ways [in which militarism structures the global
order, working [to structure technological innovation and
development]{.mark} alongside forces such as capitalism, colonialism and
other power structures]{.underline}. Such a stance must therefore be
contrasted to more contextual scenarios, where fighting may indeed be
the best form of feminist response. In this sense, anti-militarism must
be distinguished from an anti-violence position, with anti-militarism
aiming to challenge the industrial, technologically crafted, capitalist
driven military complex and with an antiviolence position calling more
broadly for peace and non-violence. It thus follows, given the links
between militarism, technological advancements and capitalism, [that
[xenofeminism, as a project aiming to]{.mark} appropriate [technology
for feminist aims]{.mark}, must have regard for
antimilitaris]{.underline}m. A xenofeminist appropriation of technology
must therefore include the desire to ensure that the technology of the
now and future cannot be used either for military gains or for the
taking of human or nonhuman life.156 Xenofeminist method provides an
affirmative method for dealing with the current times and the issue of
military technologies. [[Drawing]{.mark} on the will [to **appropriate**
technology for **feminist** aims]{.mark} and to create the future [from
the **present, manipulating, hacking and coding the
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}, it seems that the appropriation of
technology includes ensuring that technology can only be developed in
ethical ways. Technology is dependent on a set of programming choices
which will shape machine intelligence as technology advances. What
choices are made now, what programming choices are made in these current
times, could structure the entire future of technology and machine
intelligence. [There is a need [for **feminist posthuman perspectives
and xenofeminist infiltrations now**.]{.mark} T]{.underline}he
xenofeminists know well that it matters who makes those programming
choices. As Haraway puts it, 'it matters which figures figure figures,
which systems systematize systems'.157 Noting that 'technology isn't
inherently progressive', the xenofeminists call for an intervention in
these choices.158 While intelligent machines could indeed be the end of
humanity, [such [machines may not make such
choices]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is important to get the now right in
the hope of [working towards a future where the machine-human can work
together ethical]{.underline}ly. As Haraway notes, 'the machine is use,
our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for
machines: they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for
boundaries; we are they'.159 The XFM advocates the infiltration of
multiple discourses.160 [I propose this could include law. I have argued
that the discourse on autonomous weapons needs to be made
posthuman]{.underline}, emphasising [the links [between **the machine
and the human**]{.mark} and the ways in which seeing the autonomous
[weapon **as the machinic other is a fall**acy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Xenofeminist method calls for the appropriation of technology to
promote, in Braidotti's terms, [affirmative aims: [constructing the
future from the now]{.mark}]{.underline}. While many of the groups
calling for a legal ban of autonomous weapons may be overlooking some of
the nuances in the debate and definitions, their larger goal -- to seek
legal frameworks to regulate these systems -- is an aim which can remain
useful. After all, [**[legal regulation is a core manner]{.mark}** in
which profit-making tech creators **[may be forced to shape their
innovations in ethical ways]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, a
xenofeminist [method may include not only the [appropriation of
technology itself but **also the frameworks which regulate
it.**]{.mark}]{.underline} These frameworks are key in structuring
future developments of technology, and thus work to appropriate
technology through **[[structuring the creation of technology from
the]{.mark} outset]{.underline}**. In line with xenofeminist method,
therefore, I propose that a [legal **framework** [is needed to ensure
that **feminist ethics of anti-militarism, justice and
intersectionality**]{.mark} remain central [to **technological
innovation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A feminist posthuman understanding of
technology is required here: to [ensure that the dark sides of
[technology are evaded whilst **technology's** positive, subjectivity
challenging]{.mark} and [capitalism destroying potential is
maintained]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a need to focus on the
regulation of all technologies, given the real possibility that killer
machines may be created in multiple ways. There have been steps in other
contexts towards creating broader ethical regulations for technology.
This can be seen in the example of the European Parliament resolution of
16 February 2017, which makes recommendations to the Commission on Civil
Law Rules on Robotics.161 [The resolution is well thought out,
considering a **variety of issue**s around the legal **regulation of
technology** and noting issues around **liability**, care robots,
autonomous vehicles and privacy issues]{.underline}.162 The resolution
[calls for the urgent **need to regulate technologie**s]{.underline}.163
While the resolution opens up debate on these issues, it is non-binding
and seeks to regulate non-military technologies, thus upholding a false
binary between military and civil technologies despite the clear
cross-overs. As noted above, many civil technologies are originally
created for military purposes, and there also remains a risk that civil
intelligent technologies may decide to kill or may be easily adapted to
make them kill.164 In addition, the resolution does not consider human
enhancement technologies despite emerging developments in this area.
This trend towards focusing on the immediate present and towards
categorising military and non-military technologies separately is
repeated throughout legal and policy attempts to regulate these
technologies. [There is an urgent need for a
[posthumanxenofeminist]{.mark} i[nfiltration]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
discussions around the [[legal regulation of technology, working to
promote a future-facing feminist posthuman
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} which understands the cross-overs
between civil and military technologies, the human and the machine, and
autonomy and automation. While [technology may be largely controlled at
present by a capitalist elite with strong ties to
militarism,]{.underline} this does not mean this technology will
inevitably remain in their hands and under their control. By ensuring
that basic ethical principles are applied now, through the application
of laws to regulate programming choices and technological innovation in
the present, technology can be shaped, working towards a post
capitalist, fairer, more ethical and just, feminist world.

III\. DEVELOPING A REGULATORY SCHEME

**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational **[[law]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[already regulates]{.underline}]{.mark} a category of [[weapons]{.mark}
systems [that share]{.mark} important [similarities with
FAWs]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[landmines]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
several commentators have hinted at these similarities,55 scholars have
yet to consider whether FAWs might be regulated much as landmines are.56
This lacuna is striking because the similarities between FAWs and
landmines speak directly to core questions of distinction and
proportionality under international law.

A. Drawing from the Amended Protocol

Landmines and FAWs share several essential features that affect the
level of risk they pose to civilians. First, once activated, landmines
and FAWs both possess the capacity to "target" and kill without further
human input. For instance, anti-tank landmines possess a rudimentary
capacity to discriminate between targets, in the sense that they explode
only when a large vehicle travels over them.57 Like FAWs, landmines not
only react to an external signal but also potentially possess the
ability to distinguish among signals. The extent to which a weapons
system can make such distinctions in a given set of circumstances is
essential to determining whether it complies with international law.

Second, both landmines and FAWs are used, and threaten individuals,
within certain defined parameters.58 Landmines are placed in a
particular location. FAWs would also be deployed with a specific set of
instructions, which may include limitations on the areas within which
they can operate. These qualities affect the likelihood that any system
will target (or harm) civilians. In this respect, landmines and FAWs
implicate similar questions of distinction.

Landmines and FAWs are also similar in the sense that their
permissibility turns on technical characteristics. Landmines can be made
with detectable or undetectable materials; they can be triggered by
different stimuli; they can be delivered remotely or by hand; and they
can be set to deactivate after a certain amount of time has passed.
Similarly, [[FAWs]{.mark} could have better or worse sensors or
targeting software, could carry lethal or non-lethal ordinance, and
could be mobile or static, among other traits]{.underline}. [These
[features create]{.mark} ample [opportunity]{.mark} for the
international community [to supply]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[specific
rules]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[regarding how]{.mark} these [weapons can
be designed]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the intention of rendering them
compliant with international law.

At the same time, FAWs and landmines are dissimilar in ways that render
an Ottawa Treaty-style ban inappropriate. Unlike landmines, FAWs will
likely be subject to tracking and remote deactivation by design.59 The
"temporal indiscriminateness" of landmines, which can kill many years
after they are placed,60 is therefore almost non-existent with respect
to FAWs. Moreover, [[FAWs may develop in ways]{.mark} that make them
[capable of distinguishing between civilians and
combatants]{.mark}]{.underline}. Landmines, on the other hand, cannot
make this distinction. No inherent feature of FAWs renders these weapons
categorically impermissible under international law---within some
parameters, they may even perform better than human soldiers. [Compared
to landmines]{.underline}, then, [FAWs present a better case for
regulation]{.underline}.

Given the parallels between these weapon systems, [[the Amended Protocol
provides a]{.mark} suitable [framework for regulating]{.mark}
FAWs]{.underline}. The Protocol, first negotiated in 1980 and amended in
1996 in response to concerns about the proliferation of landmines,
[[provides specific rules governing]{.mark} how landmines may be
used]{.underline}.61 Specifically, the Amended Protocol [focuses on
geographic and spatial criteria for determining whether the deployment
of mines is permissible]{.underline}.62 First, as a threshold matter,
the Protocol does not apply to anti-ship mines,63 suggesting a
recognition that---[much like in the robot case discussed
above]{.underline}64---the use of these weapons at sea raises less
problematic issues under international law. Second, the Protocol makes
clear that the definition of "indiscriminate" use, a concept from the
Geneva Conventions,65 applies to how landmines are placed. The Protocol
requires landmines to be deployed around military objectives and
requires states to presume that locations "normally dedicated to
civilian purposes"---for example, homes and schools---do not constitute
legitimate military objectives.66 Relatedly, Section 9 of the Amended
Protocol provides that distinct military objectives cannot be treated as
one objective, and this, in effect, [requires states to deploy landmines
only in precisely defined areas]{.underline}.67 The Protocol [also
requires additional protections in order to place certain weapons in
areas containing a concentration of civilians]{.underline} and no active
military engagement.68

The emphasis on how landmines are deployed stems from features that
landmines share with FAWs. The Protocol focuses on commander
decision-making because landmines do not require human action to kill
once activated. Under the Amended Protocol, commanders may deploy
landmines only within certain parameters, defined by how likely they are
to contain civilians. These parameters provide a more precise
instantiation of what distinction requires.69 The Protocol does not
completely foreclose the use of landmines, but rather allows states with
legitimate military purposes to deploy them in a limited fashion.70 [By
limiting how a commander may deploy landmines, the Amended Protocol
implicitly attempts to curb the risk of civilian harm from their
use]{.underline}.71 [The Amended Protocol]{.underline} thus [[grapples
with]{.mark} the [same]{.mark} normative [challenges]{.mark} that [FAWs
pose]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this respect**[, it [provides a]{.mark}
particularly [apt model for regulation of FAWs]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The Amended Protocol for landmines also [establishes a framework for
the use of a highly technical weapons system]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
in this sense it [provides precedent for the regulation of]{.underline}
weapons like [FAWs]{.underline}. The Protocol contains several
[[technical restrictions]{.mark} on landmines and provides other
important protections]{.underline}. Several articles of the Protocol,
for instance, [[provide detailed requirements for which characteristics
landmines must have and which they may not]{.underline}]{.mark}.72
Article 3, Section 8 prohibits any method of delivery that cannot
distinguish between military objectives or that would lead to excessive
loss of civilian life.73 The Amended Protocol also contains a catch-all
provision requiring states to take all "feasible precautions" against
risk of harm to civilians.74 By analogy, **[[a regulation]{.mark} for
FAWs [could establish specific technical limits]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[including]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[baseline requirements
for]{.mark} sensory or computational ability and [shut-off
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given that the Amended Protocol set
out to answer many concerns similar to those raised by FAWs, it makes
sense to draw from this framework in developing a comparable regulatory
scheme.

B. A Model Framework for FAWs

[[The international community should negotiate---or]{.mark} nations
should [develop]{.mark}]{.underline}---[**[an instrument for
FAWs]{.mark}** that is **[analogous to the Amended Protocol for
landmines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These rules would [focus on
delineating parameters under which FAWs can be used]{.mark} consistently
with the principle of distinction]{.underline}. Such parameters would be
defined by the need to reduce the risk of civilian casualties. These
might minimally include:

· [[Characteristics of the FAW]{.underline}]{.mark}. As they develop,
FAWs may vary widely in their ability to determine whether individuals
are civilians or combatants. A regulatory framework could [[include
technical details, such as]{.mark} the [quality of]{.mark} the onboard
[camera]{.mark} and the [FAW's ability to make]{.mark} more [difficult,
contextual assessments of intention and behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}.75
[In the future, the rule might consider the machine's capacity to learn
from encounters, which may improve its capacity to distinguish but may
also create a risk that the weapon will exceed its
programming.]{.underline}

· Characteristics of the environment. A remote battlefield is unlikely
to pose much risk of civilian harm. But a well-trafficked urban area
should require the use of a FAW with a heightened capacity to assess
targets.76 At the moment, until FAW technology develops further, this
may mean that [the [deployment of FAWs in densely populated areas should
be]{.mark} per se [illegal]{.mark}]{.underline}. More generally,
commanders should also [refrain from deploying FAWs near locations that
are frequented by civilians, like schools and places of
worship]{.underline}. Above all, this regulatory factor would focus on
the relative concentration of combat forces and civilians.

· [[Characteristics of the opposing force]{.underline}]{.mark}. Whether
enemy forces wear uniforms or insignia or instead blend into the
civilian population may make a difference in terms of how well a FAW can
distinguish between combatants and civilians. Regulations should include
this factor and should require commanders to consider countermeasures
used by opposing forces to evade detection. This factor may be
dispositive depending on how significantly the opposing force's evasion
techniques affect the FAW's ability to distinguish.

· [[Level of residual human control]{.underline}]{.mark}. The degree to
which a human operator supervises and is able to override decisions or
shut down the FAW is relevant, even if the machine operates in a fully
autonomous capacity. The constant supervision of an operator, who can
cancel targeting decisions in real time, may strongly point in favor of
a weapon's permissibility. Depending on the other features of the weapon
and how they affect its ability to distinguish, oversight might even be
explicitly required.

· Other factors.Other factors that affect whether a FAW may permissibly
be used could include [[weather conditions, ordnance
strength]{.underline}]{.mark} (and lethality/non-lethality), whether the
weapon is stationary or mobile, whether it is offensive or defensive,
and the risk that it will exceed any limitations (for instance, by
traveling out of a designated zone).

An international agreement [[providing rules to
govern]{.underline}]{.mark} FAW usage would also need to address [the
issue of [accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Amended Protocol
requires states to impose sanctions against individuals who wrongfully
use landmines.77 This reflects the intuition that the commander's
decision to deploy is the proper focus of responsibility. We should
evaluate responsibility in the context of FAWs the same way. [If a
commander knowingly deploys a FAW with weak targeting software in the
middle of a city, and it kills dozens of civilians, most would likely
agree that the commander has committed a crime, or at least should be
subjected to sanctions of some kind]{.underline}.78 The standards
developed to regulate FAWs should aim to provide commanders with more
specific guidance regarding lawful usage, not only to encourage proper
use, but also to enable authorities to judge when a commander has used
weapons unlawfully.

In this respect, **[regulation is an attempt]{.underline}** not only to
limit the harm of war, but also **[to bolster the rule of
law]{.underline}**. The commander is liable for his own unlawful act of
deployment, like a commander who recklessly orders that artillery be
fired in a populated urban area.79 [[To ensure compliance, states should
train commanders in the legitimate use of FAWs]{.underline}]{.mark}.80
If a commander knowingly uses FAWs in a way conducive to harming
civilians, he should be punished.

**CP solves -- regulations will prevent cheating and encourage buy-in
and spill-over to eventual full bans, but an attempt at a full ban
initially causes cheating and lack of compliance that guts the aff**

[[Opponents]{.mark} of FAWs [invoke]{.mark}]{.underline} each of these
[[critiques]{.mark} to argue [in favor of a]{.mark}n absolute,
preemptive [ban]{.mark}]{.underline} on FAWs.24 In their view, once
nations have developed FAW technology, it will be difficult to get them
to stop.25 The time to act is now, before the military utility of FAWs
has been demonstrated and before other countries develop FAW technology
in response. These arguments resonate with apocalyptic images, replete
in pop culture, of killer robots run amok---think Terminator.26 Yet
[[they]{.mark} also [exaggerate]{.mark} the [danger]{.mark} posed [by
FAWs]{.mark}]{.underline} and underappreciate regulation's potential to
respond to the threats that FAWs do pose.

II\. THE ARGUMENT FOR REGULATION, RATHER THAN PROHIBITION

This Comment begins from the proposition that the purpose of
international humanitarian law is to minimize harm understood in terms
of suffering---primarily to civilians, but also to combatants.27 Many
have argued that public policy should be guided by consequentialist
aims, given, among other things, the differences between individuals and
states28 and the inevitability of trade-offs in policymaking.29
Gabriella Blum contends that [the argument for consequentialism is
particularly strong in the case of armed conflict]{.underline}, which
"is about committing evils and choosing between evils."30 Following
Blum's logic, this Part brackets the deontological critique of
FAWs---understood as the view that the use of FAWs is wrong
independently of its consequences---and focuses on [the possibility of
regulatory regimes that minimize suffering in practice]{.underline}.
While the deontological critique of FAWs presents a serious challenge,
it loses much of its force if the responsible use of FAWs can reduce
harm.31

[A consequentialist approach focused on minimizing harm]{.underline}
also makes less compelling the objection that the use of FAWs reduces
accountability. While the "autonomous" nature of FAWs appears to
distance decision makers from the harms they inflict, commanders remain
responsible for the initial use of FAWs. A commander must give the order
to deploy a FAW and set parameters for its use---for example, by
instructing that a FAW has X mission and must operate within Y area. In
this sense, there is no such thing as a fully autonomous weapon. Any
weapon will require human intervention at some point, if only to
activate it. The commander is ultimately responsible for using a FAW
within its programming and within legal limits. If humans must remain an
integral part of the decision to take a life in order for a weapon to
fulfill the condition of accountability, then FAWs satisfy this
requirement.

I focus, therefore, on the question whether, as a legal matter, [FAWs
can be regulated in ways that minimize the suffering that they
cause]{.underline}. This Comment argues that they can, for two reasons.
First, **[[FAWs are highly amenable to
regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As quasi- but never fully autonomous
systems, [FAWs are [ripe for a regulatory scheme that provides standards
for permissible usage and holds commanders
accountable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, given the potential military
utility of FAWs, [**[states are more likely to comply with regulations
than]{.mark}** with an]{.underline} **[[absolute
prohibition]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This point matters
because]{.underline}, even if the [[critics]{.underline}]{.mark} are
correct that FAWs will always violate international law, they [[**are
wrong** to think]{.mark} that [prohibition]{.mark} will [avert]{.mark}
these [harms]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A. FAWs May Be Used Lawfully

Whether FAWs can be deployed lawfully depends in part on whether they
can be used in a manner that avoids civilian casualties. Given the pace
of technological development, it is too early to say that a FAW could
never make the contextual and difficult decisions that soldiers must
make when distinguishing between combatants and civilians.32 As George
R. Lucas, Jr. argues, the critical question is not whether FAWs can "be
ethical," but whether they can perform at the level of a human
soldier.33 Human soldiers aren't perfect.34 Indeed, robots may have a
number of advantages over humans, including superior sensory and
computational capabilities, a lack of such emotions as fear and anger,
and the ability to monitor and report unethical behavior on the
battlefield.35 A robot might also have access to greater information
about the value of a target, and hence may be able to make a better
determination on an issue like proportionality in the heat of the
moment. Even if robots lack quintessentially human characteristics like
empathy,36 they may nonetheless be able to respect the rules of combat.

Whatever we might think about the capabilities of FAWs as a general
matter, in some circumstances the use of FAWs will be wholly
unproblematic. Imagine a robotic submarine operating in an isolated
undersea environment, far from any civilians.37 Here the risk of the
submarine violating international humanitarian law is exceedingly low.
This is a best-case scenario, but it illustrates a broader point: [the
efficacy and legitimacy of FAWs will depend on the
circumstances]{.underline}. In this regard, FAWs are unlike some weapons
that have been banned by the international community, like
non-detectable fragments and blinding laser weapons, which cause
unnecessary suffering no matter how they are used.38 In the future, FAWs
may have the ability to patrol an urban area and seek out combatant
targets; for now, perhaps they are best left to operate in isolated
environments or in a purely defensive capacity. In either case, [[the
need for clear guidelines is not an argument for]{.mark} an outright
[ban]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Rather than prohibiting FAWs]{.mark} writ
large, **[i]{.mark}**nternational [**law** should recognize]{.mark} that
[in some circumstances, they may permissibly be
used---bolstering]{.mark} the [case for regulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Regulating FAWs would]{.mark} also [help]{.mark} to [resolve]{.mark}
issues of [**compliance** and
**accountability**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} International law sets out
fairly broad standards: weapons must distinguish between civilians and
combatants, they may not cause disproportionate collateral damage, and
so on. Yet in any given case, [there is [ambiguity]{.mark} about what
the relevant standard requires, and this ambiguity [hinders effective
compliance and accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, a
commander, in the heat of battle and with incomplete information, may
not know whether a particular use complies with abstract concepts such
as distinction or proportionality. [[Defining the bounds of permissible
conduct more precisely **via regulation** can minimize these
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}.39

For this reason, various [[actors]{.mark} have [recognized the need for
guidance]{.mark} regarding]{.underline} [FAWs.]{.underline} In 2009, the
Department of Defense issued a directive on autonomous weapons, thereby
taking a strong first step toward regulation. That directive primarily
addresses mechanisms for approving the development of new weapons
systems, though it does also consider both the levels of autonomy
present in a given system and the purposes for which systems may be
used.40 The directive also generally dictates [that commanders using
automated weapons should apply "appropriate care" in compliance with
international and domestic law]{.underline}.41 [[An ideal regulatory
scheme would]{.mark} develop beyond this Directive: it would [be
international]{.mark} in nature, would [focus]{.mark} more [heavily on
use, and]{.mark} would [provide]{.mark} greater [specificity regarding
how and when]{.mark} particular [systems may be
used]{.mark}]{.underline}. A complete regulatory scheme would also
tackle other thorny issues, [[including research, testing, acquisition,
development, and proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 In these early
stages, the project of regulation ought to begin with the issue of
permissible usage, given that it presents difficult---yet
familiar---questions under international law.

B. **[[States Are More Likely To Comply with
Regulations]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In the previous section, I suggested that not all FAWs present an
unacceptable risk of civilian casualties, and, as such, that these
weapons are not wholly impermissible. Yet, even if FAWs ought to be
categorically rejected, **[[it is not clear]{.mark} that [a ban
would]{.mark} actually [be effective]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Robotic
weaponry in the form of unmanned drones has already begun to
revolutionize the ways in which nations fight wars. At least one
military analyst has suggested that [[fully autonomous weapons will
represent the biggest advance in military tech]{.mark}nology [since
gunpowder]{.mark}]{.underline}.43 Other commentators have argued that
[[it would be unrealistic to expect major world powers to ban FAWs
altogether]{.underline}]{.mark}, [especially]{.underline} [[if some
states refused to sign on and continued to develop
them]{.underline}]{.mark}.44 FAWs may have significant military utility,
and in this respect, they are unlike many other weapons that the
international community has banned.45 **[[Even if a ban
were]{.underline}]{.mark}** [successful,]{.underline} moreover,
**[[nations might interpret]{.mark} the terms of [the ban narrowly to
permit further development of FAWs]{.mark}]{.underline}**46 [[or violate
the prohibition in ways that escape detection]{.underline}]{.mark}.47
[[The better approach to ensure compliance overall would be to establish
minimum limitations on FAW technology and specific rules governing
use]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Two cases, landmines and cluster munitions, help to illustrate this
point. [[The Ottawa Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark} formally banned
landmines in 1997. However, several states, including the United States,
China, Russia, and India, declined to sign the treaty, invoking military
necessity.48 Nations that have refused to sign the Ottawa Treaty have
generally complied with the more modest regulations of the Amended
Protocol.49 In a similar pattern, several states, invoking claims of
military necessity, have declined to sign [[the Oslo
Convention]{.underline}]{.mark} of 2008, which banned cluster weapons.50
However, these nations have signaled that they would be willing to
negotiate a set of regulations under the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons.51 These cases [[suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[nations are unlikely to accept a full ban]{.mark} on weapons that they
frequently use]{.underline}. Among those states that are inclined to use
FAWs, [[a more modest attempt to regulate these weapons may result in
higher initial buy-in]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as higher overall
compliance with the principles of distinction and proportionality.

[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its allies face risks and
opportunities. The risks are twofold. On the one hand, standard setting
could become a casualty of geopolitical competition as leading countries
precipitate a race to the bottom. On the other hand, China already
asserts its principles and standards through a variety of multilateral
fora. The opportunity is that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies [can]{.mark} act now to [**set
global standards** for AI reflecting and supporting]{.mark} human rights

**a**]{.mark}utonomous **[w]{.mark}**eapons
**[s]{.mark}**ystems]{.underline}. A Japanese official responding to the
CSET survey noted that the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its allies
should]{.underline}]{.mark} adopt a citizen-centric AI strategy. Such
citizen-centric strategies would seek to [[develop and deploy AI for the

strengthened data privacy standards and respect for civil liberties;
economic empowerment of citizens **[[within rules-based market
economies]{.underline}]{.mark}**; greater access to education, precision

provision. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} [[should
lead a multilateral effort]{.mark} with allies and partners **[to set
international rules of conduct for AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
effort should build on and extend the OECD Principles on AI and the
International Organization for Standardization working group initiatives
on standards for data and AI safety and security. The United States and
its allies could [establish a standing platform to [coordinate policies
on standard-setting in multilateral fora]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
likely an area for productive dialogue, as [[partners are eager to
coordinate policies and share **best practices around norms and
standards**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, all surveyed officials were
extremely or very interested in this avenue for international
collaboration. Longer term, the United States and its allies should
explore the conditions for a common AI market, including standards for
testing, verification, and validation of AI technologies, as well as
common practices for certifying companies that support liberal
democratic values and privacy.87 [[This]{.mark} common market [would
create incentives for other countries to abide by]{.mark} these
[principles in the development and deployment of safe and reliable
AI]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one EU representative observed, if the West
could offer a viable way of doing AI that respects privacy and
fundamental rights[[, developing (and democratic) countries would
be]{.mark} more **[inclined to follow the Western
model]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Introduction 5.19.17.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y\]

The Rise of a Global Society

Let me first sketch the global democratic project for global governance
as a point of reference. We must first recognize that globalization has
given rise to a global society [for the **first time** in]{.underline}
the [evolution of the]{.underline} human [**species**. We
are]{.underline} now [**stuck with each other**; **seven and half
billion** people today ---]{.underline} nine to [**ten** by
**2050**:]{.underline} all [**super connected** and **interdependent**.
In greater or lesser measure, humans are mutually dependent]{.underline}
on each other in the pursuit of their most salient values, interests,
needs, and preferences --- [concerns about]{.underline} personal,
community, and national [**[security]{.mark}**, sustainable]{.underline}
economic **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, protection of [the
**[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [equitable
**[distribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the globe's material [wealth,
human **[rights]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} even the [validation
of]{.underline} their personal and social [identities]{.underline} by
others. Global [[**warming** is a metaphor]{.mark} of this morphological
social change]{.underline} in the human condition. [**[All]{.mark}**
humans [are **implicated** in]{.mark} this looming]{.underline}
Anthropogenic-induced **[[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the
exhausts of billions of automobiles, the methane released in fracking
for natural gas, outdated U.S. coal-fired power plants and newly
constructed ones in China. Even the poor farmer burning charcoal to warm
his dinner is complicit.

Since [interdependence surrounds, ensnares, and binds us as a human
society]{.underline}, the dilemma confronting the world's diverse and
divided populations is evident: the [**expanding scope** as well
as]{.underline} the [**[deepening]{.mark}**, **accumulating**, and
**thickening** [interdependencies]{.mark} of globalization [urge global
government]{.mark}. But]{.underline} the Kantian ideal of universal
governance is beyond the reach of the world's disparate peoples. [They
are **profoundly divided** by religion, culture, language, tribal,
ethnic and national loyalties as well as]{.underline} by [class, social
status, race, gender, and sexual orientation. How have the democracies
responded]{.underline} to this dilemma? How have they attempted to
reconcile the growing interdependence of the world's disputing peoples
and need for global governance?

What do we mean by the governance of a human society?

[A working, **legitimate government**]{.underline} of a human society
[requires simultaneous responses to three]{.underline} competing
[imperatives: Order, Welfare, and Legitimacy]{.underline}. While the
forms of these OWL imperatives have differed radically over the course
of human societal evolution, [these]{.underline} constraints [remain
predicable of all human societies if they are to replicate]{.underline}
themselves [and flourish over time]{.underline}. The OWL imperatives are
no less applicable to a global society.

1\. [Order]{.underline} refers to a society's investment of awesome
[material power]{.underline} in an individual or body [to arbitrate and
resolve]{.underline} value, interest, and preference [conflicts, which
cannot be otherwise resolved by non-violent means]{.underline} --- the
Hobbesian problematic.

2\. The [Welfare]{.underline} imperative [refers to the
necessity]{.underline} of humans [to eat, drink, clothe, and
shelter]{.underline} themselves and to pursue the full-range of their
seemingly limitless acquisitive appetites. Responses to the Welfare
imperative, like that of Order, constitute a distinct form of governing
power and authority with its own decisional processes and actors
principally associated either with the Welfare or the Order imperative.
Hence we have the Marxian-Adam Smith problematic.

3\. [Legitimacy]{.underline} is no less a form of governing power and
authority, independent of the Order and Welfare imperatives. Either by
choice, socialization, or coerced acquiescence, [populations acknowledge
a regime's governing authority and]{.underline} their [obligation to
submit]{.underline} to its rule. Here arises the Rousseaunian
problematic.

The government of a human society emerges then as an evolving,
precarious balance and compromise of the ceaseless struggle of these
competing OWL power domains for ascendancy of one of these imperatives
over the others. It is against the backdrop of these OWL imperatives ---
Order, Welfare, and Legitimacy --- that we are brought to the democratic
project for global governance.

The Democratic Project

For Order, open societies constructed the global democratic state and,
in alliance, the democratic global-state system. Collectively these
initiatives led to the creation of the United Nations, the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the
European Union to implement the democratic project's system of global
governance.

The democratic global state assumed all of the functions of the
Hobbesian Westphalian security state --- but a lot more. The global
state became a Trading, Banking, Market, and Entrepreneurial state. To
these functions were added those of the Science, Technology and the
Economic Growth state. How else would we be able to enjoy [the
**Internet**, **cell phones** and iPhones, or **miracle
cures**]{.underline}? These [are]{.underline} the [products of the
**iron triangle** of the [global democratic state]{.mark}]{.underline},
academic and non-profit [research]{.underline} centers, [and
corporations. It is a **myth**]{.underline} that [the
Market]{.underline} System [did]{.underline} all [this **alone**. Fueled
by increasing material wealth, the democratic global state was afforded
the means to become the **Safety Net** state, [providing
**ed**]{.mark}ucation, **[health]{.mark}**, **[social
security]{.mark}**, leisure and recreation]{.underline} for its
population. And as the global state's power expanded across this broad
and enlarging spectrum of functions and roles, the global state was also
constrained by the social compacts of the democracies to be bound by
popular rule. The ironic result of the expansion of the global state's
power and social functions and its obligation to accede to popular will
was a Security state and global state-system that vastly outperformed
its principal authoritarian rivals in the Cold War. So much briefly is
the democratic project's response to the Order imperative.

Now let's look at the democratic project's response to the Welfare
imperative. The democracies institutionalized Adam Smith's vision of a
global Market System. The Market System trucks and barters, Smith's
understanding of what it means to be human. But it does a lot more. The
Market System facilitates and fosters the free movement of people, goods
and services, capital, ideas, values, scientific discoveries, and best
technological practices. Created is a vibrant global civil society
oblivious to state boundaries. What we now experience is De
Tocqueville's Democracy in America on global steroids.

As for the imperative of Legitimacy, the social compacts of the
democracies affirmed Rousseau's conjecture that all humans are free and
therefore equal. Applied to elections each citizen has one vote.
[Democratic [regimes]{.mark}]{.underline} are also obliged to submit to
the rule of law, to conduct free and fair elections, to honor majority
rule while protecting minority rights, and to [**[promote]{.mark}**
human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline} at home and
**[[abroad]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Authoritarian Threat to the Democratic Project

[The **democratic project** for **global [governance]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} now [at **risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Let's start with the
challenges posed by authoritarian regimes, with Russia and China in the
lead. Both [[Russia and China would **rest**]{.mark} **global
[governance]{.mark}** on Big Power spheres of influence.
Both]{.underline} would [[assume **hegemonic status**]{.mark} in
their]{.underline} respective [regions, asserting their versions of the
**Monroe Doctrine**]{.underline}. Their [regional hegemony
would]{.underline} then [**leverage** their claim to be global **Big
Powers**]{.underline}. Moscow and Beijing would then have an equal say
with the United States and the West in sharing and shaping global
governance. [**The** Russo-Chinese global **system**]{.underline} of
Order [would ascribe]{.underline} to Russia and China governing
privileges not accorded to the states both aspire to dominate. [Moscow
and Beijing]{.underline} would enjoy [**unconditional** recognition
of]{.underline} their state **[sovereignty]{.underline}**, territorial
integrity, and non-interference in their domestic affairs, [but they
would]{.underline} reserve to themselves the right to [**intervene**
in]{.underline} the domestic and foreign affairs of the
[states]{.underline} and peoples under their tutelage [in pursuit
of]{.underline} their [hegemonic interests]{.underline}. President
[Putin]{.underline} has [announced]{.underline} that [Russia's
**imperialism** encompasses]{.underline} the **[millions]{.underline}**
of Russians [living in the former]{.underline} republics of the [Soviet
Union]{.underline}. Russia contends that Ukraine and Belarus also fall
under Moscow's purported claim to historical sovereignty over these
states. [Forceful re-absorption of **Crimea** and control over eastern
**Ukraine** are viewed by]{.underline} President [Putin as Russia's
historical inheritances]{.underline}. Self-determination is not extended
to these states or to other states and peoples of the former Soviet
Union. Moscow rejects their right to freely align, say, with the
European Union or, god forbid, with NATO.

In contrast to the democratic project, universal in its reach, [the
[Russo-Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} conception of a stable [global
[order rests on]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[tenuous]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[conflict]{.mark}-prone
ethno-[national foundations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Russia's proclaimed
enemies are the United States and the European Union. Any means that
undermines the unity of these entities is viewed by Moscow as a gain.
[[The endgame]{.mark} is a **poly-anarchical** interstate
system]{.underline}, potentially [as **war-prone** as the Eurocentric
system **before** and **after World War I**, but]{.underline} now
[populated by states with **[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Global politics becomes a **zero-sum game**.]{.underline}

[Moscow has **no compunctions** about
**[corrupting]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [**[electoral
processes]{.mark}** of democratic states, conducting
[threaten]{.mark}ing **military [exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} along
NATO's east border, or [[violating]{.mark} the]{.underline} more than
30-year old [[treaty to ban]{.underline}]{.mark} the deployment of
[Intermediate-Range **[missile]{.mark} launcher[s]{.mark}**, capable of
**[firing]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}**. Nothing less
than]{.underline} the [**dissolution** of the democratic project is
Moscow's solution for global Order]{.underline}.

[China]{.underline} also [seeks]{.underline} a [revision]{.underline} of
the global Order. [It declares sovereignty over the **South China Sea**.
Rejected is The Hague Tribunal's dismissal]{.underline} of this claim.
[Beijing continues to build artificial islands]{.underline} as military
bases in the region [to assert]{.underline} its [control]{.underline}
over these troubled waters. If it could have its way, China would decide
which states and their naval vessels, notably those of the United
States, would have access to the South China Sea.

Where Moscow and Beijing depart sharply are in their contrasting
responses to the Welfare imperative. [Moscow has **no solution** other
than to use]{.underline} its [oil and gas resources as]{.underline}
instruments of **[coercive diplomacy]{.underline}** and [to]{.underline}
weaken or **[dismantle]{.underline}** existing [Western **alliances**
and international economic **institutions**.]{.underline} China can
ill-afford the dismantling of the global market system. In his address
to the Davos gathering in January of this year, Chinese President Xi
asserted that "any attempt to cut off the flow of capital, technologies,
products, industries and people between economies, and channel the
waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not
possible." Adam Smith could not have said it better. Both Moscow and
Beijing have been particularly assiduous to legitimate their regimes.
President Putin's case for legitimacy is much broader and deeper than a
pure appeal to Russian nationalism. He stresses the spiritual and
cultural unity of Russianspeaking populations spread across the states
of the post-Soviet space. A central core of that unity is the Russian
Orthodox Church, a key prop of the regime. Reviled is Western
secularism, portrayed as corrupt and decadent, viewed by Putin as an
existential threat to the Russian World. The Chinese regime, secular and
atheistic, can hardly rely on religion to legitimate the regime. Beijing
principally rests its legitimacy on its record of economic development
and nationalism. The regime's success in raising the economic standards
of hundreds of millions of Chinese reinforces its claim to legitimacy in
two ways. On the one hand, the Communist Party can rightly claim to have
raised hundreds of millions of Chinese from poverty within a generation.
On the other hand, the Communist Party insists that its model of
economic growth, what critics scorn as crony capitalism, is superior to
the unfettered, market-driven model of the West. Hence capitalism with
Chinese characteristics is more effective and legitimate than the
Western alternative.

Where [[Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} do
**[converge]{.underline}** is in [fashioning their responses to the
Legitimacy imperative. They **[repudiate]{.mark} Western [liberal
democracy]{.mark}**. Both reject criticisms of]{.underline} their [human
rights abuses as interventions]{.underline} into their domestic affairs.
[Dissidents are harassed, incarcerated, or]{.underline}, in some
instances, [assassinated]{.underline}. Journalists are co-opted,
selfcensored, silenced, or imprisoned. Social [media is state
controlled]{.underline}. Both the [Putin]{.underline} regime [and the
Chinese Communist Party monopolize]{.underline} the [public narratives
evaluating governmental policy]{.underline}. Transparency and
accountability are hostage to governmental secrecy. Civil society has
few effective avenues to criticize governmental actions. Moscow adds an
ironic twist to these controls in manipulating national elections to
produce an elected authoritarian regime.

[[Whether either]{.mark} of these [authoritarian responses]{.mark} to
the Legitimacy imperative [will survive **remains to be
seen**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Beijing's use of economic performance and
nationalism to underwrite its legitimacy is a double-edged sword. If
economic performance falters, then legitimacy suffers. Whether top-down
nationalism will always control nationalism from the bottom-up is also
problematic. In resting legitimacy on nationalism, dubious historical
claims, and crypto-religious beliefs, Moscow is spared Beijing's
economic performance test. That said, there is room for skepticism that
in the long-run Russians will exchange lower standards of living for
corrupt rule in pursuit of an elusive Russian mission antagonistic to
the West. The implosion of the Soviet Union, due in no small part to its
retarded economic and technological development, suggests that the
patience of the Russian people has limits. Demonstrations in March 2017
against state corruption in 82 Russian cities, led largely by Russian
youth, reveal these limits. They are an ominous omen for the future of
the Putin kleptocracy. Meanwhile, neither Russia nor China offers much
to solve the Legitimacy imperative of global governance.

[the Legislature did not use the words "ban" or "prohibit." Yet County

to mean that local governments may impose a blanket nuisance prohibition
against dispensaries would frustrate both the Legislature\'s intent to
"\[e\]nhance the access of patients and caregivers to medical marijuana

Technology can be both disruptive and transformative. It can disrupt the
status quo and it can also transform the way we see how things can be
done.

[[States]{.mark} around the world have [showed]{.mark} great [interest
in developing autonomous robots for military]{.mark}
purposes]{.underline}. These robots, also called "killer robots" in some
circles, would be able [to select and engage targets without human
intervention]{.underline}. [The [implication]{.mark}]{.underline} of
ceding human control for machine discretion [has [led]{.mark} some
[organizations to call for a]{.mark}n outright [ban]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the technology. In a 2012 report entitled 'Losing Humanity,'
[[H]{.mark}uman [R]{.mark}ights [Watch recommended]{.mark}]{.underline}
the ratification of [[an international treaty
prohibiting]{.underline}]{.mark} [the "development, production, and use"
of robotic weapons]{.underline} because they would be incapable of
discriminating between combatants and civilians on the battleground.
Other coalitions, such as the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, have
formed around similar policy goals.

Although the prospect of delegating lethal powers to robots may evoke a
dystopian vision of the future, **[[the pessimism is]{.mark} arguably
[misplaced]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and misunderstands the potential of
artificial intelligence]{.underline}. Whatever the moral merits or
precautionary logic of a complete ban, **[[total prohibition]{.mark} of
autonomous robots [is undesirable]{.mark} for a number of
reasons]{.underline}**.

First, **[a ban [would be unworkable]{.mark} in practice]{.underline}**.
It [[would ignore the practical complexities of international
coop]{.underline}]{.mark}eration. [[Without]{.mark} the [ratification of
major military powers]{.mark}, a ban [would be impossible to
enforce]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The **temptation** ]{.mark}**for states
[to cheat is]{.mark} also [obvious]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given the
sensitive nature of military technology, [[states may,]{.mark} despite a
ban, [preemptively develop]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a]{.mark}**utonomous
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} [just [to stay in the
race]{.mark}]{.underline}. This of course is a classic example of the
prisoner's dilemma, and explains why [[a state would likely not
cooperate with a ban, but instead heavily arm
itself.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} dynamic [[is particularly
true]{.underline}]{.mark} in this day and age [[where]{.mark} [non-state
actors, such as terrorist org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[are increasingly powerful and active on the international
stage]{.underline}]{.mark}. As technology becomes more affordable and
technical skill readily accessible, [[it is only a matter of time before
non-state actors use]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[a]{.mark}**utomated
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. U.S. authorities have
already uncovered terrorist plans of drone attacks, and the New York
Police Department is also taking these threats seriously.

In their upcoming book The Future of Violence, Professor Gabriella Blum
and Benjamin Wittes argue that advances in cyber technology and robotics
could mean more people than ever before have access to potentially
dangerous technologies. The trend towards the [[dissemination of open
source software]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[could make a killer
robots' software widely available]{.underline}]{.mark}, coupled with the
[[increased affordability and versatility]{.underline}]{.mark} of
hardware makes that scenario all the more plausible.

Second, [**[a toothless ban would undermine a more]{.mark} [realistic
alternative: to regulate]{.mark}** the use and application
of]{.underline} [**[a]{.mark}**utonomous
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[through law and best
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. International humanitarian law (IHL)
already regulates the means and methods of warfare. In order [[to comply
with IHL, an autonomous robot would need to be able to distinguish
between combatants and civilians and use force
proportionally]{.underline}]{.mark}. These requirements are [all
[within]{.mark} the ambit of [technological
possibility]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unlike a human being, [[a robot can be programmed to comply with rules
and codes]{.underline}]{.mark} free from fear, prejudice, and fatigue.
It may thus be able to better process information, identify targets, and
protect civilians. It could tap into big data to further improve its
decisions. As an added method of accountability, [[robots could be
required to wear a camera]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[order to monitor
compliance with IHL]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Terminator-like robots are unlikely to be deployed on the battlefield
anytime soon]{.underline}]{.mark}. Autonomous robots will likely first
be used on very specific missions, thus [[controlling their scaling and
impact, and will be developed iteratively]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus
[[facilitating feedback and future improvements]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Finally, [autonomous weapon systems can provide major benefits to
international peace and security]{.underline}. [Given the potential for
machine learning]{.underline}, [autonomous robots could be more precise,
discriminate, and effective than other weapons]{.underline}. Alternative
configurations of these systems could also **[be used in peacekeeping
missions around the world]{.underline}**. They may help **[safeguard
humanitarian convoys]{.underline}**, [protect refugee camps, and assist
hostage rescue missions]{.underline}.

[To ban now]{.underline} what we do not yet fully understand [would
stifle efforts to develop potentially beneficial
tech]{.underline}nologies. Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of
artificial intelligence, may have preferred a trial and error approach.
"One must experiment with teaching \[a\] machine and see how well it
learns ... There is an obvious connection with this process and
evolution," wrote Turing in a 1950 paper. An encouraging prognosis from
the man who built a code-breaking machine that helped the Allies win the
Second World War.

We began writing in this area before the ban campaign was launched,
initially urging the Department of Defense to be more transparent about
the standards of legal review being applied to weapon systems as they
became increasingly automated and might ultimately raise questions about
who or what was actually in control of firing decisions. [After the ban
campaign was launched, we pivoted to include arguments as to why [an
international ban]{.mark} was [deeply mistaken]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Our arguments are for careful, granular reviews and regulation]{.mark}
of weapon technologies incorporating]{.underline} increasingly automated
or even [autonomous capabilities]{.underline}. Nothing in our positions
says that these machines should be anything other than [[carefully
regulated]{.underline}]{.mark}. But we also think that there is a moral
obligation to seek to try and develop new technologies that might
increase the precision of weapons and reduce harms on the battlefield;
[[sweeping, preemptive bans]{.underline}]{.mark}, not just on \"use\"
but \"development\" [[**will not be effective** and they might well
impede emergence]{.underline}]{.mark} over time of new [[technologies
that make war less harmful]{.underline}]{.mark}. So we\'re delighted to
announce \"Killer Robots and the Laws of War.\" Here is a short excerpt:

[[\[A\] ban is unlikely to]{.underline}]{.mark} work, especially in
[[constrain]{.underline}]{.mark}ing **[[states or actors most inclined
to abuse these weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Those actors **will not
respect such an agreement**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the technological
elements of highly **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**utomated
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[will
proliferate]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, because the automation of
weapons will happen gradually, [[it would be nearly impossible to design
or enforce]{.mark} such [a ban]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Because the same
system might be operable with or without effective human control or
oversight, [the line between legal weapons and illegal autonomous ones
will not be clear-cut.]{.mark}]{.underline}

If the goal is to reduce suffering and protect human lives, [[a ban
could prove counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to the
self-protective advantages to military forces that use them,
[[autonomous machines may reduce risks to civilians by improving the
precision of targeting decisions]{.underline}]{.mark} and better
controlling decisions to fire. We know that humans are limited in their
capacity to make sound decisions on the battlefield: Anger, panic,
fatigue all contribute to mistakes or violations of rules. Autonomous
weapons systems have the potential to address these human shortcomings.
No one can say with certainty how much automated capabilities might
gradually reduce the harm of warfare, but it would be wrong not to
pursue such gains, and it would be especially pernicious to ban research
into such technologies.

That said, **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**utonomous
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[warrant
careful regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each step toward automation
needs to be reviewed carefully [[to ensure that the weapon complies with
the laws of war]{.mark} in its design and permissible uses]{.underline}.
Drawing on long-standing international legal rules
[[requiring]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[be]{.mark} capable of being [used in a discriminating manner that
limits collateral damage]{.mark}]{.underline}, the U.S. should set very
high standards for assessing legally and ethically any research and
development programs in this area. Standards should also be set for how
these systems are to be used and in what combat environments.

In response to this claim, opponents of regulation make a slippery-slope
argument, stressing that once nations invest in FAW technology, it will
be difficult to encourage compliance with even modest regulations.52
Alternatively, there is some evidence from the case of landmines that an
absolute prohibition can establish a norm against a weapons system that
buttresses other, more modest regulatory schemes.53 This may be true,
but [[if FAWs turn out to revolutionize warfare, then states may
continue to develop them regardless]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore,
**[[the causality may work the other
way]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**["[soft law" norms,]{.mark} like
nation-specific codes of conduct[, can]{.mark} often [ripen into "hard
law" treaties]{.mark}]{.underline}**.54 [[If a ban turns out]{.mark} to
be [necessary,]{.mark} then [it may be easier to build on **an existing
set of regulations** and norms rather than]{.mark} to [create one from
scratch]{.mark}]{.underline}. For these reasons, it is important to
consider the components of an effective regulatory scheme.

If agreeing upon a working definition of LAWS proves too challenging,
**[[proponents of restrictions on the weapons could switch to a
piecemeal rather than comprehensive approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
That is, they could [[establish specific instruments for specific uses
of pertinent technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}, through the CCW or other
processes ([such as restricting interactions between autonomous
technologies and, say, nuclear weapons]{.underline}). [[Once the
conversation is narrowed,]{.mark}]{.underline} either through
establishing a working definition or [[laying the groundwork for a
piecemeal approach, states and other actors seeking to restrict LAWS
could begin to make real progress in governing autonomous
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

From [[machine learning intelligence insights to autonomous
drones]{.underline}]{.mark}, AI has the potential to significantly
improve the goals and tasks of U.S. military operations at almost all
levels. [[The U.S. military is focused on]{.underline}]{.mark} more than
just operational gains though---it is [[keeping pace with growing state
investment in AI from major powers such as China and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This shifting landscape reveals a
pressing need to develop appropriate governance
structures]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.mark}]{.underline} enhance the
benefits and [[manage the risks of military uses of
AI]{.underline}]{.mark}.

CHINESE AND RUSSIAN INVESTMENT IN AI

In 2017, the State Council in China announced that they plan to be the
world leaders in AI by 2030. That same year, Chinese venture capital
firms spent \$4.9 billion on AI companies, surpassing U.S. firms' \$4.4
billion total. Over the coming decade, the largest state-owned venture
capital firm in China is expected to invest more than \$30 billion in
order to reach its 2030 leadership goal. Similarly, Russia is making
significant investments in this area, pouring nearly \$719 million into
AI research and development in by 2021. As Vladimir Putin stated in
2017, "\[AI\] is the future, not only for Russia, but for all of
humankind." With this speech, Putin committed Russia to a state-led
initiative to develop AI competencies and compete for international
superiority.

[[Even with new Chinese and Russian investments, the U.S. maintains an
advantage in the **r**]{.mark}esearch [**and** **d**]{.mark}evelopment
[of AI.]{.mark}]{.underline} Recent U.S. investment in AI has been
largely driven by the private sector, but with the growing national
interest in the emerging technology, the government is positioning
itself to play a key role. In 2019, the Trump administration issued an
executive order that declares a national interest in "maintaining
American leadership in artificial intelligence", citing the economic,
social, and national security benefits of AI. [[By maintaining technical
excellence, the U.S. can use AI as a tool to advance national interests
and ideals at a global scale]{.underline}]{.mark}. This executive order,
paired with the creation of JAIC and its \$208 million in funding, show
an effort to challenge Chinese and Russian initiatives to claim
superiority in AI.

GOVERNANCE OF AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS

[[Although many]{.underline}]{.mark} activists have [[called for the
outright ban of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**utonomous **[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**ethal
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a total
**[[ban would be difficult to enforce]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
[[integration of AI as a core part of national defense strategies in the
U.S., China, Russia, and other nations will also be hard to
reverse]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Given these circumstances, it is
important to consider what meaningful international]{.underline}]{.mark}
and domestic [[governance of autonomous weapons looks
like]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are five main areas of focus where
regulations could help us capture the benefits of AI in defense and
protect against potential harms:

Transparency in technology performance to allow for proper oversight and
accountability:

With more robust performance measures around testing, defense agencies
could offer a meaningful degree of transparency prior to deploying a
technology.

Maintaining human-in-the-loop systems that permit human decision making:

Autonomous systems are subject to failure. Requiring systems that allow
for human intervention would preserve human agency with new technology
in the case of failures, unexpected actions, or other needs.

Hiring and training appropriate personnel to ensure worker competencies:

Humans engaging with emerging military technology must maintain
technical literacy by updating their knowledge relevant to their post.

Regulations on technology transfer to prevent malicious use of advanced
technology:

How and with whom we trade weapons becomes increasingly important given
the sophistication of emerging technologies. We must consider who should
control data, algorithms, and hardware during technology transfer.

Strong prioritization of cybersecurity to protect digital intelligence,
infrastructure, and services:

The more we digitize our military systems, the more we expose to cyber
vulnerabilities. It is important that the defense agencies continuously
maintain the highest established standards for cybersecurity.

These [[principles for AI deployment in defense could allow us to not
only build better accountability and oversight, but also better capture
the benefits of AI while reducing unintended harms]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Then we could begin asking important outcome-based questions, such as:
Does this technology actually mitigate collateral damage? Are we
building better national security practices, even with increased
potential cyber vulnerabilities? Are humans effectively able to maintain
control to make important defense decisions? [Through transparency and
meaningful discussions, there can be more assurance for the positive
impacts of AI in defense]{.underline}.

[The 2019 Meeting of High Contracting Parties to the Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) adopted 11 »Guiding
Principles]{.underline} affirmed by the Group of Governmental Experts
(GGE ) on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons
Systems.« (see Box 1). [Some 40 UN Member States belonging to the
»Alliance for Multilateralism« are now championing these 11 Guiding
Principles]{.underline} and calling on States to contribute actively to
the clarification and development of a normative and operational
framework.2 The civil society-led Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is
working for a preemptive ban on the development, production, and use of
fully autonomous weapons. Similarly, UN Secretary- General António
Guterres as well as his High Representative for Disarmament, Izumi
Nakamitsu, have called for LAWS to be banned by international law.3 [A
growing number of Member States have also called for a prohibition of
LAWS. At a minimum, there seems to be broad agreement that it is
necessary that States have an obligation to maintain meaningful human
control over the lethal use of force.]{.underline} Member States, with
the support and active participation of the United Nations and other
international organizations, civil society and the private sector,
quickly need to reach common understandings on how to ensure human
beings retain control over the use of force. Improving communication
between policymakers and scientific and technical experts is crucial
given the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence. Indeed, a
prohibition on weapons outside of human control would not be
counterproductive to technological development. Rather, there is a need
to fully harness technological progress while maintaining and advancing
international law that safeguards humanitarian protections, human rights
and international peace and security. Therefore, in September and
October 2020, the Friedrich- Ebert-Stiftung New York Office (FESN Y)
launched the »New Alliances for Meaningful Human Control« project aimed
at building on the 11 Guiding Principles on LAWS and moving them to the
next level, towards international legal instruments that regulate
high-tech weapons and prohibit LAWS. Linked to the UN 75 Global
Governance Forum,4 FESN Y convened three discussions with
representatives of governments, the United Nations, academia, civil
society and the private sector to discuss the moral, ethical, legal and
humanitarian challenges posed by LAWS (see Annex I for list of
participants). Participants, speaking under Chatham House Rule, offered
many diverse viewpoints, representing different perspectives on LAWS and
pathways to addressing the risk they pose. 5 This paper is rooted in the
discussions facilitated by FESN Y. While it summarizes the agreements
between the co-authors, who participated, it does not purport to
represent the views of all members of the discussions. For instance,
participants disagreed on the precise meaning, scope and value of the 11
Guiding Principles. However, a significant majority agreed that good
faith interpretation of [the 11 Guiding Principles]{.underline} --
particularly paragraphs b), c) and d) (see Box 1) -- [required progress
toward negotiation of a legally-binding multilateral instrument
mandating a positive obligation to maintain meaningful human
control]{.underline} over the use of force, at the level of individual
attacks. [Given the contested international political environment,
progress toward negotiating a legally-binding instrument would also
demonstrate the potential for effective global governance]{.underline},
as currently spearheaded by the Alliance for Multilateralism. [Towards
this end]{.underline}, the subsequent paper argues that [a potential
venue for negotiating such a mandate could be within the CC W, in the
form of a new protocol on meaningful human control.]{.underline} While
positive obligations would be the most suitable starting point, [a new
protocol should also entail principles about technologies not to be
developed and deployed.]{.underline} In what follows, two main issues
will be addressed to help States as they move toward negotiations on a
treaty to ensure meaningful human control: First, meaningful positive
obligations, and second, legally-binding control.

The economic, political and security drivers for mainstreaming this
suite of technologies \[AI\] into security functions are [**simply too
powerful** to be rolled back. There will be plenty of persuasive
national security applications]{.underline} -- minimizing casualties and
collateral damage ..., defeating [terrorist threats]{.underline}, saving
on defense spending, and [protecting soldiers and their
bases]{.underline} -- to provide counterarguments against concerns about
runaway robots or accidental wars caused by machine error.

[Appeals to the inherent immorality of allowing computers to make life
and death decisions about human beings,]{.underline} often framed in
terms of human dignity (e.g. [Horowitz

will fall in the face of ostensibly [unstoppable forces across multiple
sectors making **incorporating AI into ever more aspect of our daily
lives almost inevitable**]{.underline}. From 'surveillance capitalism'
([Zuboff
2019](https://profilebooks.com/work/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/))
to LAWS, human beings are struggling to find ways to effectively halt,
or even dramatically slow, AI's march (e.g. [Rosert and Sauer
2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13523260.2020.1771508)).

Effective

LAWS' potential [military effectiveness manifests at]{.underline}
strategic, [operational]{.underline}, and tactical [levels.]{.underline}
Operating at 'machine speed' means potentially [outpacing adversaries
and acquiring crucial advantages]{.underline}, it enables far faster
processing of huge quantities of data to generate new insights and spot
opportunities, and it means concentrating military effect with greater
pace and accuracy (e.g. [Altmann and Sauer
2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263); [Horowitz

Shifts, even temporary, in **[delicate strategic balances between rival
powers may appear as unacceptable risks]{.underline},** meaning that for
as long as adversaries are interested in and pursuing this technology,
their peer-rivals will feel compelled to do so too (e.g. [Maas

124) note, '[**operational speed** will reign supreme']{.underline}. The
'security dilemma' looms large, reinforcing amongst leading states the
sense **t[hey dare not risk being left behind in the competition to
research and develop LAWS]{.underline}** (e.g. [Altmann and Sauer
2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263); [Scharre

Morgan et
al ([2020](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3139-1.html),
xvi) argue the [US]{.underline}, for example, has no choice but to, '...
stay at the [forefront of military AI capability]{.underline}. ...
\[N\]ot to compete in an area where adversaries are developing dangerous
capabilities is to cede the field. That would be unacceptable'. Things
likely look the same in Moscow and Beijing. [Add concerns about
potential proliferation to non-state actors]{.underline} (e.g. [Dunn
2015](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/89/5/1237/2417187?redirectedFrom=fulltext)),
and the security dilemma's [powerful logic appears
inescapable.]{.underline}

Of course, other weapons technologies inspired similar proliferation,
strategic destabilization, and conflict escalation concerns. Arms
control -- a key focus for current regulatory debate -- has slowed the
spread of nuclear weapons, banned chemical and biological weapons, and
prohibited blinding laser weapons before they were ever deployed
(e.g. [Baker et al
2020](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/04/15/introducing-guiding-principles-for-the-development-and-use-of-lethal-autonomous-weapon-systems/)).
[International regulation]{.underline} can [**alter the strategic
calculus** about what weapons do]{.underline} and do not appear
effective and persuade actors to deny themselves the systems in the
first place, or limit their acquisition and deployment, or give them up
as part of a wider deal that offers a better route to strategic
stability. LAWS present specific arms control challenges because [they
incorporate AI and robotics technologies offering many non-military
opportunities and advantages that human societies]{.underline} will want
to pursue, potentially bringing major benefits in addressing challenges
in diverse fields. Key breakthroughs are at least as likely to come from
civilian research and development projects as from principally military
ones. That makes definitions, monitoring, and verification harder. That
is not a reason not to try, of course, but it [does mean effective LAWS
may take many forms,]{.underline} incorporate [inherently hard to
restrict technologies,]{.underline} and offer possibly irresistible
benefits in what the security dilemma presents as an inescapably
competitive, militarized, and uncertain international environment

#### Shifts in power causes Russia-China War---that outweighs

Vladimir [Putin's war against Ukraine doesn't just herald a new era in
European security]{.underline}, [it underlines a **growing threat to the
American-led international order.**]{.underline}

[Pax Americana]{.underline}, the post-World War II system that [has
created the conditions for peace and prosperity in Europe and
elsewhere]{.underline}, is entering a great period of testing, [with the
**revanchist powers of Russia and China seeking to overturn
it.**]{.underline}

[It is imperative that the]{.underline} **[United States]{.underline}**,
[as the leader of the West and the only nation capable of maintaining
what it has built over the last seven decades]{.underline}, **[rises to
the challenge]{.underline}**, [even though its leadership role is
increasingly contested at home.]{.underline} The left has long argued
that the U.S. is not the benign influence abroad that it likes to
believe, and the order that it created is a corrupt scam, not worth the
cost of preserving.

Now elements of the right say much the same thing. This sentiment ranges
from Senate candidate J.D. Vance pointedly declaring that he doesn't
care what happens in Ukraine to right-wing commentator Candace Owens
saying we are at fault for the conflict. Undergirding it all is a sense
that the U.S. needs to mind its own business, and perhaps even treat
China as a "civilizational equal."

But Pax Americana isn't an act of charity. It holds distinct advantages
for the United States. We'd be less safe, prosperous, and free without
it.

What we are witnessing is, in broad brush, a civilizational challenge.
[China and Russia **don't**]{.underline} [have a formal alliance and
their current cooperative arrangement may well break down over
time]{.underline}, [but they **share the same interest in ending the
long era of Western preeminence.**]{.underline}

[Russia can punch above its weight]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
fundamentally [represents]{.underline} [a regional threat,]{.underline}
in particular [to]{.underline} a **[NATO]{.underline}** alliance that
has been a keystone of Western security. [Moscow seeks to divide
European countries from one another and diminish U.S. influence in
Europe]{.underline}, toward the end of reversing the post-Cold War
settlement that was the fruit of the West's triumph over the Soviet
Union.

[What Putin seeks is consequential, but not nearly as sweeping as
Beijing's goal of supplanting the United States at the top of the
hierarchy of nations]{.underline}. [China wants nothing less than to
**restore itself as the Middle Kingdom, owed the respect and obeisance
of the rest of the world.**]{.underline}

[What unites Russia and China is that they are two civilizations that
feel they were humiliated and trampled by the West]{.underline} (Russia
at the end of the Cold War, China from the middle of the 19th century to
the middle of the 20th) and need to regain their rightful place in the
sun. There is an ideological element to the growing challenge, as these
two authoritarian regimes confront the democratic world, but the crux of
the matter is cultural---neither Russia nor China has ever been a
liberal democracy and each country is reacting against international
norms they've never embraced.

Can't we just make way for a more ambitious Russia and China? Within
limits, but their maximal demands are an obvious threat to our
interests.

[Through our system of alliances]{.underline}, [we have
been]{.underline}, in effect, **[sponsoring international
peace]{.underline}**. [Should]{.underline}, say, [NATO
unravel]{.underline}, [there is no reason that Europe]{.underline}
[would not eventually once again become **red in tooth and
claw**]{.underline}, [as it has been through much of its
history]{.underline}. Even if we could ignore or at least stay out of
any future conflict, the loss of a vast zone of free, prosperous and
allied counties would be a blow.

[If it is expensive]{.underline} and burdensome [to underwrite the
security of countries around the]{.underline} [world, it
would]{.underline} be even **[more expensive]{.underline}** and
burdensome [if a global U.S. exit or diminishment created the conditions
for a major wa]{.underline}r[, or if]{.underline} some other
power---i.e., **[China]{.underline}**---**[replaced us at the apex of
world power]{.underline}**.

There are so many advantages to our preeminent position that we take for
granted. In an essay titled "After Hegemony," former Trump official
Elbridge Colby notes some of them: "Think how the American-born internet
supported Silicon Valley, and vice versa, leading to a World Wide Web
governed by formal laws and informal norms almost entirely of American
design. Think how the desire for access to American capital markets
gives American regulators de facto control over global accounting
standards, or how the need to transact with American institutions allows
U.S. Treasury officials to freeze the assets of designated targets
anywhere in the world. Think how Americans take for granted that English
is the universal language and that everyone accepts dollars. Think how
the American university degree has become the preeminent global academic
credential, with searching implications for everything from global
educational standards to measures of professional success."

[The American order has also been, in the main, **just**]{.underline}.
[It is based on the sovereignty of borders and democracy as a
nor]{.underline}m, and hence has been a boon to self-governing peoples
around the world. We can be overbearing and even bullying---as well as
greedy, shortsighted, and wrong-headed---[but U.S. leadership **hasn't
been based on coercion.** By and large, our allies trust us, and find
our model more congenial than anything else on offer.]{.underline}

The [previous hegemonic power]{.underline}, **[Britain]{.underline}**,
[had a soft landing because]{.underline} [Pax Britannica was replaced by
Pax Americana,]{.underline} run by a partner that shared similar values
and mindsets. [The same wouldn't be true if **we hand the baton over to
China**.]{.underline}

Consider the seas. As the navalist Jerry Hendrix notes, [the U.S. Navy
has made the seas safe and free over the last 70 years in a way they
never had been before]{.underline}. It's no accident that there's been a
surge of global trade over the course of these decades that has made
countries around the world more prosperous. Russia and especially China
are a threat to this system, seeking greater control of the seas for
their own purposes.

[China wants to define a swath of the Western Pacific and the Indian
Ocean as its territorial waters. If the U.S. lacks the resources or will
to resist this Chinese aggrandizement, the rules of the road of
international commerce will change drastically in China's
favor]{.underline}. An enormous proportion of global trade flows through
the South China Sea and East China Sea. With control of the key choke
points, China would be in a position to create restrictions and fees for
everyone else's trade and privileged status for its own. [Imagine a kind
of perpetual supply-chain crisis imposed by China as a matter of
policy.]{.underline}

Indeed, [China doesn't want to be a leading country among other leading
countries]{.underline}. [It wants to have its system of government
**considered superior to liberal democracy**]{.underline}. It wants free
access to markets, while constraining everyone else. [It wants to
dominate the setting of technical standards, and so influence how new
technologies are developed to suit its own interests]{.underline}. The
Belt and Road Initiative is a reflection of its vision, with China at
the center and other countries in a subsidiary role.

[If China achieves mastery in Asia and a position of global
predominance]{.underline}, **[it won't leave us alone to enjoy tending
our garden at home]{.underline}**. "[Building upon such economic
advantages]{.underline}," Colby writes, "it [could intrude into and
shape our national life, using its position to coerce, bribe, and cajole
companies, individuals, and governments to do its will, diminishing our
economic vitality and, through that, our freedoms."]{.underline}

[Resisting these]{.underline} growing civilizational [challenges will
require continued engagement around the world and the return in certain
respects to a Cold W]{.underline}ar footing, especially when it comes to
the chronically underfunded defense budget. [Ducking our leadership role
will, eventually, mean inevitable decline and the **creation of a more
hostile world. Countries don't become more prosperous and secure on
their way down.**]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--CP\-\--UN\-\--NB\-\--Treaties

**A UN mandate for Human Control would effectively ban LAWs -- it sets
the stage for future treaties.**

Acc 2/27/22 TA\]

General Obligations[: A regulation of LAWS, e.g. a CCW Protocol, could
consist of a general obligation to maintain human control over the use
of force when deploying conventional weapons]{.underline}. The GGE
Guiding Principles adopted in 2019 could lay the groundwork to further
shape a future regulation. The Guiding Principles emphasize that IHL
continues to fully apply to LAWS. Furthermore, they stress that [human
responsibility for the decision to use LAWS must be retained since
accountability cannot be transferred to machines. This aspect should be
considered throughout the entire life-cycle of a LAWS]{.underline}. They
also stipulate that human-machine interaction must be in compliance with
international law and refer, among others, to questions relating to
accountability, weapon reviews, and risk assessments, including the
development stage of weapon systems. In addition, other principles that
were not explicitly mentioned in the Guiding Principles but found entry
into other documents adopted by the GGE could also supplement a future
regulation. Examples are the principle of predictability, reliability,
and transparency. Specific Obligations: [Specific obligations and more
nuanced rules on the concept of human control could play a pivotal role
in a future treaty focusing on human control. It could entail concrete
rules stipulating that human control encompasses]{.underline} both
[situational understanding]{.underline} and the option to intervene,
enabled by design and in use. The term situational understanding could
be elaborated in more detail by stipulating that it refers to the
ability to monitor information about the environment, the target and the
weapon system. The human operator shall monitor the system and the
operational environment to the extent necessary in a specific operation.
Furthermore, the different modes of operation should allow the human
operator to intervene if necessary. All people in the chain of command
are equally obliged to abide by the rules of international law and
should be held accountable for any violations of the law. [These and
other obligations could be an integral part of "specific obligations" in
a future treaty on LAWS. The ICRC mentions two specifics that would call
for tighter restrictions, namely AWS with unpredictable effects and the
anti-personnel use of AWS.]{.underline}

#### UN regulation via arms control treaties (akin to Ottawa) is key prevent outsourcing to countries not included in the ban

Zachary **Kallenborn 21**, is an author and analyst who specializes in
WMD terrorism, unmanned systems, drone swarms, and homeland security.,
"Applying arms-control frameworks to autonomous weapons", Brookings.Edu
10-5-2021,
<https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/applying-arms-control-frameworks-to-autonomous-weapons/>)/maze

The global community [must now resolve the tension of fear between
arms-control and military advocates.]{.underline} That means serious
debate on which types of autonomous weapon offer the most military value
and which present the most risk to civilians and noncombatants. [Weapons
with high risk to civilians and low military value should form the
**basis of conversations around risk reduction.**]{.underline}

**[Existing arms control treaties offer models]{.underline}** to address
these complexities. The [Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel
Landmines]{.underline} narrowly focuses on anti-personnel landmines,
excluding anti-vehicle landmines that require high pressure to detonate.
An [autonomous weapon treaty might focus on anti-personnel
weapon]{.underline}s using machine learning, given the challenges of
distinguishing farmers from soldiers. A more precise treaty may allow
military powers to separate weapons they fear giving up from the weapons
arms control advocates fear proliferating. This may make getting an okay
from those powers easier.

Autonomous weapons might also be [tiered based on characteristics that
make them more or less risky,]{.underline} akin to the [Ch[emical
Weapons Convention's
schedule]{.underline}s](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/annexes/annex-chemicals/annex-chemicals).
The convention divides chemical agents into three schedules, based on
their historical use as chemical weapons and use for civilian purposes.
Chemicals in each schedule have different restrictions placed upon them.
Autonomous weapons could also be [tiered **based on the risk the weapons
pose**, particularly the risk to civilian populations]{.underline} if
the weapon errs and the likelihood of an error. Defensive turrets used
at sea to defend against incoming missiles would likely be of lowest
risk, while offensive weapons targeting people using machine learning
would be a higher tier. Autonomous chemical, biological, radiological,
and nuclear weapons are the highest risk, and should never be used.  

[Debate is needed on the best policy approaches]{.underline} to stem the
proliferation of the highest risk weapons, and reduce broader global
risks. Existing global discussion has focused on whether international
treaties should ban the weapons, but that's just a start. [**Even if
autonomous weapons are banned in whole**,]{.underline} in part, or not
at all, governments [must consider how to ensure they are not
**inadvertently exported to states not party to**]{.underline} the
**[ban]{.underline}**. Restricting access to terrorist groups is an
extra, different problem as autonomous weapons are simple enough to be
made as a classroom project. And if a new international treaty is
established, an obvious question is: How can it be given teeth?
[If]{.underline} a [state uses a banned autonomous weapon, should they
suffer retaliatory diplomatic or economic sanctions?]{.underline} When,
if ever, should the United Nations Security Council endorse military
action?

The era of killer robots is here. [What comes next is up to the
world.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--CP\-\--UN\-\--NB\-\--Global Governance

**CCW action on AI weapons would demonstrate the potential for global
governance.**

[The Guiding Principles]{.underline} therefore [are]{.underline} not a
ceiling, but a [steppingstone towards a more legally binding agreement
that ensures binding human control]{.underline}, has meaningful positive
obligations, and respects IH L and IHR L. [In this regard, it is good
news that the Principles' political visibility increased after the
endorsement of the Alliance for Multilateralism]{.underline}. Member
States of [the Alliance should therefore use this political momentum and
lead the effort to negotiate an additional protocol to the CC
W]{.underline}. After the November 2020 meetings of the GGE had to be
cancelled due to Covid-19, attention is now on the next meeting of the
High Contracting Parties to the CC W and the CC W Review Conference
scheduled for 2021. Tangible progress by then is sorely needed to
achieve some form of arms regulation in an area of rapid technological
development. [Moreover, progress toward new international law would
demonstrate the potential for effective global governance, called for by
the Alliance for Multilateralism]{.underline}. The Alliance itself is
still in a phase of self-definition and is a rather loose collection of
states. In fact, among the countries who supported the Alliance's
Guiding Principles, there are also 20 countries that have explicitly
endorsed the call for a ban on LAWS. P[rogress on an additional protocol
with meaningful obligations for human control of LAWS would demonstrate
the bridge-building capacity of the Alliance and would increase its
standing as an actor for effective global governance.]{.underline}

[Convention on]{.mark} Certain [Conventional Weapons debated the
question of banning autonomous weapon]{.mark}s]{.underline} at its
once-every-five-years review meeting in Geneva Dec. 13-17, 2021, but
didn't reach consensus on a ban[. Established in 1983, the convention
has been updated regularly to restrict some of the world's cruelest
conventional weapons, including land mines, booby traps and incendiary
weapons.]{.underline} Autonomous weapon systems are robots with [lethal
weapons that can operate independently, selecting and attacking targets
without a human weighing in on those decisions. [**Militaries** around
the world are **investing**]{.mark} heavily in [autonomous weapons
research and development]{.mark}. The U.S. alone budgeted US\$[18
billion f]{.mark}or autonomous weapons between 2016 and
2020.]{.underline} Meanwhile, human rights and humanitarian
organizations are racing to establish regulations and prohibitions on
such weapons development. Without such checks, foreign policy experts
warn that disruptive autonomous weapons technologies will dangerously
destabilize current nuclear strategies, both because they could
radically change perceptions of strategic dominance, increasing the risk
of preemptive attacks, and because they could be combined with chemical,
biological, radiological and nuclear weapons themselves. As a specialist
in human rights with a focus on the weaponization of artificial
intelligence, I find that [**[autonomous weapons]{.mark}** make the
unsteady [balances and fragmented **safeguards** of the nuclear
world]{.mark} -- for example]{.underline}, the U.S. president's
minimally constrained authority to launch a strike -- more unsteady and
more fragmented. [Given the pace of research and development in
autonomous weapons, the U.N. meeting might have been the last chance to
head off an arms race.]{.underline}

flexibility, and serves as a clearinghouse for information even without

Fostering norm development in the CCW LAWS keep steadily gathering media
attention around the globe.104 [With mounting public
pressure]{.underline} and increased scrutiny, [there will be a strong
incentive for CCW States Parties to produce tangible
results]{.underline} for the 2021 Review Conference. The "aspects of the
normative and operational framework" that are to be further developed
over the course of 2021 could take a more concrete shape in three steps.
[First, consensus seems achievable on shared language that adopts the by
now widely accepted functionalist view of weapon autonomy as well as a
common understanding that some form of positive obligation and
affirmation of the principle of human control over weapons systems is
required]{.underline}.105 The CCW\'s guiding principle (b) already
points this way in stating that "\[h\]uman responsibility for decisions
on the use of weapons systems must be retained since accountability
cannot be transferred to machines".106 The Forum for Supporting the 2020
GGE on LAWS conducted in April 2020 as a webcast by the German Federal
Foreign Office, with 320 registered participants representing
sixty-three CCW States Parties, underlined the importance of further
conceptualizing the human element. Controllability of weapons is
arguably a proto-norm already,107 and a shared terminology -- be it
"meaningful human control" or some other formulation -- could be found
to stipulate in a general sense when humans and when machines are to be
performing which function in the targeting cycle. The ICRC and the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) recently
presented a conceptual framework that can support this effort of
operationalizing human control -- that is, of clarifying the "who, what,
when and how" of controlling weapons and limiting their autonomy.108
[Second, since there is no one-size-fits-all standard of meaningful
human control, the sharing of best practices and, more importantly, of
case studies of specific weapons systems and operational scenarios could
allow CCW States Parties to develop a deeper, shared conceptual grasp
o]{.underline}f the intricacies involved with implementing human control
in design and use. [The GGE is uniquely suited to facilitate these sorts
of deep dives with analyses from multiple stakeholders and a sharing of
legal, ethical and operational views]{.underline}. Smaller expert groups
such as the International Panel on the Regulation of Autonomous Weapons
(iPRAW) and the commission on the responsible use of technologies in the
Franco-German Future Combat Air System are already beginning to organize
their research toward that end. [Third, a differentiated implementation
scheme could be developed that conceives of human control as being
exercised in a context-dependent way]{.underline} -- that is, contingent
on the weapons system, its mission environment, "target profiles"109 and
additional factors such as mission duration.110 This human control
scheme could prescribe minimum standards for controllability by design,
for example regarding the ergonomics of human--machine interfaces, and
determine "levels of human supervisory control"111 in use -- that is,
the tactics, techniques and procedures required to keep human control
and responsibility intact during the system\'s operation. It currently
seems unlikely that the CCW process, even if it were to complete these
three steps, will end up yielding more than "soft law", such as a
consensual political declaration or a catalogue of best practices. In
fact, a complete breakdown of the CCW process in Geneva is also within
the realm of possibility. But [even if the CCW turns out not to be the
venue from which a legally binding regulation for weapon autonomy
emerges, it has already served as an information hub and norm
incubator]{.underline} for the last six years -- [and will continue to
do]{.underline}. Especially considering the effect of the COVID-19
crisis on meeting schedules around the globe, it is currently too early
to tell if other fora -- and if so, which ones -- can and should pick up
the ball on regulation where the CCW leaves it in 2021, in order to
further develop and codify the human control norm as binding
international law.

### 2NC\-\--CP\-\--UN\-\--Solvency\-\--Human Contrpl

**UN action through the CCW would establish the human control norm and
reduce the instability and escalation from AI weapons**

https://www.readkong.com/page/building-blocks-for-a-regulation-on-laws-and-human-control-8617434
Acc 2/27/22 TA\]

iPRAW recommends that [the principle of human control should be
internationally recognized within the CCW and]{.underline} possibly
other documents of [international law and be the basis from which
requirements can be developed as part of a norm-shaping
process]{.underline}. The elements presented below could be helpful to
shape a regulation, be it legally binding or not. [What is important
though is to create a normative framework and operational guidance
around the]{.underline} (development and) [use of weapon systems with
autonomous functions.]{.underline} For example, [the ICRC]{.underline}
presented one approach to such a framework by [calling for a prohibition
of unpredictable and anti-personnel AWS and a regulation of other AWS
that considers the specific operational context.]{.underline} As iPRAW's
scenario-based discussions about the adequate type and level of human
control illustrated, [a definition of human control that adequately
considers the operational context requires many details about technical
capabilities and indicators for the targets. Hence, a
'one-size-of-control-fits-all' solution does not exist. Rather, a
combination of minimum requirements and individual solutions is
necessary]{.underline}. Individual solutions based on a case-by-case
assessment will ultimately lead to different levels of granularity when
it comes to formulating human control in a regulatory framework, e.g. a
rather abstract declaration or treaty and more granular best practices
and manuals. [These could inform a regulation of LAWS and human control
by creating the normative baseline and align with recommendations from
other actors.]{.underline} As for example the ICRC discussed, it is
crucial to link specific regulatory elements to the challenges raised by
LAWS. Within the CCW such a regulation could cover:  military
considerations: fulfilling the operational objective and translating the
commanders intent to the battlefield,  legal concerns: abide by IHL
principles, especially the principle of precaution by avoiding
unpredictable effects, ensure human judgment to take legal decisions, 
ethical concerns: retain moral agency. [A CCW regulation entailing an
obligation to maintain human control may also mitigate security
challenges, such as conflict escalation]{.underline}, even though the
CCW does not address them explicitly. Further important aspects, such as
technology diffusion, will most likely not be addressed in a future
regulation on LAWS but would have to be addressed in other fora. iPRAW's
model discussed below is not meant to read in opposition to the ICRC
propositions on a prohibition and regulation of AWS but rather as an
additional perspective with the same objective to keep human control in
the use of force.

SOFT LAW Best Practices: [States Parties to a CCW Protocol]{.underline}

specific purpose of sharing experiences]{.underline} that were already
made at the domestic level regarding the design, development,
acquisition, deployment, and use of weapon systems with autonomous
functions (under the assumption that the use of such weapons is lawful,
meaning that human control is maintained). [Especially States with
significant experience in this area could provide knowledge and
information about regulating LAWS and could show how human control is
maintained in practice. Such experiences could serve as exemplary model
for other States. Best practices are also a helpful instrument to
establish additional standards on the design, development, acquisition,
deployment, and use of LAWS based on cooperation, transparency, trust,
and confidentiality.]{.underline} The sharing of best practices could
promote the adoption of domestic laws on LAWS, ensuring that human
control is maintained as required by military, legal, and ethical
considerations.

Conclusion [A multilateral regulation of autonomy in weapons
systems]{.underline} -- that is, codifying a legally binding obligation
to retain meaningful human control over the use of force -- [is
difficult yet imperative to achieve]{.underline}. Severe strategic as
well as ethical mid- and long-term risks, such as unintended conflict
escalation at machine speed and the violation of human dignity, outweigh
any short-term military benefits. This analysis has illustrated how
[regulating weapon autonomy is feasible, presenting a three-step process
to facilitate stepping back from the brink: step one, foster the
emerging consensus on the notion that a positive obligation to retain
human control over weapons systems is]{.underline} prudent and [urgently
required; step two, further develop the insight that there is no
one-size-fits-all standard of meaningful human control; and step three,
devise differentiated, context-dependent human control schemes for
weapons systems]{.underline}. Given the current geopolitical landscape
and the lack of political will to engage in arms control efforts, [the
taking of these steps will resemble a marathon, not a
sprint.]{.underline} After all, the perceived military value of weapon
autonomy is exceptionally high, and [the issue itself is elusive,
requiring an innovative, qualitative approach to arms
control.]{.underline} But [history clearly suggests that great powers
are not devoid of sensitivity to the accumulation of collective risks --
otherwise arms control on nuclear, chemical and biological weapons would
never have seen the light of day]{.underline}. The emerging technologies
of the twenty-first century present humankind with the opportunity to
demonstrate that it has learned from history before the risks have
manifested themselves to their full extent. Humans do terrible things to
each other in war, and there is no technological fix for that. But [the
international community can at least set rules to curb against
uncontrolled escalation and the crossing of fundamental moral
lines]{.underline}. If we fail to do so, we will not only lose the
breathing room to ponder and deliberate responses,112 an essential
requirement of political conflict management, as the Cuban Missile
Crisis strongly suggests;113 we will also allow "the ultimate indignity"
of war turning into "death by algorithm".114

[According to the latest Global Peace Index]{.underline}, peace in the
world has deteriorated for the third year running. Peace has
deteriorated for the eleventh time in the last 14 years. This has
occurred, in-part, because the fallout from COVID-19 and the escalating
security crisis in Ukraine. Despite this decline in peacefulness, one
area that has recorded a significant improvement, is terrorism.¶ Of all
the indicators of global peace, [terrorism impact recorded the third
largest improvement. 86 countries recorded an improvement]{.underline},
while 18 countries recorded deteriorations. [This represents a long-term
trend in which the total deaths from terrorism have been falling
steadily since 2015.]{.underline}¶ There are several multifaceted
reasons why these changes have occurred, and the result is that
terrorism is globally at its lowest level in the history of the GPI.
This change is represented by several notable global and regional
trends.¶ ![Chart Description automatically

height="3.3983136482939633in"}¶ Geographical Trends¶ The epicentre of
terrorism has shifted out of the Middle East and North Africa, and into
South Asia, with countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan recording
poor scores in the terrorism impact indicator. The impact of terrorism
has increased in the sub-Saharan African region, especially in the Sahel
where armed conflict has become a key driver of terrorist activity.¶
Terrorism in the Sahel has risen sharply over the last five years and
attacks have become more frequent and more deadly. IS and its affiliates
have shifted their focus away from the Middle East as the Syrian
conflict has subsided and this has been a key driver in the increase in
terrorism in the Sahel. Terrorism in the Sahel accounted for 35% of the
total of terrorism deaths globally in 2021, an enormous increase from
only 1% in 2007.¶ Ideological Trends¶ IEP's definition of terrorism
suggests that: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic,
religious or social goal.¶ [IEP groups terrorist organisations and
ideologies into three broad categories: political,
nationalist/separatist, and religiously motivated terrorism. While all
acts of terrorism are inherently political, the major point of
difference between the types of terrorism is the goal.]{.underline} For
example, far-right terrorism is classified as a form of political
terrorism, whereas when the goal or motivation is explicitly religious,
the act is defined as religious terror.¶ Difficulty arises when
attempting to delineate between the types of terrorism, as there is a
great deal of intersectionality between these categories. However, most
terrorist groups have a primary purpose and self-understanding that fits
into at least one of these three groups.¶ Over the past decade,
[religious terrorism has been the deadliest form of terrorism. Islamist
groups or lone actors have been responsible for 528 deaths in the West
since 2007, representing 60% of deaths. This reached a peak of 457
deaths in the two years between 2015 and 2017. 2021 recorded the lowest
number of attacks and deaths attributed to religious terrorism since
2013.]{.underline}

#### Terrorists acquiring LAWs seems fictional in the squo because government LAWs are serving as modes of deterrence. But the plan ensures terrorists are the only actors who can use LAWS.

**Scharre 17** \[Paul Scharre (The vice president and director of
studies at the Center for a New American Security. From 2009-2012,
Scharre led the Defense Department\'s working group that resulted in the
DoD policy directive on autonomy in weapons) , 12-22-17, \"Why You
Shouldn't Fear "Slaughterbots",\" IEEE Spectrum,
<https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-you-shouldnt-fear-slaughterbots>\] // st

[Killer drones in the hands of terrorists massacring innocents. Robotic
weapons of mass destruction breeding chaos and fear.]{.underline} A
video created by advocates of a ban on autonomous weapons would have you
believe this [dystopian future is right around the corner if we don\'t
act now]{.underline}. The short video, called "Slaughterbots,\" was
released last month coinciding with United Nations meetings on
autonomous weapons. The UN meetings ended inconclusively, but the video
is getting traction. It\'s gotten over 2 million views and has sparked
dozens of news stories. As a piece of propaganda, it works great. As a
substantive argument for a ban on autonomous weapons, the video fails
miserably.¶ Obviously, a world in which terrorists can unleash swarms of
killer drones on innocent civilians would be terrible, but is the future
the video depicts realistic? The movie\'s slick production quality helps
to gloss over its leaps of logic. It immerses the viewer in a dystopian
nightmare, but let\'s be clear: It\'s very much science fiction.¶ The
central premise of "Slaughterbots\" is that in the [future militaries
will build autonomous microdrones with shaped charges that can fly up to
someone\'s head and detonate an explosive, killing the person. In the
film, these "slaughterbots\" quickly fall into the hands of terrorists,
resulting in mass killings worldwide.]{.underline}¶ The basic concept is
[grounded in technical reality. In the real world, the Islamic State has
used off-the-shelf quadcopters equipped with small explosives to attack
Iraqi troops, killing or wounding dozens of Iraqi soldiers. Today\'s
terrorist drones are largely remotely controlled, but hobbyist drones
are becoming increasingly autonomous. The latest models can navigate to
a fixed target on their own, avoid obstacles, and autonomously track and
follow moving objects. A small drone equipped with facial recognition
technology could potentially be used to autonomously search for and kill
specific individuals, as "Slaughterbots\" envisions. It took me just a
few minutes of searching online to find the resources necessary to
download and train a free neural network to do facial
recognition.]{.underline} So while no one has yet cobbled the technology
together in the way the video depicts, all of the components are real.¶
I want to make something very clear: [There is nothing we can do to keep
that underlying technology out of the hands of would-be
terrorists.]{.underline} This is upsetting, but it\'s very important to
understand. Just like how terrorists can and do use cars to ram crowds
of civilians, the underlying technology to turn hobbyist drones into
crude autonomous weapons is already too ubiquitous to stop. This is a
genuine problem, and the [best response is to focus on defensive
measures to counter drones along with surveillance to catch would-be
terrorists ahead of time.]{.underline}¶ "There is nothing we can do to
keep that underlying technology out of the hands of would-be terrorists.
Just like how terrorists can and do use cars to ram crowds of civilians,
the underlying technology to turn hobbyist drones into crude autonomous
weapons is already too ubiquitous to stop.\"¶ The "Slaughterbots\" video
takes this problem and blows it out of proportion, however, suggesting
that [drones would be used by terrorists as robotic weapons of mass
destruction, killing thousands of people at a time.]{.underline}
Fortunately, this nightmare scenario is about as likely to happen as HAL
9000 locking you out of the pod bay doors. T[he technology shown in the
video is plausible]{.underline}, but basically everything else is a
bunch of malarkey. [The video assumes]{.underline} the following:¶
Governments will mass-produce lethal microdrones to use them as weapons
of mass destruction;¶ [There are no effective defenses against lethal
microdrones;]{.underline}¶ [Governments are incapable of keeping
military-grade weapons out of the hands of terrorists;]{.underline}¶
[Terrorists are capable of launching large-scale coordinated
attacks.]{.underline}¶ These assumptions range from questionable, at
best, to completely fanciful.¶ Of course, the video is fictional, and
[defense planners do often use fictionalized scenarios to help
policymakers think through plausible events that may occur. As a defense
analyst at a think tank and in my prior job as a strategic planner at
the Pentagon, I used fictional scenarios to help inform choices about
what technologies the United States military should invest
in.]{.underline} To be useful, however, these scenarios need to at least
be plausible. They need to be something that could happen. The scenario
depicted in the "Slaughterbots\" video fails to account for political
and strategic realities about how governments use military technology.¶
First, there is no evidence that governments are planning to
mass-produce small drones to kill civilians in large numbers. In my
forthcoming book, Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of
War, I examine next-generation weapons being built in defense labs
around the world. Russia, China, and the United States are all racing
ahead on autonomy and artificial intelligence. But the types of weapons
they are building are generally aimed at fighting other militaries. They
are "counter-force\" weapons, not "counter-value\" weapons that would
target civilians. Counter-force autonomous weapons raise their own sets
of concerns, but they aren\'t designed for mass targeting of civilians,
nor could they be easily repurposed to do so.¶ Second, [in the video,
we\'re told the drones can defeat "any countermeasure.\"]{.underline} TV
pundits scream, "We can\'t defend ourselves.\" This isn\'t fiction;
it\'s farce. [Every military technology has a
countermeasure]{.underline}, and countermeasures against small drones
aren\'t even hypothetical. [The U.S. government is actively working on
ways to shoot down, jam, fry, hack, ensnare, or otherwise defeat small
drones.]{.underline} The microdrones in the video could be defeated by
something as simple as chicken wire. The video shows heavier-payload
drones blasting holes through walls so that other drones can get inside,
but the solution is simply layered defenses. Military analysts look at
the cost-exchange ratio between offense and defense, and in this case,
the costs heavily favor static defenders.¶ In a world where terrorists
launch occasional small-scale attacks using DIY drones, people are
unlikely to absorb the inconveniences of building robust defenses, just
like people don\'t wear body armor to protect against the unlikely event
of being caught in a mass shooting. But [if an enemy country built
hundreds of thousands of drones to wipe out a city, you bet there\'d be
a run on chicken wire. The video takes a plausible problem---terrorist
attacks with drones---and scales it up]{.underline} without factoring in
how others would respond. [If lethal microdrones were built en masse,
defenses and countermeasures would be a national priority, and in this
case the countermeasures are simple]{.underline}. Any weapon that can be
defeated by a net isn\'t a weapon of mass destruction.

[Robots]{.underline} won't bring perfection to the use of force, but
they can [reduce mistakes, increase precision and lower overall

worry that autonomous weapons might prompt leaders to turn more readily
to conflict. Bu[**t decisions about war and peace have much more to do
with political leaders** and their choices than with the technology
available to them.]{.underline} Presidents George W. Bush and Barack
Obama had roughly the same military at their disposal, but they used it
very differently. [The greater risk today isn't that the U.S. will
intervene impulsively but that it won't intervene at all, allowing
serious challenges to intensify. **Robotic weapons** can **ease the
dilemma**]{.underline}. In World War II, the Allies leveled cities, at
enormous human cost, to destroy Axis transportation and manufacturing
facilities. [**Drones** today can strike an arms factory, **pick off
terrorists** or **destroy nuclear-weapons sites while leaving
neighboring structures and civilians untouched.** Robotic weapons can
reduce the costs that discourage the U.S. and its allies from
intervening in humanitarian disasters or civil wars.]{.underline} Even
if we shared the apocalyptic worries of Mr. Musk and his allies, it
isn't at all clear that arms control could begin to deal with the
problem. [Arms control has mostly failed to prevent weapons innovation,
from the crossbow to the nuclear bomb. Nations have had more success in
imposing rules of warfare, especially to protect civilians, than in
restricting specific weapons. Robotics and AI will be even harder to
control. Countries already hide their nuclear-weapons programs behind
claims of scientific research or energy production. The technology
involved in autonomous weapons is a classic instance of "dual use," with
obvious peaceful applications.]{.underline} The same technology that can
produce a self-driving car can also drive an autonomous tank. A drone
can just as easily deliver a bomb as a box from Amazon . [**A ban on
military development would be almost impossible to verify.** Such limits
would also be a serious handicap for the U.S.]{.underline} The new
technology is most likely to benefit countries with the technical
dynamism and the innovative drive to deploy them broadly. [Restraining
their development seems likely to cancel an American advantage over
our]{.underline} authoritarian rivals and [terrorist
enemies.]{.underline} Tech executives may worry that consumers will come
to associate their products with war. But [responsible governments buy
weapons and wage wars for good reasons, such as self-defense, coming to
the assistance of allies, pursuing terrorists and alleviating
humanitarian disasters.]{.underline} If force is misused, we should
blame our elected leaders, not the weapons[.]{.underline}

#### Results in nuclear terrorism and extinction

[Nuclear terrorism]{.underline} post-cold war: [trigger for
**inadvertent nuclear war**]{.underline}? The possible catalytic effect
of nuclear terrorism on the risk of state-based nuclear war is not a
simple linkage. The [multiple types and scales of nuclear terrorism may
affect state-nuclear use decisions]{.underline} along multiple pathways
**[that lead to inadvertent nuclear war]{.underline}**. These include:
[Early **warning systems fail** or are "tripped" in ways that lead to
launch-on-warning]{.underline} Accidental nuclear detonation, including
sub-critical explosions. [Strategic **miscalculation in crisis**, show
of force Decision-making failure (such as irrational, misperception,
bias, degraded, group, and **time-compressed
decision-making**]{.underline}) [Allied or enemy choices]{.underline}
([to seek revenge, to exploit nuclear risk, to **act out of
desperation**)]{.underline} [Organizational cybernetics]{.underline}
whereby a nuclear command-control-and communications (NC3) [system
generates error]{.underline}, including the interplay of national NC3
systems in what may be termed the meta-NC3 system. Synchronous and
coincident combinations of above.\[4\] Exactly how, where, and when
nuclear terrorism may "ambush" nuclear armed states already heading for
or on such a path to inadvertent nuclear war depends on who is targeting
whom at a given time, either immediately due to high tension, or
generally due to a structural conflict between states. Nuclear armed
states today form a complex set of global threat relationships that are
not distributed uniformly across the face of Earth. Rather, based on
sheer firepower and reach, the nine nuclear weapons states form a global
hierarchy with at least four tiers, viz: Tier 1: United States, clear
technological supremacy and qualitative edge. Tier 2: Russia, China,
global nuclear powers and peers with the United States due to the unique
destructive power of even relatively small nuclear arsenals, combined
with global reach of missile and bomber delivery systems, thereby
constituting a two-tiered global "nuclear triangle" with the United
States. Tier 3: France, UK, NATO nuclear sharing and delivery NATO
members (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey) and the
NATO and Pacific nuclear umbrella states (Japan, South Korea, Australia)
that depend on American nuclear extended deterrence and directly and
indirectly support US and US-allied nuclear operations even though they
do not host nor deliver nuclear weapons themselves. Tier 4: India,
Pakistan, Israel, DPRK. The first two tiers constitute the global
nuclear threat triangle that exists between the United States, Russia,
and China, forming a global nuclear "truel." Each of these states
targets the others; each represents an existential threat to the other;
and each has a long history of mutual nuclear threat that is now a core
element of their strategic identity. Tier three consists of states with
their own nuclear force but integrated with that of the United States
(even France!) that expand the zone of mutual nuclear threat over much
of the northern and even parts of the southern hemisphere; and states
that host American nuclear command, control, communications, and
intelligence systems that support US nuclear operations and to whom
nuclear deterrence is "extended" (if, for example, Australia's claim to
having an American nuclear umbrella is believed). The fourth tier is
composed of smaller nuclear forces with a primarily regional reach and
focus. Between most of these nuclear armed states and across the tiers,
there are few shared "rules of the road." The more of these states that
are engaged in a specific conflict and location, the more unpredictable
and unstable this global nuclear threat system becomes, with the
potential for cascading and concatenating effects. Indeed, as the number
of nuclear states projecting nuclear threat against each other
increases, the notion of strategic stability may lose all meaning. The
[emergence of a **fifth tier**---of non-state actors with the **capacity
to project nuclear threat against nuclear-armed and nuclear umbrella
states**]{.underline} (although not only these states)---[is a
critically important possible catalytic actor in the new conditions of
nuclear threat complexity that already exist today. Such a layer
represents an "**edge of chaos"**]{.underline} [where the attempts by
nuclear armed states to exert absolute "vertical" control over the use
of nuclear weapons confront the potential of non-state entities and even
individuals]{.underline} (insiders) [to engage in]{.underline}
"horizontal" [nuclear terrorism]{.underline}, presenting radically
different control imperatives to the standard paradigm of organizational
procedures, technical measures, and safeguards of various kinds. This
tier is like the waves and tides on a beach that quickly surrounds and
then causes sand castles to collapse. In 2010, Robert Ayson reviewed the
potential linkages between inter-state nuclear war and non-state
terrorism. He concluded: "...\[T\][hese two nuclear worlds---a non-state
actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear
exchange---are **not**]{.underline} necessarily
**[separable]{.underline}**. It is just possible that some sort of
terrorist attack, and especially [an act of nuclear terrorism, could
precipitate a chain of events leading to a **massive exchange of nuclear
weapons** between two or more of the states that possess
them]{.underline}."\[5\] How this linkage might unfold is the subject of
the next sections of this essay. Are non-state actors motivated and able
to attempt nuclear terrorism? A [diverse set of non-state actors have
engaged in terrorist activities]{.underline}---for which there is no
simple or consensual definition. In 2011, there were [more than 6,900
known extremist, terrorist and other organizations associated with
guerrilla warfare, political violence]{.underline}, protest, organized
crime and cyber-crime. Of these, [about 120 terrorist and extremist
groups had been blacklisted by the United Nations]{.underline}, the
European Union and six major countries.\[6\] [Some have argued that the
technical]{.underline}, [organizational, and funding demanded for a
successful nuclear attack,]{.underline} especially involving nuclear
weapons, [exceeds the capacity of most of the non-state
actors]{.underline} with terrorist proclivities. **[Unfortunately, this
assertion is not true]{.underline}**, especially at lower levels of
impact as shown in Figure 1; but [even at the highest levels of
obtaining authentic nuclear weapons capabilities, a small number of
non-state actors already exhibit the motivation and possible capacity to
become nuclear-armed.]{.underline} Ellingsen suggests a useful
distinction that nuclear terrorists may be impelled by two divergent
motivations, as shown in Figure 2, creating "opportunistic" and
"patient" profiles.\[7\] The requirements for an opportunist non-state
nuclear terrorist tend towards immediate use and the search for
short-term payoffs with only tactical levels of commitment; whereas the
patient non-state nuclear terrorist is able and willing to sustain a
long-term acquisition effort to deal a strategic blow to an adversary in
a manner that could be achieved only with nuclear weapons. In turn, many
factors will drive how a potential nuclear terrorist non-state
organization that obtains nuclear weapons or materials may seek to
employ them, especially in its nuclear command-and-control orientations.
Blair and Ackerman suggest that the goals, conditions, and capacity
limitations that shape a possible nuclear terrorist's posture lead
logically to three types of nuclear terrorist nuclear
command-and-control postures, viz: pre-determined (in which the
leadership sends a fire order to a nuclear-armed subordinate and no
change is entertained and no capacity to effect change is established in
the field, that is, the order is fire-and-forget); assertive (in which
only the central command can issue a nuclear fire order, central control
is maintained at all times, with resulting demanding communications
systems to support such control); and delegative (in which lower level
commanders control nuclear weapons and have pre-delegated authority to
use them in defined circumstances, for example, evidence of nuclear
explosions combined with loss-of-connectivity with their central
command).\[8\] An example of such delegative control system was the
November 26, 2008 attack on Mumbai that used social media reporting to
enable the attacking terrorists to respond to distant controller
direction and to adapt to counter-terrorist attacks---a connectivity
tactic that the authorities were too slow to shut down before mayhem was
achieved.\[9\] Logically, one might expect nuclear terrorists oriented
toward short-term, tactical goals to employ pre-determined nuclear
command-and-control strategies in the hope that the speed of attack and
minimum field communications avoids discovery and interdiction before
the attack is complete; whereas nuclear terrorists oriented toward
long-term, strategic goals might employ more pre-delegative
command-and-control systems that would support a bargaining use and
therefore a field capacity to deploy nuclear weapons or materials that
can calibrate actual attack based on communications with the central
leadership with the risk of interdiction through surveillance and
counter-attack. These differing strategic motivations, timelines, and
strategies in many respects invert those of nuclear weapons states that
rely on large organizations, procedures, and technical controls, to
ensure that nuclear weapons are never used without legitimate
authorization; and if they are used, to minimize needless civilian
casualties (at least some nuclear armed states aspire to this outcome).
[The repertoire of]{.underline} state-based [practices that presents
other states with credible nuclear threat and reassures them that
nuclear weapons are secure]{.underline} and controlled [is likely to be
completely mismatched with]{.underline} the strengths and strategies of
[non-state nuclear terrorists that may **seek to maximize civilian
terror**, are **not always concerned about their own survival** or even
that of their families and communities-of-origin, and may be willing to
**take extraordinary risk** combined with creativity to exploit the
opportunities for attack]{.underline} presented by nuclear weapons,
umbrella, and non-nuclear states, or their private adversaries. For
non-state actors to succeed at complex engineering project such as
acquiring a nuclear weapons or nuclear threat capacity demands
substantial effort. Gary Ackerman specifies that to have a chance of
succeeding, non-state actors with nuclear weapons aspirations must be
able to demonstrate that they control substantial resources, have a safe
haven in which to conduct research and development, have their own or
procured expertise, are able to learn from failing and have the stamina
and strategic commitment to do so, and manifest long-term planning and
ability to make rational choices on decadal timelines[. He identified
**five such violent non-state actors who already conducted such
engineering projects**]{.underline} (see Figure 3), and [also noted the
important facilitating condition of a global network of expertize and
hardware]{.underline}. Thus, [although the skill, financial, and
materiel requirements of a non-state nuclear weapons project present a
high bar, they **are certainly reachable**.]{.underline} Along similar
lines, James Forest examined the extent to which non-state actors can
pose a threat of nuclear terrorism.\[10\] He notes that such entities
face practical constraints, including expense, the obstacles to stealing
many essential elements for nuclear weapons, the risk of discovery, and
the difficulties of constructing and concealing such weapons. He also
recognizes the strategic constraints that work against obtaining nuclear
weapons, including a cost-benefit analysis, possible de-legitimation
that might follow from perceived genocidal intent or use, and the
primacy of political-ideological objectives over long-term projects that
might lead to the group's elimination, the availability of cheaper and
more effective alternatives that would be foregone by pursuit of nuclear
weapons, and the risk of failure and/or discovery before successful
acquisition and use occurs. In the past, almost all---but not
all---non-state terrorist groups appeared to be restrained by a
combination of high practical and strategic constraints, plus their own
cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of pursuing nuclear
weapons. However, should some or all of these constraints diminish, a
rapid non-state nuclear proliferation is possible. [Although only a few
non-state actors such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State have exhibited such
underlying stamina and organizational capacities and actually attempted
to obtain nuclear weapons-]{.underline}related skills, hardware, and
materials, **[the past is not prologue]{.underline}**. [An incredibly
diverse set of variously motivated terrorist groups exist
already,]{.underline} including politico-ideological,
apocalyptic-millenarian, politico-religious, nationalist-separatist,
ecological, and political-insurgency entities, some of [which converge
with criminal-military and criminal-scientist]{.underline} (profit
based) [networks]{.underline}; but also pyscho-pathological mass killing
cults, lone wolves, and ephemeral copy-cat non-state actors. The
[social, economic, and deculturating conditions that generate such
entities are **likely to persist and even expand.**]{.underline} In
particular, rapidly growing coastal mega-cities as part of rapid global
urbanization offer such actors the ability to sustain themselves as
"flow gatekeepers," possibly in alliance with global criminal networks,
thereby supplanting the highland origins of many of today's non-state
violent actors with global reach.\[11\] Other contributing factors
contributing to the supply of possible non-state actors seeking nuclear
weapons include new entries such as city states in search of new
security strategies, megacities creating their own transnationally
active security forces, non-states with partial or complete territorial
control such as Taiwan and various micro-states, failing states,
provinces in dissociating, failing states that fall victim to internal
chaos and the displacement effects of untrammeled globalization, and
altogether failed states resulting in ungoverned spaces. To this must be
added domestic terrorist entities in the advanced industrial states as
they hollow out their economies due to economic globalization and
restructuring, adjust to cross-border migration, and adapt to cultural
and political dislocation. In short, the prognosis is for the fifth tier
of non-state actors to beset the other four tiers with intense
turbulence just as waves on a beach swirl around sandcastles, washing
away their foundations, causing grains of sand to cascade, and
eventually collapsing the whole structure. Observed non-state nuclear
threats and attacks In light of the constraints faced by non-state
terrorist actors in past decades, it is not surprising that the
constellation of actual nuclear terrorist attacks and threats has been
relatively limited during and since the end of the Cold War. As Martha
Crenshaw noted in a comment on the draft of this paper: We still don't
know why terrorists (in the sense of non-state actors) have not moved
into the CBRN \[chemical,biological, radiological or nuclear \] domain.
(Many people think biosecurity is more critical, for that matter.) Such
a move would be extremely risky for the terrorist actor, even if the
group possessed both capability (resources, secure space, time,
patience) and motivation (willingness to expend the effort, considering
opportunity costs). So far it appears that "conventional" terrorism
serves their purposes well enough. Most of what we have seen is
rhetoric, with some scattered and not always energetic
initiatives.\[12\] Nonetheless, those that have occurred demonstrate
unambiguously that such threats and attacks are not merely hypothetical,
in spite of the limiting conditions outlined above. One survey
documented eighty actual, planned attacks on nuclear facilities
containing nuclear materials between 1961-2016\[13\] as follows: 80
attacks in 3 waves (1970s armed assaults, 1990s thefts, post-2010,
breaches) High threat attacks: 32/80 attacks posed substantial, verified
threat of which 44 percent involved insiders. All types of targets were
found in the data set---on reactors, other nuclear facilities, military
bases leading Gary Ackerman and to conclude: "Overall, empirical
evidence suggests that there are sufficient cases in each of the listed
categories that no type of threat can be ignored."\[14\] No region was
immune; no year was without such a threat or attack. Thus, there is a
likely to be a coincidence of future non-state threats and attacks with
inter-state nuclear-prone conflicts, as in the past, and possibly more
so given the current trend in and the generative conditions for global
terrorist activity that will likely pertain in the coming decades. Of
these attacks, about a quarter each were ethno-nationalist, secular
utopian, or unknown in motivation; and the remaining quarter were a
motley mix of religious (11 percent), "other" (5 percent),
personal-idiosyncratic (4 percent), single issue (2 percent) and state
sponsored (1 percent) in motivation. The conclusion is unavoidable that
there [a non-state nuclear terrorist attack in the Northeast Asia region
is possible]{.underline}. The [following sections outline the possible
situations in which nuclear terrorist attacks might be implicated as a
**trigger to interstate conflict, and even nuclear war**]{.underline}.
Particular attention is paid to the how [nuclear **command, control and
communications systems** may play an independent and unanticipated role
in leading to inadvertent nuclear war]{.underline}, separate to the
contributors to inadvertency normally included such as [degradation of
decision-making due to time and other pressures]{.underline}; accident;
"wetware" ([human failures), software or hardware failures; and
misinterpretation of intended or unintended signals]{.underline} from an
adversary. Regional pathways to interstate nuclear war [At least **five
distinct nuclear-prone axes** of conflict are evident in Northeast
Asia.]{.underline} These are: [US-DPRK conflict]{.underline} (including
with United States, US allies Japan, South Korea and Australia; and all
other UNC command allies. Many [permutations possible ranging from
non-violent collapse to implosion and civil war,]{.underline}
inter-Korean war, slow humanitarian crisis. Of these implosion-civil war
in the DPRK may be the most dangerous, followed closely by an
altercation at the Joint Security Area at Panmunjon where US, ROK, and
DPRK soldiers interact constantly. [China-Taiwan conflict]{.underline},
whereby China may use nuclear weapons to overcome US forces operating in
the West Pacific, either at sea, or based on US (Guam, Alaska) or US
allied territory in the ROK, Japan, the Philippines, or Australia); or
US uses nuclear weapons in response to Chinese attack on Taiwan.
[China-Japan]{.underline} conflict escalates via attacks on early
warning systems, for example, underwater hydrophone systems (Ayson-Ball,
2011). [China-Russia conflict,]{.underline} possibly in context of
loss-of-control of Chinese nuclear forces in a regional conflict
involving Taiwan or North Korea. [**Russia-US conflict**,]{.underline}
involving horizontal escalation from a head-on collision with Russian
nuclear forces in Europe or the Middle East; or somehow starts at sea
(mostly likely seems ASW) or over North Korea (some have cited risk of
US missile defenses against North Korean attack as risking Russian
immediate response). Combinations of or simultaneous eruption of the
above conflicts that culminate in nuclear war are also possible. Other
unanticipated nuclear-prone conflict axes (such as Russia-Japan) could
also emerge with little warning. Precursors of such nuclear-laden
conflicts in this region also exist that could lead states to the brink
of nuclear war and demonstrate that nuclear war is all too possible
between states in this region. Examples include the August 1958
Quemoy-Matsu crisis, in which the United States deployed nuclear weapons
to Taiwan, and the US Air Force has only a nuclear defense strategy in
place to defend Taiwan should China have escalated its shelling campaign
to an actual attack; the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when a US
nuclear armed missile was nearly fired from Okinawa due to a false fire
order; the March 1969 Chinese-Soviet military clash and resulting
consideration of nuclear attacks by both sides; and the August 1976
poplar tree crisis at Panmunjon in Korea, when the United States moved
nuclear weapons back to the DMZ and the White House issued pre-delegated
orders to the US commander in Korea to attack North Korea if the tree
cutting task force was attacked by North Korean forces. Loss-of-control
of Nuclear Weapons As is well known, nuclear armed states must
routinely---and in the midst of a crisis---ensure that their nuclear
weapons are never used without legitimate authority, but also ensure at
the same time that they are always available for immediate use with
legitimate authority. This "always-never" paradox is managed in part by
a set of negative and positive controls, reliant upon procedural and
technical measures, to maintain legitimate state-based
command-and-control (see Figure Four). In this framework, Jerry Conley
has produced a taxonomy of nuclear command-and-control structures that
embody varying notional national "command-and-control" orientations
(also referred to as stability points or biases). Each nuclear armed
state exhibits a distinct preference for technical and procedural
measures to achieve negative and positive control of nuclear weapons.
The way that a state constructs its control system varies depending on
its size, wealth, technology, leadership, and strategic orientation,
lending each state a unique use propensity affected by the information
processing and transmission functions of the nuclear command-and-control
system, that in part determines the use or non-use decisions made by the
leaders of nuclear armed states. The resulting ideal nuclear
command-and-control state structures are shown in Table 1. In Northeast
Asia, a four-way nuclear threat system exists that has a three
world-class nuclear armed states, the United States, Russia and China,
interacting with a fourth tier, barely nuclear armed state, the DPRK. In
this quadrilateral nuclear standoff, the DPRK's simple NC3 system likely
is an amalgam of a poorly resourced, militarized, and personalized
leadership---which may lead it to oscillate between procedural and
technical measures as the basis of control, with a primary emphasis on
positive use control, not negative control to avoid unauthorized use.
China's large, centralized NC3 system co-mingles nuclear and
conventional communications between national commanders and deployed
nuclear forces and may emphasize negative more than positive use
controls to ensure Party control. Russia's highly centralized, complex
NC3 system relies on legacy technology and limited economic base for
modernization. It too may be more oriented towards negative controls in
peacetime, but have the capacity to spring almost instantly to primary
reliance on positive controls in times of crisis or tension. The US NC3
system is large, complex and based on wealth and technological prowess.
It is under civilian, not military control, at least in principle and in
peacetime, and is redundant, diverse, and relatively resilient.
Non-state nuclear attack as trigger of inter-state nuclear war in
Northeast Asia The [critical issue is how a nuclear terrorist attack may
"catalyze" inter-state nuclear war]{.underline}, [especially the NC3
systems that inform and partly determine how leaders respond to nuclear
threat]{.underline}. [Current conditions in Northeast Asia suggest that
**multiple precursory conditions for nuclear terrorism already
exist**]{.underline} or exist in nascent form. In Japan, for example,
low-level, individual, terroristic violence with nuclear materials,
against nuclear facilities, is real. In all countries of the region, the
risk of diversion of nuclear material is real, although the risk is
likely higher due to volume and laxity of security in some countries of
the region than in others. [In all countries, the risk of an insider
"sleeper" threat is real in security and nuclear agencies, and such
insiders already operated in actual terrorist
organizations]{.underline}. Insider corruption is also observable in
nuclear fuel cycle agencies in all countries of the region. [The threat
of extortion to induce insider cooperation is also real]{.underline} in
all countries. The possibility of a cult attempting to build and buy
nuclear weapons is real and has already occurred in the region.\[15\]
[Cyber-terrorism against nuclear reactors is real and such attacks have
already taken place in South Korea]{.underline} (although it remains
difficult to attribute the source of the attacks with certainty). The
stand-off ballistic and drone threat to nuclear weapons and fuel cycle
facilities is real in the region, including from non-state actors, some
of whom have already adopted and used such technology almost instantly
from when it becomes accessible (for example, drones).\[16\] Two other
broad risk factors are also present in the region. The [social and
political conditions for extreme ethnic and xenophobic nationalism are
emerging]{.underline} in China, Korea, Japan, and Russia[.]{.underline}
Although there has been no risk of attack on or loss of control over
nuclear weapons since their removal from Japan in 1972 and from South
Korea in 1991, this risk continues to exist in North Korea, China, and
Russia, and to the extent that they are deployed on aircraft and ships
of these and other nuclear weapons states (including submarines)
deployed in the region's high seas, also outside their territorial
borders. The most conducive circumstance for [catalysis to occur due to
a nuclear terrorist attack might involve the following nexi of timing
and conditions]{.underline}: [Low-level,]{.underline} tactical, or
random [individual terrorist attacks for whatever reasons, even
assassination of national leaders,]{.underline} up to and including
dirty radiological bomb attacks[, that **overlap with inter-state crisis
dynamics** in ways that affect state decisions to threaten with or to
**use nuclear weapons**. This might be undertaken by an opportunist
nuclear terrorist entity in search of **rapid and high political
impact.**]{.underline} Attacks on [major national or international
events in each country to maximize terror and to de-legitimate national
leaders and whole governments]{.underline}. In Japan, for example, more
than ten heads of state and senior ministerial international meetings
are held each year. For the strategic nuclear terrorist, patiently
acquiring higher level nuclear threat capabilities for such attacks and
then staging them to maximum effect could accrue strategic gains.
Attacks or threatened attacks, including deception and disguised
attacks, will have maximum leverage when nuclear-armed states are near
or on the brink of war or during a national crisis (such as Fukushima),
when intelligence agencies, national leaders, facility operators,
surveillance and policing agencies, and first responders are already
maximally committed and over-extended. At this point, we note an
important caveat to the original concept of catalytic nuclear war as it
might pertain to nuclear terrorist threats or attacks. Although an
attack might be disguised so that it is attributed to a nuclear-armed
state, or a ruse might be undertaken to threaten such attacks by
deception, in reality a catalytic strike by a nuclear weapons state in
conditions of mutual vulnerability to nuclear retaliation for such a
strike from other nuclear armed states would be highly irrational.
Accordingly, the effect of nuclear terrorism involving a nuclear
detonation or major radiological release may not of itself be catalytic
of nuclear war---at least not intentionally--because it will not lead
directly to the destruction of a targeted nuclear-armed state. Rather,
it may be catalytic of non-nuclear war between states, especially if the
non-state actor turns out to be aligned with or sponsored by a state (in
many Japanese minds, the natural candidate for the perpetrator of such
an attack is the pro-North Korean General Association of Korean
Residents, often called Chosen Soren, which represents many of the
otherwise stateless Koreans who were born and live in Japan) and a
further sequence of coincident events is necessary to drive escalation
to the point of nuclear first use by a state. Also, the catalyst---the
non-state actor--is almost assured of discovery and destruction either
during the attack itself (if it takes the form of a nuclear suicide
attack then self-immolation is assured) or as a result of a
search-and-destroy campaign from the targeted state (unless the targeted
government is annihilated by the initial terrorist nuclear attack). It
follows that the [effects of a non-state nuclear attack may be
characterized better as a trigger effect, bringing about a cascade of
nuclear use decisions within NC3 systems that shift each state
increasingly away from nuclear non-use and increasingly towards nuclear
use by releasing negative controls and enhancing positive controls in
multiple action-reaction escalation spirals]{.underline} (depending on
how many nuclear armed states are party to an inter-state conflict that
is already underway at the time of the non-state nuclear attack); and/or
b[y inducing concatenating nuclear attacks across geographically
proximate nuclear weapons forces of states already caught in the
crossfire of nuclear threat or attacks of their own making before a
nuclear terrorist attack]{.underline}.\[17\] An example of a cascading
effect would be a non-state attack on a key node of linked early warning
systems that is unique to and critical for strategic nuclear forces to
be employable, or the effect of multiple, coincident and erroneous
sensor alerts of incoming attacks (as occurred during the Cuban Missile
Crisis with radar in Florida monitoring Soviet missiles in Cuba that
mistakenly fused an erroneous reading of a missile trajectory with a
real observation of a Soviet satellite that happened to be passing
overhead). An example of a concatenating effect would an [attack that
leads a nuclear weapons state to target two other states forces because
it cannot determine whose forces attacked its own]{.underline}. This
circumstance might [arise if key anti-submarine forces or an aircraft
carrier battle group were attacked and it was impossible to determine in
a given waterway or area of ocean whose submarines were present or
responsible for the attack]{.underline}, leading the attacked state to
destroy all the submarines presenting on-going threat to its strategic
forces. As we noted above, a terrorist nuclear shock may take various
forms and appear in different places. Ever since an extortion attempt in
Boston in 1974 based on the threat of nuclear detonation, the threat of
an improvised nuclear device has been credible. For such a threat to be
credible, a non-state terrorist entity must release a plausible
precursor such as nuclear material or warhead design information, or
stage an actual demonstration attack that makes it plausible that the
attacker controls a significant quantity of fissile material (most
likely plutonium, or simply radioactive materials suitable for a
radiological device that might be used to draw in first responders and
then detonate a warhead to maximize damage and terror). Such an attack
might be combined with a separate attack on critical infrastructure such
as a cyberattack. The attacker might retain sufficient material for
bargaining and insurance should the initial attack fail. Given the need
to adapt to circumstances, such an attacker is likely to be patient and
strategic, in the terms defined earlier, and to have extensive
organizational and communication capacities; and to be able to operate
at multiple targeted sites, possibly in multiple countries. Given its
patience and stamina, such an attacker would select a highly symbolic
target such as a high level meeting. Such a case would present the
targeted state with an exquisite dilemma: bargaining and negotiation
with the non-state actor threatening such an attack may be justified
given the explicit and plausible nature of the threat, which may be
politically impossible while making counter-terrorism operations very
risky and only possible with extreme caution. And, such an attacker
might well issue a false statement about state-sponsorship to invoke
third parties in ways that vastly complicate the response to the threat.
If the attacker is less capable and driven for immediate political or
other returns, then it may be satisfied with highly delegated delivery
with no recall option, and no use of communications to minimize the risk
of discovery or interdiction. Such an attacker is also less likely to
wait for the circumstances in which inter-state nuclear war is more
likely due to inter-state tension; and also less likely to seek third
party effects beyond the damage to the immediate target and resulting
terror. Should surveillance indicate that an improvised nuclear device
is in motion, then an all-out search to interdict the attackers and to
retrieve the device or materials would likely ensue. In these two
instances of credible threat of non-state nuclear attack, the insider
versus outsider perpetrator factor will affect significantly how the
attack affects possible inter-state conflicts. In Kobe's terms, if the
perpetrator is confirmed to be an outsider, then a country-of-origin
suspicion matrix may cast suspicion onto another state as possible
sponsor. For an attack threatened in China, the linkage might be back to
Russia, the United States, or North Korea. For an attack threatened in
Russia, the linkage might be back to the United States, China, or North
Korea. For an attack threatened in North Korea, the linkage might be
back to the United States, China, or Russia. And for an attack
threatened in one of the umbrella states in the region, South Korea and
Japan, such an attack might be linked to each other, as well as to
China, North Korea, or Russia. In each case, the shadow of suspicion and
possible accusations could tilt decision-making processes in one or more
of these states and ways that could worsen pre-existing views about the
nuclear use propensity of an opposing nuclear armed state. Should an
actual nuclear attack occur, the situation is even more complex and
problematic. Such an attack might be purely accidental, due to hardware,
software, or human error while nuclear materials or weapons are in
transit. In principle, this limits the site of such an event to the
nuclear weapons states or their ships and aircraft as neither South
Korea nor Japan host nuclear weapons today. If an insider is involved,
then the perpetrator may be identified quickly, and whether there is a
linkage with another state may become evident (depending on nuclear
forensics as well as insight obtained from surviving attackers). If an
outsider is the perpetrator, then the suspicion matrix will come into
play again, with possibly severe effects on inter-state tension due to
accusation, suspicion, and fear of follow-on attacks. During the attack,
especially if it is a hostage-taking type of attack, the identity of the
perpetrator may be unknown or ambiguous, and maintaining this ambiguity
or even opacity as to the attacker may be deliberate---as was the case
with the 2008 Mumbai attack in which the controller tried to ensure that
all the attackers were killed in the course of the twelve separate but
coordinated attacks across the city over four days. Although much
progress has been made in establishing local nuclear forensics
capability in Japan,\[18\] China, and South Korea, there is no certainty
that it is sufficiently developed to identify the perpetrator of an act
of nuclear terrorism, especially if there is a state sponsor and
deception involved. Conclusion We now move to our conclusion.
[Nuclear-armed states can place themselves on the **edge of nuclear
war** by]{.underline} a [combination of threatening force]{.underline}
deployments [and threat rhetoric]{.underline}. [Statements by
US]{.underline} and North Korea's [leaders]{.underline} and supporting
amplification by state and private media to [present just such a lethal
combination]{.underline}. Many observers have observed that [the risk of
war and nuclear war]{.underline}, in Korea and globally, **[have
increased in the last few years]{.underline}**---although no-one can say
with authority by how much and exactly for what reasons. However, states
are restrained in their actual decisions to escalate to conflict and/or
nuclear war by conventional deterrence, vital national interests, and
other institutional and political restraints, both domestic and
international. It is not easy, in the real world, or even in fiction, to
start nuclear wars.\[19\] Rhetorical threats are standard fare in
realist and constructivist accounts of inter-state nuclear deterrence,
compellence, and reassurance, and are not cause for alarm per se. States
will manage the risk in each of the threat relationships with other
nuclear armed states to stay back from the brink, let alone go over it,
as they have in the past. This argument was powerful and to many,
persuasive during the Cold War although it does not deny the
hair-raising risks taken by nuclear armed states during this period.
Today, the multi-polarity of nine nuclear weapons states interacting in
a four-tiered nuclear threat system means that the practice of
sustaining nuclear threat and preparing for nuclear war is no longer
merely complicated, but is now enormously complex in ways that may
exceed the capacity of some and perhaps all states to manage, even
without the emergence of a fifth tier of non-state actors to add further
unpredictability to how this system works in practice. The [possibility
that non-state actors may attack without advance warning as to the time,
place, and angle of attack presents another layer of uncertainty to this
complexity as to how inter-state nuclear war may break out]{.underline}.
That is, non-state actors with nuclear weapons or threat goals and
capacities do not seek the same goals, will not use the same control
systems, and will use radically different organizational procedures and
systems to deliver on their threats compared with nuclear armed states[.
If used tactically for immediate terrorist effect, a non-state nuclear
terrorist could violently attack nuclear facilities, exploiting any
number of vulnerabilities in fuel cycle facility security, or use actual
nuclear materials and even warheads against military or civilian
targets]{.underline}. If a persistent, strategically oriented nuclear
terrorist succeed in gaining credible nuclear threat capacities, [it
might take hostage one or more states or cities]{.underline}. [If such
an event coincides with already high levels of tension and even military
collisions between the non-nuclear forces of nuclear armed states, then
a non-state nuclear terrorist attack could **impel a nuclear armed state
to escalate its threat** or even military actions against other states,
in the belief that this targeted state may have sponsored the non-state
attack, or was simply the source of the attack]{.underline}, whatever
the declared identity of the attacking non-state entity. This [outcome
could trigger these states to go onto one or more of the pathways to
**inadvertent nuclear war**, especially if the terrorist attack was on a
high value and high risk nuclear facility]{.underline} or involved the
seizure and/or use of fissile material. [Some experts dismiss this
possibility as so remote as to be not worth worrying about]{.underline}.
[Yet the history of nuclear terrorism globally]{.underline} and in the
Northeast Asian region **[suggests otherwise]{.underline}**. Using the
sand castle metaphor, once built on the high tide line, sand castles may
withstand the wind but eventually succumb to the tide once it reaches
the castle---at least once, usually twice a day. Also, theories of
organizational and technological failure point to the coincidence of
[multiple, relatively insignificant driving events that interact or
accumulate in ways that lead the "metasystem" to fail, even if each
individual component of a system works perfectly.]{.underline} Thus,
[the potential catalytic effect of a nuclear terrorist incident is not
that it would of itself lead to a sudden inter-state nuclear war; but
that at a time of crisis when alert levels are already
high]{.underline}, when control systems on nuclear forces have already
shifted from primary emphasis on negative to positive control, when
[decision making is already stressed]{.underline}, when the [potential
for miscalculation is already high]{.underline} due to shows of force
indicating that first-use is nigh, when rhetorical threats promising
annihilation on the one hand, or collapse of morale and weakness on the
other invite counter-vailing threats by nuclear adversaries or their
allies to gain the upper hand in the "contest of resolve," and when
organizational cybernetics may be in play such that purposeful actions
are implemented differently than intended, [then a terrorist nuclear
attack may shift a coincident combination of some or all of these
factors to a threshold level where they **collectively lead to a
first-use decision by one or more nuclear-armed states**.]{.underline}
If the terrorist attack is timed or happens to coincide with high levels
of inter-state tension involving nuclear-armed states, then some or all
of these tendencies will likely be in play anyway---precisely the
concern of those who posit pathways to inadvertent nuclear war as
outlined in section 2 above.

Historically, counterterrorism has largely been reactive, adopting
policies and measures to respond to what violent extremists do. The
purpose of this blog is to argue tha[t as violent extremists innovate,
so should counterterrorism]{.underline} because as Professor Leonard
Weinberg
[noted](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/binaries/content/assets/customsites/perspectives-on-terrorism/2008/issue-9/49-304-1-pb.pdf),
"[Innovative terrorist groups seem to be exceptionally dangerous. Their
innovations are often emulated by other groups -- even ones with other
aims and in other parts of the world."]{.underline} Writing in the late
1980s, Professor Martha Crenshaw
[linked](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402398708437313?journalCode=fjss20)
terrorist innovation to survival as she emphasises that state actors
adapt to the violence. Included in her assessment is the observation
that innovation is not something that all violent extremists do or can
do, which is why some may disappear. Crenshaw was writing in the
pre-social media and fourth technological revolution, which has affected
the process of innovation as nowadays information can and is shared much
faster. Nevertheless, the core of her argument remains as valid today as
when it was first touted. In her work on terrorism and innovation
Professor [Crenshaw
[identified](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402398708437313?journalCode=fjss20)
three types of terrorist innovation: strategic, organisational and
tactical]{.underline}. She conceded that it may be difficult to identify
the [difference between strategic and tactical innovation or distinguish
the source of the innovation according to type, which could become
obvious over time. In the context of terrorism, [strategic
innovation](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/25358/2010_019_Terrorist_WME.pdf;sequence=4)
occurs when the group veers from one strategy to another, which may lead
the group to adopt new ideas, tactics or tools.]{.underline} The revised
strategy need not impact the ideology of the group, which often stays
the same. The group recognises that its current strategy is not getting
it closer to the end-goal, which is why it needs to innovate. Both
al-Qaeda and Islamic State provide good examples of groups that engaged
in strategic innovation as a way to survive and continue. The former
increasingly adopted a
[franchising](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-al-qaeda-franchise-9780190205614?cc=us&lang=en&),
[gradualist](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0030438718300425)
model. This was a strategic shift, as core al-Qaeda moved away from the
direct commission of terrorist attacks to operating as an [ideological
disseminator](https://ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vol1Iss3-Art5.pdf)
marrying the local with the global
([glocalisation](https://www.routledge.com/Glocalization-A-Critical-Introduction-1st-Edition/Roudometof/p/book/9780415722438)).
To achieve this, core al-Qaeda has to adapt its organisation and tactics
to fit with its franchising model, including focusing more on the
non-Western states, as seen for example in Zawahiri's 11 September 2019
[message](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/09/ayman-al-zawahiri-defends-9-11-hijackings-in-anniversary-address.php),
which focused more on those living in Arab-majority countries, calling
on the faithful to attack American targets in their country. The Islamic
State [recruitment
strategy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2016.1237219)
is a good example of strategic innovation, as it applied advertising
techniques to encourage young people to migrate to the so-called
caliphate or commit acts of violence. [Technological changes proved
essential to]{.underline} these [strategic innovations. Organisational
innovation
[refers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17467586.2013.814069)
to changes within the organisational space specifically to changes in
the group's structure and institutions. Organisational innovation is
very much impacted by the environment, specifically effective anti- and
counter-terrorism measures such as decapitation, as groups lose key
strategic and tactical leaders that are not easily
replaceable.]{.underline} Al-Qaeda's founders recognised the need to
form a [durable
organisation](https://www.hudson.org/research/14365-how-al-qaeda-works-the-jihadist-group-s-evolving-organizational-design)
which is why they structured along traditional lines as a top-down,
hierarchical organisation with clear strategic goals that are determined
by the emir, whilst also permitting an element of decentralisation,
giving the locals some operational independence. An important factor in
ensuring al-Qaeda's durability is its [organisation
fluidity](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2013/07/18/global-al-qaeda-affiliates-objectives-and-future-challenges/),
which is dependent on secure communication, which in turn has allowed
Zawahiri to
[reconstitute](https://www.longwarjournal.org/al-qaeda-leaders) the
group's Shura Majilis. [Tactical innovation
[refers](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/25358/2010_019_Terrorist_WME.pdf;sequence=4)
to changes in methods, targeting or operations]{.underline} used by a
terrorist group. [The innovation generally manifests itself through the
acquisition of new weapons]{.underline} or new targets or the
recognition that a tactic no longer works, which is why there is a need
to adapt. [Paul Gill's
study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2016.1237221?journalCode=uter20)
of the Provisional Irish Republican Army highlights how the group
adapted its use of improvised explosive devices. The change also altered
perception about the group which before the change in tactic was
described as 'clumsy', 'disorganised,' 'unimaginative' to one that
commentators described as professional. Another [example is the usage of
drones, which states initially held a monopoly over, but over time
non-state actors sought to acquire this tool]{.underline} ([for
example](https://ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nexus-of-Emerging-Technologies.pdf)
Israel had used drones in the 1980s in Lebanon, but by 1993 Aum
Shinrikyo sought to acquire this tool. Ten years later, [Hezbollah used
a surveillance drone]{.underline} and by the mid-2010s, [Islamic State
had used a quadcopter]{.underline} with an explosive payload). This type
of innovation is generally linked to a change within the strategic
thinking, although tactical innovation is not necessarily reliant on
strategic innovation. It is in the tactical sector that there has been a
fair amount of innovation especially as [the technological revolution
has made]{.underline} communication and therefore the [sharing of ideas
and information easier and faster]{.underline}. Research has highlighted
how effective Islamic State has been in adapting, i.e. innovating, its
communication strategy as states and companies develop a mechanism to
hinder the group's message. For example, when Twitter began removing the
Islamic State official media account, al-I'tisam, Islamic State's main
distribution unit adapted, using variations on its name when creating
new Twitter handles to come back to the platform. As Twitter became
better at shutting down the al-I'tisam account, Islamic State created a
new methodology for distribution, referred by some as the "centralised
decentralisation", allowing it to create official and unofficial
dissemination accounts (some were linked to the group and others were
managed by others who may not have had direct or even indirect links to
Islamic State but supported the group's agenda). Through this system,
Islamic State was able to continue to disseminate propaganda material
because when one account was taken down, others remained operational,
tweeting whenever the new account of the one taken down was back online
using an alternative handle. Another innovative way Islamic State has
sought to promote its message and to recruit is through [video
games](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09557571.2014.960508).
Islamic State was not the first to use this medium, Hezbollah for
example released a video game, Special Force, in 2003, in which the
player fights against Israel. The game includes real battle fought
between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon and the game itself is
structured to include a
[narrative](https://gnet-research.org/2020/04/03/war-isnt-hell-its-entertainment-the-potential-role-of-video-games-in-radicalisation-processes/)
that the designers constructed, aimed at generating a new moral reality
as much as the construction of heroes and villains. Notably, recognising
that creating games from scratch is challenging, they are opting to
undertake
[gamification](https://www.techagainstterrorism.fm/how-are-terrorists-and-violent-extremists-using-gamification/),
whether as a bottom-up or a top-down process. Conclusion
[Innovation]{.underline}, whether strategic, tactical, or organisational
[is a complex and yet a crucial process]{.underline}, as [without it,
violent extremists become susceptible to extermination]{.underline} or
irrelevancy, as states ada[pt. When it comes to innovation, violent
extremists are limited by their ideology, availability of resources, and
a willingness to change. Currently, many Salafi-jihadi groups are
engaged in strategic reassessment as they consider how to proceed with
their campaign. This may explain the lull in terrorist
attacks]{.underline} (especially against western targets).
[Nevertheless, these individuals are imaginative, technically savvy, and
determined and they bank on]{.underline} the fact that many
[policymakers]{.underline} suffer from what is best described as a
'[failure of imagination']{.underline}. Moreover, as Adam Dolnik had
shown in his important
[research](https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Terrorist-Innovation-Technology-Tactics-and-Global-Trends/Dolnik/p/book/9780415545167)
on terrorist and innovation, [groups whose ideology centres on
inflicting mass casualties and]{.underline} who want to undertake
[spectacular events tend to be more innovative]{.underline}. This is
very true for most if not all Salafi-jihadi and extreme violent
right-wing actors.

[ISIS: Down but Not Out While there is little doubt that ISIS had by the
summer of 2019 lost control over most, if not all, of its territorial
"caliphate," it is also clear that the group has not been fully
defeated, strategically or militarily. In the past two years we have
seen ISIS once again become an insurgency group engaged in hit-and-run
tactics and brutal terrorist attacks]{.underline} not only around the
globe but also in areas supposedly liberated by U.S.-led coalition

[Robots]{.underline} won't bring perfection to the use of force, but
they can [reduce mistakes, increase precision and lower overall
destruction compared with their human counterparts.]{.underline} Some
worry that autonomous weapons might prompt leaders to turn more readily
to conflict. Bu[**t decisions about war and peace have much more to do
with political leaders** and their choices than with the technology
available to them.]{.underline} Presidents George W. Bush and Barack
Obama had roughly the same military at their disposal, but they used it
very differently. [The greater risk today isn't that the U.S. will
intervene impulsively but that it won't intervene at all, allowing
serious challenges to intensify. **Robotic weapons** can **ease the
dilemma**]{.underline}. In World War II, the Allies leveled cities, at
enormous human cost, to destroy Axis transportation and manufacturing
facilities. [**Drones** today can strike an arms factory, **pick off
terrorists** or **destroy nuclear-weapons sites while leaving
neighboring structures and civilians untouched.** Robotic weapons can
reduce the costs that discourage the U.S. and its allies from
intervening in humanitarian disasters or civil wars.]{.underline} Even
if we shared the apocalyptic worries of Mr. Musk and his allies, it
isn't at all clear that arms control could begin to deal with the
problem. [Arms control has mostly failed to prevent weapons innovation,
from the crossbow to the nuclear bomb. Nations have had more success in
imposing rules of warfare, especially to protect civilians, than in
restricting specific weapons. Robotics and AI will be even harder to
control. Countries already hide their nuclear-weapons programs behind
claims of scientific research or energy production. The technology
involved in autonomous weapons is a classic instance of "dual use," with
obvious peaceful applications.]{.underline} The same technology that can
produce a self-driving car can also drive an autonomous tank. A drone
can just as easily deliver a bomb as a box from Amazon . [**A ban on
military development would be almost impossible to verify.** Such limits
would also be a serious handicap for the U.S.]{.underline} The new
technology is most likely to benefit countries with the technical
dynamism and the innovative drive to deploy them broadly. [Restraining
their development seems likely to cancel an American advantage over
our]{.underline} authoritarian rivals and [terrorist
enemies.]{.underline} Tech executives may worry that consumers will come
to associate their products with war. But [responsible governments buy
weapons and wage wars for good reasons, such as self-defense, coming to
the assistance of allies, pursuing terrorists and alleviating
humanitarian disasters.]{.underline} If force is misused, we should
blame our elected leaders, not the weapons[.]{.underline}

#### LAWs are crucial for counter-terrorism efforts

In a more practical sense, applied science, and particularly [artificial
intelligence, may provide more immediate tactical benefits. Enter killer
robots, artificially intelligent lethal machines capable of selecting
and engaging targets without human intervention.]{.underline} Killer
robots have received considerable bad press in recent months. Many
scientists, nongovernmental organizations, and states have called for a
preemptive ban on their development and eventual use on the battlefield.
They fear that lethal autonomous robots may increase the likelihood of
war and could one day pose an existential threat to humankind. This
anxiety is nothing new. In an article published in 1863 entitled "Darwin
among the machines," English writer Samuel Butler argued that the "the
machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its
inhabitants." The author recommended that as a precaution, mankind
should return to the "primeval condition of the race." Technophobic--or
perhaps neophobic, the aversion to all things new--sentiments have ebbed
and flowed throughout history, peaking at times when revolutionary
technologies were introduced in society. Seventeenth century Japan
rejected the use of firearms, then an "advanced military technology."
Nineteenth century England grappled with the Luddites, who smashed
mechanical looms for fear of putting people out of work. In many ways,
artificial intelligence is different because it raises unique issues
about control, legitimacy, and accountability. But could the pessimistic
prognoses about killer robots miss the forest for the trees? [What if
robots were used as partners of peace and promoters of global order and
justice? Or, importantly, as terrorist hunters? The war on ISIS shows no
end in sight. The group's unrestrained campaign of violence in Iraq and
Syria continues to reveal new shades of brutality. Its disregard for the
well-being of humanity is unrivaled in the 21st century. I say
"humanity" because ISIS' political war is costing the lives of the
innocent by using tactics that are perhaps best suited to earlier
iterations of the human race.]{.underline} Rape, beheadings, torture.
Repeat. But I could just as well say that the group has no respect for
the "humanities," the branch of human learning that studies human
culture. ISIS' iconoclastic crusade against Syrian and Iraqi cultural
heritage is well documented, both by the group itself and the
international community. The group's obliteration of numerous World
Heritage Sites, including the recent destruction of the Baalshamin
temple in Palmyra, and of priceless cultural artifacts around the region
are part of a systematic campaign to enforce their puritanical
interpretation of Islam. For ISIS, cultural cleansing is necessary to
wipe the slate clean and build a caliphate free from idolatry. As a
commercial hub linking the Far East with the Roman Empire, the city of
Palmyra marked "the crossroads of several civilizations in the ancient
world." Its destruction has been condemned as a "war crime" by UNESCO.
Irina Bokova, UNESCO's chief, deplored these actions as the "most
brutal, systematic" destruction of cultural heritage since World War II.

a reminder of how the web of human relations intersect and knowledge
flows interact[. This is what makes ISIS particularly dangerous: not
only are they murdering members of communities but also destroying the
cultural foundations upon which such communities were
built.]{.underline} Culture is not some whimsical collection of pretty
paintings and table manners; it is a reflection and embodiment of social
identity. Through language, art, music, knowledge, and religion we
continuously give meaning to our social existence. [By destroying these
cultural anchors, ISIS is now on an ideological path that would make
Hitler and Malan throw evil nods of approval.]{.underline} Earlier this
year, Dario Franceschini, Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and
Tourism, called for the formation of a UN military force to protect the
world's cultural heritage. [Killer robots would be particularly useful
against groups like ISIS, where political costs are too high for major
military powers to put boots on the ground, and political momentum too
low to justify human military intervention to protect sites of cultural
importance. In addition to using robots offensively to fight terrorists,
robots could be used to promote peaceful objectives, such as protecting
humanitarian convoys, refugee camps, schools, hospitals, and
museums.]{.underline} First iterations will likely be semi-autonomous,
featuring some level of human supervision and control[. Once the
technology is sufficiently capable of meeting the stringent standards of
international humanitarian law, such as discriminating between
combatants and civilians, as well as operational safety, such as
recognizing friendly fire, greater autonomy may be delegated to the
robot.]{.underline} ISIS may be defeated before killer robots ever see
the light of day. But [the value of autonomous lethal technology,
operating within legal and morally sound grounds, cannot be
underestimated to solve global security problems.]{.underline}
Scientific advancements--and its evolving creations, like artificial
intelligence--must be given serious thought as a bridge to peace, or at
the very least as a [weapon to defeat terror.]{.underline}

#### LAWs are key to counter-terrorism

// st

As early as 2009[, organisations began calling for a pre-emptive ban on
killer robots]{.underline}, when the International Committee for Robot
Arms Control (ICRAC), founded by roboticists, ethicists, and others,
issued a call to stop AI research that could lead to development of
killer robots. Five years later, the European Parliament passed a
resolution calling for a ban after more than 20 Nobel Peace Laureates
issued a statement in favour of banning the robot. In the Third
Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) held in Geneva from April 11 to
15, 2015, two high-ranking UN experts issued a report to the Human
Rights Council calling for a moratorium on autonomous killer robots. By
July 2015, the Future of Life Institute issued an open letter which more
than 1,000 AI experts signed supporting a prohibition. Today, there is
an active Human Rights Watch campaign to ban the development and use of
these technologies. But are they fighting to turn back time? In 1863,
English author Samuel Butler published an article, "Darwin among the
machines," arguing that "the machines will hold the real supremacy over
the world and its inhabitants," and further arguing that as a
precaution, humans should return to the "primeval condition of the
race." [Earlier, the Luddites ravaged English factories, destroying
machines they feared were threatening their jobs.]{.underline} In the
17th century, during a period of intense seclusion, the Japanese went so
far as to outlaw the use of firearms, which had been introduced into the
country as early as 1270 from China, only to resume their use during the
conflicts of the mid-1800s. [Over the past few days, events in the
United States demonstrate the short-sightedness of these actions while
illustrating the benefits of the use of robots for law enforcement.
After an intensive 45-minute shootout in Dallas, Texas, USA, two police
officers lay dead and three others would die within hours from massive
injuries received at the outset. An assassin was targeting police
officers and terrorising a major US city.]{.underline} Police began
negotiating with the sniper to no avail. After two-hours of intensive
negotiations, the Dallas chief of police gave an order to neutralise the
suspect by any means without risking more officer's lives. The plan was
ingenious. [The SWAT team called upon the RemotecAndrox Mark V A-1
robot, manufactured by Northrup Gruman, to deliver a pound of high
explosive C-4 directly against a wall on the second floor of the
building behind which the sniper was cowered. The robot delivered its
payload, completing its mission with only minor damage after the
explosive charge ripped a hole in the wall, fragmenting the sniper. This
ended the standoff and officially introduced robots as an anti-terrorist
weapon.]{.underline} Robots can be mounted with a variety of sensors and
tools for law enforcement. The A-1 generally carries a flashbang, a
device that emits a bright light and loud sound to stun criminals. These
robots can also place an explosive near a bomb in order to disarm it
through the explosive discharge. But there are far more uses for the
robot, as outlined on Northrup Grumman's Remotec website based upon an
assortment of accessories available. The robot can be affixed with a
modified 12 gauge shotgun, which can also be used as a breaching tool; a
gas can dispenser mount; a window breaker, a cable cutter; a variety of
drills and saws, as well as real time x-ray machines, or mounts for the
weapons launcher. Innovative new uses Interestingly, Northrup Grumman
lists the Remotec Androx Mark V A-1 robot as, "ready to handle any
situation at a moment's notice." Thankfully it was ready when called
upon. [Police departments across the United States, and around the
world, are procuring the next generation of robots to make law
enforcement safer, as criminals and terrorist employ innovative new uses
for common items, such as passenger aircraft and
explosives.]{.underline} One of the largest robots currently in the
field is the BatCat---a 39,000-pound remote controlled vehicle used to
lift cars, and tear into buildings, or barricaded areas. The BatCat
(Bomb Assault Tactical Control Assessment Tool) is built upon
Caterpillar's Telehandler base and comes equipped with claw, forklift,
and/or bucket in order to make a dynamic entry or respond to improvised
explosive devices on vehicles. On the small end is the Recon Robotics
Throwbot, which can run slightly ahead of a clearing team to provide
valuable intelligence and pictures of potential threats. Weighing just
1.2 pounds, Throwbot can be thrown up to 120 feet (36m) in front of a
police team. Directed by an operator receiving audio and video, Throwbot
can also transmit infrared optical data of its surroundings. [Autonomous
and semi-autonomous robots are already involved in a multitude of
missions against terrorists and criminals alike. Our safety, as well as
that of the men and women who serve us in law enforcement, depends even
more on the tools available to outwit the evil that surrounds
us.]{.underline} While we accept the fact that technology must advance,
we also must accept that all technologies can be used for both good and
evil. We are a long way from autonomous robots using artificial
intelligence to destroy humankind. At Florida International University
(FIU) Discovery Lab, we are exploring robots for many real-time
applications.

Secondly, [the international community could look to ban AI use in the
military]{.underline} through an international treaty sanctioned by the
United Nations. This has been the strategy pursued by activist groups
such as the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, while leading artificial
intelligence researchers and scientific commentators have published open
letters warning of the risk of weaponized AI. [That said, great powers
are not likely to refrain from AI weapons development, and a ban might
outlaw positive uses of militarized AI. The international community
could also look to stigmatize, or delegitimize,]{.underline} weaponized
AI and [lethal autonomous weapons sufficiently to deter terrorist use.

improvise and innovate, and effective]{.underline} at doing so, [there

Unmanned Predator and Reaper drones rove the skies above the Middle East
and Africa. They hover over a target for days and launch Hellfire
missiles on a moment's notice. Robots on the battlefield below breach
doors in house-to-house searches and explode improvised explosive
devices common in wars with terrorists or resistance fighters. [Future
advances will bring armed sentry robots, autonomous armored vehicles,
and automatic missile and artillery fire.]{.underline} On the sea, X-47
aerial drones take off and land on aircraft carriers while others
already perform strike and reconnaissance missions. Soon, unmanned
surface combat vessels may deploy close to shore, and others may track
enemy submarines beneath the waves. [Combat is not just moving toward
the robotic; it is also becoming ethereal]{.underline}.1 During its 2008
Georgia incursion, Russia became the first nation to deploy cyberattacks
on enemy command, control, and communication systems to augment a ground
invasion.2 To delay the Iranian nuclear program, the United States and
Israel allegedly deployed the Stuxnet virus to damage centrifuges
engaged in uranium enrichment.3 China has stolen large databases of U.S.
government personnel information in addition to penetrating the networks
of U.S. defense contractors, airlines, and technology companies.4
Russia, meanwhile, has allegedly hacked into databases and email systems
of the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, along with those of the
Democratic National Committee and the campaign of presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton.5 These examples illustrate the dramatic advances in
weapon technology over the last two decades, which observers sometimes
refer to as the "revolution in military affairs."6 [The United States
now fields thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for both
reconnaissance and armed attacks. Combined with stealth technology,
these drones allow the United States and other nations to gather
intelligence around the clock and launch immediate attacks in trouble
spots around the world. In the future, the most advanced ground and
sea-based armed forces will employ remote-controlled units, such as
sentries, light armor, and littoral naval vessels. Advances in missile
technology and precision targeting will allow the United States to field
a conventional global-strike capability that can hit any target in the
world within an hour.]{.underline} Some experts even anticipate
autonomous weapons systems that militaries can program for action
independent of direct human controllers. [The revolution in military
affairs may reduce the destruction of war. A nation will place fewer
soldiers in harm's way when remote-controlled combatants are available.
Precision-guided weapons and clearer real-time intelligence will inflict
less death and destruction on soldiers and military assets. With drones
available, for example, nations will no longer need to resort to World
War II or Vietnam-era bombing runs to destroy arms factories or oil
installations.]{.underline} Precision-strike technology may also shorten
war by targeting an opponent's leadership and strategic vulnerabilities,
as it did with the one hundred-hour Persian Gulf War of 1991 and the
lightning-quick invasion of Iraq in 2003. [Future technology could also
reduce harm to civilians---one of the central principles of the laws of
war---by tightly concentrating the use of force on military targets.
Technology will contribute to changes in tactics that are already
blurring our understanding of what constitutes "war." While modern war
has concentrated highly destructive forces on discrete battlefields, new
technology may disperse less destructive forces across the globe. For
one, technology has played a central role in the rise of nonstate
actors. The September 11, 2001, attacks and the evolving sophistication
of terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) show
that states no longer have a monopoly on international violence that can
rise to the level of armed conflict. Nations have responded to
unconventional attacks by nonstate actors with a mixture of armed force,
economic sanctions, and criminal prosecution, leaving unclear where law
enforcement ends and armed conflict begins. Technology allows nations to
gain better intelligence on these groups and attack them without
deploying large conventional forces. Moreover, high-tech surveillance
and strike systems allow nations to identify enemy groups that hide
among civilians, follow a decentralized command structure, and attack
civilian targets as often as military targets]{.underline}. While
technology has contributed to the effective reach of nonstate terrorist
groups, it has also assisted nations in responding to them both
domestically and abroad. Critics, however, worry that advances in
weapons could increase conflict by making war easier to initiate. If a
nation can simply press a button and destroy a target or cripple enemy
infrastructure without risking its own personnel, it will choose a
military response more often than it should. United Nations officials
give voice to these growing worries. "The expansive use of armed drones
by the first States to acquire them, if not challenged, can do
structural damage to the cornerstones of international security and set
precedents that undermine the protection of life across the globe in the
longer term," declares Christof Heyns, the UN's Special Rapporteur on
Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions.7 States can use drones
and other technology, such as cyberweapons, to launch attacks far from
conventional battlefields in ways that escape immediate detection, and
perhaps even responsibility. Ultimately, pinpoint strikes and
cyberattacks will continue to blur any clear line between war and peace.
Cyberwarfare further blurs this line. Internet attacks can cause
real-world destruction and harm, or they can simply interfere with
another nation's communications, financial, or information networks. A
cyberattack, for example, could cause a flood by disabling the control
mechanisms for a dam or trigger an explosion by forcing a power plant to
malfunction. As Russia demonstrated in its invasions of Georgia in 2008
and Ukraine in 2014, nations can also launch cyberattacks as part of an
electronic warfare campaign to support a conventional armed attack.8
They can use cyberweapons in place of conventional weapons to commit
sabotage, such as the Stuxnet virus. Or governments can use the Internet
to steal significant military or intelligence information, such as
weapons designs or strategic plans, which appears to be occurring with
increasing frequency between the United States and China. "China is
using its cyber capabilities to support intelligence collection against
the U.S. diplomatic, economic, and defense industrial base sectors that
support U.S. national defense programs," the U.S. Defense Department
stated in a 2016 report to Congress.9 "The accesses and skills required
for these intrusions are similar to those necessary to conduct cyber
attacks."10 The anonymity of cyberattacks may prevent open armed
conflict because targeted nations will not know against whom to
retaliate. Indeed, nations have been uncertain about their responses to
robotic and cyberwarfare attacks. They sometimes treat them as a form of
espionage or covert action, refusing to consider the resulting damage as
an act of war. China's theft of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
database did not prompt an official use of U.S. force, nor did North
Korea's hacking of Sony's electronic files. Iran took no overt military
response to the Stuxnet virus. [American drones execute dozens of
strikes in countries, such as Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan,
without sparking any military reaction. And yet, use of these weapons in
other contexts would likely start an armed conflict]{.underline}.
Cyberattacks to disable military units or critical civilian networks, or
to augment a broader military offensive, would surely constitute acts of
war, as would the use of robots and drones to harm people or real
property. Robotics and cyberweapons could also exert force that does not
necessarily kill or destroy tangible objects, but fall somewhere in
between the line between domestic crime and an act of war. Governments
and scholars are not always clear about when such attacks meet the legal
standards for an armed attack or something less. For example, the new
United States Law of War Manual, issued by the Department of Defense in
2015, declares that the existing laws of war should apply to what it
calls "cyber operations."11 But it then concedes that the rules here are
"not well-settled" and are "likely to continue to develop."12 The United
States even takes the position that it may not have a position, as the
manual declares that it does not "preclude the \[Defense\] Department
from subsequently changing its interpretation of the law."13 This Essay
argues that efforts to constrain new military technologies with ex ante
per se rules, rather than ex post reasonable regulation, are not only
doomed, but dangerous. History is littered with proposals to stop
advances in weapons. Medieval leaders tried to ban crossbows, early
artillery, and firearms because they violated chivalry and honor.14
During World War I, nations argued over whether international law
prohibited airplanes from bombing targets or submarines from sinking
ships without warning.15 But by the end of World War II, the United
States used atomic bombs to end the war against Japan.16 International
agreements, such as the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact,
failed to stop the Axis. [History tells us that restraint arrives
through deterrence, not law or morality]{.underline}. In World War II,
the Allies and Axis stockpiled ample arsenals of chemical weapons, but
did not use them for fear of retaliation.17 During the Cold War,
mutually assured destruction ultimately led both superpowers to agree to
limits on, and then reductions of, nuclear weapons. International law,
rightly understood, does not prohibit the use of these new weapons. The
United States will not stop China from stealing its government personnel
databases by appealing to common values, but by deploying equally
effective offensive and defensive cyber weapons. Europeans will not
force the United States to limit its drone campaign against terrorist
leaders through legal arguments, but they could pressure Washington by
refusing to cooperate with intelligence sharing and joint operations. In
fact, [limiting, and especially prohibiting, the use of robotic and
cyber weapons could have perverse effects on the very goals of
international law. If nations cannot employ new, more precise weapons,
they will have to resort to traditional conventional warfare, using
human soldiers and pilots in larger numbers with more destructive
weapons.]{.underline} In addition to causing greater destruction, limits
on new weapons will discourage nations from using force when the
international system needs it most: to stop terrorism, human rights
disasters, nuclear proliferation, and aggression. Perversely[, banning
new weapons out of a vague desire to make war harder to start will make
war more destructive and harmful to the innocent---the very antithesis
of the laws of war.]{.underline}

[Terrorist Acquisition of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Is Realistic The
proliferation of artificial intelligence and killer robot technology to
terrorist organizations is realistic and likely to occur through three
avenues --- internal development, sales, and leaks. Firstly, modern
terrorist organizations have advanced scientific and engineering
departments, and actively seek out skilled scientists]{.underline} for
recruitment. [ISIL]{.underline}, for example, [has appealed for
[scientists to trek to the
caliphate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/use-of-weaponized-drones-by-isis-spurs-terrorism-fears/2017/02/21/9d83d51e-f382-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html?utm_term=.9047622d3994)
to work on drone and AI technology. The individual technologies behind
swarming killer robots]{.underline} --- including unmanned aerial
vehicles, facial recognition, and machine-to-machine communication ---
[already exist, and have been adapted by terrorist
organizations]{.underline} for other means. [According to a French
defense industry
executive,](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42153140) "[the
technological challenge of scaling it up]{.underline} to swarms and
things like that [doesn't need any inventive step. It's just a question
of time and scale]{.underline} and I think [that's an absolute
certainty]{.underline} that we should worry about." Secondly,
[autonomous weapons tech]{.underline}nology [will]{.underline} likely
[[proliferate through
sales](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/05/terrorists-are-going-use-artificial-intelligence/147944/).]{.underline}
Because AI research is led by private firms, [advanced AI technology
will be publicly sold on the open market]{.underline}. As Michael
Horowitz
[argues](https://thebulletin.org/who%E2%80%99ll-want-artificially-intelligent-weapons-isis-democracies-or-autocracies9692),
"[militant groups]{.underline} and less-capable states [may already have
what they need]{.underline} to produce some simple autonomous weapon
systems, and that capability is likely to spread even further for purely
commercial reasons." The current framework controlling high-tech weapons
proliferation --- the Wassenaar Arrangement and Missile Technology
Control Regime --- is voluntary, and is constantly tested by great-power
weapons development. Given interest in developing AI-guided weapons,
this seems unlikely to change. Ultimately, as AI expert Toby Walsh
[notes](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/06/its-not-too-late-to-save-the-world-from-killer-robots),
the world's [weapons companies]{.underline} can, and [will]{.underline},
"make a killing (pun very much intended) [selling autonomous weapons to
all sides of every conflict." Finally, autonomous weapons technology is
likely to leak. Innovation in the AI field is led by the private sector,
not the military]{.underline}, because of the myriad commercial
applications of the technology. [This will make it]{.underline} [more
difficult to contain the
technology](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42153140), and [prevent
it from proliferating to nonstate actors]{.underline}. [Perhaps the
starkest
warning](https://www.amazon.com/Army-None-Autonomous-Weapons-Future/dp/0393608980)
has been issued by Paul Scharre, a former U.S. defense officia[l: "We
are entering a world where the technology to build lethal autonomous
weapons is available not only to nation-states but to individuals as
well. That world is not in the distant future. It's already
here."]{.underline}

#### Terrorists want LAWS -- cost, traceability, and lethality

**Ware 19 \[Jacob Ware (research associate at the Council on Foreign
Relations), 9-24-2019, \"Terrorist Groups, Artificial Intelligence, and
Killer Drones,\" War on the Rocks,**
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/terrorist-groups-artificial-intelligence-and-killer-drones/>**\]
// st**

[Terrorist groups will be interested in]{.underline} artificial
intelligence and [lethal autonomous weapons for]{.underline} three
reasons --- [cost, traceability, and effectiveness.]{.underline}
Firstly, [killer robots are likely to be [extremely
cheap](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18691459/killer-robots-lethal-autonomous-weapons-ai-war),]{.underline}
while still maintaining lethality. Experts agree that
[l]{.underline}ethal [a]{.underline}utonomous
[w]{.underline}eapon[s]{.underline}, once fully developed, [will provide
a cost-effective alternative]{.underline} to terrorist groups looking to
maximize damage, with Tegmark [arguing
that](https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598)
"[small]{.underline} AI-powered killer [drones are likely to cost little
more than a smartphone]{.underline}." Additionally, [killer robots will
minimize the human investment required]{.underline} for terrorist
attacks, [with scholars arguing
that](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/3d82daa4-97fe-4096-9c6b-376b92c619de/downloads/1c6q2kc4v_50335.pdf)
"greater degrees of autonomy enable a greater amount of damage to be
done by a single person." Artificial intelligence could make terrorist
activity cheaper financially and in terms of human capital, lowering the
organizational costs required to commit attacks. Secondly, [using
autonomous weapons will reduce the trace left by
terrorists.]{.underline} A large number of [munitions could be
launched]{.underline} --- and a large amount of damage done --- by a
small number of people operating [at considerable distance from the
target]{.underline}, reducing the signature left behind. [In Tegmark's
words](https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598),
for "a terrorist wanting to assassinate a politician ... all they need
to do is upload their target's photo and address into the killer robot:
it can then fly to the destination, identify and eliminate the person,
and self-destruct to ensure nobody knows who was responsible." With
autonomous weapons technology, [terrorist groups will be able to launch
increasingly complex attacks, and]{.underline}, when they want to,
[escape without detection.]{.underline} Finally, [killer robots
could]{.underline} reduce, if not [eliminate, the]{.underline} physical
costs and [dangers of terrorism, rendering the operative
"]{.underline}[essentially
invulnerable.](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/inside-the-chilling-proliferation-of-artificially-intelligent-drones/)"
Raising the possibility of "fly and forget" missions, lethal autonomous
weapons might simply be deployed toward a target, and engage that target
without further human intervention. As P. W. Singer
[noted](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-robotics-revolution/) in
2012, "[one \[will\] not have to be suicidal to carry out
attacks]{.underline} that previously might have required one to be so.
This allows new players into the game, making al-Qaeda 2.0 and the
next-generation version of the Unabomber or Timothy McVeigh far more
lethal." Additionally, [lethal autonomous weapons could potentially
reduce human aversion to killing, making terrorism even more palatable
as a tactic for political groups.]{.underline} According to the
aforementioned [February 2018
report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/3d82daa4-97fe-4096-9c6b-376b92c619de/downloads/1c6q2kc4v_50335.pdf),
"[AI systems can allow]{.underline} the actors who would otherwise be
performing the tasks to retain their anonymity and experience a
[greater]{.underline} degree of [psychological distance
from]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} they impact"; [this
would]{.underline} not only improve a terrorist's chances of escape, as
mentioned, but reduce or even [eliminate the moral or psychological
barriers to murder.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear terror leads to extinction

To an increasing extent, [people are congregating in the world's great
urban centers, creating megacities with populations exceeding 10 million
individuals]{.underline}. At the same time, [advanced technology has
designed nuclear explosives of such small size they can be easily
transported in a car]{.underline}, small plane or boat [to the heart of
a city]{.underline}. We demonstrate here that [a single detonation in
the 15 kiloton range can produce urban fatalities approaching one
million]{.underline} in some cases, [and casualties exceeding one
million]{.underline}. Thousands of small weapons still exist in the
arsenals of the U.S. and Russia, and there are at least six other
countries with substantial nuclear weapons inventories. In all,
thirty-three countries control sufficient amounts of highly enriched
uranium or plutonium to assemble nuclear explosives. A conflict between
any of these countries involving 50-100 weapons with yields of 15 kt has
the potential to create fatalities rivaling those of the Second World
War. Moreover, [even a single surface nuclear explosion]{.underline}, or
an air burst in rainy conditions, [in a city center is likely to cause
the entire metropolitan area to be abandoned at least for
decades]{.underline} owing to infrastructure damage and radioactive
contamination. As the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in Louisiana
suggests, [the economic consequences of even a localized nuclear
catastrophe would most likely have severe national and **international
economic consequences**]{.underline}. Striking effects result even from
relatively small nuclear attacks because low yield detonations are most
effective against city centers where business and social activity as
well as population are concentrated. Rogue nations and **[terrorists
would be most likely to strike there]{.underline}**. Accordingly, an
organized [attack on the U.S. by a small nuclear state, or
terrorists]{.underline} supported by such a state, **[could generate
casualties comparable to those]{.underline}** once **[predicted for a
full-scale nuclear "counterforce" exchange in a superpower
conflict]{.underline}**. Remarkably, the [estimated quantities of smoke
generated by attacks totaling about one megaton of nuclear explosives
**could lead to significant global climate perturbations**]{.underline}
(Robock et al., 2007). While we did not extend our casualty and damage
predictions to include potential medical, social or economic impacts
following the initial explosions, such analyses have been performed in
the past for large-scale nuclear war scenarios (Harwell and Hutchinson,
1985). Such a study should be carried out as well for the present
scenarios and physical outcomes.

#### Terrorism leads to extinction

University), "Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios
and Related Hazards,"

Risks in this sixth category are a recent phenomenon. This is part of
the reason why it is useful to distinguish them from other risks. [We
have not evolved mechanisms, either biologically or culturally, for
managing such risks.]{.underline} Our intuitions and coping strategies
have been shaped by our long experience with risks such as dangerous
animals, hostile individuals or tribes, poisonous foods, automobile
accidents, Chernobyl, Bhopal, volcano eruptions, earthquakes, draughts,
World War I, World War II, epidemics of influenza, smallpox, black
plague, and AIDS. These types of disasters have occurred many times and
our cultural attitudes towards risk have been shaped by trial-and-error
in managing such hazards. But tragic as such events are to the people
immediately affected, in the big picture of things -- from the
perspective of humankind as a whole -- even the worst of these
catastrophes are mere ripples on the surface of the great sea of life.
They haven't significantly affected the total amount of human suffering
or happiness or determined the long-term fate of our species. With the
exception of a species-destroying comet or asteroid impact (an extremely
rare occurrence), there were probably no significant existential risks
in human history until the mid-twentieth century, and certainly none
that it was within our power to do something about. The first manmade
existential risk was the inaugural detonation of an atomic bomb. At the
time, there was some concern that the explosion might start a runaway
chain-reaction by "igniting" the atmosphere. Although we now know that
such an outcome was physically impossible, it qualifies as an
existential risk that was present at the time. For there to be a risk,
given the knowledge and understanding available, [it suffices that there
is some subjective probability of an adverse outcome, even if it later
turns out that objectively there was no chance of something bad
happening. If we don't know whether something is objectively risky or
not, then it is risky in the subjective sense]{.underline}. The
subjective sense is of course what we must base our decisions
on.[\[2\]](http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html#_ftn2) At
any given time we must use our best current subjective estimate of what
the objective risk factors
are.[\[3\]](http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html#_ftn3) [A
much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear
arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a
possibility with both a substantial probability and with
consequences]{.underline} that might have been persistent enough to
qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best
acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear
Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or
permanently destroy human
civilization.[\[4\]](http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html#_ftn4) 
Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a
future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also
a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals.
Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan
for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or
thwart humankind's potential permanently. Such a war might however be a
local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted.
Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or
asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will
encounter in the 21st century. The special nature of the challenges
posed by existential risks is illustrated by the following points: [ Our
approach to existential risks cannot be one of trial-and-error. There is
no opportunity to learn from errors]{.underline}. The reactive approach
-- see what happens, limit damages, and learn from experience -- is
unworkable. Rather, [we must take a proactive approach. This
requires foresight to anticipate new types of threats and a willingness
to take decisive preventive action and to bear the costs]{.underline}
(moral and economic) of such actions. [** **We cannot necessarily rely
on the institutions, moral norms, social attitudes or national security
policies that developed from our experience with managing other sorts of
risks. Existential risks are a differen]{.underline}t kind of beast. We
might find it hard to take them as seriously as we should simply because
we have never yet witnessed such
disasters.[\[5\]](http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html#_ftn5) Our
collective fear-response is likely ill calibrated to the magnitude of
threat.         Reductions in existential risks are global public
goods \[13\] and may therefore be undersupplied by the market \[14\].
Existential risks are a menace for everybody and may require acting on
the international plane. Respect for national sovereignty is not a
legitimate excuse for failing to take countermeasures against a major
existential risk.         [If we take into account the welfare of
future generations, the harm done by existential risks is multiplied by
another factor, the size of which depends on whether and how much we
discount future benefits]{.underline} \[15,16\]. In view of its
undeniable importance, it is surprising how little systematic work has
been done in this area. Part of the explanation may be that many of the
gravest risks stem (as we shall see) from anticipated future
technologies that we have only recently begun to understand. Another
part of the explanation may be the unavoidably interdisciplinary and
speculative nature of the subject. And in part [the neglect may also be
attributable to an aversion against thinking seriously about a
depressing topic. The point, however, is not to wallow in gloom and doom
but simply to take a sober look at what could go wrong so we can create
responsible strategies for improving our chances of survival. In order
to do that, we need to know where to focus our efforts. ]{.underline}

they will not succeed in the future.]{.underline} Making matters worse,
[there is evidence of an **illicit market** for nuclear weapons-usable
materials]{.underline}. **[There are sellers in search of potential
buyers]{.underline}**, as shown [by the dismantlement of a nuclear
smuggling network in Moldova in 2015]{.underline}. [There]{.underline}
certainly [are **plenty of sites** from which to obtain nuclear
material.]{.underline} According to the 2016 Nuclear Security Index by
the Nuclear Threat Initiative, [24 countries still host inventories of
nuclear weapons-usable materials]{.underline}, stored in facilities with
different degrees of security. And in terms of risk, [it is not
necessary for a given country to possess nuclear weapons, weapons-usable
materials, or nuclear facilities for it to be useful to nuclear
terrorists]{.underline}: **[Structural and institutional
weaknesses]{.underline}** in a country may [make it favorable for the
illicit trade of materials]{.underline}. [**Permeable boundaries, high
levels of corruption, weaknesses in judicial systems, and consequent
impunity** may give rise to a series of transactions]{.underline} and
other events, [which could end in a nuclear attack]{.underline}. The
truth is that, at this stage, [**no country** in possession of nuclear
weapons or weapons-usable materials can guarantee their full protection
against nuclear terrorism]{.underline} or nuclear smuggling. Because [we
live in a world of growing insecurity, where explicit and tacit
agreements between the relevant powers]{.underline} -- which upheld
global stability during the post- Cold War -- [are giving way to
increasing mistrust and hostility,]{.underline} a question arises: [How
would our lives be affected if a current terrorist group]{.underline}
such as the Islamic State (ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the future,
[succeed in evolving from today's]{.underline} Manchester style
"[low-tech" attacks to a "high-tech" one, involving **a nuclear bomb,
detonated in a capital city,**]{.underline} anywhere in the world? We
attempted to answer this question in a report developed by a high-level
multidisciplinary expert group convened by the NPSGlobal Foundation for
the Latin American and Caribbean Leadership Network. We found that there
would be multiple harmful effects that would spread promptly around the
globe (Arguello and Buis 2016); a more detailed analysis is below, which
highlights the need for the creation of a comprehensive nuclear security
system. The consequences of a terrorist nuclear [attack A small and
primitive 1-kiloton fission bomb]{.underline} (with a yield of about
one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and certainly much less
sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), detonated in any large capital city of the
developed world, [would cause an **unprecedented catastrophic
scenario**]{.underline}. An estimate of direct effects in the attack's
location includes a death toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people and
12,600-to-57,000 people injured, depending on the target's geography and
population density. [Total physical destruction of the city's
infrastructure,]{.underline} due to the blast (shock wave) and thermal
radiation, would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the point of
detonation (also known as ground zero), while ionizing radiation greater
than 5 Sieverts -- compatible with the [deadly acute radiation
syndrome]{.underline} -- would expand within an 850-meter radius. From
the environmental point of view, such an area would be unusable for
years. In addition, [radioactive fallout would expand]{.underline} in an
area of about 300 square kilometers, depending on meteorological
conditions (cf. Figure 2). But the [consequences would go **far beyond
the effects in the target country,**]{.underline} however, [and promptly
propagate worldwide]{.underline}. [Global and national security,
economy]{.underline} and finance, international [governance]{.underline}
and its framework, national [political systems, and the behavior of
governments]{.underline} and individuals [would all be put under severe
trial]{.underline}. The severity of the effects at a national level,
however, would depend on the countries' level of development,
geopolitical location, and resilience. [Global security and]{.underline}
regional/[national defense]{.underline} schemes **[would be strongly
affected.]{.underline}** [An increase in global distrust would spark
rising tensions among countries]{.underline} and blocs, [that
could]{.underline} even [lead to the brink of **nuclear weapons use by
states**]{.underline} ([if, for instance, a sponsor country is
identified]{.underline}). The [consequences of such a]{.underline}
shocking [scenario]{.underline} would include a [decrease]{.underline}
in [states' self-control]{.underline}, [an escalation of present
conflicts and the emergence of new ones]{.underline}, [accompanied by an
increase in military unilateralism and]{.underline} military
[expenditures]{.underline}. Regarding the economic and financial
impacts[, a severe global economic depression would rise]{.underline}
from the attack, likely [lasting for years]{.underline}. Its duration
would be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The main
results of such a crisis would include a [2 percent fall of growth in
global G]{.underline}ross [D]{.underline}omestic [P]{.underline}roduct,
[and a 4 percent decline of international trade]{.underline} in the two
years following the attack (cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing and
less-developed countries, the economic impacts would also include a
shortage of high-technology products such as medicines, as well as a
fall in foreign direct investment and a severe decline of international
humanitarian aid toward low-income countries. We [expect an increase of
unemployment and poverty in all countries]{.underline}. [Global poverty
would raise about 4 percent]{.underline} after the attack, which implies
that [at least **30 million more people** would be living in extreme
poverty,]{.underline} in addition to the current estimated 767 million.
[In]{.underline} the area of [international relations, we would expect a
breakdown of key doctrines]{.underline} involving politics, security,
and relations among states. These [international tensions could lead to
a **collapse of the nuclear order** as we know it today]{.underline},
with a consequent setback of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation
commitments. In other words, [the whole system based on the
N]{.underline}uclear Non- [P]{.underline}roliferation
[T]{.underline}reaty [would be put under severe trial]{.underline}.
After the attack, [there would be a reassessment of
existing]{.underline} security doctrines, [and a deep review of concepts
such as nuclear deterrence, no-firstuse]{.underline}, proportionality,
[and]{.underline} negative [security assurances.]{.underline} Finally,
the behavior of governments and individuals would also change radically.
[Internal chaos fueled by the media and social networks would threaten
governance at all levels,]{.underline} with greater impact on those
countries with weak institutional frameworks. [Social turbulence would
emerge]{.underline} in most countries, with [consequent attempts by
governments to impose restrictions on personal freedoms to preserve
order]{.underline} -- possibly by declaring a state of siege or state of
emergency -- and **[legislation would surely become tougher on human
rights]{.underline}**. There would also be a significant [increase in
social fragmentation -- with a deepening of antagonistic
views]{.underline}, mistrust, [and intolerance]{.underline}, both
[within countries and towards others]{.underline} -- and a resurgence of
large-scale social movements fostered by ideological interests and
easily mobilized through social media.

spell out here the likely consequences of the explosion of a single
terrorist nuclear bomb on a major city, and its subsequent ripple
effects on the rest of the planet]{.underline}. Depending on where and
when it was detonated, the [blast, fire, initial radiation, and
long-term radioactive fallout from such a bomb could leave the heart of
a major city a smoldering radioactive ruin, killing tens or hundreds of
thousands of people and wounding hundreds of thousands
more]{.underline}. [Vast areas]{.underline} [would]{.underline} have to
be evacuated and might [be uninhabitable for years. **Economic,
political, and social** aftershocks would ripple throughout the
world]{.underline}. A single terrorist nuclear bomb would change
history. The [country attacked---and the world---would **never be the
same.** The idea of terrorists accomplishing such a thing
is,]{.underline} unfortunately, [not out of the question; it is far
easier to make a crude, unsafe, unreliable nuclear explosive that might
fit in the back of a truck than it is to make a safe, reliable
weapon]{.underline} of known yield that can be delivered by missile or
combat aircraft. [**Numerous government studies** have concluded that it
is plausible that a sophisticated terrorist group could make a crude
bomb]{.underline} if they got the needed nuclear material. And in the
last quarter century, [there have been some **20 seizures** of stolen,
weapons-usable nuclear material, and at least two terrorist groups have
made significant efforts to acquire nuclear bombs.]{.underline}
Terrorist use of an actual nuclear bomb is a low-probability event---but
[the immensity of the consequences means that **even a small chance is
enough to justify an intensive effort to reduce the risk**.]{.underline}
Fortunately, since the early 1990s, countries around the world have

is more to do to ensure this nightmare never becomes reality.

(Mark, PoliSci@MIT, AssistProfPoliSci@Minnesota, Defending the
"Acquisition-Use Presumption" in Assessing the Likelihood of Nuclear
Terrorism, International Studies Quarterly)

In their recent article in International Studies Quarterly, [McIntosh
and Storey]{.underline} (2018, 289) [criticize existing analyses for
falling prey to an "acquisition-use presumption]{.underline}" [that
"assumes that once a terrorist group acquires a nuclear weapon, it
will]{.underline}, at some point, [attempt to detonate it."]{.underline}
Instead, they argue that "a nuclear terrorist attack is the least likely
outcome---even for terrorist groups with nuclear capability." McIntosh
and Storey (2018, 289, 296--97) identify three reasons why terrorist
organizations would be unlikely to detonate a nuclear weapon even if
they acquired one. First, they point to "many options available to a
terrorist group" other than detonating a nuclear weapon. Second,
"terrorist organizations are not unitary, homogenous organizations" and
must maintain "the continued support of . . . multiple audiences" such
as funders and state sponsors, as well as individuals within the
organization. These organizational dynamics should be expected to reduce
the likelihood of a nuclear attack by a terrorist organization, even if
it has acquired nuclear weapons. Third, scholars "conflate capitulation
and surrender" because a nuclear attack would likely increase threats to
the terrorist organization. [**These arguments, however, are ultimately
unpersuasive.** The acquisition-use presumption remains a valid basis
for theorizing about]{.underline} the probability of [nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}.1 Alternatives to a Nuclear Attack McIntosh and
Storey (2018, 292--93) identify a range of options for a terrorist
organization that has acquired nuclear weapons. Drawing on the
literature on the ways that states use nuclear weapons, they highlight
four potentially attractive strategies for a terrorist organization with
a nuclear weapon. First, a terrorist organization could pursue
"ambiguity," in which a terrorist organization "neither publicly
identifies the conditions triggering nuclear attack nor publicizes
acquiring the weapon." "Latency," the second option, requires a
terrorist organization to "keep its capacity covert, but publicly state
conditions under which it would employ a nuclear weapon." A third
possibility, "opacity," occurs when an organization "admits a nuclear
capacity but does not identify conditions resulting in an attack." The
fourth option, "blackmail," involves an organization making "specific
nuclear threats to achieve an outcome." [McIntosh and
Storey]{.underline} (2018) [conclude]{.underline} that "[there is always
a myriad of options that remain available" other than detonating a
nuclear weapon]{.underline} and that nuclear weapons are "much more
effectively used, paradoxically, when \[they\] remain holstered." [These
strategies, however, are **unlikely to appeal to a terrorist
organization** with a nuclear weapon]{.underline}. A terrorist
organization with a nuclear weapon that adopts a strategy of ambiguity
neither acknowledges its nuclear capability nor the circumstances in
which it might use it; as McIntosh and Storey (2018, 292, 289) say,
nuclear weapons are "not utilized directly." If so, [ambiguity merely
provides the terrorist organization with the option of
future]{.underline} operational or political [use]{.underline}. [If that
future use involves a nuclear detonation, then the acquisition-use
presumption]{.underline}, that the terrorist organization "will, at some
point, attempt to detonate \[its nuclear weapon\]" [remains
valid]{.underline}. If that future use does not involve a nuclear
detonation, then the attractiveness of the strategy of ambiguity depends
on the attractiveness of potential future options other than detonation.
The [other strategies that McIntosh and Storey]{.underline} (2018)
[identify---latency, opacity, and blackmail---involve the terrorist
organization revealing]{.underline} (to some degree) [its nuclear
capabilities and seeking to gain political utility]{.underline} from
nuclear weapons [without detonating]{.underline} them, through
deterrence or compellence (or both).2 [McIntosh and Storey]{.underline}
(2018) [are correct that states have generally sought political benefits
from possessing rather than directly using nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.3 However, **[terrorist organization would find it
far harder than states,]{.underline}** which are better positioned to
reap deterrent or compellent benefits from the possession of nuclear
weapons, [to gain political benefits from merely possessing nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} First, [a terrorist organization with nuclear
weapons would be in a more vulnerable position than any
state]{.underline} with respect to its nuclear weapons. Even newly
nuclear-armed states typically possess numerous nuclear weapons, a range
of facilities in which weapons and delivery capabilities can be held,
military resources to protect facilities and weapons, and control of the
territory in which those weapons are being held. These capabilities
substantially reduce a state's vulnerability to having its nuclear
capabilities attacked and destroyed militarily and allow a state to
achieve political goals without detonating its nuclear capabilities. [A
terrorist organization's nuclear arsenal,]{.underline} by contrast,
[would]{.underline} likely [be more vulnerable]{.underline}. Terrorist
organizations do, of course, vary substantially in terms of their
resources, military capabilities, and control over territory; terrorist
organizations with more resources, capabilities, and territorial control
would be better able to protect their nuclear capabilities. For example,
an organization holding substantial territory, such as the Islamic State
at the height of its power, would have a better chance of protecting
nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, [**even an extremely well-resourced,
sophisticated terrorist organization** is likely to have a far more
vulnerable nuclear arsenal than a weak state]{.underline}. Just
assembling a single gun-type nuclear device (the crudest and easiest
type of nuclear weapon to build) would be a remarkable technological
achievement for any terrorist organization, and even scholars concerned
about nuclear terrorism conclude that "an attack by nonstate terrorists
using an actual nuclear explosive---self-made or stolen---would clearly
be among the most difficult types of attack to carry out" (Bunn and Weir
2006, 133--34). [A terrorist organization]{.underline} would not be able
to produce highly enriched uranium or plutonium (which require operating
a nuclear reactor or uranium enrichment technologies such as
centrifuges); would not be able to manufacture substantial numbers of
nuclear weapons; would not have a large cadre of nuclear engineers,
scientists, and metallurgists at its disposal; and generally [would not
have]{.underline} a large range of [facilities or the military
capabilities to protect them from attack by powerful
states]{.underline}.4 Even the most sophisticated terrorist
organization's nuclear arsenal would, therefore, be more vulnerable than
the nuclear arsenal of a weak state. [This vulnerability has important
consequences]{.underline} for the incentives facing a terrorist
organization with nuclear weapons. [A terrorist organization with a
nuclear weapon would face **an extreme version of the
"use-them-or-lose-them" incentives** that states with vulnerable nuclear
arsenals face:]{.underline} to "posture \[its\] forces for an early use
. . . before its nuclear option is curtailed" (Feaver 1992/1993, 165).
Similarly, [a terrorist organization with a vulnerable arsenal would
face strong incentives to use its nuclear weapons to avoid having
the]{.underline} opportunity to use [them taken away]{.underline} (Van
de Velde 2010, 685). Second, [states can gain political leverage from
nuclear weapons without using]{.underline} them in a direct military
attack [because a state revealing its nuclear capabilities does not
reduce the weapons' potency or the state's ability to use
them]{.underline}. As Gartzke and Lindsay argue, "nuclear actors can
openly advertise their weapons to signal the costs of aggression to
potential adversaries" (2017, 37). This is partly because states can
protect their nuclear assets, as discussed above. However, additionally,
[states have]{.underline} generally [relied on military technologies to
deliver nuclear weapons that are]{.underline} (to differing degrees)
[difficult to defend against]{.underline}: military aircraft, land-based
missiles, or submarine-launched missiles. Indeed, the fact that nuclear
weapons delivered by missile or aircraft are difficult to defend against
regardless of knowledge of an adversary's capabilities is at the core of
arguments about the stabilizing effects of nuclear weapons on
international politics.5 A terrorist organization, however, has much
stronger incentives to maintain secrecy about its nuclear capability. As
discussed, a terrorist organization cannot protect its nuclear assets to
the same degree as a state. In addition, [a terrorist organization would
likely employ crude methods of delivery such as a truck or a ship
navigated into a port]{.underline} rather than the sophisticated
delivery technologies available to states (Bunn 2010, 16). [Such methods
of delivery are far easier to defend against than those employed by
states if the defender has knowledge of the attacker's capabilities or
intentions]{.underline}. As a result, [**any sort of disclosure** by a
terrorist organization reduces the potency of its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. For example, [if a state knew that a terrorist
organization had a nuclear device, it would have a wide range of
counterterrorism policy tools]{.underline} at its disposal [to reduce
the likelihood of a successful]{.underline} terrorist [attack. For
example, a state could shut down border crossings, increase security at
potential target sites]{.underline}, [activate intelligence
assets]{.underline} within the terrorist organization, [share
intelligence]{.underline} with other states, [or pursue assassinations
or other kinetic operations]{.underline} (Ganor 2006). Terrorist
organizations, therefore, have greater incentives for secrecy, thereby
reducing the feasibility of them achieving political leverage from
possessing nuclear weapons without using them directly in a nuclear
attack. [This]{.underline}, in turn, **[increases the attractiveness of
detonation relative to any other strategy.]{.underline}** Third, [for a
terrorist organization seeking to gain political leverage]{.underline}
from possessing nuclear weapons, it [must first persuade the world that
it has a capability that no previous terrorist organization has
previously acquired.]{.underline} [States may reasonably doubt such
claims]{.underline} by a terrorist organization. First, no terrorist
organization has previously acquired nuclear weapons. And second,
[responding to a nuclear threat from a terrorist organization by
granting concessions would set a precedent that other organizations
could exploit]{.underline}. Of course, states can unambiguously
demonstrate their nuclear capabilities using public and observable
nuclear tests because they can replenish their nuclear arsenals; states
with uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capabilities can
easily produce more fissile material. [Terrorists]{.underline} are
unlikely to have these capabilities and would therefore [have a fixed,
finite quantity of nuclear materials; any sort of public nuclear test
is, therefore, costlier for a terrorist organization than for a
state.]{.underline} The United States during World War II provides the
closest example of a state facing these constraints. As (Schelling 1982,
67) notes, when the United States "had a very small capability to
produce nuclear bombs . . . the possibility of a harmless detonation in
an unpopulated place was considered but rejected." A terrorist
organization with a nuclear weapon would face the same incentives as the
United States faced in 1945---a small arsenal and limited fissile
material, a world potentially skeptical of any claim to have acquired a
revolutionary new capability, and defenders potentially capable of
interfering with an attack. A terrorist organization in this position
would likely conclude, as the United States did in 1945, that "the
weapons couldn't be wasted on a remote battlefield . . . \[N\]o warning
\[could be\] given that might have allowed interference with the
demonstration" (Schelling 1982, 67). This is not to say that terrorist
organizations might never seek to demonstrate their capabilities prior
to detonating a nuclear weapon in an attack, but such demonstrations are
much costlier, and thus less attractive, for terrorist organizations
than states. In sum, states can generally protect their nuclear arsenals
from attack, can deliver nuclear weapons regardless of actions by
adversaries, and can disclose their capabilities without reducing their
potency. This makes it plausible for them to use nuclear weapons for
deterrence or compellence--- gaining political utility from their
nuclear weapons without directly using them. [While terrorist
organizations vary substantially]{.underline}, and some may even
approximate some of the capabilities of states on some dimensions,
[their nuclear arsenals would likely be more vulnerable, their delivery
methods cruder, and their incentives for secrecy greater than states.
Gaining political leverage]{.underline} from nuclear weapons [without
using]{.underline} them [is more difficult in such
circumstances]{.underline}. [As a result, a terrorist organization with
nuclear weapons would be unlikely to find the strategies that McIntosh
and Storey]{.underline} (2018) [identify feasible or
attractive]{.underline}. Organizational Dynamics While McIntosh and
Storey's (2018) first argument is that a nuclear attack would be a poor
strategic choice for a rational terrorist organization, their second
argument does not assume that terrorist organizations are unitary,
rational actors. As the literature has increasingly recognized,
organizational dynamics and intragroup politics shed light on the
behavior of terrorist and insurgent organizations.6 For example,
terrorist organizations are composed of multiple suborganizations that
may have their own interests and incentives distinct from those of the
larger organization; have links to other organizations and are embedded
within broader societal structures; must maintain the support of
individuals within the organization; and must maintain the support of
external audiences such as funders or states. McIntosh and Storey (2018,
296--97) argue that these organizational dynamics reduce the validity of
the acquisition-use presumption. They argue that (1) "there could be
divisiveness \[within the organization\] regarding themost effective use
of the weapon," (2) "a nuclear attack would exponentially raise the
threat to each individual who composes the extended organization," (3)
"transgressing the longstanding nuclear taboo would have dramatic and
negative effects on broader public support," and (4) any "host
state/government will likely be much less committed to the survival of
the terrorist group" if it conducted a nuclear attack. However, if these
arguments should reduce our estimate of the likelihood of nuclear
terrorism, it is not because the acquisition-use presumption is faulty.7
Rather, these arguments reduce the probability of a terrorist
organization acquiring nuclear weapons in the first place.8 If there are
organizational rifts about the utility of using nuclear weapons, an
organization will find it hard to generate internal support for a
decision to acquire nuclear weapons. If individual members of the
terrorist organization fear the consequences of nuclear use, they are
likely to resist the acquisition of a nuclear weapon. And if a terrorist
organization relies on support from a state that would oppose its use of
nuclear weapons, the state has incentives to prevent the terrorist
organization from acquiring nuclear weapons in the first place. For
example, Pakistan may support numerous terrorist organizations including
Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, or the Haqqani network (Byman 2005,
chap. 6; Fair 2011; 2014, chap. 9) but has strong incentives not to
allow such organizations to acquire nuclear weapons (Lieber and Press
2013, 93--95). [McIntosh and Storey's]{.underline} (2018) [arguments
about the organizational politics of terrorist organizations actually
reinforce the logic of the acquisition-use]{.underline} presumption [via
selection effects: the particular terrorist organizations able to
overcome these issues to acquire nuclear weapons are also likely to be
those able to overcome them in the decision to detonate nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.9 As Schelling argues, only an organization of
"high professional quality and excellent organization and discipline"
would be able to acquire nuclear weapons (1982, 65). Selection effects
also reinforce the acquisition-use assumption through mechanisms other
than organizational politics. [Groups with ideologies and goals that
might incentivize acquiring nuclear weapons--- such as those with
apocalyptic worldviews or a desire for mass-casualty terrorism, like Al
Qaeda]{.underline} or the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo---[will also be
those most inclined to use nuclear weapons after acquiring
them]{.underline} and best able to enforce ideological discipline among
their members. In short, the terrorist organizations that have the
motivation, discipline, and capability to acquire nuclear weapons would
be least subject to the dynamics that McIntosh and Storey (2018)
identify as a constraint on nuclear use. The Escalatory Potential of an
Attack Finally, McIntosh and Storey (2018, 297) argue that "assuming
nuclear attack is inevitable postacquisition conflates capitulation and
surrender." As they argue, "it is certainly the case that \[a terrorist
organization\] utilizing threats and violence can sometimes shift a
target state's policy," but this does "not necessarily end the threat to
\[its\] organization." A nuclear attack, in short, could worsen the
threats a terrorist organization faces. It certainly seems likely that a
terrorist organization would "be subjected to heavier attacks than ever
before" if it successfully detonated a nuclear weapon in an attack. This
is not, however, a persuasive argument against the acquisition-use
presumption. First, [terrorist organizations often undertake attacks
that increase the threats they face]{.underline}. Indeed,
[terrorist]{.underline} or insurgent [organizations often deliberately
seek to escalate a confrontation with a state]{.underline}; scholars
have long understood the logic of "provocation" or "outbidding"
strategies by groups competing for recruits, resources, or notoriety.10
[Al Qaeda, for example, sought to provoke the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [into a costly and destructive war using the 9/11
attacks]{.underline}, with Osama bin Laden boasting that the United
States had been "easy for us to provoke" (Kydd and Walter 2006, 71).
Other terrorist organizations such as Hamas or Shining Path have sought
to "outbid" other terrorist organizations to demonstrate that they are
"zealots rather than sellouts" (Kydd and Walter 2006, 76). [For a
terrorist organization seeking provocation, escalation, or outbidding,
it is hard to imagine a better way to achieve those goals than a nuclear
attack.]{.underline} The argument that a nuclear attack would lead to
the escalation of hostilities does not, therefore, support the
conclusion that a terrorist organization with a nuclear weapon would not
seek to conduct a nuclear attack. Second, the claim that a nuclear
attack would cause significant blowback only undermines the
acquisition-use presumption if other strategies a terrorist organization
could employ with nuclear weapons would not result in significant
blowback. However, as discussed above, [the other strategies that
McIntosh and Storey]{.underline} (2018) identify are unlikely to be
attractive to a terrorist organization. More importantly, to the extent
that other strategies are attractive, they [are also likely to result in
significant blowback from states]{.underline}. For example, as Van de
Velde (2010, 685) argues, if Al Qaeda sought to gain political leverage
from its nuclear weapons without using them, it would be faced with
overwhelming "pressure, airstrikes, troop movements, alliances, and
alike to find the weapon." This, as discussed above, would increase the
incentives for a terrorist organization to use a nuclear weapon in an
attack before its ability to do so is destroyed.

China is the clear [rising contender in lethal AWS]{.underline} and [AI
development]{.underline} and has outlined in its 'Next Generation
Artificial Intelligence Development Plan' that it intends to [utilize AI
on the battlefield]{.underline} in association with AWS (China State
Council, 2017; Kania, 2017). With a combination of [70 per cent citizen
trust]{.underline} in AI (the highest of the 24 countries surveyed) and
the heavy pressure it can exert on companies to transfer technology to
the state, it is **[unlikely to face significant internal resistance to
AWS development]{.underline}** (Ipsos, 2018). China's capacity for
weapons development is high with an estimated [annual budget of \$250
billion]{.underline} and projected spending of \$4.5 billion on drone
technology by 2021 (SIPRI, 2019; Statista, 2019). Most impressively,
Chinese companies have tested swarming technology with over 1,000
synchronized drones (Kania, 2017). However, while some countries, such
as South Korea, Israel, and Japan, seek AWS development to augment their
soldiers and fill near-term gaps in security, China, with the world's
largest army, does not have this problem. This fre[es China to focus the
bulk of its resources on long-term strategic investments in
AI.]{.underline} China publicly [plans to become the world leader in AI
development by 2030]{.underline} (China State Council, 2017). China's
controversial methods of intellectual property procurement have allowed
them to make technological leaps forward in a non-linear fashion. With
heavy 'civil-military fusion' investment, China's State Council
estimates their AI industries to be worth \$22 billion by 2020, \$59
billion by 2025, and \$150 billion by 2030 (China State Council, 2017;
Kania, 2017). By some metrics, China has already taken the lead in AI.
Despite lagging in total publications, between 2011 and 2015 [Chinese
scientists published 41,000 papers on AI, almost double the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates during the same period (Baker,
2017). Further, Chinese investment and financing in AI projects between
2013 and 2018 is estimated to be 60 per cent of the entire worlds
funding of such projects, again more than doubling United States
investment during the same period (CAICT and Gartner, 2019). However,
[**China does face a problem of top expertise flight** as despite having
over 18,000 talented AI developers,]{.underline} when it comes to those
who rank among the world's best, the United States and EU each have more
than [**five times as many of the top experts**]{.underline} (CISTP,

Secondly, I assume [efforts to **ban** the development and **deployment
of LAWS will fail**.]{.underline} Despite a large coalition of NGOs,
academics, policymakers, scientists, and others

([2019](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ethics-and-international-affairs/article/abs/artificial-intelligence-and-international-security-the-long-view/4AB181EAF648501422257934982A4DD5),

former Chair of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on LAWS at the
UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), stresses how:

The economic, political and security drivers for mainstreaming this
suite of technologies \[AI\] into security functions are [**simply too
powerful** to be rolled back. There will be plenty of persuasive
national security applications]{.underline} -- minimizing casualties and
collateral damage ..., defeating [terrorist threats]{.underline}, saving
on defense spending, and [protecting soldiers and their
bases]{.underline} -- to provide counterarguments against concerns about
runaway robots or accidental wars caused by machine error.

[Appeals to the inherent immorality of allowing computers to make life
and death decisions about human beings,]{.underline} often framed in
terms of human dignity (e.g. [Horowitz
2016](https://direct.mit.edu/daed/article/145/4/25/27111/The-Ethics-amp-Morality-of-Robotic-Warfare); [Heyns
2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02587203.2017.1303903); [Rosert
and Sauer
2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12691)),
will fall in the face of ostensibly [unstoppable forces across multiple
sectors making **incorporating AI into ever more aspect of our daily
lives almost inevitable**]{.underline}. From 'surveillance capitalism'
([Zuboff
2019](https://profilebooks.com/work/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/))
to LAWS, human beings are struggling to find ways to effectively halt,
or even dramatically slow, AI's march (e.g. [Rosert and Sauer
2021](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13523260.2020.1771508)).

Effective

LAWS' potential [military effectiveness manifests at]{.underline}
strategic, [operational]{.underline}, and tactical [levels.]{.underline}
Operating at 'machine speed' means potentially [outpacing adversaries
and acquiring crucial advantages]{.underline}, it enables far faster
processing of huge quantities of data to generate new insights and spot
opportunities, and it means concentrating military effect with greater
pace and accuracy (e.g. [Altmann and Sauer
2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263); [Horowitz
2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2019.1621174); [Jensen
et al
2020](https://academic.oup.com/isr/article-abstract/22/3/526/5522301?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).
Shifts, even temporary, in **[delicate strategic balances between rival
powers may appear as unacceptable risks]{.underline},** meaning that for
as long as adversaries are interested in and pursuing this technology,
their peer-rivals will feel compelled to do so too (e.g. [Maas
2019](https://brill.com/view/journals/ihls/10/1/article-p129_129.xml),
141-43). Altmann and Sauer
([2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263),
124) note, '[**operational speed** will reign supreme']{.underline}. The
'security dilemma' looms large, reinforcing amongst leading states the
sense **t[hey dare not risk being left behind in the competition to
research and develop LAWS]{.underline}** (e.g. [Altmann and Sauer
2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1375263); [Scharre
2021](https://tnsr.org/2021/06/debunking-the-ai-arms-race-theory/)).
Morgan et
al ([2020](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3139-1.html),
xvi) argue the [US]{.underline}, for example, has no choice but to, '...
stay at the [forefront of military AI capability]{.underline}. ...
\[N\]ot to compete in an area where adversaries are developing dangerous
capabilities is to cede the field. That would be unacceptable'. Things
likely look the same in Moscow and Beijing. [Add concerns about
potential proliferation to non-state actors]{.underline} (e.g. [Dunn
2015](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/89/5/1237/2417187?redirectedFrom=fulltext)),
and the security dilemma's [powerful logic appears
inescapable.]{.underline}

Of course, other weapons technologies inspired similar proliferation,
strategic destabilization, and conflict escalation concerns. Arms
control -- a key focus for current regulatory debate -- has slowed the
spread of nuclear weapons, banned chemical and biological weapons, and
prohibited blinding laser weapons before they were ever deployed
(e.g. [Baker et al
2020](https://www.e-ir.info/2020/04/15/introducing-guiding-principles-for-the-development-and-use-of-lethal-autonomous-weapon-systems/)).
[International regulation]{.underline} can [**alter the strategic
calculus** about what weapons do]{.underline} and do not appear
effective and persuade actors to deny themselves the systems in the
first place, or limit their acquisition and deployment, or give them up
as part of a wider deal that offers a better route to strategic
stability. LAWS present specific arms control challenges because [they
incorporate AI and robotics technologies offering many non-military
opportunities and advantages that human societies]{.underline} will want
to pursue, potentially bringing major benefits in addressing challenges
in diverse fields. Key breakthroughs are at least as likely to come from
civilian research and development projects as from principally military
ones. That makes definitions, monitoring, and verification harder. That
is not a reason not to try, of course, but it [does mean effective LAWS
may take many forms,]{.underline} incorporate [inherently hard to
restrict technologies,]{.underline} and offer possibly irresistible
benefits in what the security dilemma presents as an inescapably
competitive, militarized, and uncertain international environment
(e.g. [Sparrow
2009](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4799404); [Altmann

#### Shifts in power causes Russia-China War---that outweighs

Vladimir [Putin's war against Ukraine doesn't just herald a new era in
European security]{.underline}, [it underlines a **growing threat to the
American-led international order.**]{.underline}

[Pax Americana]{.underline}, the post-World War II system that [has
created the conditions for peace and prosperity in Europe and
elsewhere]{.underline}, is entering a great period of testing, [with the
**revanchist powers of Russia and China seeking to overturn
it.**]{.underline}

[It is imperative that the]{.underline} **[United States]{.underline}**,
[as the leader of the West and the only nation capable of maintaining
what it has built over the last seven decades]{.underline}, **[rises to
the challenge]{.underline}**, [even though its leadership role is
increasingly contested at home.]{.underline} The left has long argued
that the U.S. is not the benign influence abroad that it likes to
believe, and the order that it created is a corrupt scam, not worth the
cost of preserving.

Now elements of the right say much the same thing. This sentiment ranges
from Senate candidate J.D. Vance pointedly declaring that he doesn't
care what happens in Ukraine to right-wing commentator Candace Owens
saying we are at fault for the conflict. Undergirding it all is a sense
that the U.S. needs to mind its own business, and perhaps even treat
China as a "civilizational equal."

But Pax Americana isn't an act of charity. It holds distinct advantages
for the United States. We'd be less safe, prosperous, and free without
it.

What we are witnessing is, in broad brush, a civilizational challenge.
[China and Russia **don't**]{.underline} [have a formal alliance and
their current cooperative arrangement may well break down over
time]{.underline}, [but they **share the same interest in ending the
long era of Western preeminence.**]{.underline}

[Russia can punch above its weight]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
fundamentally [represents]{.underline} [a regional threat,]{.underline}
in particular [to]{.underline} a **[NATO]{.underline}** alliance that
has been a keystone of Western security. [Moscow seeks to divide
European countries from one another and diminish U.S. influence in
Europe]{.underline}, toward the end of reversing the post-Cold War
settlement that was the fruit of the West's triumph over the Soviet
Union.

[What Putin seeks is consequential, but not nearly as sweeping as
Beijing's goal of supplanting the United States at the top of the
hierarchy of nations]{.underline}. [China wants nothing less than to
**restore itself as the Middle Kingdom, owed the respect and obeisance
of the rest of the world.**]{.underline}

[What unites Russia and China is that they are two civilizations that
feel they were humiliated and trampled by the West]{.underline} (Russia
at the end of the Cold War, China from the middle of the 19th century to
the middle of the 20th) and need to regain their rightful place in the
sun. There is an ideological element to the growing challenge, as these
two authoritarian regimes confront the democratic world, but the crux of
the matter is cultural---neither Russia nor China has ever been a
liberal democracy and each country is reacting against international
norms they've never embraced.

Can't we just make way for a more ambitious Russia and China? Within
limits, but their maximal demands are an obvious threat to our
interests.

[Through our system of alliances]{.underline}, [we have
been]{.underline}, in effect, **[sponsoring international
peace]{.underline}**. [Should]{.underline}, say, [NATO
unravel]{.underline}, [there is no reason that Europe]{.underline}
[would not eventually once again become **red in tooth and
claw**]{.underline}, [as it has been through much of its
history]{.underline}. Even if we could ignore or at least stay out of
any future conflict, the loss of a vast zone of free, prosperous and
allied counties would be a blow.

[If it is expensive]{.underline} and burdensome [to underwrite the
security of countries around the]{.underline} [world, it
would]{.underline} be even **[more expensive]{.underline}** and
burdensome [if a global U.S. exit or diminishment created the conditions
for a major wa]{.underline}r[, or if]{.underline} some other
power---i.e., **[China]{.underline}**---**[replaced us at the apex of
world power]{.underline}**.

There are so many advantages to our preeminent position that we take for
granted. In an essay titled "After Hegemony," former Trump official
Elbridge Colby notes some of them: "Think how the American-born internet
supported Silicon Valley, and vice versa, leading to a World Wide Web
governed by formal laws and informal norms almost entirely of American
design. Think how the desire for access to American capital markets
gives American regulators de facto control over global accounting
standards, or how the need to transact with American institutions allows
U.S. Treasury officials to freeze the assets of designated targets
anywhere in the world. Think how Americans take for granted that English
is the universal language and that everyone accepts dollars. Think how
the American university degree has become the preeminent global academic
credential, with searching implications for everything from global
educational standards to measures of professional success."

[The American order has also been, in the main, **just**]{.underline}.
[It is based on the sovereignty of borders and democracy as a
nor]{.underline}m, and hence has been a boon to self-governing peoples
around the world. We can be overbearing and even bullying---as well as
greedy, shortsighted, and wrong-headed---[but U.S. leadership **hasn't
been based on coercion.** By and large, our allies trust us, and find
our model more congenial than anything else on offer.]{.underline}

The [previous hegemonic power]{.underline}, **[Britain]{.underline}**,
[had a soft landing because]{.underline} [Pax Britannica was replaced by
Pax Americana,]{.underline} run by a partner that shared similar values
and mindsets. [The same wouldn't be true if **we hand the baton over to
China**.]{.underline}

Consider the seas. As the navalist Jerry Hendrix notes, [the U.S. Navy
has made the seas safe and free over the last 70 years in a way they
never had been before]{.underline}. It's no accident that there's been a
surge of global trade over the course of these decades that has made
countries around the world more prosperous. Russia and especially China
are a threat to this system, seeking greater control of the seas for
their own purposes.

[China wants to define a swath of the Western Pacific and the Indian
Ocean as its territorial waters. If the U.S. lacks the resources or will
to resist this Chinese aggrandizement, the rules of the road of
international commerce will change drastically in China's
favor]{.underline}. An enormous proportion of global trade flows through
the South China Sea and East China Sea. With control of the key choke
points, China would be in a position to create restrictions and fees for
everyone else's trade and privileged status for its own. [Imagine a kind
of perpetual supply-chain crisis imposed by China as a matter of
policy.]{.underline}

Indeed, [China doesn't want to be a leading country among other leading
countries]{.underline}. [It wants to have its system of government
**considered superior to liberal democracy**]{.underline}. It wants free
access to markets, while constraining everyone else. [It wants to
dominate the setting of technical standards, and so influence how new
technologies are developed to suit its own interests]{.underline}. The
Belt and Road Initiative is a reflection of its vision, with China at
the center and other countries in a subsidiary role.

[If China achieves mastery in Asia and a position of global
predominance]{.underline}, **[it won't leave us alone to enjoy tending
our garden at home]{.underline}**. "[Building upon such economic
advantages]{.underline}," Colby writes, "it [could intrude into and
shape our national life, using its position to coerce, bribe, and cajole
companies, individuals, and governments to do its will, diminishing our
economic vitality and, through that, our freedoms."]{.underline}

[Resisting these]{.underline} growing civilizational [challenges will
require continued engagement around the world and the return in certain
respects to a Cold W]{.underline}ar footing, especially when it comes to
the chronically underfunded defense budget. [Ducking our leadership role
will, eventually, mean inevitable decline and the **creation of a more
hostile world. Countries don't become more prosperous and secure on
their way down.**]{.underline}

Right now, [**each soldier** in Afghanistan **costs the Pentagon
\$850,000 a year**, according to DOD]{.underline} estimates. Some
independent [experts put that number as high as \$1.2
million]{.underline}.¶ That's just the cost of keeping soldiers in the
field of battle. [Over time, these soldiers are expected to cost the
Pentagon tens of billions of dollars in **long-term health care
costs.**]{.underline} This expense is expected to be **[one of the main
drivers of DOD spending]{.underline}** in the coming years: According to
the left-leaning Center for American Progress, health care costs will
[reach \$63.9 billion]{.underline} by 2015.¶ Compare that, however, to
the cost of building and maintaining a robot. [The TALON robot, a small
rover that can be outfitted with weapons, costs \$230,000 right now. The
SGR-A1, used by the South Korean military to detect movement in the
demilitarized zone, costs \$200,000. The 710 Warrior, a miniature rover
with enough power to tow a car, costs between \$300,000 and
\$400,000.]{.underline}¶ [Even the larger, more sophisticated robots
that are in development are relatively cheap]{.underline}. PETMAN, the
humanoid robot that can run and do pushups, cost \$26.3 million to
develop. The Pentagon has only invested \$11 million in its program to
develop robots that can act autonomously. The Navy has invested \$813
billion in its unmanned X-47B, a project that is close to operational.¶
This might seem like a large amount until you consider that DOD plans to
spend \$1.5 trillion on its manned F-35. ¶ Of course, these costs will
grow as the robots are produced on a larger scale. And people will never
be completely eliminated from the DOD: Pentagon commanders are likely to
use robots as companions to human soldiers, not as replacements.¶ But
because [they're cheap to maintain, **the rise of robot warriors is
likely to reduce DOD spending**. As production increases, efficiencies
will be found, reducing costs. All signs indicate that the cost of
**using a robot in battle is likely to be less than using a
human**.]{.underline}¶ [The real savings come through medical costs.
Robots do not require long-term medical care, the time and services of
the Veterans Administration, or anything else connected to the
government's bottom line.]{.underline}

### Link -- NATO 

#### NATO represents an *[ambitious war machine]{.underline}* whilst simultaneously posturing itself as a progressive entity

Feminist Responses", 2012 Women in Action, 11-24-2011 ,

NATO and The Woman Question The big challenge lies in getting the new
instrument implemented, getting governments to commit to it and
translating it into action for peace making initiatives and
peace-keeping operations. That task has engaged many women and women's
organisations in a great deal of sustained efforts from that day to
this.5 They had to 'get their hands dirty', negotiating not only with
member governments but also with state militaries, for they are the ones
who 'man' the aforesaid 'peace keeping operations'. Who else but they,
can ensure that women's concerns are addressed by the UN 'blue beret'
units who work among the distressed populations in conflict and
post-conflict situations? Up to a point, implementing Resolution 1325
could mean relatively unproblematic and even creative encounters with
the 'civil-military' functionaries of relatively benign state armies
like those of the Netherlands, a country which sees its army more as a
peace keeping force rather than a war-fighting army.6 However, many of
the [armies of Western Europe]{.underline} (and increasingly of Eastern
Europe and even further afield) are marshalled within, and often
[commanded by]{.underline} the [structures of]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Alliance, by [NATO]{.underline}. In our No-to-NATO movement we
have developed a strong, sustained and carefully argued critique of the
Alliance. It may speak the [dainty language of 'security']{.underline},
but its actions show that it is an **[ambitious, expansionist and
belligerent war-machine]{.underline}**, primarily serving the economic
and [strategic interests of the more powerful among its member
states]{.underline}.7

NATO has adopted Resolution 1325 with an energy that could easily pass
for enthusiasm. A glance at its website will show 47 documents relating
to the topic.8 A multi-media exhibition has been mounted about NATO's
contributions to the implementation of the Resolution (September 2010).
There are pleasing photos of young women in army fatigues carrying
babies, waving to children. NATO even celebrates International Women's
Day. **[Apparently standing shoulder to shoulder with the women's
movement]{.underline}**, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen asked,
on 8 March 2010, "[Would a world in which women enjoyed rights equal to
those of men be safer and more stable]{.underline}? It is difficult to
say, but ultimately a [lasting peace in many of the world's most
troubled areas may depend upon the answer]{.underline}."9 The Alliance
was, it is true, rather slow off the mark at first in **[grasping the
merits of Resolution 1325]{.underline}**. They made their first move in
2007, seven years after it came into effect, and in doing so, they
addressed action on 'women, peace and security (WPS)' from the start, as
a joint policy initiative between NATO and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council. In other words the 28 NATO member states didn't put a go on it
alone. They decided, on their own reasons, to include the 22
'Partnership for Peace' states. Otherwise, this would not be, they said,
"a true partnership policy on an issue of global interest."10 They set
up an [**informal 'ad hoc group'** to make progress on the
matter]{.underline}. It was the following summer, 2008, that the North
Atlantic Council 'tasked' the NATO Strategic Command to provide guidance
on implementing Resolution 1325. In other words, this was the point when
the **[big political boys asked the big military boys to put their minds
on women.]{.underline}** The result was a Bi-Strategic Command
guidelines to be 'taken forward' by the NATO civil and military
authorities. All these member and 'partner' nations were urged to adopt
National Action Plans on the Resolution. The Alliance envisioned
Resolution 1325 [**policy on WPS** as 'an **integral part of NATO's
corporate identity**]{.underline}, in the way it plans and conducts its
everyday business, and the way it organises its civilian and military
structures'. It should also be fully integrated into 'all aspects of
NATO-led operations' (my emphasis).

\*WPS\*=women peace and security agenda\*

Specifically, this article takes a critical feminist approach to
conceptualise [NATO as an 'institution of international hegemonic
masculinit]{.underline}y' through the way the [alliance invokes the
masculinist protection logic in its engagement with WPS]{.underline} and
[acts as a '**teaching machine'** shaping the value]{.underline} placed
on WPS by NATO members and a growing number of partners (Wright et al.,
2019). In this article, I develop this framework through situating civil
society within it and, in so doing, contribute something new to
understanding how [NATO functions through its move to active engagement
on the international stage with the WPS agenda]{.underline}. In
addition, this framework enables interrogation of how the WPS agenda can
become militarised despite civil society engagement. In order to do so,
I focus on how civil society engaged in WPS work perceive NATO and,
specifically, NATO's intentions. I seek to understand whether and how
NATO's attempts to engage civil society through the creation of CSAP in
2014 have influenced civil society perceptions of the alliance and in
turn whether such engagements have the potential to support
transformative understandings of WPS at NATO. My analysis proceeds as
follows. First, I introduce my method and approach drawing on an
understanding of NATO as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity. Next, I engage with the concept of civil society and the
relationship with the WPS agenda, before moving on to interrogate why
NATO has until recently remained an outlier in global governance with
its lack of formal policy engagement with civil society. The article
then moves to introduce the WPS architecture at NATO and specifically
the role of the Secretary General's Special Representative (SGSR) on WPS
in relationship building with civil society on WPS. Next, the article
turns to examine the motivations for civil society engagement with NATO,
before moving to interrogate the value civil society perceive NATO gains
from CSAP. Finally, I examine how encounters with **[NATO's bureaucracy
and security apparatus shape civil society perceptions of
NATO]{.underline}.** [NATO as an **institution of international
hegemonic masculinity**]{.underline}: method and approach NATO is a
political-military alliance built on [consensus
decision-making]{.underline}. Moving beyond its Cold War origins, the
alliance's remit has expanded significantly beyond a sole focus on
collective defence to include crisis management and cooperative
security. This has seen NATO's focus enlarge from a regional one to a
global one, with recent engagements in Afghanistan, Libya and Kosovo,
for example. Its status as a multilateral institution means it is
limited by its members' priorities and therefore sensitive not to
implicate NATO or NATO member states in wrongdoing (Hebert, 2012). In
centring NATO as an 'institution of international hegemonic masculinity'
(Wright et al., 2019), in this analysis, it is possible to shed light on
the peculiarities of NATO's WPS work to date, against which engagement
with civil society takes place. This has two co-constituting elements,
first, internally, [existing gender norms and expectations of
masculinity]{.underline} and femininity reflective of a [hierarchical
military institution]{.underline} are (re)created and (re)enforced
through NATO's engagement with WPS (Wright et al., 2019: 71). For
example, men working on WPS at NATO navigate both the [**trivialisation
and the feminisation of such work a**nd must (re)negotiate their own
identities.]{.underline} Yet in so doing they [reinforce the importance
of men speaking to and listening to other me]{.underline}n (rather than
women) [**reinforcing** the **gendered status quo**]{.underline} (Wright
et al., 2019: 93; see also Hurley, 2018a). Second, externally, as a
transnational military alliance, [NATO acts as a 'teaching
machine']{.underline} in which member and partner states learn the value
of WPS as a 'military tool' through socialisation with each other
(Wright et al., 2019; see also Enloe, 1981). This means [perpetuating an
understanding of WPS as a means to support operational effectiveness
through]{.underline} 'the **[role of masculinist
protector]{.underline}** which [reinforces hegemonic militaristic,
masculine ideals and norms']{.underline} (Wright et al., 2019: 34). This
patriarchal logic puts '[women and children, in a subordinate position
of dependence and obedience']{.underline} to justify the waging of war
(Young, 2003: 2), for example, [NATO's intervention in
Afghanistan]{.underline} (Wright, 2019). It is [reinforced through the
stories NATO tells internally about]{.underline} its [WPS
engagement]{.underline} (Hurley, 2018b) and externally in public
diplomacy (Wright, 2019) and to support partnerships with other states
but also celebrities (Wright and Bergman Rosamond, 2021) and now civil
society. Thus, interrogating civil society perceptions of NATO in this
context adds an additional dimension to understanding how [NATO seeks to
legitimise itself as a WPS actor]{.underline}, further [constituting its
role as an institution of international hegemonic
masculinity]{.underline}. It is worth noting here that CSAP was revised
in late 2019 following an independent review commissioned by NATO,
neither this review, the new Terms of Reference nor full membership have
been made public. This reflects some of the challenges to researching
NATO, [an institution **cloaked in secrecy**]{.underline} by merit of
its purpose as a security and defence alliance (see Wright and Hurley,
2017 for a wider discussion). Therefore, the focus of this article is on
CSAP as it existed prior to this revision, from the first consultation
with civil society on WPS policy in 2014 and the formal establishment of
CSAP in 2016 until its 2019 revision which led to a change in
membership. This lack of transparency has also necessitated the method.
In order to assess civil society perceptions of NATO as a WPS actor, I
use a number of sources. First, I conducted 23 semi-structured
interviews of varying length with civil society actors working on WPS,
including current or former CSAP members. Participants were identified
via their membership of CSAP, as prominent civil society actors working
on WPS (in line with NATO's definition) and via snowballing. The
interviews took place either remotely or in person in locations across
the globe between September 2018 and March 2020. All of the interviews
were conducted on the condition of anonymity to enable participants to
speak as freely as possible. For this reason, no distinction is made
between current and former CSAP members. In addition, the locations of
specific interviews have not been revealed (Appendix 1), and this is
because the relatively small pool of members means doing so would
potentially expose the participants' identities. Second, I conducted a
review of civil society and NATO websites, including features on NATO or
CSAP specifically, along with NATO policy documents where available and
related content to inform my analysis. I used this information to
generate interview questions and also to corroborate interview data
where possible.

#### NATO promotes progressive gender values while *[sustaining masculine values]{.underline}* of *[protection and sovereignty]{.underline}* 

Elsa **Hedling 22**, is an associate fellow at the Europe Programme,
Swedish Institute of International Affairs (UI) and a PhD Candidate at
Lund University., "Embodying Military Muscles and a Remasculinized West:
Influencer Marketing, Fantasy, and "the Face of NATO", Global Studies

We argue that influencer marketing, through [engaging
fantasy]{.underline}, provides a site where [military organizations can
cre- ate appeal]{.underline} among a wider audience by bridging
incompati- ble [notions of soldiering, gender, and
geopolitics]{.underline}. Through the story of Lasse Matberg, the
political project of NATO military buildup was positioned as
[simultaneously neces- sary, commonsensical, and
pleasurab]{.underline}le, and NATO could [project **gender-progressive
values** while **safeguarding**]{.underline} "tra- ditional," [muscular
**masculinity.**]{.underline} Our findings add primar- ily to feminist
International Relations (IR) research, which has critically analyzed how
NATO communication efforts construct the organization as a cosmopolitan
defender of gender justice and human rights, thereby legitimating its
actions and existence (Kuus 2007; Wright 2019; Wright and Rosamond
2021). More broadly, feminist IR scholars have shown how notions of
[protection, territoriality, and sovereignty]{.underline}---all central
to contemporary security politics--- are [deeply gendered]{.underline}.
Gender relations and specific ideas of masculinity and femininity are,
explicitly or implicitly**, [invoked]{.underline}** [in **discourses
about who and what must be pro- tected**, from whom and by
whom]{.underline} (Young 2003; Parashar, Tickner, and True 2018; Agius
and Edenborg 2019; Strand and Kehl 2019). When seen in light of the
above research, our findings show how NATO, through new communica- tion
technologies, can engage and appeal to a wider audi- ence by [combining
a "pro-feminist]{.underline}," cosmopolitan [message with]{.underline}
other meanings, associated with "[traditional" masculin-
ity]{.underline} or nationalist mythologies. These ambiguous enactments
of gender and geopolitics are particularly significant in a time when
liberal and cosmopolitan values, feminism, and gender equality are
increasingly challenged by populist and "masculinist" discourses inside
and outside NATO (Nicholas and Agius 2018).

In addition to the primary contribution, our findings are relevant to
several other IR conversations. It contributes to the literature on
[war's relation to pleasure and joy]{.underline} (Dawson 1994; Welland
2018), which has dealt primarily with mili- tary recruitment, marketing
campaigns, or fictional repre- sentations of war. In contrast, we
demonstrate how influ- encer marketing---through mundane and
**[interactive visual storytelling centering on]{.underline}** the
**[soldier persona]{.underline}**---offers a par- ticularly fertile
genre for the production of fantasy. More generally, the article adds to
visual IR scholarship by taking seriously the ways in which [social
media can create new **pos- sibilities for conducting global
politics**]{.underline} (Bleiker 2015; Crilley 2021). The article also
joins IR discussions of how social me- dia are used to engage with
global publics as part of strategic communication, public, and digital
diplomacy (Shepherd 2015; Leaver and Highfield 2018, Duncombe 2020;
Hedling and Bremberg 2021).

The article proceeds as follows. Next, we introduce our analytical and
methodological framework for studying visual storytelling and its
geopolitical dimensions. Then we analyze the story of Lasse Matberg
through the three layers outlined above. Moving from the composition of
the story as told on Instagram, the role of digital media when used by
military organizations, and the geopolitical context, we discuss how
these three layers interrelate and coconstruct each other. In our
conclusions, we reflect upon the wider theoretical and political
implications of the analysis and identify pathways for future research.

Tracing Fantasy and Appeal in Visual Narratives of Social Media

[Stories of soldiers]{.underline}, circulating in popular culture, war
memorials, political speeches and strategic communication, [enable
civilian audiences to access]{.underline}, make sense of, and "[know"
war]{.underline}. Military and security organizations attempt to
orchestrate such stories in ways that [sustain morale
within]{.underline} the [ranks and foster public support]{.underline}
for war preparations and deployments (e.g., Pin-Fat and Stern 2005;
Achter 2010; Basham 2016; Cree and Caddick 2020). For wars to be sup-
ported, soldiers must be thought of as virtuous and mili- tary
sacrifices scripted as meaningful. This is arguably par- ticularly
important as professional forces (rather than con- scripted forces) have
become the norm in Europe and North America and few civilians have
personal bonds to a service member---even less to one serving under NATO
command. Still, stories of soldiers are rarely explicit in their
motivation of warfare. Instead, war and [war preparations]{.underline}
are made possible and even [desirable through stories that script the
soldier as]{.underline} an aspirational [war hero]{.underline} and
create a deeper resonance with what Dawson (1994) describes as the
"plea- sure culture of war."

Much has already been written about the relationship be- tween pleasure,
desire, military power, and war. One influen- tial body of work has
discussed how representations of war as an entertaining spectacle---or
the soldiering body as inspira- tional and attractive---in media,
popular culture, or by mili- tary organizations may produce a desire to
enlist in, watch, or support war (Der Derian 2001; Pears 2021). Another
body of literature has rather studied war as an emotional and indeed
often pleasurable experience, for instance, by de- scribing pleasure
attached to combat, synchronized move- ments, and marches as well as to
the molding of a strong, capable, and desirable military body
(Crane-Seeber 2016; Dyvik 2016; Welland 2018). The [emergence of social
and interactive media tech]{.underline}nology as a [site for strategic
commu- nicatio]{.underline}n and storytelling more broadly has arguably
enabled a third body of literature to merge war as a pleasurable ex-
perience with war as an enjoyable spectacle, by showing how civilian
audiences are called upon to actively engage with, "like," and "share"
strategic messages (Stahl 2010; Kuntsman and Stein 2015; Crilley 2016).
We will come back to this body of work in our analysis but, for now, we
want to establish that war and war preparations are [enabled through
desire,]{.underline} plea- sure, and appeal in a range of ways.

Therefore, our analysis of how NATO is ascribed mean- ing through the
story of Lasse Matberg focuses not primar- ily on identifying explicit
arguments about what NATO does and why it is necessary but rather on
[laying bare the ap- peal or fantasies that the visual narratives may
evoke]{.underline}. Fol- lowing Freinstein and Gadinger (2019), and
their reading of Glynos and Howarth (2007), we conceptualize this dy-
namic through the notion of fantasmatic logics (as distinct from
political logics). While political logics are descriptive as well as
prescriptive and may be identified in statements such as "NATO is a
guarantor of security in Europe against Russian aggression," fantasmatic
logics [lack clear directions or antagonism]{.underline}. Instead, a
fantasmatic logic bridges incon- sistent storylines enabling an
"[impossible union between incompatible elements]{.underline}" (Glynos
and Howarth 2007, 147). For Glynos and Howarth, the fantasmatic provides
a way to understand why certain practices and representations grip
subjects, thus giving political projects energy through a promise of
enjoyment or a "fullness-to-come" (Glynos and Howarth 2007,145--47). The
function of fantasy, they argue, is not to give a false or misleading
picture but to ensure that [political controversy and potential
conflicts remain in the background]{.underline}, allowing us to "have
the cake and eat it" (Glynos and Howarth 2007,147). As an example, in
military communication, language drawing on a political logic of
compulsory conscription and service for the nation can be combined with
images activating a fantasmatic desire for personal growth and
adventure.

Attention to fantasmatic logics is crucial for understand- ing how
strategic communication by military and security organizations may
resonate with and appeal to audiences. In line with Freinstein and
Gadinger, we here refer to "the **[performative dimension of
presentation rather than recep- tion]{.underline}**, to which we have no
analytical access" (2019: 2). When we suggest that the story of Lasse
Matberg produces ap- peal around the figure of the NATO soldier and
NATO's military buildup, we have in mind the promise or potential of
pleasure (Glynos and Howarth 2007). The question of what the
possible---and varying---target audiences are, and what promises Lasse
Matberg may embody for individuals as well as larger audiences, is a
concern to which we return throughout the analysis. Also, we have had no
analytical ac- cess to intention (Shepherd 2015) or "real motives,"
which is important to underline when studying representations that are
described, [not least by security organizations themselves, as strategic
communication.]{.underline}

How, then, do we trace fantasmatic logics in the story of Lasse Matberg?
Drawing on narrative methodology, we un- derstand m[ilitary marketing
and soldier self-representations]{.underline} on social media as
storytelling practices (Bamberg 2012; Hedling 2020). In line with much
narrative research, we [view personal stories as relying on,
reproducing]{.underline}, or chal- lenging [broader
narratives]{.underline}, such as those around nations, or [NATO as a
geopolitical actor]{.underline} (Somers and Gibson 1994). When analyzing
how the story of Lasse Matberg produces appeal and attaches meaning to
NATO, we pay attention to both visual and textual elements, with
inspiration from lit- erature on visual culture and global politics.
Loosely draw- ing on Hansen's (2011, 2015) three-step model for visual
analysis, we first explore the visual strategies used by Mat- berg to
construct a public image of himself as NATO of- ficer and social media
figure. To interpret these represen- tations, we engage with literature
on military masculinities and entertainment. Next, we analyze how
digital, social me- dia in general---and Instagram in particular---makes
pos- sible a particular story of Lasse Matberg. In this step, we draw on
research on digital Web 2.0 technologies, under- lining how the
[interactivity and intimacy of these platforms]{.underline}
[shape]{.underline} the [narratives communicated by]{.underline}
military and [security organizations and contribute to their
appeal]{.underline}. In the third step, we situate the story of Lasse
Matberg within a wider geopolitical context, examining how international
relations, and the role of NATO in world politics, [are constituted in
specifically gendered ways through this soldier story]{.underline}. This
discussion engages literature on gender and geopolitics. Throughout the
analysis, we identify tensions and incompat- ible elements, which seem
to be bridged by, and contribute to narrate, certain fantasies about
NATO. Our three-step ap- proach, and paying attention to how the three
steps are in- terconnected through the fantasmatic, allows us to gain a
more complex understanding of how the story of Lasse Mat- berg produces
[appeal around the NATO soldier]{.underline} and NATO buildup, not only
through his visual representation but how his visual representations are
consumed and circulated in a specific digital (second step) and
geopolitical (third step) environment.

#### The US and NATO have historically victimized women as a justification for their western imperialism, furthering their hegemonic masculine protectionist logic. 

Katharine Am **Wright**, 9-19-20**17**, \"Telling NATO's story of
Afghanistan: Gender and the alliance's digital diplomacy,\" SAGE
Journals, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1750635217730588

The [**gendered underpinnings** of NATO's approach to **public
diplomacy** are nothing new]{.underline}. For example, in the [1960s,
NATO]{.underline} produced a propaganda movie called The Atlantic
Decade, warning of the dangers of Soviet expansion and specifically
targeting women, with the [narrator introducing Turkey by saying 'here
too women have been liberated]{.underline}' (Risso, 2009: 509). Today,
NATO's approach to public (and now digital) diplomacy continues to be
underpinned by narratives, whether they concern individuals, states or
the alliance itself. As Wibben (2010: 43) argues, narratives are
political, they enable and limit representation and these
representations shape our world and the possibilities within it,
challenging the link between 'experience, meaning, and knowledge'. A
narrative approach is therefore a useful means to challenge traditional
conceptions of security concerned with creating meaning and imposing
value in what is viewed as an 'anarchic world' because it makes
'explicit the operation and production of particular kind\[s\] of
meaning, and ... draw\[s\] out the implications this understanding has
for human existence' (Polkinghorne, 1988: 16, quoted in Wibben 2010:
44). A deconstructive approach necessitates consideration of the way
they are 'read, understood and located institutionally' because, for
example, the [existence of narratives of women in the third world does
not necessarily equate to a challenge to established **hegemonic
histories** and their subjectivities]{.underline} (Mohanty, 1991, quoted
in Cooke, 1996: 292). The mediatization of war means that the
'delocalized world' of TV, newspapers and the internet is where battles
over 'legitimacy, effectiveness and consequences are fought' (Behnke,
2002: 198). Therefore, understanding NATO's engagement with digital
diplomacy and the narratives that underpin it is important, yet NATO's
public diplomacy efforts have been left on the margins of scholarly
analysis of the alliance. This is significant given that, as Ringsmose
and Borgesen (2011: 524) argue, in a world of international cooperation
and international media, [national narratives are not formed in a
vacuum]{.underline}. It also leaves work on the use of strategic
narratives by both governments (Jakobsen and Ringsmose, 2015; Ringsmose
and Børgesen, 2011) and militaries (Crilley, 2015; 2016) separated from
the wider regional security context. The use of digital platforms by
governments and military actors is on one level an attempt to engage the
media and at its most successful this can contribute to the formation of
successful strategic narratives, which turns the media into a 'conveyor
belt transmitting elite cues to the public' (Jakobsen and Ringsmose,
2015: 217). However, it can also be viewed as a means to circumnavigate
the traditional dissemination of information through the media in order
to engage directly with consumers (Crilley, 2016: 55). The remit of
NATO's Public Diplomacy Division supports both of these purposes, with
the division tasked with complementing information activities within
each member state and addressing issues related to the public perception
of the alliance (Public Diplomacy Divison, 2006: 333). The recalibration
of NATO's public diplomacy to engage with digital platforms came in part
as a result of the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan and the
Taliban's ability to grab both the Afghan and international media's
attention with civilian casualty numbers (Betz, 2011: 622). To address
this issue, NATO created a specific media centre hosted in Afghanistan,
the web-based NATO TV platform, and appointed Michael Stopford as Deputy
Assistant Secretary General for Strategic Communication. Stopford had
been credited with bolstering Coca-Cola's image and reputation in his
previous role as an executive for the company (Castle, 2008). This
resulted in a change in NATO's approach to public diplomacy through a
shift to direct engagement with publics through digital platforms. The
alliance now has a significant digital presence across multiple social
media platforms: for example, [NATO TV]{.underline} (now hosted on
YouTube) [features short explanatory clips on NATO,]{.underline} NATO's
military capabilities and short documentary style stories, [including on
Afghanistan]{.underline}. NATO TV provides a useful insight into NATO's
approach to digital diplomacy, and while the primary video featured on
the channel is one detailing what NATO is and why it exists, the three
[most viewed videos]{.underline} across the site [are]{.underline} on
ballistic missile defence, [female prisoners in a prison in
Herat]{.underline} and the food scene in Kabul (NATO, 2017). This
demonstrates that [NATO's digital diplomacy strategy is]{.underline} not
just concerned with selling NATO and NATO's 'hard power' but has
[utilized more contextualized narratives to inform outreach
initiatives]{.underline}. It also draws attention to the way [gendered
narratives are utilized to support NATO's digital diplomacy
strategy.]{.underline} The [prominence given to women's stories on the
YouTube challenge has been the subject of critique,]{.underline} which
concerned the alliance's apparent [**'failure'** to explicitly link a
video showing **Afghan women voting** in the 2015 presidential election
to the alliance's ('hard power') actions to support this]{.underline}
(Seib, 2014: 98). However, this analysis misrepresents the purpose of
NATO's public diplomacy, where in respect of public information
campaigns the intention is not to sell 'hard power', nor to engage in
promoting the alliance to individuals already supportive of its agenda
but rather to permeate a wider audience.1 In relation to public
diplomacy campaigns linked to NATO enlargement in Central Europe, this
was also evident, with discussions of NATO framed 'around the notions of
rights, peace, culture, and values', rather than defence (Kuus, 2007:
271). As NATO's Head of Communication has stated, the intention of such
content is for individuals to be drawn to it not because it is about
NATO, but because of the issue it addresses (Inside Agency, 2014). In
applying feminist analysis it is possible to see how [**gendered
narratives** are **instrumentalized** by the alliance to
support]{.underline} (in this case) a [tacit association of NATO with
women's rights]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} in turn [reinforces the
secondary **justification underpinning** the **war in Afghanistan**,
that the action was taken in order to liberate Afghan women]{.underline}
(Shepherd, 2006). The (continued) [instrumentalization of (Afghan) women
Afghan women have been **central to Western involvement** in
Afghanistan, far predating the 2001 intervention]{.underline}. Efforts
to 'modernize' women's status in Afghanistan go as far back as the early
20th century (Kabeer and Khan, 2014: 5). However, the Western approach
to Afghan women has been far from consistent, underscoring its
instrumentality. For example, [during the rise to power of the
Soviet-backed regime in Kabul and the subsequent Soviet occupation
(1979--1989) efforts were made to emancipate women]{.underline}
(Kabeerand Khan, 2014: 1). At this time, the [US conveniently left
women's rights off the agenda in formulating its opposition to Soviet
action]{.underline}s, although the US was drawing upon women's rights to
oppose other regimes at the time (Enloe, 1989: 57[). The selective and
instrumental use of women's rights in US foreign policy was reinforced
when the US-backed mujahidin came to power in Afghanistan in
1992]{.underline} and ushered in one of the worst periods of human
rights abuses the country had seen. The subsequent overthrow of the
mujahidin in 1994 by the Taliban led to severe restrictions on women's
rights, including to movement, work and education (Kabeer and Khan,
2014: 2). As Kandiyoti (2007: 505) argues, [women's rights have 'become
implicated in the geopolitical manoeuvrings of powerful global actors'
and this makes the invocation of the 'principled politics solidarity',
which has emerged in the **War on Terror**,]{.underline} extremely
problematic. The discourse surrounding the US-led intervention in
Afghanistan in 2001, and subsequent NATO-led ISAF operation has been
noticeably gendered. As Messerschmidt (2016: 167) identifies, [Bush and
Obama drew on a masculinist protection logic in their articulations of
the War on Terror]{.underline}, which [constructed a particular gendered
villain--victim--hero discourse in order to gain support for their
actions]{.underline} both globally and regionally. Their speeches
constructed the hero--villain relationship as unequally gendered, with
the hero -- the US -- [occupying a **hegemonic masculinized position**
as 'civilized, virtuous, just and peaceful']{.underline}, [while the
subordinate masculinized villain -- the Taliban -- was 'uncivilized,
cruel, unjust, and violent']{.underline}. In contrast, [all '**other'
people** in the world were **feminized,** framed as 'passively
dependent, innocent, uniformed, vulnerable and unable to protect
themselves']{.underline} (Messerschmidt, 2016: 169). Feminine
subordination in the masculinist protection model is not submission,
rather it is undertaken willingly, with adoration expressed for the
protector (Young, 2003b: 3). [This saw Afghan women framed as victims
and, as such, **in need of rescue,** along with the rest of the
world]{.underline}. In November 2001, Laura Bush made history when she
became the first First Lady to give the President's radio address,
shortly after the start of the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom
intervention in Afghanistan. She drew heavily on the experiences of
Afghan women in making her case in support of the intervention:
Civilized people throughout the world are speaking out in horror -- not
only because [our hearts break for the women and children in
Afghanistan, but also because in Afghanistan we see the world the
terrorists would like to impose on the rest of us]{.underline}. (Bush,
2001) The address invoked [the **emancipation of Afghan women** as
supplementary to the **primary justification** that the intervention was
a necessary defensive action to protect American people following the
attacks of 9/11 and was framed around the **masculinist protection
logic**]{.underline}. As Cooke (2002: 485--486) points out, the
rationale presented was that to defend our universal civilisation we
must rescue the women. To rescue these women we must attack these men;
[These women are to be rescued not because they are more 'ours' than
'theirs' but rather because they will have become more 'ours' through
the rescue mission]{.underline}. Following the 2001 intervention in
Afghanistan, women became beneficial not just in rhetoric but in both
doctrine and practice to population centric counter-insurgency (Dyvik,
2013: 412). [This was most visible in the military's use of Female
Engagement Teams (FETs) intended to engage local
populations]{.underline}. FETs both [mirrored essentalized notions of
women as peaceful and instrumentalized gender as a 'new strategic
asset]{.underline}', [enabling women to engage in the post-9/11
masculinist protectionist narrative]{.underline} (Pratt, 2013: 778). The
gendering of counterinsurgency also served to demonstrate that the US
was 'no longer fighting its new battles with outmoded methods' (Mcbride
and Wibben, 2012: 200). FETs were a new initiative but, as one member of
a FET later reflected, 'we were tourists, unable to solve problems with
units that changed every 12 months. Everything was temporary, except
Afghanistan' (Pope, 2016). The preoccupation of the Western interveners
with 'rescuing' Afghan women has both imperialist undertones and
political implications (Khan, 2013: 105). The centrality of Afghan women
to the NATO-led ISAF mission in Afghanistan has pervaded every element
of the intervention, with public diplomacy and strategic communication
no exception. This is exemplified in a classified CIA document released
through Wikileaks (CIA \[Wikileaks\], 2010) which notes: Afghan women
could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing the ISAF role in combating
the Taliban because of women's ability to speak personally and credibly
about their experiences under the Taliban, their aspirations for the
future, and their fears of a Taliban victory. Outreach initiatives that
create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with
French, German, and other European women could help to overcome
pervasive scepticism among women in Western Europe toward the ISAF.

Philip **Olson** and Christine **Labuski**, 8-7-20**18**, \"'There's
always a \[white\] man in the loop': The gendered and racialized
politics of civilian drones,\" SAGE Journals,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0306312718792619

As corporations and civilian actors grasp the economic potential for
UAS, drones are becoming an increasingly common sight in US civilian
airspace. Non-military UAS have existed for decades, consisting mainly
of remote control (RC) aircraft used by amateur pilots and hobbyists,
but the past decade has seen UAS pressed into service for a wider range
of purposes, including agriculture, search and rescue, cinematography
and remote sensing (The Economist, 2017). And while military-domestic
transfers of technology are common, advancements in civilian drone
technologies also benefit the military by offloading research and
development to the private sector (Boucher, 2015). [Widely perceived as
'exceptional \[military\] tools', drones 'are fast becoming everyday
tools' (Shaw et al., 2012: 1505), and UAS are often deployed in similar
ways across both military and domestic contexts. Targeted surveillance
is among the most conspicuous of shared applications]{.underline}. UAS
visualizing capacities developed alongside the use of other technologies
for surveillance, including 'security' cameras, cell phones, laptop
computers, body and dashboard cameras, global positioning systems (GPS)
and geographic information systems (GIS). [The near-ubiquity of
surveillance devices has led to what some scholars refer to as an age of
omniveillance, in which 'everyone will soon be watched, targeted, and
tracked' (Shaw et al., 2012: 1505) and where it is 'unreasonable to
expect to not be recorded at all']{.underline} (Tran, 2015: 195). Though
often referred to in ordinary and distributive terms (Bell, 2009;
Koskela, 2012), [these surveillance technologies index a 'scopic regime'
(Gregory, 2011: 190) through which **social hierarchies of race, gender
and geopolitical location are enacted and enforced in intrusive and
often violent ways**]{.underline}**.** AbuLaban (2015) refers to this
regime, including [its ability to render a growing number of people
'targetable']{.underline}, as a 'key organizational practice of late
modernity' (p. 46). We identify two broad groups in our study:
established and emerging users. In comparison with emerging users, who
exhibit a range of interest in and understanding of the roles that UAS
will play in their lives, established users possess more of the
technical knowledge, skills and control through which UAS have thus far
been interpreted. [A key distinction between our two user groups is
demographic: established users are almost exclusively white and
male/masculine, while emerging users are more diversely
identified]{.underline} (Mellström, 2004; Wajcman, 1991). Given that
established users have been tasked with advising the FAA on civilian UAS
regulation, it is important to consider not only who might soon be
sharing the sky with law enforcement, farmers and hobbyists, but also
how drone technologies are discursively constructed across these
populations[. In this study, established users aligned -- though not to
a person -- with the focus groups that contained the highest percentages
of men]{.underline}: TEST, SCI and USER. And though we are keenly aware
of gender's arbitrary and plural nature (Connell, 1998), the [men from
these groups enacted a strikingly consistent hegemonic
masculinity]{.underline} (Connell and Messerschimdt, 2005), one that
valued and elevated technological expertise, even as it left unmarked
the stratified social origins of this technoscientific knowledge
(Cockburn, 1985). In this essay[, we interpret the discourse of these
white technomasculine experts as a form of prototypical white
technomasculinity.]{.underline} Our data also suggest that
[military-civilian continuities persist for established users and that
this group sees the challenges to greater civilian uptake of UAS as
technical and individual rather than collective and
justice-oriented]{.underline}. Sclove (1995) refers to focal and
non-focal features of technological systems, [but our analysis of race,
gender and drones reveals that we can also distinguish between focal and
non-focal peop]{.underline}le, or groups of people -- that is[, between
the perspectives of those who control the development of civilian UAS
and those whose lives are more likely to be disrupted or menaced by
these systems.]{.underline} Surveillance remains central to how UAS are
imagined and we further argue that via prototypical white
technomasculinity -- a subject position interpreted as original,
standard and in no need of justification (Gordon, 2006: 242) --
surveillance can be perceived as unproblematic and even 'cool'. This
perspective [differs sharply from how surveillance technologies are
experienced and described by so-called minority groups in the US and
elsewhere, including people of color (of all genders), women (of all
racial groups), and queer and other nonconforming people]{.underline}
(e.g. Abu-Laban, 2015; Browne, 2015; Tran, 2015). We employ the term
'so-called' here in order to underscore that though white
technomasculine people often understand their discourse to reflect a
neutral or majoritarian stance, it is more accurate to describe them as
a particular minority interest group. Browne suggests that the
experiences [of **black women in particular**,]{.underline} whose lives
[**are routinely subjected to** what she calls 'a **scrutinizing
surveillance'**]{.underline} (Browne, 2015: 156), can be instructive for
interrogating the racialized and gendered dimensions of security and
surveillance. It is our worry [that racialized and gender minorities in
the US will bear a disproportionate burden of what Koskela (2012) calls
'the fruits of surveillant labor']{.underline} (p. 53). Related, we are
concerned that uncritical and/or under-informed perspectives on UAS will
mask the role of discriminatory attitudes and affects in shaping how
these technologies are deployed. Prototypical white technomasculinity
camouflages digitized data as both neutral and precise, despite the fact
that even cursory assessments of such data reveal that algorithms rely
upon developers' perceptions of normality and difference (Magnet, 2011;
Wilcox, 2017). Gender and race are 'intertwine\[d\] with practices of
intense information gathering' and '\[d\]isciplinary power and control'
(Koskela, 2012: 50) and, in military contexts, analysts have argued that
drone surveillance and signature strikes are often 'little more than a
form of high-tech racial profiling' (Wall, 2016: 1123). In sum, though
there might be [consensus regarding **military drones' capacity to carry
out 'lethal surveillance'**]{.underline}, there is [disagreement among
differently 'targetable' populations regarding the dangerous nature of
civilian UAS.]{.underline} Following Browne (2015: 116--121), we
advocate for the cultivation of a critical technological consciousness
in relation to civilian UAS. Such a consciousness would apprehend the
particularity of the white technomasculine perspective -- evinced here
by our focus groups -- through which UAS are constructed, and would
advocate for 'informed public debate ... accountability by the state and
the private sector', and an acknowledgement of the 'connections between
contemporary ... \[UAS\] technologies and their historical antecedents'
(p. 116). Absent such a consciousness, the [public uptake of commercial
drones will likely rehearse the social hierarchies by which they were
generated and that perpetuate unmarked **white
technomasculinity**]{.underline}. To highlight the constructed
specificity of this subject position, we use transcript data from the
white technomasculine actors in our focus groups to demonstrate that
[UAS can scarcely be discussed]{.underline} -- by these actors and those
they influence -- [without masculine pronouns and imagined scenarios
involving exclusively male actors. We refer to this discourse as a
**white technomasculine imaginary**]{.underline}, given the
disproportionate role these actors play in designing, employing and now
regulating these and other technologies. Such an imaginary may constrain
the abilities of emerging users to identify and develop alternative
uses, questions and ethical norms related to civilian drones.
Highlighting the specificity of white technomasculinity helps us to see
that [masculinities are not only constructed and plural, but also
contingent upon the mutable social arrangements through which they are
upheld]{.underline} (Cockburn, 1985; Connell, 1998; Salter, 2014).
Civilian UAS [**technologies** may **facilitate new ways of living race
and gender** in an omniveillant world]{.underline}; we note focus group
moments where anxiety and vulnerability inhere in white
technomasculinity. Here we join Daggett (2015) in asking whether
civilian drones, despite their militaristic and imperial origins, can
subvert or even queer social relations. Though not currently marketed as
tools with which emerging users can engage in sousveillant acts --
'taking back the night' or 'shooting back' (Beirne et al., 1997), for
example -- our focus groups suggest that drones have the capacity to
produce ontological insecurity in white technomasculine actors who may
newly perceive themselves as 'targetable'.

Safety and Wellbeing [In traditional foreign policy approaches, security
is given high priority.]{.underline} Concepts such as national or human
security represent understandings of governments on what to target or
how to achieve security. Feminists have criticized both concepts because
these approaches ignore or overlook the gendered dimension of
security.35 [Feminist security studies emphasize and elaborate the
importance of asking questions such as "security for who, by whom?"36 It
is the questioning of the militarized security that is not able to
protect women, children, civilians, migrants, among others, neither in
times of conflict nor in times of peace.]{.underline}37 Feminist
security studies emphasize the [need to rethink traditional concepts of
security.]{.underline} Putting the security issues of all intersectional
groups and individuals at the center of security, the usefulness of the
military industrial complex will have to be questioned.38 [Buying tanks
or fighter jets are not preventing children from dying of hunger,
stopping preventable diseases from spreading, or averting gender based
violence. Instead, this form of security often perpetuates these
situations.]{.underline}39 In an ever-changing society featuring
dynamically evolving conflicts, Sylvester emphasizes that there is a
[need to]{.underline} always review, reframe, and reflect on current
approaches of security and [avoid the formulation of universal,
timeless, and fixed security concepts.]{.underline}40 With this in mind,
[we refrain from unpacking the concept of security, and we support
feminist ideas of shifting the focus from security toward the peace,
safety, and wellbeing of the gendered individual. Wellbeing, in this
vein, includes physical safety in addition to the social and political
security of people and the fulfillment of basic social needs. We argue
that the way problems are framed inherently influences the way solutions
are found. While defining security not through the absence of violence
but through the foundations of peace, world leaders can commit to
peace]{.underline} through, for example, renaming the United Nations
Security Council into the United Nations Peace Council. Feminist Foreign
Policy demands shifting toward a positive peace model and away from
security. Empathic Communities The third indicator we have identified is
based on the building of empathic communities. We differentiate between
alliances based on military or defense strategies and communities based
on empathy and friendship. Alliances such as [the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO),]{.underline} the Collective Security Treaty
Organization (CSTO), or even the current structure of the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC), [serve the goal of engaging in alliances to
advance militarized security and national interests. These coalitions
further capitalize on the fundamental values of neo-realism in
international politics and represent the hegemonic security model.
Because these alliances always come with implicit assumptions such as
the presence of an enemy, a threat, and power conflict, violent
escalation often proves inevitable.]{.underline} Feminism claims that
there are [more reasons for building communities, which are not about
military and power, but rather about common goals such as peace,
mutually beneficial trade agreements, or agreements on disarmament.
Those can eventually build trust and dependencies so that attacks and
war would seem illogical. Communities such as the Group of Friends of
1325, the Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace, and Security, and
Friends of Gender Parity are built on agreements that open dialogue
builds trust and empathy.]{.underline}

### 1NC- Feminist Failure

#### Thus, the alternative is to reject the aff and embrace feminist failure. This is a politics that requires a gendered thinking of the political to open discursive space for feminist interventions to unsettle the comfortability of the 1AC.

"Feminist fatigue(s): reflections on feminism and familiar fables of
militarization" Review of International Studies (2009), 35, 611--630,
Cambridge journals, JKS)**

In this article we pick up on the contradictory threads running through
the account above to re-consider the work of feminist scholarship in the
study of international politics through the specific example of familiar
feminist fables of militarisation. The rest of the article will proceed
as follows. First, we will explain why we think it matters to have a
discussion about feminism framed by its location within the disciplinary
boundaries of the academic study of international politics. We then move
to explain what we mean by the performative predicament of sexgender and
the attached weariness inflecting feminist narratives; we then give
readings of how this predicament plays out in what we call familiar
feminist fables of militarisation. Finally, **[we return to the question
of feminism's failure,]{.underline}** [working with the idea of failure
as being part of the process of intervening politically]{.underline}.7
In an associated move, [we consider the grammar of temporality that
haunts representations of feminism.]{.underline} We argue that [this
grammar]{.underline} or logic [of temporality glues feminism to a
generational trajectory of]{.underline} activity [always seemingly en
route to proffering a solution to gender -- unsurprisingly beckoning an
unavoidable failing to ever arrive]{.underline}. We work with [the
spectre of feminist failure --]{.underline} which we suggest
**[is]{.underline}** one of **[the dominant motifs of feminism
within]{.underline}** contemporary **[IR]{.underline}** theory -- to
accomplish two tasks. One is to interrogate the implications of the
performative production of sexgender through feminism, which, although
well discussed in feminist theory more generally, has not been
adequately attended to in the field of International Relations. We link
the discussion of feminism's reproduction of sexgender to the ongoing
implicit and explicit expectation that a central task of feminism is to
produce effective and productive knowledge in a conventionally
recognisably temporal and political manner.9 [Feminism's 'failure' to
ever 'fully arrive' is suggestive of unfulfilled expectations in this
context]{.underline}. Our overall concern has to do with the multiple
violences that persistently prevail in the construction of theories of
international politics -- and which can be traced through reading the
production of feminist failure in IR, as demonstrated through our
familiar narratives of militarisation. We ultimately suggest [that
failure to resolve the predicaments that feminist
**I**]{.underline}nternational **[R]{.underline}**elations [scholarship
appears to face may be alternatively presented as a specific political
and pedagogical stance which offers]{.underline} potential [aporetic
room for 'thinking otherwise' about the production of
knowledge]{.underline}. In conclusion [we reflect on the atmosphere of
feminist anxiety, or melancholia]{.underline}, that the article infers,
[culminating with the suggestion that **failure and disenchantment
are**]{.underline} perhaps **[necessary to re-imagine the possibilities
of unrecognisable interventions that lie at the heart of feminist
political imaginations]{.underline}**. Feminism/International Relations
We are not offering a conventional audit of feminist work in
International Relations in this article;14 rather, our focus is
primarily on one thread of the discursive production of feminism within
the discipline of International Relations. traditional forms of feminism
have fared in relation to and in competition with conventional theories
of international politics. Such studies clearly privilege IR's
boundaries but also tend to work with a very parsimonious definition of
feminism.15 Our approach works with a more expansive and malleable
understand- ing of the practices and possibilities of feminism. Hence,
it is not our intention to measure how far feminism has succeeded in the
context of the discipline's conventional epistemological, methodological
and political boundaries,16 or to prove in some kind of neo-scientific
way that IR has 'got it wrong', but rather to investigate some
implications of the discursive representation and production of feminism
within the discipline. We argue that one of the dominant motifs or
signatures of feminism within IR is one of decline and demise
particularly in relation to feminism's theoretical and methodological
potential.17 These apparent tired limits of feminism within IR mirror a
quandary facing feminist scholarship more generally.18 Manifestations of
this quandary include a certain lassitude inflecting narratives about
gender weaved through feminism parsimoniously represented,19 accompanied
by a sense that feminism is becoming increasingly obsolete.20 As noted
above, we investigate this quandary in order to think more deeply, if
tangentially through feminism, about the limitations and accompanying
violence that marks the academic production of knowledge,21 as well as
to ponder feminism's own performative function in this regard. [Feminist
scholars have consistently focused on the knowledge that authoritative
accounts of the world accredited by academic institutions generates; and
as an historically hyper-masculinised discipline, IR has always been a
significant empirical site to investigate, not least its role in
discursively reproducing gender and related power
structures,]{.underline} regimes and practices.23 In this overly 'manly
\[inter- national\] moment,'24 **[it]{.underline}** therefore **[remains
important to reflect on the gendered power that pervades the
construction and performance of scholarly
investigations]{.underline}**.25 [This entails continuing to scrutinise
the discursive production of feminism in the context of its
representation within the disciplinary boundaries of the academic study
of international politics]{.underline}, especially as this is an arena
which has embarked on a re-energised (re)turn toward hegemonic
certainty.26 In our investigation of this we have chosen to focus our
inquiry on demonstrating how, in the production of feminist narratives
of militarisation through IR, we can glimpse traces of how
'organizational practices play a central role in recreating and
entrenching gender hierarchies, gender symbols and gender identities.'
To carry this enquiry forward we therefore offer a doubly layered and
interlocking reading of the general discursive production of feminism
within IR, as exemplified in stories of militarisation. We work with the
paradox of feminism's apparent failure within IR given that, at this
historical juncture, the nexus of feminism and global politics calls for
harder work to mitigate the harms produced through gender and that
feminist work is globally abundant.28 The idea that feminism has
apparently failed in regard to its own normative ambitions given that
global gendered inequality remains endemic calls for careful
reflection.29 Though all certainly do not ascribe to the belief that the
task of feminist scholars in IR is to accurately map gender relations in
order to prescribe solutions to gender(ed) violence, the idea that this
is the purpose of feminist work -- however diffusely articulated -- is
nonetheless widespread.30 And clearly feminist scholars/activists have
not shied away from this remit; indeed quite the opposite, as they/we
have seemingly eagerly grasped apparent opportunities to alter unjust
gendered struc- tures and practices. Such normative projects have indeed
been perceived to be the hallmark and raison d'être of much feminist
activity.31 Correspondingly, **[feminist scholars have]{.underline}**
traditionally **[been expected to respond to the task of 'doing some-
thing',]{.underline}** hopefully **[practical and
tangible]{.underline}**, [about the disadvantages which have ensued from
cultural constructions of gender]{.underline}.32 Indeed, [in our view it
is increasingly politically and pedagogically required by]{.underline}
what we call [the burgeoning 'gender industry,' for feminist scholars to
strive towards providing effective knowledge to this end, including,
for]{.underline} example, [the formulation of policy,]{.underline}
especially policies [for gender mainstreaming,]{.underline} or through
the delivery of academic programmes in universities or to meet
institutional research auditing and funding requirements.

### 1NC- Reproductive Futurism

#### The aff's drive to prevent extinction is a form of [masculine survivalism]{.underline} where gendered bodies become the unwilling tools to sustain humanity. You should refuse their obsession with patriarchal reproduction.

**[The reproduction of survival/ the survival of
reproduction]{.underline}**

[Extinction is almost always understood against the horizon of survival
and the imperative to sustain it -- at least for life forms deemed to be
of value to humans.]{.underline} In many cases, this imperative takes
the form of deliberate strategies for enforcing existence. Donna
Haraway's influential book When Species Meet devotes considerable
attention to the logics, practices and politics of Species Survival
Plans. These plans monitor and enforce reproduction amongst 'endangered'
species, not least by collecting data on populations, genetic profiles
and genetic materials to enable selective breeding. [This strategy
assumes that all organisms can, should, and can be made to exercise
their reproductive capacities in order to resist extinction, and it
actively mobilizes members of 'endangered species']{.underline} into
this project. In so doing, **[it helps to entrench norms regarding
gender, sexuality and reproductive labour]{.underline}** that are deeply
entrenched in modern, Western human cultures. Attention to these
programmes **[highlights an important way in which extinction is
gendered in dominant scientific and policy frameworks]{.underline}**.
Specifically, [strategic breeding programmes share in the belief that
reproduction is an imperative for those capable of reproducing if 'the
species' is at risk']{.underline}. **[This belief is directly related to
Western norms of the reproductive imperative for women]{.underline}**.
Indeed, Haraway points out that it [is precisely "'woman's' putative
self-defining responsibility to 'the species' as this singular and
typological female is reduced to her reproductive
function]{.underline}". In a similar sense, within SSPs and other
strategies of enforced survival, entire life forms are reduced to their
reproductive capacities. Moreover, programmes of enforced survival can,
in the context of sexual reproduction, disproportionately burden female
organisms with the task of avoiding extinction. [This logic is
particularly fraught in discussions of the possibility of human
extinction, in which female fertility (captured in the standard policy
language of 'births per woman') is framed simultaneously as a threat to
survival, and the only hope for escaping extinction (]{.underline}see,
for instance, Alan Weisman's comments on this). In these ways, **[the
securitization of survival entrenches the intersectional categories of
gender, species and race]{.underline}** discussed above. [Dominant
discourses of extinction and conservation also entrench and privilege
sexual reproduction, in ways that entrench heteronormative assumptions
and norms]{.underline}. This is reflected in the way that the subjects
of extinction and conservation are framed. The standard object of
conservation is the biological 'species', a term which is defined by the
ability of organisms to reproduce sexually. As Myra Hird has pointed
out, this conception of 'species' makes it appear as if sexual
reproduction is the 'best' means of sustaining the existence of a life
form. However, Hird's work demonstrates that Earthly life forms actually
engage in myriad forms of reproduction, from the free exchange of DNA
between bacteria to the hermaphroditic practices of some fish. The
upshot of these arguments is that Earthly life is sustained through a
huge variety of reproductive activities that do not conform to
biological understandings of life processes or species. Crucially, Hird
argues that there is no necessary hierarchy between forms of
reproduction. In Darwinian terms, all species that manage to survive are
equally successful. However, [by conflating survival with sexual
reproduction**, existing discourses of extinction embed hetero-normative
frameworks that devalue other forms of reproduction**. They also reduce
reproduction to the imperative to survive, ignoring the myriad cultural,
political, aesthetic, sensual and other dimensions of
reproduction.]{.underline}

#### The panic over potential threats to the nation is a form of [masculine futurity]{.underline} which allows reproductive bodies to be regulated. Claims of utilitarianism justify the endless sacrifice of reproductive freedom in the name of the "greatest good."

Cultural theorist Ruth McElroy suggests, "Women's belonging to nations
is indissoluble from their reproductive biology" (325). For all that
motherhood may be conceived as a private choice occurring in the
supposedly private sphere, reproduction and motherhood are nonetheless
public and political as well, and thoroughly entangled with women's
status as members of their nation. By virtue of their reproduction (or
even lack thereof!), women can be constructed in cultural narratives and
political scripts as contributors to society or threats to the national
good, caretakers of the future who merit protection and support or
wayward parents who must be disciplined back into the national fold,
national maternal ideals or outsiders within. The state's identification
of and response to women as reproducers reflects the continuous
processes of the politics of belonging, which "involve not only the
maintenance and reproduction of the boundaries of the community of
belonging by the hegemonic political powers\...but also by their
contestation, challenge and resistance by other political agents"
(Yuval-Davis 20). [We see these politics of belonging manifested not
only discursively, but also in the policies and laws that protect or
privilege some mothers and not others, some children, but not
all.]{.underline} When anthropologists Faye Ginsburg and Rayna Rapp ask,
"who defines the body of the nation into which the next generation is
recruited? Who is considered to be in that national body, who is out of
it?" (3), therefore, there is no one answer; rather, this is the
question perpetually being asked and answered by political discourse and
practice infused with the logic of futurity. [[The hopes and fears of
the present]{.mark}]{.underline} political moment [[and the imaginative
desires for the future are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[continually
projected upon the bodies of women and their procreative
capacities]{.underline}. [Futurity]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} I
suggest in this project, as a possibly inevitable perspective or
worldview[, [allows]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[the state to focus on
women as reproductive beings in a way that it does not for
men]{.mark}.]{.underline} Following from Foucault's explication of
biopower, the modern state takes an interest in the workings and
ostensible health of its populations, creating new knowledges and
indices for the normal as it counts up the characteristics of its
citizenry and sets goals for demographic management. While Foucault
tends not to focus on the reproductive elements of the state's
biopolitical interest---for instance, the setting of ideal rates of
fertility, health expectations for women and children, creation of
access to the medical, economic, and social resources needed for
reproduction---these are, I would argue, operations of the state that
have potential for tremendous impacts upon women particularly. The other
biopolitical interests of the state---appropriate number of workers,
manageable immigration rates, proper ratio of elderly to young, and so
on---are also all implicated in the procreative behaviors of women,
which would seem to intensify the state's interest in them. Brought into
the broader framework of women's political status and national
belonging, [reproduction in this context seems poised to function as an
axis upon which the dispensation of women's citizenship can pivot, with
particular regard to her racial, economic, and social demographic and
the state's assessment of her (and her children's) value to the national
future]{.underline}. Penelope Deutscher suggests that through the
emergence of biopower: Women would later assume a status as a
reproductive threshold of the future and health of nations, populations
and peoples. But [[the condition for this role for women and maternal
reproductivity was the very possibility of reproduction being associated
with]{.mark} a shifting field of possible substances, telos, outcomes
and obligations:]{.underline} **[[the overall good, the general
happiness, the future]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the nation, the
**[[health of the nation, the competitiveness of the nation,]{.mark} the
future of the people, individual flourishing or freedom, individual
rights,]{.underline}** domestic happiness, the family unit as building
block of the nation, the transmission of the bloodline, the family name,
transmission of property or family or genealogical transmission,
[reproduction of the labour force]{.underline}, etc. [That reproduction
be plausibly thought of in such terms at all was a precondition of it
becoming associated with women's role as threshold of futurity.
(]{.underline}Deutscher 129) **[[The state's biopolitical management of
women's reproduction]{.mark}]{.underline}** may thus **[[allow it to
approach women primarily as reproductive beings, an
essentalist]{.mark}]{.underline}** or even **[[utilitarian collapse
that]{.mark}]{.underline}** may **[[make it easier to intervene upon
their bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}** and perhaps **[[reflects a deeply
ingrained discomfort with the notion that women have tremendous
potential power to impact the composition of the
future]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In this project, I am proposing [[a
framework of futurity that]{.mark} is in operation, characterized by
discursive and eugenic aspects, that [uses women as the vehicle for
future world-building and nation-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
futurity [[aims to enact]{.mark}]{.underline} particular [[visions of
the future via changes in the present]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly
[[through the management of women's reproduction in the
present]{.underline}]{.mark} such that the future population comports
with present desires. [When this futurity framework is picked up by the
state in its various capacities,]{.underline} I suggest [there are
significant consequences for women's citizenship as women because they
are so intrinsically linked in the cultural and political imaginary with
reproduction.]{.underline} In the process of grappling with these
concepts, this project asks how the logic of futurity functions to
organize the terms of women's social or political belonging in
reproductive terms. How does the state pick up and extend this logic to
women, and how might that impact the meaningfulness of women's
citizenship or national belonging? Does the logic of futurity, the
constant pressure of the forward vision combined with the imaginative
limitations of the present, insist upon women's citizenship being or
becoming something fundamentally different from men's by virtue of
reproductive capacity and association? Exploring these questions brings
this project into several disciplinary contexts, including feminist
theory and philosophy, political theory, disability theory (eugenics),
and even the sphere of economics. In connecting these concepts to
ongoing conversations about women and citizenship in the contemporary
United States, this project is ultimately working to tie together
disparate fields and illuminate how they interact with respect to a
model of futurity that I theorize as containing discursive and eugenic
aspects. It may be that state-based discourses and practices related to
women's reproduction and citizenship are not so much causes as they are
effects of the logic of futurity.

discussion, rather than serve as a systematic treatise.]{.underline} The
[conflicts and contestations both among feminists in Feminist Security
Studies and between feminists and security that have come up in this
conversation are not an outline of problems that need to be
solved]{.underline} or divides that need to be crossed, healed, or
closed. Instead, **[those debates, along with how they are handled and
addressed, constitute Feminist Security Studies.]{.underline}** Feminist
Security Studies, then, neither needs to solve nor ignore either the
fundamental differences among feminists or the dissonance between
Feminist Security Studies and security studies as a discipline. Instead,
Feminist Security Studies is defined not only by its fundamental
contestabilities but also by its actual contestations. [Feminist
Security Studies is not the sum of the different approaches or the
winner of the debate between them, but the narrative generated from
their arguments, disagreements, and compromises]{.underline}.

### Subject Formation

#### Subject formation comes first---the community they create will inevitably privilege masculine comfortability and dismiss feminist connections- building a feminist affect is necessary to form embodied collectives that drive political action.

**Chamberlain 16**

**(Prudence, Department of English, Royal Holloway University (2016):
Affective temporality: towards a fourth wave, Gender and Education, DOI:
10.1080/09540253.2016.1169249, JKS)**

This discussion of the contemporary and feminist timekeeping serves as a
framing device for the way in which the wave narrative can be considered
as an '[affective temporality'. Social movements are bound to emotional
convergences,]{.underline} in which [feeling becomes transferred amongst
wider groups, encouraging]{.underline} them to [action**. This is
central to initiating and**]{.underline} then **[sustaining surges of
feminist activism]{.underline}**, [drawing]{.underline} a number of
[subjects together through shared investment within a specific
historical moment]{.underline}. The formulations of affect also mirror
the way in which the contemporary is constructed through Agamben's work,
allowing for activists to cohere while still remaining without set
definition. In The Affect Theory Reader, Melissa Gregg and Gregory J.
Seigworth state that 'affect is born in in-between-ness and resides in
accumulative besides-ness' (2010, 2). This sense of 'beside- ness'
mirrors the simultaneity of the contemporary, while the 'between-ness'
relates to the idea that feminism is caught in temporal tension, in
which the past dictates and future aspirations orientate. [Affect also
explores the relationship between the private and the
public,]{.underline} as Love out- lines when she writes: [Politics and
feelings are very different kinds of things; the public sphere is big,
feelings are small; social life happens out there, psychic life,
somewhere inside; public time is collective time, measured by the clock,
whereas in psychic life the trains hardly ever run on time]{.underline}.
(2007, 11) Inevitably, it is challenging to map what is ostensibly a
more personal and feeling sphere onto a wider public, or indeed vice
versa. However, **[despite the difference between public and personal,
affect creates an undeniable relationship between the
two]{.underline}**. [The feminist tenet that the 'personal is political'
encourages a shared public intimacy, which is central to the
transference and perpetuation of affect. Airing feeling]{.underline},
and [allowing feeling to be aired, creates a context in which responses
and emotions become integral to a political collective]{.underline}.
Cvetkovich writes that she views '[affect as a motivational system and
as the ground for forging new collectivities']{.underline} (2003, 12).
Resonating with the formulation of waves affects may serve to catalyse
and sustain a surge of related activity. If feminist unity is no longer
pre- dicated on identity, then common ground is found through political
aims. The movement away from collectives determined by shared
characteristics to those formed through shared feeling creates a
feminism that is able to adapt and evolve with affect at its centre.
[Affect may]{.underline} in fact [work as an adhesive for political
subjects, sticking them together through shared feeling]{.underline}
(Ahmed 2010). **[Affect]{.underline}**, then, **[is able to form
collectives that are driven to political action through feeling, forming
a cohesive series of relations and connections.]{.underline}**

### AT: You're Just Theory!

#### The process of the alt is much more than just "theory". It recognizes that feminists work with concrete rather than abstract senses of the political and prioritize grounded senses of theory, that works actively with the socially located circumstances of feminine lives

**Weber 2k**

**(Cynthia Weber (2000), Professor of International Studies, University
of Leeds, Why IR needs theory/practice debates: Or, from enlightenment
to romanticism to enlightened romanticism , Cambridge Review of
International Affairs, 14:1, 296-308, DOI: 10.1080/09557570008400344,
JKS)**

And, indeed, if we revisit the guarantors of Enlightenment and Romantic
knowledge claims, we find that these guarantors may not be guarantors at
all. [Do policy-makers really set the limits on what IR theory and its
connection to practice must be, or do Enlightenment theorists tell us
that this is what policy-makers do?]{.underline} And do \'the world\'s
oppressed people\' really demand that IR theory be practical in the
terms that Romantic theorists claim it must, or do Romantic theorists
tell us that this is how theory should be connected to practice? In
other words, [in making their separate claims to how IR knowledge can be
legitimated, aren\'t Enlightenment and Romantic scholars \'socially
constructing\' or even \'textually inventing\' their guarantor\'s voices
as if they were the limits on how IR theory must be
practiced]{.underline}. And, [whether speaking to elite policy-makers or
speaking for \'the world\'s oppressed peoples\', isn\'t this a terribly
elitist move? Isn\'t this a pretension to knowledge that creates its
guarantors as guarantees rather than just \'telling it like it is\' in
\'the real world beyond\'?]{.underline} I would argue the answer to this
question is **[\'yes .]{.underline}** Furthermore, I would argue that,
whether we have poststructuralist critiques of this move or not, such a
move is bound to fail. It is impossible to stabilise the \'who\' for
whom we speak, even if that \'who\' is ourselves. [It is therefore
impossible to stabilise what IR theory must be, what IR practice must
be, and what the relationship between the two must be]{.underline}. The
CRIA debates register this failure. Their critiques of traditional IR
tales expose how the \'who\' on whose behalf Enlightenment and Romantic
IR theorists claim to speak is always absent. **[Think about it. How
many times have we read IR theory/practice debates]{.underline}**, [and
in those debates, how many times have \'elite practitioners\' or \'the
world\'s oppressed people\'s\' told us what the limits on good theory,
good practice, and their connections must be]{.underline}? In exposing
this absence the CRIA debates expose Enlightenment and Romantic tales as
nothing more than articulations of power. By \'whose\' authority is it
after all that Enlightened and Romantic IR theorists speak? Only their
own. [**And this is precisely why the discipline of IR needs
theory/practice debates.** It is in this site of the ritual revisiting
of the question \'how can knowledge be legitimated?\' that IR theorists
telling traditional Enlightenment and Romantic tales resist
destabilising moves by the \'dissident margins\'.]{.underline} It is at
this site of ritual return that the discipline of IR is normalised,
authorised, and legitimised. And it is at this site that pretensions to
normality, authority, and legitimacy always fail. And so the debates go
on.

### AT: It's a Link of Omission

#### No, these aren't merely links of omission. Their post-facto desire to include gender as a variable is antithetical to the alternative.

**(Laura, total bae, Associate Professor of Political Science at the
University of Florida., 2018, Feminist Security and Security Studies,
Chapter 4 in: The Oxford Handbook of International Security, edited by

The fourth commonality that I noted in 2009 was that **[Feminist
Security Studies]{.underline}** work **[shares the view that "the
omission of gender from work on]{.underline}** international **[security
does not make that work gender-neutral or unproblematic"]{.underline}**
(Sjoberg 2009: 202). This might be the most radical tenet Feminist
Security Studies shares. In this view, **[F]{.underline}**eminist
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[S]{.underline}**tudies [is not another
paradigm like realist work or constructivist work---where it offers a
different perspective than other paradigmatic alternatives based on a
different worldview]{.underline}. Instead, [it argues that security
studies across paradigmatic approaches is incomplete and
exclusive]{.underline} inasmuch [as it is \[oblivious\]]{.underline}
~~blind~~ [to the gendered nature of the analysis it undertakes and the
gendered nature of the global political phenomena that it
observes.]{.underline} In this view, **[F]{.underline}**eminist
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[S]{.underline}**tudies **[is not seeking
the inclusion of gender,]{.underline}** either **[as a
variable]{.underline}** of analysis **[or as a perspectival approach,
but instead the transformation of security studies.]{.underline}**

Strategies of Depiction: Fitspirator, Viking, and Modern Warrior

[NATO's desired audiences]{.underline} are **[found in a noisy
environment]{.underline}**, filled with competing messages and
[alternative voices]{.underline}. [New technologies]{.underline} and
social media channels mean [that all organizations must **constantly
communicate to**]{.underline} their [desired **audienc**es or risk their
communications]{.underline} being [drowned out]{.underline} by noise or
[counter-narratives]{.underline} \[. . .\] Like never before, individual
influencers can be a major factor in affecting societal change. An
individual can now attract millions of supporters from around the world
to any particular cause. (Paxton 2018) This quote from the NATO Review,
an online magazine pub- lished monthly by NATO, describes the reasoning
behind using influencer marketing as strategic communication. In October
2018, NATO released a first video of Matberg vis- iting the new NATO
headquarters (HQ) in Brussels, which was shared widely by NATO (on
YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) as well as by Matberg
himself. The thirty- second film features Matberg arriving in his
service dress uniform, with a backdrop of member-state flags (zooming in
on the NATO flag), and shaking hands with the Secretary- General Jens
Stoltenberg, whose "normal" body accentu- ates the massive body of
Matberg. The music alludes to a movie scene and communicates
significance and sincerity. In a close-up, Matberg smilingly explains
that "Trident Junc- ture is the biggest NATO exercise in decades" and
that he is going up to Trondheim to "see what the fuzz is all about."
The film ends with Matberg stating "Stay tuned for more!, exiting the HQ
premises and putting his navy cap back on his head. The video launched
Lasse Matberg as a personality who would give not only a glimpse into
the life of a NATO soldier but also an entertaining report from Trident
Junc- ture. In the following weeks, he did multiple media inter- views,
which he documented in his "insta-stories" along with images and short
video footage from his own participation in Trident Juncture. The social
media content quickly went viral and attracted media attention both
within and outside NATO's member states. As an example of the latter,
the Rus- sian state media agency Rossiya Segodnya published an arti- cle
(originally published in a Serbian outlet) asking if "hand- some Lasse
is NATO's secret weapon in a future Instagram war" (Mekina 2019).
Several clips feature Matberg heading toward an army he- licopter and
scenic views from the helicopter flying over Norwegian fjords. Although
the helicopters, tanks, vessels, and army clothes communicate that
Trident Juncture is a military event, the beautiful nature, smiling
faces, the ab- sence of rifles, and the large number of journalists and
photographers in the images signal a media spectacle (Der Derian 2001).
Matberg navigates the scenes in the ways of a celebrity; he looks
healthy and relaxed, stops, shakes hands, and poses for the
photographers, always with a smile reveal- ing his bright white teeth.
The celebrity and "clean-war" rep- resentations detract attention from
any contentious or less- appealing aspects of military buildup (Stahl
2010). Trident Juncture did however include combat training, and such
im- agery was also shared but in other channels aimed to attract more
traditional audiences. The strategy of a clean-war rep- resentation of
Trident Juncture through social media was described by NATO officials as
"fusing hard power imagery with a positive message" (Hilton 2019).
Closely connected to the clean-war depictions, **[images of advanced
weaponry invoke "techno-fetishism]{.underline}**" (Stahl 2010). In two
video clips with "Top Gun-aesthetics," Matberg walks toward a moving
helicopter in slow motion accompanied by dramatic music. More notably, a
number of short clips feature Matberg "amazed" by a micro unmanned
aerial ve- hicle (a really small helicopter that fits in his hand). The
[small size and the fact that it is unmanned not only **enhance** the
**clean-war trope**]{.underline} but also [**glorify** the modern
**military** by **emphasizing** the **precision** and effectiveness **of
high-tech weapons**]{.underline} (Stahl 2013). The micro helicopter is
controlled by a joystick controller (Matberg is childishly excited to
try it out), which adds to the "[gamification of war"]{.underline}
(Jarvis and Robinson 2019). Paying attention to the fantasmatic logics,
we can see how the [techno-fetishist depiction of modern warfare is
merged with]{.underline} Matberg's [muscular Viking imagery]{.underline}
(discussed further below), which rather [signals readiness for close
combat.]{.underline}

#### Artificial intelligence perpetuates racial biases by paining people of color as expendable "human shields." Search engines, algorithms, and networks have biases engrained within them which makes them predisposed to relegating entire communities as objects that can be disposed of. 

**Wilcox 22** Lauren Wilcox, 2-20-2022, \"Becoming shield, unbecoming
human,\" SpringerLink,
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41312-022-00141-5

The "[human shield" is a civilian "whose status as a civilian is
simultaneously assumed only to be disavowed]{.underline}" (Perugini &
Gordon, 2017, p. 3) and said disavowal does not turn them into a
combatant, but a liminal figure on the threshold between civilian and
combatant. The war crime of using "human shields" becomes then a claim
that these "human shields" are actually an attack, not on the so-called
human shields but on those who are using violence against such persons.
[It is part of a calculative logic of making citizens responsible for
their own deaths, instead of the military bearing responsibility to
prevent civilian deaths, and it plays precisely on the question of how
'the human shield' is produced as an object of knowledge.]{.underline}
Neve Gordon and Nicola Perugini take readers on a far-reaching tour of
historical and contemporary instances of human shielding, both voluntary
and involuntary in Human Shields: A History of People in the Line of
Fire (2020) with powerful story-telling that underpins disturbing truths
about how [violence becomes legitimated]{.underline}. The paradoxes of
[the figure of the "human shield" lie at the heart of the
work]{.underline}, and Gordon and Perugini use this figure as a means to
pry open international humanitarian law's inconsistencies in regard to
[who counts as "the human]{.underline}". Of critical importance is their
insistence that "[the seemingly neutral term human in the phrase human
shield denotes not merely an ostensibly universal biological condition
but also a political one"]{.underline} (p. 5). Gordon and Perugini's
wide-ranging series of vignettes on different aspects of how human
shields have been deployed and/or invoked, and to what effect, provides
a compelling read in which the abstract question of "who counts as
human" comes to life with great complexity. Yet, the underlying argument
speaks to deep injustices at the core of frameworks for thinking about
the ethics of violence. "Human shielding" and the discourse around the
legal and ethical implications of this category "illustrates how racial,
class, religions, sexuality, and gender orders help shape our
understanding of the human and thus the ethics of violence and how
[legal frameworks, particularly the laws of war reflect, reinforce, and
even produces these orders and their ethical valence"]{.underline} (p.
6). As Gordon and Perugini argue, because the figure of the human shield
elides [the two main classifications of humans---combatants and
noncombatants---this figure "destabilizes the order regulating the use
of lethal violence in war]{.underline}" (2020, p. 7). Throughout the
history of the use of such human shields from the American Civil War
onward whether or not being a "[human shield"]{.underline} protected one
from the violence of war or did not reflects and [reproduces racialized,
gendered, and class about how life is valued by the opposing
force.]{.underline} The [claim that persons were "human shields" when
used to justify treating such persons outside of the protections granted
to civilians]{.underline} (inadequate as these maybe) makes humans into
weapons of war who are positioned as defensive weapons to block or
divert attacks: humans that are objects, obstructions. There is a
paradox evident in this kind of use of "lawfare" as Gordon and Perugini
show in many compelling examples: the deaths of civilians who are said
to be "human shields" positions responsibility for the deaths of such
persons in their own hands, not those who attacked them. While Gordon
and Perugini note the paradox of the human shield being a
civilian-who-is-not-a-civilian, another paradox might be said to exist
in the coexistence of the "human" and the "shield", that is, a human
whose becomes less human, (that is to say, less worthy of humane
treatment) when their bodies are considered weapons. As such, [thorny
questions of the ethics and politics of 'human shielding' revolve around
the weaponization of the body]{.underline}. The weaponization of the
body has most often been considered [in terms of forms of military
discipline, dehumanization, and even mechanization of the soldier's body
within the military apparatus]{.underline} (as Bourke, 1999 discusses
for example). Paul Kirby has recently explored some of the uncanny and
uncomfortable ways in which the soldier's body and particularly, the
body part of the penis figures in discussions of wartime sexual violence
and the idiom "rape as a weapon of war" (Kirby, 2020). While IR
traditionally considers weapons to be instrumental and as human
artifacts, and recent critical scholarship has sought to examine how
"objects, [ideologies, practices, bodies, and affects get drawn into
specific assemblages of violent intentionality"]{.underline} (Bousquet
et al., 2017, p. 1). Benjamin Meiches has recently argued, "weapons
operate as bodies that incite, prompt, and undermine human agency in
ways that are largely unaccounted for by traditional security studies
literature" (Meiches, 2017, 10). Referring to hunger strikers/death
fasters struggling against the Turkish state, Banu Bargu has articulated
this form of the "weaponization of life" as a form of necropolitical
resistance to one's construction as "bare life" (2014, 81). Here, it is
not the "body" per se that is weaponized, but the body as a conduit
through which the weaponization of life works as a political tactic
(Bargu, 2014, p. 16). What particularly interests me about Gordon and
Perugini's work here is embodied persons made into weapons: the
"becoming-weapon" of "human shields" especially when this is a
designation given to certain persons. While Gordon and Perugini focus on
instances that are or might be interpreted as involving human shields
from a wide variety of examples (including environmental struggles),
their primary concern is how human shielding is considered in the laws
of war, including in appeals made to the laws of war. I wonder, however,
if [in thinking about the ways in which certain persons, certain bodies
are made into weapons, or treated as such, we might locate these varied
histories of human shielding into an even broader and longer standing
set of concerns]{.underline} about the human, weapons, and war that
extend even beyond the temporal and spatial limits of "war" as it is
treated in the laws of war. To this end, Gordon and Perugini's work on
"proximity" and "proximate" human shields (pp. 159--169) was one of the
most intriguing discussions. "[Proximate" human shields are those who
are categorized this way only due to their proximity to fighting, as in
civilians located in and around Mosul, Iraq, when it was held by ISIS in
2016, rather than having been coerced into an area near a military
target or intentionally choosing to put themselves between military
force and a target.]{.underline} As Gordon and Perugini note, "Since
practically [any person trapped in a war zone can be cast as a proximate
shield]{.underline} rather than as an innocent bystander without the
accuser having to demonstrate anything about the action of that person
of the belligerents, it becomes relatively simple to frame hundreds of
thousands of civilians as human shields[. This act of framing convers
entire urban populations trapped in a war zone into killable
subjects]{.underline}" (2020, p. 164). Importantly, the [civilian
population was not depicted as human shields when the Iraqi
arm]{.underline}y, assisted by the US and its coalition: "[proximate
human shields are the weapon of the state par excellence]{.underline}"
(p. 165). Such "proximate" human shields are only framed as such by
major media outlets when they are in supposedly decolonized parts of the
world. As such, Gordon and Perugini put their respective fingers on the
core of the issue when they write, after noting that human shielding was
codified in international law when the laws of war became applicable to
conflicts in (former) colonies, "\[p\]recisely when increasing numbers
of nonwhites were finally recognized as fully human, they also become
potential human shields, and when they are either used or framed as
human shields, they lose some of the legal protections they gained
following decolonization" (p. 169). This question of "proximate human
shields," as [becoming less human as they "become shield" and thus
"become weapon" through proximity and military/legal
parlance]{.underline} is a form of objectification that recalls Frantz
Fanon's famous declaration "All I wanted was to be a man among other
men" (Fanon 1967 \[1952\] p. 112) and its rejoinder "and then I found
that I was an object in the midst of other objects." (p. 109). Making of
persons into objects was and is legal, political, cultural, and
epistemic strategy of colonialism to enable extraction. The native is
one of many such things that need classification, management,
containment. Such "body-objects," as Mbembe elaborates in expanding upon
Fanon's work, is a matter of a "spectral and phantasmatic object, at the
limit of desire and of terror...." (Mbembe, 2019, p. 133). [The spatial
designation of bodies is a core component of colonialism: "Colonizing
broadly consisted in a permanent work of separation: on one side, my
living body; on the other, all those 'body-things' surrounding
it"]{.underline} (Mbembe, 2019 p. 46). In the work of designating which
persons are "civilians" and which persons are "human shields," there
also seems to be some congruity with Denise Ferreira da Silva's
"transparency thesis," which attempts to comprehend the role the
"racial" plays in modern thought and its ties to the emergence of "the
global" in the "first encounter" of Europe's conquest of the Americas
(2007). For Ferreira da Silva, this project produces the human body as
the exteriorization of the mind and establishes the distinction between
the "transparent I" of Europe post-Enlightenment and the "affectable
other" institutes race as the signifier of those persons who are subject
to universal reason, although not capable of grasping it. Ferreira da
Silva locates this subaltern racial subject as being constituted
temporally and ontologically before principles of universality upon
which the laws of war are constructed. The [designation of racial
difference carries with it suggestion of threat, raising fears of
insecurity, contagion, consumption, annihilation]{.underline}: it
carries with it an inversion of the relations of violence in which, the
recipients of violence are coded as having caused such violence. The
racialized body is coded as a justifiable site pre-emptive violence as
it is coded as always about to commit violence. Christina Sharpe
captures that this inversion of how violence is framed: "We see in many
visual and other representations in public life, certainly in the
US...Black people ejected from the state become the national symbols for
the less-than-human being condemned to death; become the carriers of
terror, terror's embodiment (an internal, the internal terroristic
threat) and not the primary objects of terror's multiple enactments but
the ground of terror's possibility." (Sharpe, 2016, p. 79). The
racialization of such weaponized bodies is not limited to prior racial
categorization either: David Theo Goldberg, for example, describes as
"racially indexed" the "prevailing proxy articulation" of migration,
terrorism, contagious disease, and the threat of invasion implicit in
each as racialized (2009, p. 359), and certainly other articulation of
racialized threat and invasion can be cited and articulated. As Helen
Kinsella points out, the commentary on additional protocol I suggests
that civilians and combatants are to be differentiated "principally by
visual means," and [that "visuality is not a neutral observation, but an
embodied, racialized, and gendered practice that does not merely detect,
but actively produces what is to be seen and how it is to be
understood"]{.underline} (2016). Fanon's description of epidermalization
as means of estrangement from fully human being by colonial power has
been [supplemented by a range of digital technologies, vast, and complex
surveillance and intelligence gathering systems involving facial
recognition, digital databases, algorithmic analysis, AI detection of
gunshots and more that are used by military and policing bodies alike to
predict and track both known individuals and patterns of movement in
order to identify potential threats to the order.]{.underline} Work by
Timnit Gebru, Joy Buolamwini, Safia Noble, Ruha Benjamin, and others has
drawn attention to how [contemporary AI technologies like search engine
algorithms, facial recognition technologies, and more are built upon,
and reproduce, gender, and racial differences, often leading to the
**perpetuation of racial oppression.**]{.underline} Ruha Benjamin refers
to as "the New Jim Code" in terms of the use of new technologies that
reproduce and even exacerbate existing power hierarchies, especially
those of race, while appearing to be racially neutral (2019). This
suggests that the ["visual" means of identifying and producing human
shields as objects of knowledge and either protection or vulnerability
is not longer, if it ever was, dependent on the visual alone, but rather
a broad array of **technologies of visualizing, sensing, and data
gathering and analysis, much of it indebted to prior "codes" of
interpretation.**]{.underline} The; in the context of the war [spread of
surveillance and targeting technologies suggest that the question of
"who counts as human" in terms of how violence is regulated]{.underline}
on terror[, the US and NATO have shifted to "militants," "insurgents,"
"unlawful combatants,]{.underline}" and particularly in terms of the use
of drone strikes, "**[military-aged males": all whom make up the
"ungrievable" and killable bodies.]{.underline}** Rather than
"civilians," Christiane Wilke documents, for example, [how the term
"uninvolved" was used to refer to a much narrower range of perceived
"innocence"]{.underline} following the September 2009 Kunduz air strike
which killed up to 113 civilians (2017). In a similar vein, I've
elsewhere written about how the use of various forms of **[digital
surveillance and visual evidence was not enough to override the "racial
schema"]{.underline}** (including the labeling of certain activity as
that of a "human shield") [that affected the decision to bomb an Afghan
convoy on the basis of a perceived "imminent threat"]{.underline}
(Wilcox, 2017). It is also certainly worth thinking about to what
extent, given the racialization of how the figure of "human shields" has
come to be treated, and the ongoing coloniality of many of the conflicts
involving the use of, and framing battles over, the use of human shield
(especially in relation to Israel's ongoing occupation of Palestinian
lands) whether further consideration beyond the legal, temporal, and
spatial limitations of the laws of war might push this work even
further. The killing of teenager Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman who
invoked "stand your ground" laws to enable his acquittal although Martin
was only carrying a package of candy skittles, or police officer Derek
Chauvin's attempted defense of killing George Floyd---that Floyd was
suffering from "excitable delirium" (a term with no medical definition
meant to cast him as possessing superhuman strength) certainly resonate
with ongoing legacies of racialized bodies as "always already" weapons.
That is, absent almost uniquely compelling video evidence to the
contrary (and in many cases despite such evidence) such racialized
bodies are accepted as threats and therefore justifiably killed. Neither
of these two, nor any of the thousands of other similarly killed were
labeled "human shields" but both are examples of, Judith Butler's words
on the subject, "those who exemplify the form of human life worth saving
and those who in their person and their cultural or racial status come
to represent a living threat to a form of human life worth saving"
(Butler, 2015 p. 233). Gordon and Perugini have powerfully, skilfully,
and with great detail, shown how this [division is reproduced in
international law and practice; by tracing this through-line, they have
brought to the fore the intricate workings of how "humans" can be made
less so, and "shields" can be made to do the opposite of
protecting.]{.underline}

which it was used, the jury understood that it meant **[more than simply
advisory]{.underline}**.

In the case of Smith v. State, 142 Ind. 288, 41 N. E. 595, the Supreme
Court of Indiana held that [it was **more imperative** than the word
"may."]{.underline}

In the case of Lynch v. Bates, 139 Ind. 206, 38 N. E. 806, where the
court charged the jury that in passing upon the weight of the evidence,
etc., they "should" take into consideration \*1081 the interest of the
witness, etc., the court reversed the case, holding that [the word
"should"]{.underline} there [was]{.underline} too
**[imperative]{.underline}**.

In the case of Durand\'s Adm\'r v. N. Y. & L. B. R. Co., 65 N. J. Law,
656, 48 Atl. 1013, the court held that [the word "should"
implies]{.underline} the performance of some **[obligation or
duty]{.underline}**. Often the word "shall" is used to mean "may." So,
it will be seen that either of the terms cannot be considered
abstractly, but must be considered in connection with the subject-matter
and sense in which it is used.

2 LAWS and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) Lethal autonomous
weapon systems (LAWS) are intensely discussed, but [there is no
generally accepted definition of what they are]{.underline}. The central
point is that they can function without human intervention. However, the
question is where the line should be drawn between a highly automated
system -- which is not subject to discussion within the framework of
LAWS -- and an autonomous system -- which is the subject of discussion
within LAWS. With respect to a technical system, the [terms **automatic
and autonomous mean the same thing**, that is, the system works without
human influence]{.underline}. A technical system can have many automated
functions, and a complex system with many automated functions is often
labelled autonomous.6 [Depending on what definition of LAWS one uses --
a **definition that sets the degree of automation so high that no such
weapon system yet exists**]{.underline} or a definition that stipulates
a lower degree of automation for a weapon system to be labelled
'autonomous' -- [LAWS can be claimed not to exist today or to exist
already.]{.underline} It is uncontroversial to claim that there are
weapon systems today with highly automated -- or autonomous --
functions, without these weapon systems necessarily being subject to
discussion within the framework of LAWS. Weapons with certain autonomous
functions have existed for more than 100 years. The [most common highly
automated -- or autonomous -- weapon systems today are **different kinds
of targeting robots**]{.underline}, which were first put into use during
and after the Second World War. Different forms of air defence systems
with highly automated -- or autonomous -- functions also exist, for
instance.7 Probably, [the discussion on LAWS relates to weapon systems
**that do not yet exist**]{.underline}, but that might soon be brought
into existence due to the rapid technological development in the field
of AI.

#### Vote NEG. 

#### 1\-\--GROUND they wreck it by ensuring AFF'S that defend uncontroversial future emerging technologies 

#### 2\-\--LIMITS\--opening up the topic to infinite new technologies overstretches the neg research burden and undermines preparedness for all debates- and undermines clash because this technology could not even be viable
