Racial Capitalism and Settler Colonialism Given the dual character of
capitalist accumulation identified by both Rosa Luxemburg and David
Harvey, what new understanding of capitalism would be generated by
focusing on dispossession and expropriation over .work and production?
Contemporary political theorists as well as critical ethnic studies,
black studies, and Native studies scholars and activists analyze how
racial slavery and seeder colonialism provide the material and
territorial foundation for U.S. and Canadian sovereignty. Rather than
casting slavery and Native genocide as temporally circumscribed events
chat inaugurated the birth of capitalism in the New World (\"primitive
accumulation\"), they show how the racial logics produced by these
processes persist to this day: [In order to recuperate the frame of
political economy, a focus on the dialectic of racial slavery and
settler colonialism leads to important revisions of Karl Marx\'s theory
of primitive accumulation]{.underline}. In particular, Marx designates
the transition from feudal to capitalist social relations as a violent
process of primitive accumulation whereby \"conquest, enslavement,
robbery, murder, in short, force, play the greatest part.\" For Marx,
chis results in the expropriation of the worker, the proletariat, who
becomes the privileged subject of capitalist revolution. \[f we consider
primitive accumulation 35 a persistent structure rather than event, both
[Afro-pessimism and settler colonial studies destabilize normative
conceptions of capitalism through the conceptual displacements of the
proletariat.]{.underline} As Coulthard demonstrates, in considering
Indigenous peoples in relation to primitive accumulation, \"it appears
that the history and experience of dispossession, not
proletarianization, has been the dominant background structure shaping
the character of the historical relationship between Indigenous peoples
and the Canadian state.\" [It is thus dispossession of land through
genocidal elimination, relocation, and theft that animates Indigenous
resistance and anticapitalism]{.underline} and \"less around our
emergent status 35 \'rightless proletarians.\'\" If we extend the frame
of primitive accumulation to the question of slavery, [it is the
dispossession of the slave\'s body rather than the proletarianization of
labor that both precedes and exceeds the frame of settler colonial and
global modernity.]{.underline} 13 [As lyko Day notes, Native
dispossession occurs through the expropriation of land, while black dis􀄅
possession is characterized by enslavement and bodily
dispossession.]{.underline} Although [both racial logics buttress white
accumulation and are defined by a \"genocidal limit
concept\"]{.underline} that constitutes these subjects as disposable,
Day notes that \"the racial content of Indigenous peoples is the mirror
opposite of blackness. From the beginning, an eliminatory project was
driven to reduce Native populations through genocidal wars and later
through statistical elimination through blood quantum and
assimilationist policies. For slaves, an opposite logic of exclusion was
driven to increase, not eliminate, the population of slaves.\"14 A
debate has ensued in critical ethnic studies about which axis of
dispossession is capitalism\'s condition of possibility: the
expropriation of Native land or chattel slavery? Was the U.S. made
possible primarily by unbridled access to black labor, or through
territorial conquest? Is the global racial order defined-as Day
writes-primarily by the indigenous-settler binary or the black-nonblack
binary? At stake in this debate is the question of which axis of
dispossession is the \"base\" from which the \"superstructures\" of
economy, national sovereignty, or even subjectivity itself emerge. Those
who argue that settler colonialism is central have sometimes made the
claim that even black Americans participate in settler colonialism and
indigenous displacement by continuing to live on stolen land, while
those who center slavery and antiblackness have sometimes viewed Native
Americans as perpetrators of anriblackness insofar as some uibes have
historically owned slaves and seek state recognition by making
land-based claims to sovereignty-a claim that relies on a political
grammar that black Americans do not have access to, as slaves were rem
from their native lands when they were transported co the Americas (see
Jared Sexton\'s \"The Vel of Slavery\"). Although weighing in on this
debate is beyond rhe scope of this essay, I generally agree with Day\'s
assertion that to treat this set of issues as a zero-sum game obfuscates
the complexity of these processes. With that said, it is important to
note that this book deals primarily with the antiblack dimensions of
prisons, police, and racial capitalism, though I acknowledge that
analyses of settler colonialism are equally vital to understanding the
operations of racial capitalism and how race is produced through
multiple expropriative logics. Gendered Expropriation Though this book
focuses primarily on black racialization in a contemporary context, it
is worth noting that expropriation reproduces multiple categories of
difference\--including the man-woman gender binary. Although categories
of difference were not invented by capitalism, expropriative processes
assign particular meanings to categories of difference. \"Woman\" is
reproduced as inferior through the unwaged theft of her labor, while the
esteem of the category of \"man\" is propped up by the valorization of
his labor. Even when women are in the professional workforce, they are
still vulnerable to expropriation when they are given or take on work
beyond their formal duties-whether it\'s washing the dishes at the
office, mentoring students, or doing thankless administrative work while
male colleagues gee the \"dysfunctional genius\" pass. But above all,
gendered expropriation occurs through the extraction of care labor,
emotional labor, as well as domestic and reproductive labor all of which
is enabled by the enforcement of a rigid gender binary. This system is
propped up by gender socialization, which compels women to
psychologically internalize a feeling of responsibility for others.
Although, at a glance, ic might seem that the expropriation of women\'s
labor happens primarily through housewifeitization, the marriage
contract, and the assignment of child-care duties to women, in the
current epoch-characterized by an aging baby boomer population and a
shortage of geriatric health-care workers-women are increasingly filling
this void by taking care of sick parents, family members, and loved
ones. It is hardly surprising that two-thirds of those who care for
chose with Alzheimer\'s disease are women, even as women are the primary
victims of this disease. Given thac women\'s lives are often interrupted
by both childcare duties and caring for ailing family members, it\'s
also hardly surprising that women accumulate many fewer assets and arc
more likely to retire into poverty than their male counterparts. A
recent report found that the European Union gender pension gap was 40
percent, which far exceeds the gender pay gap of 16 percent. Overall,
gender is a material relation that, among other things, bilks women of
their futures. The aged woman who has toiled by caring for others is
left with little by the end of her life. Though gender distinctions are
maintained through expropriative processes, they also have consequences
beyond the economic and material realm. While it could be said that
disposability is the logic that corresponds to racialized expropriation,
gendered subjectivation has as its corollary rapeability. It also goes
without saying that these expropriative logics are not mutually
exclusive, as nonwhite women and gender-nonconforming people may be
subject to a different set of expropriative logics than white women.
Racalized Expropriation Although I do not claim that expropriation
should be defined exclusively as racialization (again, because different
expropriative logics reproduce multiple categories of difference), this
book deals primarily with the antiblack racial order that is produced by
late-capitalist accumulation. Michael C. Dawson and Nancy Fraser are two
contemporary political theorists who have defined expropriation as a
racializing process in capitalist societies. In \"Hidden in Plain
Sight,\" Dawson takes Fraser to task for not acknowledging racialized
expropriation as one of the \"background domains\" of capitalist
society. [Understanding the logic of expropriation, in his view, is
necessary for understanding which modes of resistance are needed at this
historical juncture.]{.underline} His article begins with a meditation
on the question: Should activists and movements such as Black Lives
Matter focus on racialized state violence (police shootings, mass
incarceration, and so forth), or should they focus on racialized
inequality cawed by expropriation and exploitation? What is the
relationship between the first logic-characterized by disposability-and
the second logic-characterized by exploitability and expropriability?
Rather than describing these logics as distinct forms of antiblack
racism, he analyzes them as two dimensions of a dynamic process whereby
[capitalist expropriation generates the racial order by fracturing the
population into superior and inferior humans: Understanding the
foundation of capitalism requires a consideration of \"the hidden abode
of race\": the ontological distinction between superior and inferior
humans-codified as race-that was necessary for slavery, colonialism, the
theft of lands in the Americas, and genocide.]{.underline} This racial
separation is manifested in the division between full humans who possess
the right to sell their labor and compete within markets, and chose that
are disposable, discriminated against, and ultimately either eliminated
or superexploited.15 [Black racialization, then, is the mark that
renders subjects as suitable for-on the one hand-hyperexploitation and
expropriation, and, on the other hand, annihilation. Before the
neoliberal era, the racial order was propped up by the state, and racial
distinctions were enforced through legal codification, Jim Crow
segregation, and other formal arrangements. In a contemporary context,
though the legal regime undergirding the racial order has been
dismantled, race has maintained its dual character, which consists of
\"not only a probabilistic assignment of relative economic value but
also an index of differential vulnerability to state violence.\" 16 In
other words, vulnerability to hyperexploitation and expropriation in the
economic domain and vulnerability to premature death in the political
and social domains.]{.underline} My essay on the [Ferguson Police
Department and the city\'s program of municipal plunder]{.underline} is
an attempt to [make visible the hidden backdrop of Mike Brown\'s
execution: the widespread racialized expropriation of black residents
carried out by the criminal justice arm of the state. It is not just
that Mike Brown\'s murder happened alongside the looting of residents at
the behest of the police and the city\'s financial manager, but that
racial legacies that have marked black residents as lootable are
intimately tied to police officers\' treatment of black people as
killable. The two logics reinforce and are bound up with each
other.]{.underline} In her response co Dawson\'s analysis of
racialization as expropriation, Fraser develops Dawson\'s claims by
looking at the interplay between economic expropriation and
\"politically enforced status distinctions.\" 17 [Not only does
accumulation in a capitalist society occur along the two axes of
exploitation and expropriation, but one makes the other possible in that
the \"racialized subjection of those whom capital expropriates is a
condition of possibility for the freedom of those whom it
exploits.]{.underline}\" 18 [In other words, the \"front story\" of free
workers who are contracted by capitalists to sell their labor-power for
a wage is enabled by, and depends on, expropriation that takes place
outside this contractual arrangement.]{.underline}

Fraser further extends Dawson\'s analysis by offering a historical
account of the various regimes of racialization. In her analysis of the
\"proletarianization\" of black Americans as they migrated from the
South to industrial centers in the North and Midwest during the flrst
half of the twentieth century, she points out that even in the context
of industrial \"exploitation,\" the segmented labor market was organized
such that a \"confiscatory premium was placed on black labor.\" Black
industrial workers were paid less than their white counterparts. In some
sense, the racialized gap in earnings can be thought of as the portion
that was expropriated from black workers. It is not as though the black
laborers who joined the ranks of the industrial proletariat were newly
subjected to exploitation rather than expropriation, but that these two
methods of accumulation were operating in tandem. [In the \"present
regime of racialized accumulation\"- which she refers to as
\"financialized capitalism\"-Fraser notes that there has been a
loosening of the binary that has historically separated who should be
subjected to expropriation from]{.underline} who should be subjected to
exploitation, and that [during the present period]{.underline}, debt is
regularly deployed as a method of dispossession: Much large-scale
industrial exploitation now occurs outside the historic core, in the
BRICS countries of the semi-periphery. And [expropriation has become
ubiquitous, afflicting not only its traditional subjects but also those
who were previously shielded by their status as
citizenworkers.]{.underline} In these developments, debt plays a major
role, [as global financial institutions pressure states to collude with
investors in extracting value from defenseless populations.]{.underline}
19 While I agree with Fraser\'s claim that the \"sharp divide\" berween
\"expropriab le subjects and exploitable citizen-workers\" has been
replaced by a \"contin uum\" (albeit a continuum chat remains
racialized), I would add that [the existence of poor whites who have
fallen out of the middle class or have been affected by the opiate
crisis at the present juncture represents not racial progress for black
Americans, but the generalization of expropriability as a condition in
the face of an accumulation crisis. In other words, immiseration for all
rather than a growing respect for black Americans.]{.underline} Fraser
rightly points out that \"expropriation becomes tempting in periods of
crisis.\"20 Sometimes the methods of accumulation that were once
reserved exclusively for racialized subjects bleed over and are used on
those with privileged status markings. [If expropriation and
exploitation now occur on a continuum, then it has been made possible,
in part, by late capitalism\'s current modus operandi: the probabilistic
ranking of subjects according to risk]{.underline}, sometimes indexed by
a person\'s credit score. As I will demonstrate in the coming sections,
this method is not a race-neutral way of gleaning information about a
subject\'s personal integrity, credibility, or financial responsibility.
It is merely an index of already-existing inequality and a way to
distinguish between which people should be expropriated from and which
should be merely exploited.

[BALIBAR']{.underline}S NEW BOOKS [will appear in an intellectual
landscape where a **revolutionary Marxism**]{.underline} --- at least
from a glance at bookstores and syllabi --- [is still in
vogue]{.underline}. Ambivalent as they are about revolution, what kind
of reception will these books receive? Why do people read Marxist
philosophers anyway? [It would be hard to argue]{.underline} that [the
fashion for Marxism]{.underline} during the past decade or so [has had
anything to do with the]{.underline} perceived **[proximity of
revolution]{.underline}** or even the strength or militancy of
working-class organizations. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[Marxist]{.underline} writer[s rode a wave of political
energy]{.underline} and hope. [That has]{.underline} mostly [not been
true]{.underline} for the generation that came of age around or [after
September 11]{.underline}, 2001, which saw [inequality and unemployment
rising]{.underline} but [labor unions]{.underline} and left-wing parties
[falling]{.underline}. Interest in Marxism makes more sense as a
response to the intensified financialization and globalization of
capital, with its most revelatory moments in the bursting of the dot-com
bubble in 2000--01 and more recently the 2008 financial crisis. It seems
worth adding here that the digital revolution, which did for today's
generation something like what the Industrial Revolution did for
Marx --- prove that dramatic change was possible --- helps explain some
of the otherwise inexplicable enthusiasm for Hardt and Negri. As Balibar
observes, their argument splits apart the Marxist concept of the
material base, making much of (digital) technology, which has changed,
but leaving out the relations of production, which have not, or at least
not for the better. If you want to be a serious materialist, he says,
you have to hold onto both. [One consequence of
capitalism's]{.underline} ever-firmer annexation of the global scale and
[ever-tighter squeezing]{.underline} of the majority's living standards
has been that ordinary [domestic politics]{.underline}, especially
electoral politics, [have come to feel]{.underline} ever more trivial
and [irrelevant]{.underline}. One need only look at voter turnout, even
for elections like 2008, to see that abstention is the one principle in
the US that enjoys broad consensus. Under these circumstances, [even
hard-won battles in the name of race, gender, and sexuality
could]{.underline} come to [seem a bit beside the point.]{.underline} To
Žižek, who routinely gets laughs at the expense of multiculturalism,
Balibar no doubt looks too eager to please the "identity"
constituencies. [To Balibar, Žižek and Badiou]{.underline} no doubt
[seem to have given up on the idea of **speaking to any
constituencies --- **that is,]{.underline} to have [given
up]{.underline} [on the project of **politics.**]{.underline}
Paradoxical as it may seem, [giving up on politics has]{.underline}
probably **[been part of Marxism's seductiveness for a long
time]{.underline}**. [No one in Balibar's cohort]{.underline} (Balibar
was born in 1942, Badiou in 1937, Rancière in 1940, Žižek in 1949) could
have felt confident that as Marxists they [came of age at a propitious
time for plunging into the class struggle.]{.underline} If 1968 didn't
turn out to be the revolutionary conjuncture, no moment that has
followed has come closer. [In nonrevolutionary times, the most
**tempting and pervasive of revisionisms** is to **give up on changing
the world and just interpret it**]{.underline}. [Nothing supplies
serviceable analytic distance like the conviction that you don't have a
horse in this race]{.underline}. [Witness the quietism of the New Left
Review]{.underline}, the foremost organ of Marxism in the
English-speaking world and yet a journal that you go to for searching
analysis, not for uplifting news of movements and conflicts. For some
years NLR, strongly influenced by Althusser, ostentatiously ignored
thinkers in the messianic mode --- and bless them for it. But [isn't
there a sort of secret alliance between messianism and
quietism]{.underline}? How can you stay so coolly detached unless you're
absolutely sure that in the end your day will come? [Balibar wants no
part of this alliance. His unwillingness to maintain an authoritative
detachment from]{.underline} ongoing [political struggles, however
insignificant posterity may judge those struggles to be, is of a piece
with his lack of certainty that he knows where History is going or who
will lead it there.]{.underline} For some readers, this will be
frustrating. [His distaste for political theology, his premise that even
in situations of political urgency there is no excuse for pretending
that Marxism has all the answers, has doubtless driven away some
who]{.underline}, whether aware of it or not, [**preferred a system that
did have all the answers** while also preferring prophets who carry
those answers down from the mountain and deliver them in
thunder.]{.underline} This seems the most likely reason why, as radical
social transformation has reappeared as a historical possibility, as
Marxism has reappeared to analyze its chances, and as Americans in
search of political enlightenment continue to eavesdrop on exchanges
among left-wing French philosophers, many of them Althusser's former
students, Balibar has had less of a hearing than the aging superstars
around him. It is true that Balibar is personally mild, self-deprecating
almost to a fault, and does not seek out occasions for newsworthy
confrontation. David Rieff observes in a nasty but not inaccurate review
of Claude Lanz-mann's recent memoir that "self-deprecation has never
been much prized in French intellectual life." Things are not so
different in the US. For whatever reasons, Balibar's putative rivals
have also largely avoided on-screen collisions with him. I note that
Žižek calls Balibar out in two of his books, Revolution at the Gates and
The Ticklish Subject --- and then, seemingly forgetting he's thrown down
the gauntlet, devotes most of his pages to Badiou. Is Badiou an easier
target? If so, what makes Balibar a harder one? Consider The Idea of
Communism (2010), a collection of papers delivered with much fanfare at
Birkbeck College in London in 2009, a year or so into the financial
crisis, and coedited by the conference organizers, Žižek and Costas
Douzinas. Balibar is not included in the collection (he was invited to
the conference but was stuck teaching in California) and he is not cited
in the index. His omission from the index is especially curious because
he is in fact argued with, at least glancingly, in two places that I
noticed: on the question, What is politics? and on the question, Should
the left claim human rights? In both cases the underlying issue is
whether it's hopelessly naive to engage in politics at the level of the
state. [Balibar is taken]{.underline}, rightly, **[as assuming that
politics at the level of the state, rights, and law remains a
significant obligation]{.underline}**. [It's clear that the other
speakers disagree, but they **don't feel obliged to spell out
why.**]{.underline} [Badiou's contribution]{.underline} to The Idea of
Communism [openly rejects]{.underline} the enterprise of "[ordinary"
politics]{.underline}. (Much might be said about the assumption that
passing previously unimaginable legislation like the forty-hour workweek
or the graduated income tax or the regulation of the financial industry
would count as "ordinary.") Badiou takes as his premise that "ordinary
history" is "confined within the State." By contrast, the kind of
history he thinks we need, the kind that is not confined within the
State, is history that is faithful to "the Idea." [Badiou takes his
argument about "the Idea]{.underline}" from Plato, whose usefulness to
the left he seems recklessly eager to promote. But [there is something
post-Hellenic about]{.underline} the idea of [an Idea that floats above
ordinary history and beams encouragingly down on those]{.underline},
wherever and whenever they are, who are [distressed by life on the
ground]{.underline}. This might be what Balibar had in mind when he
called Badiou a theologian. In the same volume Bruno B[osteels describes
the disagreements]{.underline} among Badiou, Žižek, Rancière, and
Balibar [as the "fights of a dysfunctional family]{.underline}." He
doesn't designate parents and children, but he admits that **[Lenin had
a point when he described the dogmatic antistatism of the
holier-than-thou Communists to his left as indicative of "an infantile
disorder."]{.underline}** Rather than thinking of the family members as
squabbling over who loves Marx most or who was Althusser's favorite, [it
seems more generous to imagine them deciding whether to invest their
nest egg in political ventures that may or may not pay off]{.underline}.
Many of the [issues that have filled the news over the past
decades --- ethnic cleansing, violence against immigrants, Palestinian
self-determination, European unity --- have **not exactly cried out for
a Marxist vocabulary.**]{.underline} What about, say, Europe? Europe is
a subject that absorbed much of Balibar's attention in the 1990s and has
continued to preoccupy him since --- see Politics and the Other Scene
(2002) and We, the People of Europe? (2004) as well as a volume now out
in France, Europe, crise et fin? His latest pronouncements have been
extremely pessimistic. But they emerge against his expectation that the
project of European unification, rather than a ploy of the bankers
and/or a creative new version of apartheid, might become a site of
bottom-up democratic zeal and give birth to a new set of transnational
institutions. As Žižek notes disapprovingly, this [**hopefulness** sets
Balibar against both the antistatism of the New Left and **current
cynicism** about an emergent transnational politics of any
kind]{.underline}. [Balibar's line on Europe is not that we should make
the best of the European institutions we have]{.underline}, poor as
their performance has been. Those institutions have failed, he says,
definitively. [Where he differs from his cohort is in his passionate
will to see them replaced]{.underline} --- in other words, his refusal
to give up on Europe altogether. [His critique of "**statism without a
State"---technocratic top-down solutions to the European
crisis**]{.underline} [without encouragement of broad democratic
participation --- assumes]{.underline} (against Rancière's argument in
his own essay on French solidarity with Algeria) [that democracy is
possible not just on a national but a transnational scale]{.underline}.
[Balibar's call for a left populism to counter the racist, xenophobic
populism that threatens to become the only populism we can recognize in
Europe also assumes]{.underline} (here he borrows from Rancière and
diverges from Žižek) **[that racism is not a fixed psychic quantity that
cannot be diminished by any conceivable rejiggering of social
arrangements.]{.underline}** And it assumes (arguing with both Žižek and
Badiou) that democracy is a good in itself, and that, stretched and
intensified, it might create the sort of European institutions that the
victims of European integration (many of them, like the Greeks, still
theoretically committed to the European Union) will like a lot better.

**[2ac identity]{.underline}**

**Do Both- we can have contingent coalitions not rooted in static
identity. These coalitions are *more effective***

**Butler, PhD, 90**

(Judith, [Gender Trouble]{.underline})

Some [efforts have been made to formulate coalitional politics
which]{.underline} [do not assume in advance]{.underline} what [the
content]{.underline} of "women" will be. [They propose instead a set of
dialogic encounters by which variously positioned women articulate
separate identities within the]{.underline} framework of an emergent
[coalition.]{.underline} Clearly, [the value of coalitional politics is
not to be underestimated, but the]{.underline} very [form of
coalition]{.underline}, of an emerging and unpredictable assemblage of
positions, [cannot be figured in advance]{.underline}. Despite the
clearly democratizing impulse that motivates coalition building, [the
coalitional theorist can]{.underline} [inadvertently reinsert herself
**as sovereign**]{.underline} of the process [by trying to assert an
**ideal form for coalitional structures in advance**]{.underline}, one
that will effectively guarantee unity as the outcome. [Related efforts
to determine]{.underline} what is and is not [the true shape of a
dialogue]{.underline}, [what constitutes a
subject]{.underline}-position, [and]{.underline}, most importantly,
[when "unity" has been reached, can impede the]{.underline} self-shaping
and self-limiting dynamics of [coalition.]{.underline} The [insistence
in advance on]{.underline} coalitional "[unity]{.underline}" as a goal
[assumes]{.underline} that [solidarity]{.underline}, **[whatever its
price]{.underline}**, [is a prerequisite]{.underline} [for political
action]{.underline}. [But what]{.underline} sort of [politics demands
that]{.underline} kind of advance purchase on unity?
[Perhaps]{.underline} a [coalition needs]{.underline} to acknowledge its
[contradictions]{.underline} and take action with those contradictions
intact. Perhaps also part of what [dialogic understanding
entails]{.underline} is the [acceptance of divergence]{.underline},
breakage, splinter, and fragmentation [as part of the]{.underline} often
tortuous [process]{.underline} of democratization. [The very notion of
"dialogue" is **culturally specific and historically
bound**]{.underline}, and while one speaker may feel secure that a
conversation is happening, another may be sure it is not. The power
relations that condition and limit dialogic possibilities need first to
be interrogated. Otherwise, the model of dialogue risks relapsing into a
liberal model that assumes that speaking agents occupy equal positions
of power and speak with the same presuppositions about what constitutes
"agreement" and "unity" and, indeed, that those are the goals to be
sought. It would be wrong to assume in advance that there is a category
of "women" that simply needs to be filled in with various components of
race, class, age, ethnicity, and sexuality in order to become complete.
The assumption of its essential incompleteness permits that category to
serve as a permanently available site of contested meanings. The
definitional incompleteness of the category might then serve as a
normative ideal relieved of coercive force. Is "unity" necessary for
effective political action? Is the premature insistence on the goal of
unity precisely the cause of an ever more bitter fragmentation among the
ranks? Certain forms of acknowledged [fragmentation might facilitate
coalitional action]{.underline} [precisely because]{.underline} the
"[unity]{.underline}" of the category of women [is neither presupposed
nor desired]{.underline}. Does "unity" set up an exclusionary norm of
solidarity at the level of identity that rules out the possibility of a
set of actions which disrupt the very borders of identity concepts, or
which seek to accomplish precisely that disruption as an explicit
political aim? [Without the presupposition]{.underline} or goal [of
"unity]{.underline}," which is, in either case, always instituted at a
conceptual level, **[provisional unities]{.underline}** [might
emerge]{.underline} [in the context of concrete actions that have
purposes other than the articulation of identity.]{.underline} Without
the compulsory expectation that feminist actions must be instituted from
some stable, unified, and agreed-upon identity, [those actions might
well get **a quicker start** and seem **more congenial**]{.underline} to
a number of "women" for whom the meaning of the category is permanently
moot. [This antifoundationalist approach to coalition]{.underline}al
politics [assumes neither that "identity" is a premise nor that the
shape or meaning of a coalitional assemblage can be known
prior]{.underline} to its achievement. Because the [articulation of an
identity within available]{.underline} cultural [terms instates a
definition that **forecloses in advance**]{.underline} the [emergence of
new identity concepts]{.underline} in and through politically engaged
actions, [the foundationalist tactic cannot take]{.underline} the
[transformation]{.underline} or expansion [of existing identity concepts
as a normative goal]{.underline}. Moreover, [when agreed-upon
identities]{.underline} or agreed-upon dialogic structures, through
which already established identities are communicated, [no longer
constitute the]{.underline} theme or [subject of politics]{.underline},
then [identities can come into being and dissolve depending on the
concrete practices that constitute them]{.underline}. **[Certain
political practices institute identities on a contingent basis in order
to accomplish whatever aims are in view]{.underline}**. Coalitional
politics requires neither an expanded category of "women" nor an
internally multiplicitous self that offers its complexity at once.
Gender is a complexity whose totality is permanently deferred, never
fully what it is at any given juncture in time. An open coalition, then,
will affirm identities that are alternately instituted and relinquished
according to the purposes at hand; it will be an open assemblage that
permits of multiple convergences and divergences without obedience to a
normative telos of definitional closure. (this is from a bootleg epub

Conclusion: dealing with the end of the wages of whiteness This article
has attempted to retrieve Huey P. Newton's seemingly forgotten
theorisation of imperialism's transition to reactionary
intercommunalism, not only to achieve some form of epistemic justice,
but also because Newton's thought speaks urgently to our present. It has
taken over 40 years for the contours of a truly global capitalism to
match up with Newton's proto-theorisation of neo-liberal globalisation.
But Newton's theoretical prescience also centres on his appreciation of
how such changes would be refracted through issues of race and whiteness
that underpin the US state and its economy. In conclusion, I want to
reflect on Newton's thought and why we should return to his ideas to
understand the era of Trumpism. It is my contention that Newton's
reflection on what the future may hold under reactionary
intercommunalism may in fact be words about our present. In a 1972
discussion with sociologists Franz Schurmann and Alberto Martinelli,
Newton outlined his theory of intercommunalism and the future's likely
political trajectory. Newton's main point to Schurmann and Martinelli
was that the changes associated with reactionary intercommunalism,
chiefly its technological displacement of jobs and the global spread of
capitalist social relations, meant that Western imperialism's wages of
whiteness, where imperial conquest led to a bargain between capital and
the white working and middle classes in the metropole, were effectively
over. Indeed, as Newton told an audience at Yale in 1971, he hoped white
America would unite with 'those people who are already unemployable',
but whether this did or didn't happen that 'material existence will have
changed. The proletarian will become the lumpen proletarian'.60 Newton's
interview with Schurmann and Martinelli saw him declare that either the
white US population would come to terms with this reality, and embrace
the objective class relations between themselves and the vast array of
humanity, or they would start on a path towards world war three: The
people here have to realize that they live at the expense of the world,
and this includes the workers. Either the people will oppose the
reactionary circle for survival, for peace, or else they will go into
the third world war. So [our basic problem is educating and
organizing]{.underline}.61 Returning to Newton's ruminations on the
impossibly of resupplying the wages of whiteness highlights how
dangerous the death of the wages of whiteness may actually be for us all
today. [Trumpism's attempt to resupply the wages of whiteness through
racism, nationalism and xenophobia, places humanity on a likely path
towards war.]{.underline} Despite Trump's claim that 'jobs will return,
incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our
shores',62 Trumpism is unlikely to supply any jobs and material wages to
its supporters because it is not designed or capable of doing so. Just
as Du Bois highlighted at the start of the twentieth century that the
[wages of whiteness were designed by the elite to split class unity
along racial lines, Trumpism's wages of whiteness appear designed to
split class unity for elite ends]{.underline} at the start of the
twenty-first century. Trump's economic plans, dubbed 'Trumponomics',
essentially repackage neo-liberal 'trickle-down' policies with the
promise of Keynesian stimulus. Trump has proposed massive infrastructure
spending combined with huge tax cuts for the rich and corporations and
further deregulation in the hope of generating investment and jobs. The
30-year track record of neo-liberalism has shown that these policies are
unlikely to illicit investment in the economy and such a strategy seems
incapable of addressing how technology, as Newton realised, will
eliminate ever more jobs.63 As such, [Trumpism will likely continue the
processes of enriching elites and corporations]{.underline} at the
expense of all members of the working and middle classes.64 This failure
to supply the economic wages of whiteness will in turn likely be
[supplemented with the overtures to trade protectionism (Border Tax),
racist and xenophobic polices]{.underline} such as (Muslim) travel bans,
illegal migrant deportations, border wall building [and military actions
that aim to supply the psychological aspects of the wages of
whiteness.]{.underline} This will simply be the supplying of the wages
of whiteness in the absence of wages. [There thus appears more chance
that we shall see a race war in the US than any potential class
struggle. However, the changes brought about by reactionary
intercommunalism have also changed the nature of geo-politics and made
such resurgent nationalism a more likely conduit for war on the
international stage.]{.underline} The quest to remake the world in the
American image, or rather in its interests, has enriched non-Western
elites and empowered nations in the Global South in ways even Newton
could not have foreseen. Although the 'neo-liberalism with southern
characteristics' of the BRICS bloc does not yet mark an ideological and
geo-political alternative to US and wider Western power, it does mark a
world of increasing multi-polarity.65 What chance that a trade war or
imperial proxy war induced by Trumpism could lead to what Newton called
the third world war? Yet, [Newton's thought also offers us a vision of
an alternative]{.underline} approach to dealing with the end of the
wages of whiteness and perhaps herein lays the true value of returning
to Newton in the age of Trumpism. Newton's discussion with Schurmann and
Martinelli revealed his frustration with the Western left's fixation
with the 'factory as a phase that does not go through transformation'.66
In Newton's eyes [the left couldn't simply repeat the fantasy of
returning to the post-war settlement between labour and
capital.]{.underline} Not only was such a position unachievable due to
the changes induced by reactionary intercommunalism, but also because
[such a position failed to see how]{.underline} the post-war era of
[embedded liberalism was itself a racialised imperial formation. Newton
argued against nostalgic pleas for national forms of socialism, which
had been used to imperially split humanity across the
colour-line,]{.underline} and for a transnational politics he called
'Revolutionary intercommunalism'.67 Revolutionary intercommunalism
functioned off the recognition of the interconnected nature of the
global economy and the need to deliver equality and justice for the
entirety of the world's communities. Above all else, [revolutionary
intercommunalism rejected the idea that nationalist settlements, whether
Black, white or socialist, were the pathways towards
liberation.]{.underline} In light of reactionary intercommunalism's
global dimensions, Newton argued that [only a global form of
justice]{.underline} that would equally share the productivity and
resource gains of technology [would now suffice: In order for a
revolution to occur in the United States you would have to have a
redistribution of wealth not on a national or international level, but
on an intercommunal level.]{.underline} Because how can we say that we
have accomplished revolution if we redistribute the wealth just to
people here in North America when the ruling circle itself is guilty of
trespass de bonis asportatis. That is, they have taken away the goods of
the people of the world, transported them to America and used them as
their very own.68 [Revolutionary intercommunalism saw the BPP create
alliances with a plethora of social movements]{.underline} both within
and beyond the US. These included the student-led anti-Vietnam War and
Peace movements, Latino groups like the Young Lords Organisation and
poor white American groups like the Young Patriots Organisation and
'peoples of world' pursuing nationhood, such the National Liberation
Front in South Vietnam (NLF), the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO)
and Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO). 69 [The aim of
revolutionary intercommunalism was not only to create a united front of
oppressed peoples against global capitalism, but also to create
alternative forms of life to the capitalist way of life. This ethos was
exemplified in the BBP's 'survival]{.underline}
[programmes']{.underline}, community-based programmes that were set-up
and run by the Panthers and wider community to provide services [such as
free healthcare,]{.underline} free breakfasts for school children and
free clothing for the Black community and other communities who had been
excluded from the spoils of US capitalism. As Singh has suggested, the
practices of the BPP's [survival programmes not only filled these gaps
in welfare but also provided a 'projection of sovereignty' that rivalled
the 'reality principle' of the US state.70 This entailed a practical
deconstruction of the idea of state power (policing, education, welfare)
that reimagined spaces and practices along new intercommunal lines of
self-determination and democracy. Through attempting to disrupt class
relations, racial segregation and gender roles, the BPP's survival
programmes also attempted to offer alternative ways of life, both
institutionally and ideologically, to the racially divisive, class
exploitative and gendered structures of capitalist
society]{.underline}.71 The value of returning to Newton's thought today
thus lays not only with his appreciation of how reactionary
intercommunalism would be refracted through issues of race and
whiteness, but also with how Newton's vision of revolutionary
intercommunalism demands us to link the project of anti-imperialist
solidarity with the creation of alternative intercommunal ways of life
to capitalist society. This especially pertinent given that [Trumpism's
critique of neo-liberal globalisation ironically shares elements of the
left's own social democratic critique of neo-liberal globalisation.72
Although violently disagreeing on the means, both Trumpism and social
democracy aim towards the end of taming global capitalism through
reasserting national controls]{.underline} (whether this is through
racist approaches to immigration or raising taxes) and alleviating
economic insecurity through job creation (whether this is through
deregulation and tax cuts or increased regulation and government
spending). Newton's work on [intercommunalism leads us to question the
very categories of labour, nation, capital and democracy that underpin
both Trumpism and contemporary social democratic politics.]{.underline}
For example, Newton's theory of intercommunalism makes it clear that we
must question the linking of wage labour and income in an environment
where technology eliminates vast sways of jobs and labour markets are
racially discriminatory. Moreover, we must ask this question with a
global rather than solely a national inflexion. Newton's thought thus
demands that we consider a new politics that would create new
institutions and ideologies that could serve and liberate communities
both within and beyond the boundaries of nation states. Returning to
[Newton's theorisation]{.underline} of reactionary intercommunalism, and
his conclusion that both white supremacy and nationally bounded
socialism were incapable of dealing with the contradictions of global
capital, thus [implores us to pursue a politics of intercommunal
revolution rather than mere national reform]{.underline}. This may sound
idealistic as we encounter the re-emergence of racist populism in the US
and wider Western world.73 However, Newton's work reminds us that the
contradictions of racial capitalism under the machinations of
reactionary intercommunalism also offer the possibilities of hope as
well as horror. Newton saw a chance for intercommunal solidarity and the
creation of alternative forms of life because he believed the effects of
the dwindling wages of whiteness now meant that the white populaces in
the US were 'more ready to fight' than ever before. The key was to
answer the questions 'who shall he fight? Who is your enemy? Who is your
friend?' Newton challenged the left in the West 'to show \[that\] the
other unemployables are not the enemy'.74 In our contemporary moment
these words, and the anti-racist and anti-imperialist politics they
commit us to, seem as urgent as the time they were first spoken.

[AS A STUDENT OF ALTHUSSER]{.underline} IN THE 1960S, [Balibar took to
heart his master's desire to detach Marxism from Hegel]{.underline}.
[Hegel was seen]{.underline} (a bit tendentiously) by Althusser and his
disciples [as a confident oracle of the End of History]{.underline}; and
[their aim was]{.underline}, through a close and even reverent reading
of Marx's texts, to [expose a mature Marx who had been through an
"**epistemological rupture**," breaking with his early Hegelian
faith,]{.underline} and [who by the time he wrote Capital had embraced a
**more complex and open-ended model of history**]{.underline}. [History
had to be interpreted the way Freud interpreted
dreams]{.underline} --- as [motivated and structured, but with a
quotient of randomness]{.underline} and openness to reinterpretation.
Seeing history as analogous to dreams risked conceding that Marxism had
something in common with wishful fantasy, but [Althusser thought it made
Marxism more scientific]{.underline}. In at least one sense it did:
[genuine science accepts the limits of its own knowledge]{.underline}.
[Balibar,]{.underline} not much interested in scientificity,
[was]{.underline} clearly [enticed]{.underline} from the beginning **[by
modesty about the limits of knowledge]{.underline}**. Neither he nor
Althusser put it this way, but [their]{.underline} shared [project might
be described as a **secularizing of Marxism.** After
Stalin]{.underline}, [many]{.underline} thinkers [were ready to abandon
Marxism altogether]{.underline}. [For those who wanted to save
it]{.underline} --- that was the grand but also defensive goal that
Althusser announced to his students, Balibar among them, on the first
day of the 1965 seminar that was to become Reading Capital --- [one
option was to return to the founding texts of historical materialism and
read them afresh, liberated from their **decades of service to Party
dogma**.]{.underline} Like the Protestants of the Reformation, [Marxists
would get out from under the authority of the Church by appealing to the
authority of Scriptur]{.underline}e. [This]{.underline} of course [would
involve a resacralizing of Marx's texts]{.underline} --- something of an
irony for a secularizing project. The secular always seems to need more
secularizing. In this sense, Balibar's series of studies from the 1980s
(some of them collected in English under the title Masses, Classes and
Ideas) was indeed secular and even detheologizing, [a sort of
Nietzschean--Rortyan experiment in thinking Marxism **without its
god-terms**.]{.underline} For example, the concept of [ideology went
unmentioned in Marx's Capital]{.underline}, Balibar observed, and this
was [because Capital had no need of it: if the fetishism of the
commodity is working, it will do the job,]{.underline} mistakenly
assigned to ideology, [of making exploitation look like the breaks of
the game.]{.underline} [Balibar]{.underline} thus [gently encouraged
Marxists to make better use of their time than **accusing others of
false consciousness.** Like ideology, the]{.underline} concept of the
[proletariat]{.underline}, so prominent in The Communist Manifesto,
[**could also be jettisoned**. According to]{.underline} the predictions
of the [mature Marx]{.underline}, [the only class that would come to
full political selfhood under the capitalist system is the
bourgeoisie]{.underline}. **[The proletariat names a political potential
that could well remain unfulfilled]{.underline}** (as it has). [This
argument had the fortunate result of rendering unnecessary the
proletariat's predicted emergence as a self-conscious revolutionary
subject]{.underline}; the usefulness of Marx's analysis of capital could
be demonstrated without it (as it has). Balibar was proposing in effect
that Marx offered no providential assurance that things would work out
in the end. [This was Marxism without a Book of Revelation]{.underline}.

**[2ac marxism fails]{.underline}**

**The worker has disappeared \-\-- the lack of spatial proximity and
continuity between workers denies the possibility of class solidarity
fomenting meaningful resistance. Moreover, Marx's economic theory
understands labor as divisible into discrete units of time, but the
floating, arbitrary value of money combined with the depersonalization
of time means today's cognitive worker no longer has no discrete
surplus-value to be stolen**

**Bifo 15** \[Francesco 'Bifo' Berardi, Professor of Social History of

[The recombinant **alliance** of **cognitive work and financial capital
was over**]{.underline}. [The young army of free agents, selfexploiters
and virtual prosumers was transformed into modernity's horde of
precarious cognitive workers: **cognitarians**]{.underline}, [cognitive
proletarians and internet-slaves who invest nervous energy in exchange
for a precarious revenue.]{.underline}

**[Precarity is the general condition of semio-workers.]{.underline}**
[The essential feature of precarity in the social sphere is not the loss
of regularity in the labour relation, since labour has always been more
or less precarious]{.underline}, notwithstanding legal regulations[. The
essential transformation induced by the digitalization of the labour
process is the fragmentation of the personal continuity of work, the
fractalization and cellularization of time. The **worker disappears as a
person**]{.underline}, and is replaced by abstract fragments of time.
The cyberspace of global production can be viewed as an immense expanse
of depersonalized human time. [In the sphere of industrial production,
abstract labour time was embodied in a worker of flesh and bone, with a
certified and political identity]{.underline}. When [the
boss]{.underline} was in need of human time for capital valorization, he
[was obliged to hire a human being, and was obliged to deal with the
physical weaknesses]{.underline}, maladies and rights of this human
being; was obliged to face trade unions reclaims and the political
demands of which the human was a bearer.

As we move into the age of info-labour, [there is no longer a need to
invest in the availability of a person for eight hours a
day]{.underline} throughout the duration of his or her life. [Capital no
longer recruits people, but buys packets of time, separated from their
interchangeable and occasional bearers]{.underline}. In the internet
economy, flexibility has evolved into a form of fractalization of work.

Fractalization is the modular and recombinant fragmentation of the
period of activity. [The worker no longer exists as a
person]{.underline}. He or she is only an interchangeable producer of
micro-fragments of recombinant semiosis that enter into the continuous
flux of the internet. Capital no longer pays for the availability of a
worker to be exploited for a long period of time; it no longer pays a
salary that covers the entire range of economic needs of a person who
works.

The worker (a machine endowed with a brain that can be used for
fragments of time) is paid for his or her occasional, temporary
services. Work time is fragmented and cellularized. Cells of time are
put up for sale online, and businesses can purchase as many of them as
they want without being obligated in any way to provide any social
protection to the worker. [Depersonalized time has become the real agent
of the process of valorization, and depersonalized time has no rights,
no union organization and no political consciousness]{.underline}. It
can only be either available or unavailable -- although this latter
alternative remains purely theoretical inasmuch as the physical body
still has to buy food and pay rent, despite not being a legally
recognized person.

[The time necessary to produce the info-commodity is liquefied by the
recombinant digital machine]{.underline}. The human machine is there,
pulsating and available, like a brainsprawl in waiting. The extension of
time is meticulously cellularized: cells of productive time can be
mobilized in punctual, casual and fragmentary forms. The recombination
of these fragments is automatically realized in the network. [The mobile
phone is the tool that makes possible the connection between the needs
of semiocapital and the mobilization of the living labour of
cyberspac]{.underline}e. The ringtone of the mobile phone summons
workers to reconnect their abstract time to the reticular flux.

In this new labour dimension, people [have no right to protect or
negotiate the time of which they are formally the proprietors, but are
effectively expropriated. That time does not really belong to them,
because it is separated from the social existence of the people who make
it available to the recombinant cyber-productive circuit.]{.underline}
The time of work is fractalized, reduced to minimal fragments that can
be reassembled, and the fractalization makes it possible for capital to
constantly find the conditions of the minimal salary. **[Fractalized
work can punctually rebel, here and there, at certain points -- but this
does not set into motion any concerted endeavour of
resistance.]{.underline}**

**[Only the spatial proximity of the bodies of labourers and the
continuity of the experience of working together lead to the possibility
of a continuous process of solidarity]{.underline}**. [Without this
proximity and this continuity, the conditions for the cellularized
bodies to coalesce into community do not pertain.]{.underline}
[Individual behaviours can only come together to form a substantive
collective momentum when there is a **continuous proximity in time, a
proximity that info-labour no longer makes possible.**]{.underline}

Cognitive activity has always been involved in every kind of human
production, even that of a more mechanical type. There is no process of
human labour that does not involve an exercise of intelligence. But
today, **[cognitive capacity is becoming the essential productive
resource]{.underline}**. In the age of industrial labour, the mind was
put to work as a repetitive automatism, the neurological director of
muscular effort. While industrial work was essentially repetition of
physical acts, mental work is continuously changing its object and its
procedures.

Thus, the subsumption of the mind in the process of capitalist
valorization leads to a true mutation. [The conscious and sensitive
organism is subjected to a growing competitive pressure, to an
acceleration of stimuli]{.underline}, to a constant exertion of his/her
attention. As a consequence, [the mental environment, the info-sphere in
which the mind is formed and enters into relations with other minds,
becomes a psychopathogenic environment.]{.underline}

[To understand semiocapital's infinite game of mirrors, we must first
outline a new disciplinary field, delimited by three aspects: the
critique of political economy of connective intelligence; the semiology
of linguistic-economic fluxes; and the psychochemistry of the
info-sphere, focused on the study of the psychopathological effects of
the mental exploitation caused by the acceleration of the
info-sphere.]{.underline}

In the connected world, the retroactive loops of general systems theory
are fused with the dynamic logic of biogenetics to form a post-human
vision of digital production. [Human minds and flesh are integrated with
digital circuits thanks to interfaces of acceleration and
simplification: a model of bio-info production is emerging that produces
semiotic artefacts with the capacity for the auto- replication of living
systems. Once fully operative, the digital nervous system can be rapidly
installed in every form of organization.]{.underline}

[The digital network is provoking an intensification of the
info-stimuli, and these are transmitted from the social brain to
individual brains]{.underline}. This **[acceleration is a pathogenic
factor that has wide-ranging effects in society.]{.underline}** Since
capitalism is wired into the social brain, [a psychotic meme of
acceleration acts as pathological agent: the organism is **drawn into a
spasm until collapse**]{.underline}.

**The bourgeoisie has disappeared: in the regime of semiocapitalism,
there's nothing to rebel against. Their replacement, the "elsewhere
class," engages in a constant reterritorialization of random financial
value that makes effective resistance impossible.**

Semiocapital and the Ethics of Baroque

Crime used to be a secret act. In the age of repression and
industriousness, when the morality of the bourgeoisie was reigning,
crime wanted to be secret. Law aimed at preventing crime, and it
encouraged investigations of criminals in order to punish them.

This order of things has irrevocably changed in the last turn of time,
especially since the advent of the semiocapitalist regime.

[Semiocapitalism occupies the sphere of randomness of value, as well as
the sphere of **randomness of law** and of moral judgement]{.underline}.

[The entire strategy of the system lies in this **hyper-reality of
floating values**]{.underline}. It is the same for money and theory as
for the unconscious. [Value rules according to an ungraspable
order]{.underline}: [the generation of models]{.underline}, [the
indefinite chaining of simulation]{.underline}. Cybernetic
operationality, the genetic code, [the random order of
mutations,]{.underline} [the principle of uncertainty]{.underline}, and
so on: all of [these replace a determinist and objectivist science, a
dialectical vision of history and consciousness]{.underline}.1

Baudrillard is talking of value in economic terms. In the post-Fordist
transition, the relation between work-time and value is jeopardized, as
immaterial production and cognitive work are difficult to properly
gauge. But the random effect is not limited to the sphere of the
economy, as it spreads both to the sphere of social relations and to
that of ethics.

[The current, generalized perception of widespread corruption is neither
a superficial impression, nor the effect of a deterioration of the moral
character of people]{.underline}.

**[It is a systemic effect of the randomization of value]{.underline}**.
[When value can no longer be determined by the precise relation to
work-time]{.underline}, [its determinant factors]{.underline} [become
**deception**, **swindle**, **violence**]{.underline}. Mafia ceases to
be a marginal phenomenon of lawlessness, instead becoming the prevailing
force of emerging capitalist economies like Russia and Mexico. At the
same time, [fraud is legalized and organized in the global financial
market as a systemic feature]{.underline}.

As it becomes increasingly institutionalized, [crime loses its secrecy
and demands access to the spectacle]{.underline}. [The visibility of
crime becomes part of the effectiveness and persuasiveness of
power]{.underline}. [Competition is all about subduing, cheating,
predating]{.underline}. [Blaming the victims is part of the
game]{.underline}: [you are guilty of your inability to subdue,
to]{.underline} [cheat and to plunder]{.underline}, [therefore you will
be submitted to the blackmail of debt and to the tyranny of
austerity]{.underline}.

Nazism already enacted spectacular crime as a means to secure absolute
power, but the criminal acts conducted in the name of the 'Final
Solution' were secretly organized and performed away from the public
eye. [Evil was proclaimed and simultaneously denied in the name of the
superior values of family, homeland and God]{.underline}. [On the
contrary, reclaiming evil has become commonplace in today's financial
markets, as the old ethics of bourgeois Protestantism is progressively
cancelled by the]{.underline} [neobaroque, post-bourgeois ethics of the
deterritorialized financial class.]{.underline}

The bourgeoisie was a strongly territorialized class, whose power was
based on the property of physical assets, and on the fact of belonging
to a stable community. Protestant ethics was based on the long-lasting
relationship between the religious community and the labourers and
consumers who shared the same place and the same destiny.

Nowadays, **[the bourgeoisie has disappeared]{.underline}**. The
financial deterritorialization is generating a post-bourgeois class,
which has no relation to the territory and to community.

It is a class that is not concerned with the future of any specific
territorial community, because tomorrow it will move its business to a
different part of the world. We might call it [the 'elsewhere
class']{.underline}, as it [continuously displaces the stakes of its
investment]{.underline}. But [we may also call it a 'virtual
class']{.underline}, for two reasons: [because it is the class that
gains profits from virtual activities, like net trading, and high tech
immaterial production]{.underline}; and because it is the class that
does not actually [exist. Identifying those who are investing in the
financial market is difficult, impossible, as everybody is obliged to
depend on it.]{.underline}

In a sense, [everybody is part of the class that is investing in the
financial market]{.underline}. Including myself. [As a teacher I am
bound to wait for a pension, and I know that my pension will be paid if
some investment funds will be profitable, therefore I am obliged to
depend for my **future revenue** on the **profitability of the financial
market**]{.underline}. **[The 'elsewhere class']{.underline}** [has
re-established the economic rationale of the rentier, as profit is no
longer linked to the expansion of the existing wealth, but is linked to
the mere possession of an invisible asset]{.underline}: money, or, more
accurately, credit.

According to Thomas Stewart:

[Money has dematerialized]{.underline}. [Once upon a time officials of
the Federal Reserve Bank]{.underline} of New York [were loading gold
bars onto trolleys and rolled them from one]{.underline} [country's
basement to another. Today some 1.3 trillion in currency is traded every
day, and never takes a tangible form.]{.underline}

[Money has turned ethereal, volatile and electronic]{.underline}.
[Nothing more than an assemblage of ones and zeros that are piped
through miles of wire, pumped over fiberoptic]{.underline}
[highways]{.underline}, [bounced off satellites, and beamed from one
microwave relay station to another.]{.underline} [This new money is like
a shadow]{.underline}. It has no tactile dimension, no heft or weight.
[Money is an image.]{.underline}2

[The **post-bourgeois class of virtual finance has no homeland, no
community, no belonging, and also no money**. Just faith. Faith in
signs, in figures. The post-bourgeois class announces the return of the
baroque.]{.underline}

Although defeated and marginalized during the age of bourgeois progress
and the rational organization of social life, the baroque has never
disappeared.

[Its spirit is based on the primacy of the spectacle, on the
multiplication of possible interpretations, on randomness of value and
of meaning, or the potency of **arbitrary** and **violent
will**]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, Curzio Malaparte, a writer who
took part in Italian Fascism before changing his position during the
Second World War, in Europa vivente, published in 1925, speaks of
Italian Fascism as a return of the baroque. Northern Europeans are wrong
to think that modernity is only a Protestant business, says Malaparte.
Fascism is the reclaiming of the modern soul of Southern Europeans, and
the political spectacle of Mussolini is the resurgence of the baroque
cult of inessentiality, decoration, excess: arbitrary power.

But [arbitrariness is not only a **defining feature** of Fascism, it is
also the **quintessential character** of the **semio capitalist** form
of **accumulation**]{.underline}. The power of the resurgent baroque is
[fully exposed by the transformation of the economy into
**semioproduction**]{.underline}. [When **language**, **imagination**,
**information** and **immaterial flows**]{.underline} [become the force
of production and the general space of exchange]{.underline}, [when
property is deterritorialized and becomes immaterial]{.underline}, [the
**baroque spirit** becomes the all-encompassing form, both of the
economy and of ethical discourse]{.underline}.

**[2ac anti-blackness turns]{.underline}**

**The freedom of the anti-capitalist worker is premised upon a denial of
blackness because it remains on the terrain of beings. Their claim to
produce freedom for blackness relies on a vicious ruse of analogy that
re-elaborates on the conditions of slavery.**

**[Barber]{.underline}** (Daniel Colucciello, Department Member ICI
Berlin Institute for Cultural Inquiry) **[2016]{.underline}** (The
Creation of Non-Being, Rhizome, Issue 29,
<http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html>, C.A.)

\[28\] This is to name the essential limit of Lazzarato\'s account as
the failure to analyze the ways in which the domination of **[capitalism
is constituted by]{.underline}** the domination of
**[anti-blackness]{.underline}**. In making this claim, I am following
Wilderson\'s argument that \"the privileged subject of Marxist discourse
is a subaltern who is approached by variable capital---a wage. In other
words, Marxism assumes a subaltern structured by capital, not by white
supremacy\" (Wilderson 2003: 225). The essential limit of Marxism, he
argues, is its theorization of capitalism in terms of \"exploitation
(rather than accumulation and death)\" (Wilderson 2003: 234).
**[Marxism]{.underline}** thus begins from and **[stays within the being
of whiteness]{.underline}**, a being whose coherence is premised on the
denial of the fact that capital \"was **[kick-started by approaching
a]{.underline}** particular body (a **[Black body]{.underline}**)
**[with direct relations of force, not by approaching a White body with
variable capital\"]{.underline}** (Wilderson 2003: 230). \[29\] The
position of the worker, in virtue of its raced difference from the
position of the slave, asserts a capacity for analogical relation---even
amidst exploitation---with the exploiter. The exploited and the
exploiter, despite their asymmetry, share a being that is made through
the denial of blackness, which is positioned as the slave; the worker
possesses an analogical relation to the owner that the slave does not.
**[To presume that the slave]{.underline}** position **[can be
analogized with the worker]{.underline}** position **[is
thus]{.underline}** to attribute the latter\'s analogical capacity to
the former, which is without analogy. It is to presume an analogy
between what is capable of being analogous with what is not: **[\"the
ruse of analogy\"]{.underline}** (Wilderson 2010: 37). \[30\] This
means, as well, that **[there can be no question of an
intersection]{.underline}** between separate but equal spheres of class
and anti-black racism, much less of an account that takes up
anti-blackness as a means of proceeding toward a supposedly essential
antagonism of class. Against such accounts, Wilderson remarks that,
within them, \"racism is read off the base, as it were, as being
derivative of political economy\" (Wilderson 2003: 225). On the
contrary, what is essential is anti-black racism, or the
incommensurability between non-being and being: class division concerns
relations between analogizable terms (owner and worker) that, however
conflictual or exploitative, presume a common being, a being whose
making---and being made coherent---is premised on (the denial of) the
real non-being of the slave. \[31\] All this is to say that anti-black
racial ontology is the condition of possibility for the Marxist
demand---central to Lazzarato\'s own version of autonomist Marxism---for
being free from exploitation. As Christina Sharpe remarks: \"The legal
captivity of Africans and their descendants was central to the
codification of rights and freedoms for those legally constituted as
white and their legally white descendants. That is, freedoms for those
people constituted as white were and are produced through an other\'s
body legally and otherwise being made to wear unfreedom and to serve as
a placeholder for access to the freedoms that are denied the black
subject\" (Sharpe 2010: 15). The being of freedom, or the articulation
of a free being -- that is, **[the very link between being and
freedom---is premised upon a denial of blackness]{.underline}**, or
non-being. This is the case even (or especially) when freedom is
expressed as a possibility, for such possibility---pertaining only to
that which has already emerged as being---cannot articulate that which
this emergence denies. As Saidiya V. Hartman remarks, **[the \"language
of freedom]{.underline}** no longer **[becomes]{.underline}** that which
rescues the slave from his or her former condition, but **[the site of
the re-elaboration of that condition]{.underline}**\" (Hartman and
Wilderson 2003: 185). \[32\] **[Freedom names the modulative, mutational
possibilities of being(s]{.underline}**). **[Marxist discourse, however
innovative, addresses free beings, or the being of freedom. It leaves
unthought non-being, the reality of which is logically prior to all
being, and thus to all possibilities of being.]{.underline}** It is for
this reason that **[Lazzarato\'s account of capitalism in terms of debt,
while an extremely innovative form of contemporary Marxism, still fails
to articulate the essential antagonism of
non-being]{.underline}**.[\[17\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-17)
When Lazzarato speaks of the indebted man, of the \"we\" of debt
inheritance, he is speaking of the position that Marxism ascribes to the
worker---instead of a capital-work relation we have, in Lazzarato, a
credit-debt
relation.[\[18\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-18)
Debt innovatively re-defines the meaning of work, but it does not change
the positionality of the worker, which remains as the position of the
debtor.[\[19\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-19)
His critique proceeds in virtue of a link---foreclosed by debt---between
being and freedom, without ever articulating that the very possibility
of this link is premised on the denial of non-being, on the making of
blackness as that which is without the possibility of being free.
Lazzarato thereby fails to address how the being of the worker, now the
indebted man, is rendered visible by standing out against the background
of (black)
flesh.[\[20\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-20)

**The focus on exploitation of the worker cannot grapple with black
non-being because exploitation occurs through the inheritance of debt
which presumes a being which has the capacity to inherit. It is
precisely through this capacity that the worker can still identify with
the "we" of humanity.**

**[Barber]{.underline}** (Daniel Colucciello, Department Member ICI
Berlin Institute for Cultural Inquiry) **[2016]{.underline}** (The
Creation of Non-Being, Rhizome, Issue 29,
<http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html>, C.A.)

\[17\] **[A central feature of control is debt]{.underline}**. As
Deleuze remarks, \"A man is no longer a man confined but a man in debt\"
(Deleuze 1997: 179). The experience of the indebted man is one of
endless postponement, for the creditor-debtor relation sets the terms,
in the present, for the future of this relation. Otherwise put, the
relation between present and future is circumscribed within the relation
between creditor and debtor: to have credit is to have the future as a
present creditor; to have debt is to have the future as a present
debtor. The future is given credit by the present, or the future is what
one is given to pay off the debt of the present. In such a relation,
**[the future is endlessly postponed while the present remains, endures,
as credit and debt. Any negativity toward the present is
foreclosed]{.underline}**, and so the future is never created. \[18\]
Yet Deleuze\'s analysis of control, and thereby of debt, is inchoate.
For this reason, it will be useful to turn to the arguments set forth in
Lazzarato\'s recent text, The Making of the Indebted Man, which offers a
thoroughgoing development of the insights of Deleuze\'s analysis. The
usefulness of this text arises, additionally, from the fact that
Lazzarato---unlike many who work in a Deleuzian vein---tends to avoid
dependence on an ineliminable excess of being that is presumed to
overcome the limits of the present. Rather than treat Deleuze\'s thought
as the index of an indefatigable, constitutive power of being that
guarantees political possibility, **[Lazzarato attends to the ways in
which control has foreclosed such possibility]{.underline}**. As such,
Lazzarato is perhaps the best available candidate for **[exemplifying
Deleuzian thought without the presumption of affirmation]{.underline}**.
\[19\] Lazzarato presents the indebted man as the subjective terrain of
communicative capitalism\'s apparatus of control, and in doing so
develops some of Deleuze\'s central claims. For instance, he observes
how debt \"preempts non-chronological time, each person\'s future as
well as the future of society as a whole,\" and contends that debt is
the \"principal explanation for the strange sensation of living in a
society without time, without possibility, without foreseeable rupture\"
(Lazzarato 2012: 46-47). Furthermore, he confirms that debt marks the
appearance of capitalism\'s capacity to make being as such, and thus to
make the future: \"The power of capitalism, like the world it aims to
appropriate and control, is always in the process of being made\"
(Lazzarato 2012: 107). \[20\] **[Lazzarato offers a key advance on
Deleuze with his emphasis on the aforementioned being-making capacity of
capitalism]{.underline}**. Specifically, he insists that **[debt is not
a scientific necessity]{.underline}**---something that stems from
autonomous economic laws---**[but rather a product of
power]{.underline}**. Debt belongs to the exercise of power, and as such
it is a making of beings that are logically prior to---and thus do not
gain their coherence through---any science of economy. \"Measure,
evaluation, and appraisal\"---the means by which debt expresses and
constructs itself---\"all arise from the question of power, before there
is any question of economics\" (Lazzarato 2012: 80). It is in virtue of
the centrality of power within his analysis that Lazzarato offers an
additional advance: the claim that attention to the debt-relation is
inseparable from attention to the Christian relation. The power at
issue, Lazzarato argues, is one in which the \"origin of valuation and
measure is both religious and political\" (Lazzarato 2012: 81). \[21\]
Lazzarato\'s theorization of **[capitalism as a power to make the
debt-relation]{.underline}**---and not as a secular science regulating
this relation---**[leads him to introduce and emphasize the Christian
valence of \"debt obligations]{.underline}**\" (Lazzarato 2012: 40-41).
He argues that what makes the debt-relation hold (as its necessary, if
not sufficient, condition) is obligation, and that the theorization of
this obligation requires attending to the Christian character of debt.
Being is made through the establishment of a creditor-debtor relation,
yet **[essential to this relation is the establishment of
obligation]{.underline}**, and obligation, Lazzarato argues, is
**[established by Christianity]{.underline}** (from which capitalism
inherits it). Simply put, the making of beings through debt is made
through obligation, which is made through Christianity. It is along
these lines that he claims **[we are now \"indebted to the \'god\'
Capital\"]{.underline}** (Lazzarato 2012: 32). Lazzarato\'s analysis of
the debt-relation thereby demonstrates that the power by which
capitalism makes being is bound up with a power named by Christianity.
Capitalist power must then be analyzed in its undividedness from
Christian power, and in a way that attends to the negativity of
non-being against being. Asymmetry as Analogy \[22\] One way of
addressing this task is to think debt as inheritance---that is, to think
the inheritance of Christian debt by capitalism, and in doing so to
think how **[a capacity of being is inherited by capitalism from
Christianity]{.underline}**. We inherit debt, and debt requires that our
future be inherited---ahead of time---as the debt enacted in the
present. But it is not just that debt is inherited, it is also that
**[debt constitutes its inheritors as]{.underline}** something, as
beings analogically **[belonging to a \"we.\"]{.underline}** Note, for
instance, the collective first-person of Lazzarato\'s claim: \"We are no
longer the inheritors of original sin but rather of the debt of
preceding generations\" (Lazzarato 2012: 32). Who is \"we\"? \[23\] It
is by way of this question that one begins to encounter a limit of
Lazzarato\'s analysis, which I will address in a logical register before
returning to the explicitly historical marks of the inheritance that he
tracks. **[This limit]{.underline}**, logically speaking, **[is
Lazzarato\'s focus on asymmetry]{.underline}**. He clearly observes the
injustice of the debt-relation by articulating the deep asymmetry
between creditor and
debtor.[\[11\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-11)While
this observation is not incorrect, the approach to which it belongs
ignores the ways in which **[asymmetry remains within
being]{.underline}**. In order for one thing to be communicated as
asymmetrical with or disproportionate to another thing, these things
must be analogical to one another, possessing a minimal degree of
likeness or commonality. Therefore creditor and debtor, despite the
extremity of their asymmetry, remain analogous to each other as beings.
\[24\] This is to say that the debt-relation operates as a domain of
analogous being, and that **[Lazzarato]{.underline}**---by presupposing
and leaving in place this domain---**[fails to encounter the negativity
of
non-being]{.underline}**.[\[12\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-12)[Whereas
asymmetry presupposes the commonality and analogical relation of beings,
non-being names that which is without being, and thus without analogical
relation to being]{.underline}(s): **[something and nothing are not
asymmetrical but incommensurable]{.underline}**. Lazzarato\'s critique
of debt, by focusing on asymmetry, ignores this absence of analogy
between being (whether positive or negative, creditor or debtor) and
non-being, and so it can only amount to a modulation of being---that is,
a modulation ofwe. \[25\] Returning to Lazzarato\'s history of
Christian-capitalist inheritance, I contend that this modulation is
evident as an apparent transmutation within the \"we\": we were **[once
the inheritors of original sin]{.underline}**, whereas we are **[now the
inheritors of debt.]{.underline}** Yet a deeper continuity remains, for
while we are different, it is we who have undergone---and
survived---discontinuity: **[we are still we]{.underline}**. Previously
we inherited original sin, whereas now we inherit debt, but we are still
those who inherit---and, in virtue of this being-inherited or
inheriting-being, we are something. We are we, and we remain we, across
any apparent discontinuity of Christianity and capitalism, **[because
what remains]{.underline}**, what is constant, **[is the capacity to
inherit]{.underline}**. Such inheritance is not so happy, of course, for
to inherit sin, or to inherit debt, is to be exploited by God or
capital. Yet this structure of exploitation maintains an analogy between
exploiter and exploited: we are exploited, but **[precisely through this
exploitation]{.underline}**, this inheritance of debt, we still know
ourselves as we. \[26\] In this sense, \"we\" names the inherited
capacity to be-something, or the capacity to inherit being. What is
ultimately inherited is not debt so much as this capacity: the debt that
exploits is the debt that gives being, that gives the capacity to be in
analogy with other beings, and thus to participate in or communicate as
we. To frame the inheritance of debt primarily in terms of its asymmetry
or exploitation is thus to obscure the fact that inheritability, or the
ability to inherit, is the common or communicable being underlying all
asymmetry. This is to say that **[Lazzarato focuses]{.underline}** his
analysis **[on the conflictual relation between beings of the anti-black
world and thereby fails to address the more essential antagonism between
blackness and the world]{.underline}**. Lazzarato remains within the
being of inheritance, or within the we that underlies and guarantees the
\"coherence\"[\[13\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-13)
(Hartman and Wilderson 2003: 187) of asymmetrical relation, whereas
**[any break with the present]{.underline}** must be articulated
according to blackness, which is without relation. \[27\] The break,
then, **[must be articulated according to the uninheritability of
blackness]{.underline}**. For Lazzarato, however, blackness remains in
\"the position of the unthought\" (Hartman and Wilderson 2003: 185), and
this is precisely because he adheres to the universalizable horizon of
the we. \"Everyone is a \'debtor,\' accountable to and guilty before.
Capital has become the Great Creditor, the Universal Creditor\"
(Lazzarato 2012:
11).[\[14\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-14)
Yet it is clear that there are those who do not participate in the we of
the indebted
man.[\[15\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-15)
Logically prior to the domination articulated via asymmetrical relations
of we (inheritance of debt), there is domination articulated as
non-being: \"the damned of the
earth\"[\[16\]](http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/barber.html#footnote-16)
do not inherit.

**Their move to call us individualistic masks the whites as the
collective and demonize people who challenge racial and sexual violence
-- that allows that violence to continue and reifies neoliberalism**

**Ahmed in 14** \<Sara. Professor of Race and Cultural Studies,
Goldsmiths College, University of London. "Selfcare as welfare" August
25, 2014. http://feministkilljoys.com/2014/08/25/selfcare-as-warfare/\>

Audre Lorde writes persuasively about how self-care can become an
obscurant, how caring for oneself can lead you away from engaging in
certain kinds of political struggle. And yet, in A Burst of Light, she
defends self-care as not about self-indulgence, but self-preservation.
[Self-care becomes warfare. This kind of self-care is not about one's
own happiness. It is about finding ways to exist in a world that is
diminishing.]{.underline} Already: [we have been given some tools to
sharpen our understanding of how neo-liberalism can be used as a tool.
There are differences that matter, differences that matter relating to
differences of power. Neoliberalism sweeps up too much when all forms of
self-care become symptoms of neo-liberalism. When feminist, queer and
anti-racist work that involves sharing our feelings, our hurt and grief,
recognising that power gets right to the bone, is called neo-liberalism,
we have to hear what is not being heard. When feminism involves
recognising the suffering of say, an individual woman of colour at the
hands of a sexist, heterosexist, and racist system that is indifferent
to the suffering it causes and that is called neoliberalism, you would
be repeating rather than challenging this structural
indifference]{.underline}. And you also negate other "other histories"
that are at stake in her struggle for her suffering to matter. [Those
who do not have to struggle for their own survival can very easily and
rather quickly dismiss those who have to struggle for survival as
"indulging themselves."]{.underline} As feminism teaches us: **[talking
about personal feelings is not necessarily about deflecting attention
from structures]{.underline}**. If anything, I would argue the opposite:
**[not addressing certain histories that hurt, histories that get to the
bone, how we are affected by what we come up against, is one way of
deflecting attention from structures]{.underline}** (as if our concern
with our own pain or suffering is what stops certain things from just
"going away"). Not the only way, but one way. If you have got a model
that says an individual woman who is trying to survive an experience of
rape by focusing on her own wellbeing and safety, by trying to work out
ways she can keep on going or ways she can participate in something
without having to experience more trauma (by asking for trigger warnings
in a classroom, for instance) is participating in the same politics as a
woman who is concerned with getting up "the ladder" in a company then I
think there is something wrong with your model. [Sometimes, "coping
with" or "getting by" or "making do" might appear as a way of not
attending to structural inequalities, as benefiting from a system by
adapting to it, even if you are not privileged by that system, even if
you are damaged by that system]{.underline}. Perhaps we need to ask: who
has enough resources not to have to become resourceful? When you have
less resources you might have to become more resourceful. Of course: the
requirement to become more resourceful is part of the the injustice of a
system that distributes resources unequally. Of course: becoming
resourceful is not system changing even if it can be life changing
(although maybe, just maybe, a collective refusal not to not exist can
be system changing). But [to assume people's ordinary ways of coping
with injustices implies some sort of failure on their part -- or even an
identification with the system -- is another injustice they have to cope
with. The more resources you have the easier it is to make such a
critique of those whose response to injustice is to become more
resourceful.]{.underline} You might not be trying to move up, to project
yourself forward; you might simply be trying not to be brought down.
Heavy, heavy histories. Wearing, worn down. Even if it's system change
we need, that we fight for, when the system does not change, when the
walls come up, those hardenings of history into physical barriers in the
present, you have to manage; to cope. Your choices are compromised when
a world is compromised. [It is not surprising: some recent
anti-feminist, anti-queer and anti-intersectionality (intersectionality
as code for people of colour) statements from the "white male left" rest
on charging us with being individualistic, as indulging ourselves, as
being concerned with ourselves and our own damaged
"identities]{.underline}." I wonder if Audre Lorde might have had to
insist that self-care was not self-indulgence because she had heard this
charge. I wonder. I have read recently some critiques of feminists for
calling out individuals for sexism and racism because those critiques
neglect (we neglect) structures. Really? Or is that when we talk about
sexism and racism you hear us as talking about individuals? Are you
suddenly concerned with structures because you do not want to hear how
you as an individual might be implicated in the power relations we
critique? I noted in my book, On Being Included (2012) how there can be
a certain safety in terms like "institutional racism" in a context where
individuals have disidentified from institutions they can see themselves
as not "in it" at all. And how interesting: the individual disappears at
the very moment he is called to account. He will probably reappear as
the saviour of the left. You can hear, no doubt, my tiredness and
cynicism. I do not apologise for it. I am tired of it. Some of the glib
dismissals of "call out culture" make my blood boil. I say glib because
they imply it is easy to call people out, or even that it has become a
new social norm. I know, for instance, how hard it is to get sexual
harassment taken seriously. Individuals get away with it all the time.
They get away with it because of the system. It is normalised and
understood as the way things are. Individual women have to speak out,
and testify over and over again; and still there is a system in place, a
system that is working, that stops women from being heard. In a case
when a woman is harassed by an individual man, she has to work hard to
call him out. She often has to keep saying it because he keeps doing it.
Calling out an individual matters, even when the system is also what is
bruising: the violence directed against you by somebody is a violence
that leaves a trace upon you whether that trace is visible or not. And:
there is a system which creates him, supports him, and gives him a sense
that he has a right to do what he does. To challenge him is to challenge
a system. I read one anti-feminist article that implied feminists are
being individualistic, when they call out individual men, because that
calling out is what stops us working more collectively for radical
transformation. [**Collectivity: can work for some individuals as a
means for disguising their own interest as collective interest**. When
collectivity requires you to bracket your experience of oppression **it
is not a collectivity worth fighting for**]{.underline}. And I have
watched this happen with feminist despair: [when women speak out about
sexual harassment and sexual violence they are heard as compromising the
whole thing: a project, a centre, a revolution. And the individuals they
speak of are then presented as the ones]{.underline} who have to suffer
the consequences of feminist complaint, the one's [whose damage is
generalised (if "he" is damaged "we" are damaged). When her testimony is
heard as damaging the possibility of revolting against a system, **a
system is reproduced**.]{.underline} I will say it again: the individual
seems to disappear at the moment he is called to account. We are the
ones who then appear as individuals, who are assumed to be acting as
individuals or even as being individualistic, while he disappears into a
collective. From my study of will and willfulness, I learnt how [those
who challenge power are often judged as promoting themselves, as putting
themselves first, as self-promotional]{.underline}. And maybe: the
judgment does find us somewhere. We might have to promote ourselves when
we are not promoted by virtue of our membership of a group. We might
have to become assertive just to appear. For others, you appear and you
are attended to right away. A world is waiting for you to appear. The
one who can quickly disappear when called to account can then quickly
re-appear when on the receiving end of an action that is welcomed or
desired. I think of these differences as how we become assembled over
and by tables. Two women seated together at a table, let's say.
Sometimes you might have to wave your arm, your willful arm, just to be
noticed. Without a man at the table you tend not to appear. For others,
to be seated is not only to be seen, but to be seen to. You can take up
a place at the table when you have already been given a place. You do
not have to become self-willed if your will is accomplished by the
general will. This is why the general dismissal of feminism as identity
politics (and there is a history to how identity politics becomes a
dismissal) needs to be treated as a form of conservatism: it is an
attempt to conserve power by assuming those who challenge power are just
concerned with or about themselves. An individual is one who is not
dividable into parts. [In Willful Subjects (2014), I tied the history of
the individual as the one who does not have to divide himself to a
patriarchal, colonial and capitalist history. He can be an individual,
not divided into parts, because others become his parts: they become his
arms, his feet, his hands, limbs that are intended to give support to
his body.]{.underline} When a secretary becomes his right hand, his
right hand is freed. Your labour as support for his freedom. This is how
the question of support returns us to bodies, to how bodies are
supported. Willful parts are those who are unwilling to provide this
support. So how quickly those who resist their subordination are judged
as being individualistic as well as willful. In refusing to support him,
by becoming his parts, we have become self-willed; in refusing to care
for him, we are judged as caring for ourselves, where this "for" is
assumed as only and lonely. **[Self-care: that can be an act of
political warfare]{.underline}**. In directing our care towards
ourselves we are redirecting care away from its proper objects, we are
not caring for those we are supposed to care for; we are not caring for
the bodies deemed worth caring about. And [that is why in queer,
feminist and anti-racist work self-care is about the creation of
community]{.underline}, fragile communities, [assembled out of the
experiences of being shattered. We reassemble ourselves through the
ordinary, everyday and often painstaking work of looking after
ourselves; looking after each other.]{.underline} This is why when we
have to insist, I matter, we matter, we are transforming what matters.
Women's lives matter; black lives matter; queer lives matter; disabled
lives matter; trans lives matter; the poor; the elderly; the
incarcerated, matter**[. For those who have to insist they matter to
matter: selfcare is warfare.]{.underline}**

**It also means the alt fails because reading racist and sexist violence
as extrinsic effects of capital alienates people from the proletariat
movement against capitalism**

Race, Gender, Class; A Working Class Approach" Race, Gender & Class8.2
(Apr 30, 2001): 142.\>

[More than ever there is a need for the continued struggle against
historical social inequalities based on race, class and
gender]{.underline}. We need to integrate racism, sexism and classism
into the Marxist analysis of capitalism [in which race or gender or
class serves as a point of entry through which the varied forms of
social inequality can and must be understood]{.underline}. Thus, [in
recognizing the centrality of race, gender and class issues in the
struggle against economic inequality and exploitation and cultural
subordination and domination, we will be able to avoid the dramatic
mistakes of the past that considered racism, sexism and classism as
divisive issues.¶]{.underline} Marxism and the \"Woman Question\"¶ In
their article Marxist Theory and the Oppression of Women, Morrissey &
Stoecker (1994) argue \"those who follow Marx and Engels are left with a
Marxist theory that is ambiguous on whether the source of women\'s
oppression might be independent of the source of capitalism and whether
this oppression could be ended by ending capitalism alone.\" Feminism
often suggests that [Marxism produced virtually nothing of real
usefulness about gender inequality and the liberation of
women]{.underline}. For Vogel (1983): \"[Marx and his collaborator
Engels had little to say about the emancipation of women\.... For them
it was a marginal problem.\" As a result, the sexist bias in Marxism
contributed to the growth of distortions in their analysis of
capitalism]{.underline}. In her famous article entitled: The Unhappy
Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union,
Hartman (1981) argued that: \"The marriage of Marxism and feminism has
been like the marriage of husband and wife depicted in English common
law: Marxism and feminism are one, and that one is Marxism.\" As such
feminists argued (e.g., Hartman, 1981), [since capital and private
property do not cause the inequality of women, **their abolition alone
will not result in the end of gender inequality**]{.underline}. Only
specifically feminist analysis revealed the systemic character of the
patriarchal relations between men and women necessary to understand
gender inequality.¶ Most women writing on feminism began with the
central notion that there was a distinction between sex and gender and
argued that \"women\" were not born, but made: the problem was culture,
not nature that were at the center of women\'s so-called inferiority.
Other feminist writers also argued that the end of capitalism or
patriarchy would not necessarily end the objectification and
\"subordination\" of women because the control was within culture and
the unconscious. Some feminist theorists believe that the gender
hierarchical system is more deeply embedded in the male ego and thus,
the various changes in the social order have remained male dominated,
whether capitalist, socialist, fascist, communist, authoritarian, or
liberal. Central to the reproduction of the [\"inferiorisation of
women\" is the socialization process of children outside and inside the
home where \"the patriarchal ideology, that men are superior to women,\"
are]{.underline} taught and, where the inferior position of women is
[reinforced by the churches, unions, armies, factories, offices, media,
publicity, schools, etc]{.underline}. The extensive list of practices,
such as clitoridectomy, infibulation, prostitution, pornography, rape,
foot-banding, body-veiling, involuntary sterilization, and sex-object
advertising, illustrate the unequal power relationship of women to men,
and finally, modern Asia\'s anomaly; the girls who do not get born.¶
MARXISM AND THE \"RACE PROBLEM.\"¶ Although much contemporary
sociological writing concerns itself with analyses of race, theories of
racial ethnic inequality have never been a priority in Marxist social
science. As Geschwender & Levine (1994) reminds us: \"[Classical social
theorists, such as Marx, Durkheim, and Weber, were not concerned with
the race problem]{.underline}\...The authors conclude their reviews of
Classical and Recent Theoretical Developments in the Marxist Analysis of
Race and Ethnicity in regretting that certain [Marxist theorists make
the error of denying the race problem in the U.S.]{.underline} For
instance, Bonacich (1980) [reduced racism to an **ideological adjunct to
class exploitation.**]{.underline} Wallerstein (1972) came very close to
eliminating the concept together by stripping it of any meaning
independent of the exploitation process.¶ As consequence, Manning
Marable (1996) argues that [racism has blunted the critical faculties of
white progressives from the colonial period to the present Blacks have
seen an endless series of prominent white liberal and progressive allies
**betray their trust and embrace the politics of white
supremacy**.]{.underline} Marxists have always insisted that the flow of
social history is determined by the relationship between subjective and
objective factors \-- the superstructure or ideological, cultural, and
political apparatuses and the base, or forces of production. But what
most American progressives and Marxists adhered to was a philosophy not
of [Marxism]{.underline} \-- which also [suggests that the relations
between superstructure and base are]{.underline} reciprocal, each
affecting the other \-- but [of economic determinism. Racism
was,]{.underline} therefore, [only part of the larger class question.
Small wonder, then, that until today, **no progressive or Marxist white
organizations**, Old Left or New, **had won over any significant number
of black and people of color activists, intellectuals, or
workers.**]{.underline}

The use of melancholia as an analytical category has its roots in
Freudian psychoanalysis, and is to be distinguished from the related
concept of mourning. For Freud, the latter refers to the
(non-pathological) process of working through an acknowledged 'loss of a
loved person, or of some abstraction which has taken the place of one,
such as one's country, liberty, an ideal, and so on' (Freud, 2001, p.
243). Crucially, after a period of mourning is completed 'the ego
becomes free and uninhibited again' (2001, p. 243) but melancholia, by
contrast, is 'related to an object loss that is withdrawn from
consciousness' (2001, p. 245), and as such it remains unacknowledged,
enduring and intransigent. A number of authors have argued that Freud's
distinction between mourning and melancholia can help capture something
specific about the affects and dispositions of the academic left. Wendy
Brown's 1999 essay 'Resisting Left Melancholy' remains the
standard-bearer. Drawing on Freud, Walter Benjamin and Stuart Hall,
Brown argues that the left-wing melancholic is 'attached more to a
particular political analysis or ideal -- even to the failure of that
ideal -- than to seizing possibilities for radical change in the
present' (Brown, 1999, p. 20). [Left-wing melancholy,]{.underline} says
Brown, '[signifies a certain narcissism with regard to one's past
political]{.underline} [attachments and identity that exceeds any
contemporary investment in political mobilization, alliance or
transformation]{.underline}' (1999, p. 20). But [what precisely is it
that has brought about this pervasive left-wing melancholy?]{.underline}
Brown's answer is twofold. First, she argues that [the discourse of the
left-wing melancholic frequently cites the turn to]{.underline}
so-called 'cultural politics' or '[identity politics']{.underline} -- in
[which]{.underline} struggles around gender, race and sexuality [are
seen to have displaced the traditional focus on class]{.underline} -- as
having caused a crisis and loss of focus (1999, p. 23). [The second
alleged culprit]{.underline} -- in the eyes of the left-wing melancholic
-- [is the turn to 'poststructuralism,]{.underline} [discourse analysis,
postmodernism, trendy literary theory]{.underline} [got up as political
analysis']{.underline} (1999, p. 23). Brown argues that [this
**pervasive** structure of **left-wing melancholy**,]{.underline}
[despite being based on an ostensible commitment to radical
transformation]{.underline}, in fact **[engenders a conservative refusal
to engage critically]{.underline}** and constructively [with the
world]{.underline}. Instead, [the left-wing melancholic takes refuge
in]{.underline} his or her **[attachments to a lost ideal of traditional
left theory and politics]{.underline}**. [The crucial point]{.underline}
for Brown [is that the problems affecting the academic left do
not]{.underline} -- as the left-wing melancholic would have it -- [arise
from the left's abandonment of its radical principles. Rather, this
melancholia arises from many leftists' continued]{.underline} (often
unacknowledged) [attachments to a historically specific model of
anti-capitalist revolutionary]{.underline} [social change, whose
privileged status is now called into question]{.underline}. [Left-wing
melancholia,]{.underline} for Brown, [is]{.underline} therefore **[bound
up with a generalised refusal]{.underline}** or inability [to respond
to]{.underline} the [challenges engendered by the changing nature of
capitalism]{.underline}, [and the emergence of]{.underline} various
forms of radical politics -- [feminism, queer politics,
anti-racism]{.underline} and so on -- [irreducible to historical
materialist models of political transformation]{.underline}.3 Brown's
text is notable for its lack of proper names, and as [such melancholia
is implicitly understood to refer to a collective, widely shared set of
investments and orientations]{.underline}. This aspect of left
melancholia is tackled in some detail in J.K. Gibson-Graham's (2006)
analysis of the affects and emotions of the academic left. One of
Gibson-Graham's central aims is to contest an entrenched mindset in
which 'the accepted or correct 'political' stance is one in which the
emotional and affective dispositions of paranoia, melancholia, and
moralism intermingle and self-reinforce' (2006, p. 4). Crucially, [these
negative affects are not located in particular individuals, but are a
'structure of feeling']{.underline} (2006, p. 1) ['widely present if not
fully manifest in any person or pronouncement]{.underline}' (2006, p.
6). Gibson-Graham suggests that [these structures of feeling reduce the
academic left to **political \[clogging\]**]{.underline}
~~paralysis~~[,]{.underline} [and also curtail our analytical
capacities]{.underline}: [left melancholia]{.underline}, they argue,
[reflects and reinforces]{.underline} rather **[crude, totalising
renditions of capitalism]{.underline}** as a pervasive and largely
uncontestable socio-economic formation. Consequently,
[complexities]{.underline} within capitalism, and socio-economic
practices [that diverge from]{.underline} -- or indeed actively resist
-- [capitalism, are downplayed, overlooked and cast to the
margins]{.underline}, [precluding the production of more nuanced
framings of contemporary economic practices and social
formations]{.underline}. The thrust of Brown and Gibson-Graham's
critical analyses of various aspects of left melancholia is not to
suggest that those on the academic left should simply cheer up, or
foster more positive affective orientations for the sake of it. Rather,
their point is that [melancholia]{.underline} -- conceived as a specific
kind of psychic formation different to, say, disappointment or sadness
-- **[hampers the academic left's ability]{.underline}** [to intervene
politically, or to engage in fruitful socio-political
analysis]{.underline}. Consequently, Gibson-Graham and others make a
persuasive argument that **[an urgent task]{.underline}** for the left
[is to explore how we might weaken the hold of melancholia]{.underline}.

Although in his contribution Eric Lott targets Professor Michaels\'s
comments and his own recent feud with Timothy Brennan (who unfortunately
is not included in this volume) rather than Ken\'s argument, what Eric
says about "left and liberal fundamentalists" who "simply and somewhat
penitently" urge us to "'go back to class'" could also be directed at
Ken\'s conclusion. Ken writes, "Crafting a political left that does not
merely reflect existing racial divisions starts with the relatively
mundane proposition that it is possible to make a persuasive appeal to
the given interests of working and unemployed women and men, regardless
of race, in support of a program for economic justice." On this one, I
side with Eric, rather than Tim and Ken. Standing on the left depends on
whose left side we\'re talking about. My left might be your right and
vice versa, because it depends on what direction we\'re facing, and what
direction depends on which identities we\'re assuming and affirming.
Eric adds, \"Even in less dismissive \[than Tim\'s\] accounts of new
social movements based not on class but on identities formed by
histories of injustice, there is a striking a priori sense of
voluntarism about the investment in this cause or that movement or the
other issue---as though determining the most fundamental issue were a
matter of the writer\'s strength of feeling rather than a studied or
analytical sense of the ever-unstable balance of forces in a hegemonic
bloc at a given moment.\" I agree, but I\'ll risk mangling what Eric
says by putting it more crassly.[Touting class **or \"economic
justice\"**as the fundamental stance for left identity is just another
way of telling everybody else to shut up so I can be heard above the
fray. Because of the force of \"identity politics,\" a leftist white
person would be leery of claiming to lead Blacks toward the promised
land, a leftist straight man leery of claiming to lead women or queers,
but, for a number of complex rationalizations, we in the middle class
(where all of us writing here currently reside) still have few qualms
about volunteering to lead]{.underline}, at least theoretically, [the
working class toward \"economic justice.\" What Eric calls]{.underline}
here \"[left fundamentalism,\" I\'d call]{.underline}, at the risk of
sounding harsh, [left paternalism. **Of the big identity groups
articulated through \"identity politics,\" economic class remains the
only identity where a straight white middle-class man can still feel
comfortable claiming himself a leading political voice, and thus hemay
sometimes overcompensate by screaming that this is the only identity
that really matters---which is the same as claiming that class is beyond
identity**]{.underline}. Partly this is because**[Marxist
theory]{.underline}**and Marx himself (a bourgeois intellectual creating
the theoretical practice for the workers\' revolution) **[stage the
model for working-class identity as a sort of trans-identification, a
magical identity that is transferable to those outside the group who
commit themselves to it wholeheartedly enough]{.underline}**. If we look
back, we realize even this magical quality is not special to a history
of class struggle, as whites during the New Negro movements of the early
twentieth century felt that they were vanguard race leaders because they
had putatively imbibed some essential qualities of Negroness by
cross-identifying with the folk and their culture.

Fifty years ago, researchers at MIT produced The Limits to Growth, a
report on how existing economic trends foretold environmental ruin. Left
unchecked, the [authors predicted]{.underline},
**[expanding]{.underline}** populations and economic
**[growth]{.underline}** [would exhaust global resources
and]{.underline} ultimately [prompt]{.underline} **[civilizational
collapse]{.underline}**. The models upon which Limits was based
suggested that global reserves of copper, silver, lead, tin, zinc, and
petroleum would have all run out by now, and the world would be
struggling to find enough arable land to feed a population of over 7
billion people. Without governmental efforts to change global trends,
\"\[t\]he most probable result will be a rather sudden and
uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity,\" the
authors warned. As should be obvious, the [[predictions]{.mark}
offered]{.underline} in The Limits to Growth (and other contemporary
doomsayers) [were **wildly [off the mark]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Among
other things, they [failed to account for how **[markets]{.mark} respond
to scarcity**]{.underline}, [[produc]{.mark}ing [incentives for]{.mark}
**efficiency and [innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[so]{.mark} that
[we]{.mark} may [do more with less]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, the
authors failed to understand why markets encourage sustainability.
[Those predicting]{.underline} imminent [depletion of global
resources]{.underline} and exhaustion of the earth\'s carrying capacity
also [failed to predict]{.underline} what is arguably the most important
\-- and under-appreciated \-- **[positive]{.underline}** [environmental
trend of the 21st century]{.underline}:
**[[Dematerialization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of modern
economies]{.underline}. The same **[economic incentives]{.underline}**
which forestalled resource exhaustion have [actually enabled people to
do more with less throughout the developed world.]{.underline} This
dramatic development is chronicled in Andrew McAfee\'s book, More from
Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer
Resources --- and What Happens Next, which I reviewed for Regulation.
Here is an excerpt from my review: **[Dematerialization]{.underline}**
may be [the **most important**]{.underline}, yet unsung, [example of
environmental progress in the 21st century]{.underline}. It is
commonplace to observe that the relentless drive to do more with less
has led to more efficient resource use, so that a soda can today is made
with a fraction of the metal required 50 years ago. But
dematerialization is not merely a story about increased efficiency or
per‐​capita reductions. [What is]{.underline} now [being
observed]{.underline} [represents a **fundamental
decoupling**]{.underline} [of resource consumption from economic
growth]{.underline}, such that [[as]{.mark} mature [economies]{.mark}
[grow]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
[[use]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[fewer resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**
per unit of output, but [they also **consume fewer resources
overall.**]{.underline} In short, economic [growth]{.underline} in the
most developed nations increasingly [coincides with a net reduction in
resource consumption.]{.underline} Let that sink in. It is not merely
that we are using resources more efficiently in countries like the
United States. It\'s also that we are actually using fewer total
resources year-over-year. The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[uses]{.underline}
[less]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[gold]{.mark}, [steel]{.mark},
[aluminum]{.mark}, [copper]{.mark}, stone, cement,]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [even]{.underline} **[paper]{.underline}** [than it
did at the start of this century]{.underline}, despite the continued
increase in gross domestic product. Annual [consumption of [all but
six]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the **[72]{.mark} resources**]{.underline}
[tracked]{.underline} by the U.S. Geological Service [[are]{.underline}
\"**[post peak]{.underline}**]{.mark}.\" [We]{.underline} also
[use]{.underline} [[less]{.underline} **[fertilizer and
water]{.underline}**]{.mark} while growing more crops. [Plastic
consumption]{.underline} is up, as is [energy use]{.underline}, but
these two appear to [have been]{.underline} **[decoupled]{.underline}**
[from population and economic growth as well.]{.underline} How does this
dematerialization occur? Some examples may be useful. The
dematerialization of soda cans is relatively easy to grasp, particularly
for those of us who can remember the heavier cans of the 20th century.
Aluminum cans weighed 85 grams when introduced in the 1950s. By 2011,
the average can was under 13 grams. Cans today are not only thinner and
lighter, they are produced more efficiently, with fewer separate sheets
of metal. **[[Substitution]{.underline}]{.mark}** can be an even more
[powerful source of dematerialization]{.underline}. Consider
telecommunications. A single fiber optic cable made from less than 150
pounds of silica can carry the same volume of information as multiple
1‑ton copper cables. And were that not enough, satellite and wireless
technologies enable us to bypass the use of physical cables altogether.
[We can communicate more and yet use vastly less material to do
so]{.underline}. This not only saves copper, but other resources too.
[Think of all the paper saved by **e**‑**mail, e‑banking, and
e‑readers.**]{.underline} Not only did [neo-Malthusians]{.underline}
**[not predict]{.underline}** [these developments]{.underline}, [they
failed to recognize that such [trends]{.mark} would be **[driven by
private markets]{.mark}**, and not governmental regulation. We do more
with less]{.underline} not [because of]{.underline} government
regulation or administrative direction, but because of
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}**. These are the [dominant forces
[driving]{.mark} [demat]{.mark}erialization]{.underline} in the most
developed countries and they [could unleash]{.underline} [similar gains
in the]{.underline} **[rest of the world]{.underline}**. We \"want more
all the time, but not more resources,\" McAfee notes. We want more of
what resources can provide, and one way to get more is to do more with
less. [Market capitalism]{.underline} both facilitates and
[enhances]{.underline} the [underlying incentives that **drive
[efficiency gains]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nological advance]{.underline}. This not only leads to
dematerialization but also promotes \"critical aspects of well‐​being,\"
including health and prosperity. Unfortunately, these trends are not
universal. While we consume fewer resources in developed nations, these
trends have not (yet) taken hold in many developing countries, which
often lack well-functioning market economies. We have also not observed
equivalent trends in many forms of pollution, largely because emissions
are not priced the way consumption is. [An entrepreneur who figures out
how to produce widgets while using less copper gains an economic
advantage, as the copper must be paid]{.underline} [for.]{.underline} An
entrepreneur who figures out how to emit fewer particulates or nitrogen
oxides does not, as emitting such pollutants is not meaningfully priced
and contemporary regulations rarely create meaningful incentives for
emission reductions on the margin. [Understanding]{.underline}
**[what]{.underline}** has [encouraged]{.underline} and allowed for
[dematerialization]{.underline} at the same time that populations have
expanded and economies have grown is essential if these
[trends]{.underline} are to be **[replicated]{.underline}** in
[developing countries]{.underline} [and if we are to **meet contemporary
environmental challenges**]{.underline}, [including **climate
change**]{.underline}. A suite of policies designed to replicate the
same market dynamics that have led [dematerialization]{.underline}
[could [spur]{.mark} **meaningful
[decarbonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ill-conceived policies, on the
other hand, could actually do more harm than good. This is but one more
reason policymakers should be more interested in fiscal instruments than
regulatory mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Another article
in the same issue of Regulation as my More from Less review notes that
[greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United States may
have [**[peaked]{.underline}** [in 2005]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that
[GHG emissions]{.underline} appear to **[initially
increase]{.underline}**, [but then]{.underline}
**[decline]{.underline}**, [with economic growth]{.underline}. Such
trends are not observed, however, in less-developed and
less-market-oriented economies, such as China. The authors, Bruce Yandle
and Jody Lipford, think this indicates that [domestic GHGs]{.underline}
could **[[continue to decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** going forward,
[[**even** **without**]{.mark} **new** government
**[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This may be so, but the reductions
are nowhere near what would be achieved if carbon emissions were priced
and there were more powerful market incentives for market
decarbonization. [Greater **[market]{.mark} incentives** for
decarbonization could also [lead to]{.mark} the development and
**[deployment of low-carbon tech]{.mark}nologies** [that]{.mark} could
[facilitate **emission reductions**]{.mark} in other countries as well,
and given that climate change is a global concern, such measures will be
necessary if atmospheric stabilization is to be achieved.]{.underline}
The bottom line is that [competitive markets create **powerful
incentives**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} efficient and [sustainable
resource use.]{.underline} [Market-driven innovation has made it
possible to provide for more people using fewer resources]{.underline}.
Such environmental successes are often ignored because there is no
policymaker or program than can take credit for them. [They are the
result of market processes, **not governmental direction or
design.**]{.underline}

[Some people claim]{.underline} that [we need to cut our
consumption]{.underline} or there will be no hope for the planet. Such
[[claims]{.mark} are [based]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the thesis that continued growth increases the
rate at which the earth's [[finite resources]{.underline}]{.mark} are
consumed and, moreover, leads to irreversible climate change. And
**[such warnings are [by no means new]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 1970,
for instance, the Club of Rome attracted a great deal of attention with
the publication of The Limits to Growth. A Report for the Club of Rome's
Project on the Predicament of Mankind, which has to date sold more than
thirty million copies in thirty languages. The book warned people to
change their ways and had a clear message: the world's raw materials,
and in particular, oil would soon be used up. In twenty years, the
scientists predicted, we would have used the very last drop of oil. Of
course, the Club of Rome's models for the depletion of oil---and almost
all other major raw materials---were wrong. [According to the
scenarios]{.underline} presented in The Limits to Growth, [[we
should]{.mark} now [be]{.mark} living on a planet that has been [devoid
of]{.mark} [natural gas, copper]{.mark}, lead, aluminum and tungsten for
decades]{.underline}. And **[we were supposed to have run out of silver
in 1985.]{.underline}** Despite the bleak forecasts, as of January 2020,
the United States Geological Survey estimated silver reserves worldwide
at 560,000 tons. Employing an extensive array of data, the American
scientist Andrew McAfee proves in his book More from Less that
**[[economic growth]{.mark} is [no longer]{.mark} [coupled to]{.mark}
the [consumption]{.mark} of raw materials.]{.underline}** Data for the
United States, for example, show that [[of seventy-two
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, from aluminum to zinc, **[[only six are
not yet post-peak]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nevertheless, [[despite
the]{.mark} fact [that the]{.mark} U.S. [economy has grown]{.mark}
strongly]{.underline} in recent years, **[[consumption]{.mark} of many
commodities [is]{.mark} actually [decreasing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Back in 2015, the American environmental scientist Jesse Ausubel wrote
an essay, "The Return of Nature: How Technology Liberates the
Environment," showing that [Americans are consuming fewer and fewer raw
materials per capita. [Total consumption]{.mark}]{.underline} of steel,
copper, fertilizer, wood and paper, which had previously always risen in
line with economic growth, **[[had plateaued]{.mark} and was now in
constant decline]{.underline}**. Such [across-the-board
reductions]{.underline} in natural resource consumption are [[only
possible because of]{.mark} much-maligned
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[companies]{.mark} are constantly
[developing more efficient production]{.mark} methods and reducing the
amount of raw materials they consume.]{.underline} Of course, **[they
are]{.underline}** not **[doing this]{.underline}** primarily to protect
the environment but **[[to cut costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What\'s
more, a [constant stream of innovations]{.underline} has
[promoted]{.underline} the trend of miniaturization or
[dematerialization]{.underline}. Just think of your smartphone. How many
devices has your smartphone replaced and how many raw materials did they
use to consume? Nowadays, many people no longer have a fax machine or
street atlas because they have everything they need on their smartphone.
Some even use their phones instead of a wristwatch. You used to need
four separate microphones in your telephone, cassette recorder,
Dictaphone and video camera, today you just need one---in your
smartphone. [The finite nature of the world's natural resources is one
argument against growth]{.underline}, **[[climate change]{.mark} is
another]{.underline}**. Let's take China as an example:
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [emits more CO2 than any other
country]{.underline} in the world and is
**[[building]{.underline}]{.mark}** a number of **[new [nuclear power
plants]{.mark} in order to [achieve carbon neutrality]{.mark} by
2060]{.underline}**. With the new build program well underway, China's
first new-generation nuclear power plant recently went into operation.
In the very near future, China intends to start exporting power plants.
[The latest generation of nuclear power plants is much safer than
earlier models---and can play [a pivotal role]{.mark} in the fight
against climate change]{.underline}. In the United States, Joe
[[Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} is already [evaluating]{.underline} the
advantages of small modular reactor (SMR) **[nuclear power
plants]{.underline}**. As the name suggests, SMRs are smaller than
traditional nuclear fission reactors and offer a maximum capacity of
three hundred megawatts. In the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom, for example, a consortium led by Rolls-Royce has
announced plans to [[build]{.underline}]{.mark} up to sixteen
[[SMR]{.mark} power plants]{.underline}. So far, two reactors of this
type are in operation, both onboard the floating nuclear power plant
"Akademik Lomonosov, which supplies heat and electricity to the Siberian
city of Pevec and its one hundred thousand inhabitants. Anticapitalists
blame capitalism for resource consumption and climate change. But
[[political decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}---[such as]{.underline}
Germany's decision to phase out [nuclear
energy]{.underline}---frequently **[[have a negative impact on climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Telling people to cut their
consumption]{.underline} must seem like [pure mockery to
the]{.underline} hundreds of [millions of [people]{.mark}]{.underline}
around the world who are still [living [in]{.mark} extreme
[poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[What they [need]{.mark}
is]{.underline}** more capitalism and **[[economic
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Just like [in
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, where the number of [people living in
extreme [poverty]{.mark} has [fallen from 88]{.mark} percent [in]{.mark}
19[81]{.mark} [to]{.mark} less than [1]{.mark} percent
[today]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Andrew McAfee's book has an
optimistic message about how we don\'t have to turn back the clocks and
cut our consumption: capitalism and technological progress are allowing
us to steward the world's resources, rather than stripping them bare.

[American]{.mark} free [enterprise]{.mark}.**]{.underline} While the
left is advocating unprecedented government intervention in almost every
sector of the U.S. economy, from health care to energy, today [Americans
are celebrating the successful privatization of space
travel.]{.underline} If you want to see the difference between what
government and private enterprise can do, consider: **[It [took a
private company to give us]{.mark} the first [space vehicle]{.mark} with
touch-screen controls instead of antiquated knobs and buttons. It took a
private company to give us [a capsule that can fly]{.mark} entirely
autonomously from launch to landing --- including docking --- without
any participation by its human crew. It also took a private company to
invent [a reusable rocket]{.mark} that can not only take off but land as
well.]{.underline}** When the Apollo 11 crew reached the moon on July
20, 1969, Neil Armstrong declared "the Eagle has landed." On Saturday,
SpaceX was able to declare that the Falcon had landed when its rocket
settled down on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean --- ready to be used
again. That last development will save the taxpayers incredible amounts
of money. [[The cost to NASA]{.mark} for launching a man into space on
the space shuttle orbiter was [\$170 million]{.mark} per seat, compared
with just \$[60 million]{.mark} to \$67 million [on the Dragon]{.mark}
capsule.]{.underline} The cost for the space shuttle to send a kilogram
of cargo into to space was \$54,500; with the Falcon rocket, the cost is
just \$2,720 --- a decrease of 95 percent. And while the space shuttle
cost \$27.4 billion to develop, the Crew Dragon was designed and built
for just \$1.7 billion --- making it the lowest-cost spacecraft
developed in six decades. [SpaceX did it in six years --- far faster
than the time it took to develop the space shuttle]{.underline}. [The
[private sector does it better, cheaper, faster and more
efficiently]{.mark} than government. [Why?
**Competition**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Today, SpaceX has to compete
with a constellation of private companies --- including legacy aerospace
firms such as Orbital ATK and United Launch Alliance and innovative
start-ups such as Blue Origin (which is designing a Mars lander and
whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Post) and Virgin Orbit (which is
developing rockets than can launch satellites into space from the
underside of a 747, avoiding the kinds of weather that delayed the
Dragon launch). [In the race to put the first privately launched man
into orbit, upstart SpaceX had to beat aerospace behemoth Boeing and its
Starliner capsule to the punch]{.underline}. It did so --- for more than
\$1 billion less than its competitor. **[That [spirit of
competition]{.mark} and innovation will [revolutionize space
travel]{.mark} in the years ahead]{.underline}**. Indeed, Musk has his
sights set far beyond Earth orbit. [Already, [SpaceX is working
on]{.mark} a much larger version of the Falcon 9 reusable rocket called
Super Heavy that will carry a deep-space capsule named Starship capable
of carrying up to 100 people to the moon and eventually to
Mars.]{.underline} Musk's goal --- the reason he founded SpaceX --- is
to [**colonize Mars and [make humanity a multiplanetary
species]{.mark}**. He has set a goal of founding a million-person city
on Mars [by 2050]{.mark} complete with iron foundries and pizza
joints]{.underline}. Can it be done? Who knows. But this much is
certain: **[[Private-sector innovation]{.mark} is [opening the
door]{.mark} to a new era of space exploration.]{.underline}** [Wouldn't
it be ironic if, just as capitalism is allowing us to explore the
farthest reaches of our solar system, Americans decided to embrace
socialism back here on Earth?]{.underline}

**Space col is [possible]{.underline}.**

[Elon Musk hopes to have a metropolis a million earthlings strong on
Mars by mid-century]{.underline}, complete with everything from
factories to breweries. **[But]{.underline}** before anyone can swill
down a Martian IPA, **[[we\'ll]{.mark} first have to [deal with
the]{.mark} myriad [ways the]{.mark} red [planet can kill a
person]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If you were teleported to Mars with just
basic camping gear, you\'d eventually die of radiation poisoning or
cancer. But you\'d freeze to death long before then, most likely on the
first night when temperatures dip to Antarctic levels. Before that,
you\'d suffocate trying to breathe the atmosphere made up of mostly
carbon dioxide. But before even that, the very low atmospheric pressure
on Mars would cause your blood to literally boil, regardless of the
outside temperature. In short, [**camping out there will require much
more than pitching a tent.** Fortunately]{.underline} for aspiring
Martians, **[humans have spent a lot of time thinking about how to live
on a relatively inhospitable planet millions of miles away from
Earth]{.underline}**. Ideas have ranged from big bubble cities to
underground bases \-- one of NASA\'s latest concepts even involves
Martian homes made of fungi. While Mars may be preferable to closer
options like Venus with its boiling heat and toxic atmosphere, or the
moon with zero atmosphere and space stations lacking gravity, it\'s
still a problematic environment. \"You would fizz to death,\" the SETI
Institute\'s Pascal Lee explains in the video below. On Earth we never
worry about going full soda, thanks to our very friendly atmosphere and
helpful magnetic field. But **[on Mars [we\'ll]{.mark} need to [create
infrastructure]{.mark} to solve the problems our planet handles
automatically.]{.underline}** And of course, we also have to develop
ways to extract the water and oxygen we need to survive from a Martian
landscape that has hidden them away in pockets of ice, soil, rock and
extremely thin air. **[[Easy peasy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, Lee
and others who have cataloged the many ways to die on Mars do not see
them as insurmountable hurdles. In fact, [there might be **one
[ready-made]{.mark} [solution]{.mark} for living on Mars that\'s viable
from the moment humans arrive for the very first time.** Just [stay on
the ship]{.mark}.]{.underline} Living in the parking lot This futuristic
render shows a [[collection of Starships]{.mark} hanging out [on the
surface]{.mark} of Mars]{.underline}. Elon Musk and Space [envision
astronauts initially living out of the spaceships **[while constructing
a]{.mark} more [permanent]{.mark} human [settlement]{.mark}** on the Red
Planet. SpaceX]{.underline} The first people to arrive via a SpaceX
Starship will likely live and work out of the landed spacecraft in the
beginning. **[\"\[Starships\]]{.underline}** are very valuable on the
surface of Mars,\" said Paul Wooster, the company\'s principal Mars
development engineer, in 2018 at a Mars Society convention. \"[You\'d
actually be having most of the ships stay and you\'d be operating using
the various systems on them to support the activities
there]{.underline}.\" Living in the ship after arrival isn\'t just a
SpaceX idea, though. The [Mars Society]{.underline}, founded in 1998 to
advocate for exploring and setting up a human presence on Mars, has its
own \"Mars Direct\" plan. It also [suggests traveling to Mars in
habitats or \"habs\" that could then be used to set up a base on the
surface once the earthlings arrive.]{.underline} The habs could be
connected together, in much the same way that modular buildings are
trucked around on Earth and quickly hooked together on site. \"**[We
could have [people]{.mark} on Mars [by 2030]{.mark} and a
[permanent]{.mark} manned [base by
2040]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,\"]{.mark} Zubrin told me in 2018. Besides
bringing their own shelter to start, Martian pioneers must also pack the
right tools to harvest materials from the rugged landscape in order to
build a more permanent crib. \"Very little that pertains to living on
Mars in the early years will involve off-the-shelf equipment and
supplies from Earth,\" writes Stephen Petranek in his book How We\'ll
Live on Mars. \"Almost every tool or device in use on Mars will need to
have been carefully thought out.\" Building from scratch For the long
term, a basic modular camp like the one Matt Damon struggles with in
2015\'s The Martian may not offer sufficient protection from radiation
and other dangers, especially in the case of a powerful solar flare
aimed directly at Mars. **[[Radiation shielding]{.mark} doesn\'t need to
be high-tech]{.underline}**. [A barrier made up of [water or]{.mark}
certain [plastics]{.mark} can [work]{.mark}, as can simply going
underground.]{.underline} Former NASA physician Jim Logan estimates
putting our fragile, fleshy bodies behind or beneath about **[[9
feet]{.mark} (2.7 meters) [of Martian soil]{.mark} should
suffice]{.underline}**. Zubrin has also suggested using thick bricks
made from Martian regolith to construct shelter, adding a uniquely
medieval castle vibe to the more traditionally sleek and futuristic
vision of a Mars outpost. [Old lava tubes and underground caves are also
ideal places to shelter, both early on and in the case of emergencies
like major dust and solar storms that can sometimes spread across the
entire planet.]{.underline} In the absence of other options, **[[3D
printing]{.mark} technology [offers]{.mark} another alternative for
creating [custom structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. NASA held a 3D
printed habitat challenge in 2019, with New York\'s AI SpaceFactory
(which bills itself as a \"multi-planetary architectural and technology
design agency\") winning the top prize for a system that built a
lightweight but strong structure using autonomous robots requiring
almost no human guidance. Going underground or behind thick walls isn\'t
exactly great for the agriculture that\'s going to be essential to
sustain any presence on Mars, however. Mechanical engineer Andrew
Geiszler suggested at the 2015 Mars Society convention that **[[geodesic
glass domes]{.mark} could be the answer]{.underline}**. [[Mars
provides]{.mark} all [the]{.mark} raw [materials]{.mark} needed to
create glass, plastic and metals that can then be turned into dome
homes.]{.underline} \"**[Ultimately we\'re going to need to use native
materials. It\'s very feasible. They\'re there for the
taking]{.underline}**.\" The glass dome structure has been popular in
visions of Mars settlements going back decades, including in some recent
renderings from HP\'s Mars Home Planet concept challenge that asked
designers to draw up plans for a city on Mars. This leaves the question
of exactly where on Mars is best to establish a presence. None of the
above is possible without access to water, which we need to create
oxygen, grow food and produce fuel and other raw materials. So finding
precious H2O will be a top priority along with shelter from the elements
when choosing a site. [[Water has been found]{.mark} in Martian soil, in
trace amounts in the air, and in significant amounts near and below ice
deposits. Moving to the edge of a Martian ice cap would likely be too
cold and windy, but the [planet]{.mark} also [offers]{.mark} intriguing
[craters]{.mark} and canyons [that pro]{.mark}vide a certain amount of
[shelter,]{.mark} building materials and water from deposits of ice or
possibly even springs. The remarkable Valles Marineris, a massive gorge
eight times longer and four times deeper than the Grand Canyon, is one
place often suggested as a dramatic second home for hardy humans. **Time
to [Terraform]{.mark}**]{.underline} Maintaining all of the necessary
life support systems on Mars will be quite an undertaking, which is why
[Musk and others have a long, long term vision of expanding the
habitable bubble we construct on Mars to eventually encompass the entire
planet. **The concept is often referred to as
terraforming**]{.underline}, and [would [involve]{.mark} changing the
planet\'s environment to be more earth-like. Musk notably proposed
nuking Mars\' poles to [release]{.mark} massive amounts of [greenhouse
gases to warm the planet]{.mark}, although he\'s also amenable to
massive solar mirrors.]{.underline}
