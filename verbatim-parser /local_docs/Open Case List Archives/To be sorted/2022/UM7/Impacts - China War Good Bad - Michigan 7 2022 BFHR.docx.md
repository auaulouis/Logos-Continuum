This logic has not been well-recognized by either US foreign
policymakers or scholars of US-China relations, however. On economic
issues, the US adopted a strategy of unconditional cooperation for the
first two decades of China's rise. This strategy was not necessarily
misguided. However, absent any degree of hedging by the US, China's
cooperation with the US-led economic order should have been seen as
largely non-credible[. A [rising China had strong incentives to]{.mark}
[misrepresent]{.mark} any hypothetically-[revisionist intentions]{.mark}
it might have held]{.underline}, as long [as doing so would elicit
continued US accommodation that facilitated China's rapid power
gains]{.underline}. Yet [many China experts took China's cooperative
behavior]{.underline} during this period [at face value, ignoring its
incentives to misrepresent and drawing overly optimistic conclusions
that China truly shared American preferences for the international
order]{.underline} \[29, 32, 56, 61\].

Even more troublingly[, the [Trump administration]{.mark} has recently
[expressed confident beliefs]{.mark} that [China's intentions are
hostile]{.mark}, and consequently begun to implement policies of
escalating]{.underline} economic [containment toward China]{.underline}.
Yet this conclusion is also unwarranted: China's revisionist behavior
has been generally limited to its territorial disputes in the South
China Sea, whereas its economic and institutional actions are either
ambiguous or supportive of the US-led liberal order \[31\].

Ironically, the Trump administration's emerging strategy of economic
containment, which has been adopted due to ill-formed pessimistic
beliefs about China's intentions, lends considerable (though incomplete)
credibility to China's cooperative signals on economic and institutional
dimensions. To the extent that China continues to defend and advocate a
rules-based liberal economic order in the face of Trump's economic
containment, this is a much more credible signal of China's benign
intentions than its previous cooperation under unconditional US
accommodation. Thus, current US foreign policy turns the logic of
hedging on its head: rather than hedging due to uncertainty and updating
their beliefs in response to China's subsequent behavior, policymakers
have assumed China's hostility and are initiating what appears to be a
strategy of unconditional containment.

Power Shifts, Uncertainty, and US-China Relations

The Thucydides trap is not a new concept -- it is fundamentally
equivalent to what Jack Levy referred to more than three decades ago as
the preventive motivation for war \[9, 42\]. When a declining state
knows that its preferences conflict with those of a rising state, war
can occur due to the well-known "commitment problem," which refers to a
rising state's inability to commit to not use its future power gains to
exploit the declining state \[13, 54\]. Under complete information,
there is always a range of peaceful bargains that both the riser and
decliner would prefer to war, if the bargain could be guaranteed to
endure into the future. However, as the rising state gains power its
bargaining leverage would increase, giving it an ex post incentive to
revise the settlement in its own favor at the decliner's expense. Thus,
when the power shift is sufficiently large, the declining state prefers
a winner-take-all war in the present to the eventual settlement the
riser will impose in the future if the decliner were to acquiesce to the
power shift.

Note, however, that the commitment problem obtains only when the rising
and declining states have sufficiently divergent preferences over the
shape of the international order. If the rising and declining states
have highly compatible preferences, the decliner sacrifices little by
allowing the riser to gain power. This "benign" riser (from the
decliner's perspective) would simply use its power to maintain the same
order that the decliner prefers. Conversely, however, [if the [riser's
preferences]{.mark} are]{.underline} highly [[incompatible with the
decliner's]{.mark}, then it will use its power gains to radically revise
the international order in ways that are at odds with the decliner's
preferences]{.underline}. It is with this sort of "hostile" rising state
that commitment problems obtain under complete information, [[yielding
strong incentives for the decliner to initiate]{.underline}]{.mark}
preventive [[war]{.underline}]{.mark}. Commitment problems do not obtain
when the rising state is known to be benign (\[36\]:119; \[67\]).

This [raises the question of what the decliner should do when it is
uncertain about the compatibility of the rising state's preferences with
its own]{.underline}. As discussed below, [this is the situation that
characterizes contemporary US-China relations. It is this sort of
[uncertainty]{.mark} that [lies at the heart of the security
dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} the phenomenon [by which
[conflict can occur even between states]{.mark} [with
mutually-compatible preferences due to]{.mark}]{.underline} misplaced
(but rational) [[distrust]{.mark} of the other's
intentions]{.underline}. Under the combination of shifting power and
uncertainty, commitment problems potentially obtain if the rising state
turns out to be hostile. In this case, [the decliner]{.underline} may
[not be willing to risk accommodating the rising state]{.underline} if
the consequences of exploitation by a hostile riser outweigh the
benefits of cooperation with a benign one. [Instead, the decliner would
initiate]{.underline} preventive [conflict]{.underline}. Yet because
there is some probability that the rising state is actually benign, this
opens up the possibility of "tragic" conflict between truly compatible
states. If uncertainty about the riser's intentions cannot be overcome,
or at least mitigated, [a sufficiently large power shift would produce
war even between rational states whose interests do not conflict at
all]{.underline}.

A prominent subset of realist scholars has compellingly argued that this
is often the case: [large power shifts engender formidable barriers to
the credibility of rising states' cooperative signals]{.underline}, such
that uncertainty about others' intentions is intractable [and
**[declining states]{.mark} must [make worst-case assumptions]{.mark}
about rising states' intentions**]{.underline} \[9, 12, 45, 53\]. This
is [**because hostile rising states have strong incentives to
misrepresent their intentions** while relatively weak, by mimicking the
cooperative behaviors of benign risers and refraining from attempting to
revise the international order]{.underline}. These realists argue that
for hostile risers the costs of foregoing immediate revision are
outweighed by the prospects of [avoiding opposition from the decliner
and attempting revision under a more favorable distribution of power in
the future]{.underline}. As such, **[if [cooperative signals]{.mark} are
likely to be sent by both benign and hostile risers]{.underline}**
alike, **[such signals [are non-credible,]{.mark} and declining
states]{.underline}** should [**remain highly uncertain** about any
rising state's]{.underline} future [intentions. This exacerbates the
security dilemma, and gives declining states strong incentives to
take]{.underline} preventive [action even against risers that have
exhibited cooperative behavior]{.underline}.

[This barrier to credible signaling during power shifts has]{.underline}
also [been applied to contemporary US-China relations]{.underline}. For
many realists, [it is entirely possible that]{.underline} "[China is
just practicing common sense and behaving itself until it is a more
powerful and consolidated entity]{.underline}" (\[33\]:203),
[and]{.underline} "[pursuing a peaceful policy today in order to
strengthen itself to confront the United States tomorrow]{.underline}"
(\[40\]:14). As such, a common conclusion has been that "we cannot tell
much about China's future behavior, because it \[currently\] has such
limited capacity to act aggressively" (\[46\]:385).

#### Chinese CRISPR causes extinction\-\--global bioweapons war and irreversible infertility

What is CRISPR all about? CRISPR (or CRISPR-Cas9) stands for Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats which are "systems that
can be programmed to target specific stretches of genetic code and to
edit DNA at precise locations".3 In short, researchers can permanently
modify genes in living organisms with CRISPR. In the early 2000s
scientists first started to name specific repeat regions in bacterial
genomes CRISPR. Around 2010 scientists showed that together with the
protein Cas9 it is possible to target specific DNA sequences and in 2012
researchers demonstrated that it is possible to delete or replace any
gene in an organism's genome.4 As happens often in the history of
science, different research groups published their discoveries at the
same time5. This lead to a fierce patent fight that has been decided
only recently.6 7 The whole patent fight calls into question how useful
such patents are. After all, the CRISPR technology is based on knowledge
accumulated in various labs around the world and mainly financed through
public resources.8 A CRISPR-monster born in China While the major
discoveries and the first commercialization of the technology all
happened in the West, C[hina took the CRISPR stage in 2015, a year that
has been called CRISPR's "monster" year by the MIT Technology Review.9
This is not surprising, as [China has]{.mark} since 2013
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} second [[largest R&D spending in the
world]{.mark}10 [and CRISPR is an explicit priority area]{.mark} for the
Chinese Academy of Sciences]{.underline}.11 In the years between the
initial discovery and 2015 [**[Chinese scientists have pushed the
boundaries of science.]{.mark}** In 2015 even the Chinese public became
aware or CRISPR as the data of Chinese search volumes on the Chinese
Internet illustrates.12 Scientists in [China]{.mark} have [successfully
modified the genes of living organism]{.mark}s such as monkeys, dogs,
and goats]{.underline}.13 A group of scientists in Shanxi province, for
example, successfully created a new type of goat with longer hair (more
Cashmere wool) and stronger muscle growth (more meat for food
consumption).14 [The biggest Chinese breakthrough to date also happened
in 2015, when a group of Chinese researchers [managed to edit human
embryos]{.mark} for the first time.15 This move came not without
criticism.]{.underline} In 2015, a number of scientists called for a
moratorium because "genome editing in human embryos using current
technologies could have unpredictable effects on future generations".16
Relative search volume for "CRISPR" over time on China's second largest
search engine Qihoo 360. Peak in November 2015 and stronger attention
afterward. [The genetically edited embryos of the first Chinese
experiment [showed]{.mark} some [unintended
mutations]{.mark}]{.underline}. 17 Still, in 2016, CRISPR was tested for
the first time in a person during a clinical trial in Chengdu.18 At the
moment, externally applied gels and creams are tested in China to treat
patients infected with the human papillomavirus.19 Of course, such
simple applications of CRISPR could help to cure many diseases in the
future. At the same time[, [the risk of CRISPR is great, both]{.mark} if
the technology is used [for criminal purposes as well as]{.mark} if
benevolent applications of CRISPR yield [unintended]{.mark} or at least
undesirable [outcomes]{.mark}.]{.underline} CRISPR as existential risk
[Saying that CRISPR is risky is not very controversial -- assuming that
new technologies are inherently risky is a common heuristic. However,
labeling CRISPR as an existential risk might sound outright alarmist.
But it is not: [CRISPR is]{.mark} indeed [an anthropogenic existential
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that does not mean that humankind is just
about to be wiped out by it. Existential risks are risks that threaten
the existence of humankind. Existential risks have a maximally great
scope (all humans are affected, even future generations that would have
existed if not for the adverse outcome) and gravity (the risk is
terminal).20 In addition, existential risks have some probability,
usually above zero. [CRISPR is an existential risk both in civilian and
in criminal or military applications. In the latter scenario, it is
easier to understand why: Weaponized CRISPR [is a potentially potent
bioweapon that could do great damage whilst being very precise]{.mark}
and accurate. **[A global CRISPR bioweapon war]{.mark},** if it ever
came to that, [would]{.mark} not produce the same levels of physical
destruction as global nuclear war, but it might [introduce cumulative
hazards comparable to nuclear wint]{.mark}]{.underline}[er.]{.mark} The
criminal and military application of CRISPR is somewhat salient in
current risk analysis. For example, then U.S. director of national
intelligence James Clapper declared CRISPR a global threat in February
2016, along other threats such as North Korean nuclear weapons21.
Civilian applications of CRISPR are aimed at helping people, not killing
them. However, [[unintended consequences]{.mark} of premature wide-scale
introductions of CRISPR products [might create]{.mark} existential
risk]{.underline}. Imagine a thought experiment: If some pharmaceutical
company were to introduce a CRISPR anti-aging cream that really works
and makes people biologically younger, that product would be in
extremely high demand almost immediately. Now imagine that that cream
had an unintended side-effect: [**[Irreversible infertility]{.mark}**.
The CRISPR cream would, almost certainly, still be in extremely high
demand, resulting in a precipitous drop in overall fertility. This could
result in the loss of humankind's reproductive capacity and thus in the
(gradual) extinction of humankind]{.underline}. The existential risk of
CRISPR (and similar technologies) is typical of the dilemma of human
progress: The [more technologically mature humankind becomes, the
greater anthropogenic human risks become]{.underline} Gene editing race
between China and the US In 2017, after China had taken the CRISPR lead,
it was time for the US to push the boundaries. Just recently, results of
an experiment from scientists in the US were published: The scientists
involved in the experiment also modified genes in human embryos, just as
their Chinese counterparts did, but this time, apparently no mutations
occurred.22 The technology and research race between the two nations can
best be illustrated with the number of publications originating in each
country. Since 2002, when Jansen et al.23 coined the term CRISPR in
their paper, 6,942 scientific papers were published up to now.24 Most
papers originated from US institutions (2890) followed by Chinese (919),
German (413) Japanese institutions (390). Even though CRISPR research is
dominated by institutions situated in the US and China, it is a
technology used all over the world. One major reason is the rather low
cost of the procedure.25 It is even possible to buy a "DIY Bacterial
Gene Engineering CRISPR Kit" to do your own gene editing at home.26
However, this kit only allows using the most basic form of CRISPR.
Colour intensity indicates the number of papers originating in a
specific country. We used the country of the institution of the
corresponding author of a paper. Data from Web of Science -- own
visualization. How to regulate the unimaginable [It is very likely that
we just got a first glimpse of what will be possible in the future.
After the first experiment in China with human embryos, scientists from
all around the world gathered at a global summit in Washington DC in
2015.27 Unsurprisingly, it was difficult for the participants to reach
an agreement as every country regulates research
differently.]{.underline} In the end, a statement by the organizers
"stopped short of calling for a ban on editing human embryos and germ
cells for basic research".28 In cases where the work of scientists
affects society as a whole, [[governments usually start to regulate
research]{.mark}. In the case of the US, for example, a majority of
people is worried about the idea of gene-edited babies**.29 [In
democratic societies, citizens can influence regulations]{.mark} and
public debates about opportunities and threats are
possible**]{.underline}. In Switzerland, we had a national vote in 2016
about genetic testing of embryos.30 The majority approved to modify the
law on medically assisted reproduction. **[However, [in authoritarian
countries, such decisions are made top-down without open public
debates.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

In "Should the United States Reject MAD?" [Charles [Glaser and]{.mark}
Steve [Fetter]{.mark}]{.underline} argue that the United States should
forgo a damage-limitation capability against China's strategic forces.1
To arrive at this conclusion, however, they [underestimate the
advantages of a \[End Page 199\] damage-limitation strategy and do not
even consider more feasible and desirable policy options for a strategic
equilibrium with China]{.underline}. When these steps are corrected, it
becomes clear that the United States should not forgo this capability.
Rather, [it should preserve its damage-limitation capability and
quantitative nuclear superiority over China, while accepting the
inevitability of China's possession of an assured nuclear retaliatory
capability. Glaser and Fetter begin by [making]{.mark} the [conceptual
mistake of searching for an]{.mark} [arbitrary threshold for
meaningful]{.mark} damage [limitation.]{.mark} In doing so, they
underestimate the value of limiting damage in the event of nuclear war.
Glaser and Fetter are correct that completely denying China's nuclear
deterrent is increasingly difficult if not impossible as China expands
and modernizes its arsenal, but this is an [unnecessarily high
bar.]{.mark} **Damage [limitation is]{.mark} better conceived of as a
[continuous, not]{.mark} a [binary, variable]{.mark}. There is no
magical threshold**]{.underline} beyond which the ability to limit
damage in a nuclear war ceases to matter. Any U.S. president would want
to protect as much of the country as possible in the event of a nuclear
exchange, and any damage-limitation capability (even far below the
threshold set by Glaser and Fetter) would therefore be valuable. [To
argue otherwise, one would have to argue that saving millions of
American lives is unimportant or politically irrelevant, which is an
untenable position.]{.underline}

For several years, [U.S. military publications]{.underline} have
[suggested]{.underline} that [China is working on MIRVing
ICBMs]{.underline}.37 The 2015 DoD report on Chinese military power
stipulates, for the first time, that MIRVed missiles have been deployed
operationally, specifically on the CSS-4 Mod 3 (a modified version of
the DF-5A).38 [In both our high and low estimates]{.underline},
therefore, [we posit that number of Chinese]{.underline} CSS-4s
([DF-5As]{.underline}) [remains unchanged at 20]{.underline}, but [that
half of the force has been MIRVed]{.underline}, with each of the MIRVed
missiles carrying three warheads.39 [It is **unclear why
[China]{.mark}** would **begin [MIRVing]{.mark}** with]{.underline} its
force of [**[DF-5s]{.mark}**, which, due to their vulnerability, [**will
not contribute much** to **second-strike
survivability**]{.mark}]{.underline} even with more warheads. [Beyond
2017]{.underline}, it seems likely that [China may MIRV its road-mobile
DF-41, which is **currently under development**]{.underline} and which
would yield more in terms of retaliatory credibility.40 **\*\*FOOTNOTE
40 BEGINS\*\*** 40 Given that [existing mobile missiles]{.underline}
([including the **DF-31**, **DF-31A**, and **JL-2**]{.underline}) [are
**relatively small** and would require **miniaturized warheads**, they
are **unlikely candidates**]{.underline}. The DF-41 is said to be some
25-percent heavier than the CSS-10 Mod 2 (DF-31A). Jane's Strategic
Weapons Systems, "DF-41 (CSS-X-10)," January 6, 2015. **\*\*FOOTNOTE 40
ENDS\*\*** Both our high and low estimates for China posit that the
number of CSS-10 Mod 1s (DF-31s) will remain unchanged at 12, but in the
case of CSS-10 Mod 2s (DF-31As), there is some uncertainty with regard
to the size of the force, and we estimate the potential inventory at
between 24 and 48.41 There is also some uncertainty as to how many
CSS-NX-14s (JL-2s) might be in service by 2017. Jane's Fighting Ships
reports four Jin-class submarines in service by the end of 2015, with a
fifth to be commissioned in 2017.42 The JL-2 SLBM, carried by the Jin,
encountered problems during testing, but DoD suggested that tests in
2012 were successful, and DoD's 2014 Annual Report to Congress on
Chinese military power reported that the Jin would undertake its first
operational patrols shortly.43 We posit that China will have five
Jin-class submarines in service by 2017, with between 50 percent and 100
percent of their full complement of 12 JL-2 SLBMs each (totaling between
30 and 60 missiles).44 Both the Jin-class platform and the missile it
carries will be a dramatic improvement over the minimal capability
offered by the single Xia-class (Type 092) submarine in past years. We
assume that the single Xia-class SSBN will be taken out of service. If
it remains in the inventory, its operational status and usefulness will
be questionable. The U.S. nuclear arsenal size in 2017 will be
constrained by the New START agreement with Russia and, as a result,
will be smaller than it was in 2010. For the sake of simplicity, we use
the end-point 2018 delivery system numbers for 2017, since it is
uncertain when the United States will reach the New START 2018 limits
(see Figure 12.7). We do not follow the New START definition of
"deployed warheads." Under New START, the United States and Russia are
each limited to 700 deployed strategic delivery systems (ballistic
missiles and nuclear-capable bombers), with up to 100 in reserve. The
treaty allows each side up to 1,550 deployed warheads. However, New
START counts nuclear-capable bombers as a single deployed warhead,
despite the ability to place more weapons on the platforms during
wartime.45 [Using the New START numbers]{.underline} for 2017 delivery
vehicles but a somewhat more liberal definition of warheads, [the number
of U.S. delivery systems will fall]{.underline} from 882 in 2010 [to
700]{.underline} and the number of deployed warheads will fall from
4,806 to 2,144.46 Based on current plans, it appears that the number of
Minuteman III ICBMs will be reduced from 450 in 2010 to 400 in 2017, and
all will be fitted with a single warhead. The United States will
maintain its fleet of 14 Ohio-class SSBNs, but at least two will be in
overhaul at any one time (and not count against limits), and each boat
will sail with only 20 of its 24 tubes loaded with nuclear-capable
Trident D-5 Mk-4A and Mk-5 SLBMs. The United States will maintain 60
nuclear-capable bombers, which we posit will include 44 B-52Hs and 16
B-2As. While we assume that [there will be **enough gravity bombs** for
each B-2A to carry a full complement of 20 weapons (for a total of **256
warheads**]{.underline}), the load-out for B-52Hs will be limited by the
inventory of air-launched cruise missiles (a total of 528 missiles and
warheads). Finally, the United States expanded its number of GBIs from
24 to 30 in 2010, and, in March 2013, DoD announced a further increase
to 44 by 2017.47 Chinese Vulnerability to First Strike, 2017 Even the
low-end projected Chinese force structure outlined above suggests a more
robust and survivable Chinese second-strike capability by 2017, though
[U.S. **missile defense** and **intelligence efforts** against PLAN
SSBNs will]{.underline} likely [continue to **cause concerns** in
Beijing about the **viability of its second-strike**
forces]{.underline}. In the low Chinese case, [U.S. forces must
target]{.underline} the CSS-10 Mod 1 (DF-31), CSS-10 Mod 2 (DF-31A),
CSS-4 Mod 2 (DF-5A), and CSS-4 Mod 3 (DF-5B) [ICBMs and SSBN
bases]{.underline} harboring the Jin-class (Type 094) that employ SLBMs.
[At the **lowest alert level**, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[can]{.mark} **target and [destroy all]{.mark} of the [weapons]{.mark}**
that are located and susceptible to attack [with]{.mark} an [**80
percent chance of success** using]{.mark} 157 weapons.]{.underline}
While [this represents]{.underline} approximately [[7 percent of]{.mark}
the total U.S. [arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}, it still leaves 1,987
warheads for other purposes. [The number of surviving Chinese weapons
(15) in]{.underline} the [2017]{.underline} case [is **marginally
larger** than the surviving number in the 2010 case]{.underline} (13).
In reality, the gains to survivability should be considered more
significant than this modeling might suggest. The surviving systems in
the 2017 modeling include three types of relatively modern systems: the
CSS-10 Mod 1 (DF-31), the CSS-10 Mod 2 (DF-31A), and the CSS-NX-14
(JL-2), associated with the Jin-class (Type 094) submarine. With five
operational submarines and 36 road-mobile ICBM launchers, it becomes
more reasonable to imagine modest alert levels that would ensure that a
portion of both the land- and sea-based legs of China's nuclear dyad are
kept deployed on an operational basis. While the Jinclass SSBNs will
require a "shakedown" period, their introduction into operational
service represents a major advance for Chinese nuclear forces and their
survivability. The results of attacks against the 2017 upper bound
("high estimate") case for Chinese missiles, which includes a larger
number of CSS-10 Mod 2s (DF-31As) and CSS-N-14s (JL-2 missiles), are
somewhat different. In this case, China possesses 160 warheads able to
reach the United States prior to the attack, instead of 106. After the
hypothetical U.S. first strike, 27 Chinese warheads remain, 12 more than
in the "low estimate" case (see Figure 12.8). The additional Chinese
missiles and the warheads atop them provide an additional buffer against
the possible compromise of some portion of China's alert forces, and
they provide a more convincing second-strike capability in the face of
U.S. missile defenses, even when those defenses are assumed to be
relatively effective in engaging targets. Note that in neither the low
nor high estimate cases does the MIRVing of DF-5 missiles contribute to
survivability against a first strike, since the missiles themselves are
highly vulnerable to attack. Beijing will continue to harbor concerns
about U.S. missile defenses, as well about intelligence-gathering
efforts directed against Chinese SSBNs. In the 2017 low Chinese case,
[the 44 [interceptors]{.mark} deployed by the United States will
**[outnumber surviving]{.mark} Chinese strategic [warheads]{.mark}** by
nearly **[three to one]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the "high" case, the
ratio is less than two to one. In the more distant future, if U.S. GBI
missile deployment halts at 44 and each interceptor continues to carry
only one warhead, the Chinese secondstrike capability will ultimately be
able to overwhelm U.S. defenses, especially if China puts MIRVs in the
more survivable portion of its missiles. However, Chinese confidence in
the effectiveness of its second-strike capability will likely depend on
the extent of U.S. interceptor deployment, as well as the state of U.S.
missile defense technology and advances in Chinese penetration aids. It
will also depend on the survivability of China's alert forces,
especially its SSBNs. In addition to hosting large numbers of survivable
missiles, SSBNs are the only Chinese weapons that can launch missiles at
U.S. targets from areas where the trajectories do not take them near
U.S. GBI sites in Fort Greely, Alaska. Our counterforce first strike
modeling, and the sensitivity of results to the size of mobile forces,
helps explain why Beijing has reacted to the activities of special
oceanographic surveillance ships equipped with SURTASS, such as with the
USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS-23), near Yalong Submarine Base in March 2009.
The sonar on these ships is designed "to perform acoustic collection
surveillance to help locate and identify submarines."48 As mentioned
earlier, Yalong, with its underground submarine portal is a likely
location for the new Jin-class (Type 094) SSBN. If the U.S. Navy can
detect and trail Chinese SSBNs in the open sea, the Chinese
second-strike capability once again becomes questionable, especially
when U.S. anti-submarine warfare activities are combined with an active
missile defense program. This prognosis, however, only pertains to the
immediate future. Looking somewhat beyond 2017, China will likely be
able to achieve a highly secure second-strike capability (even with very
conservative estimates from China's perspective), and further increases
on its part beyond that point may raise more serious questions about its
ultimate intentions. Conclusions [Given the asymmetry in
the]{.underline} respective [number of nuclear weapons, it is hardly
surprising that]{.underline} our [modeling shows **severe structural
imbalances**]{.underline} in outcomes (see Table 12.7). [In **every
period**, a **U.S. first strike** could **destroy all targets** with
known locations with a relatively **high degree of confidence**,
**leaving** a relatively **small number of missiles** on alert and
therefore ostensibly **not susceptible to attack**]{.underline}. [Given
the **small numbers** of systems that might be deployed]{.underline} at
any given point in time, [Beijing would]{.underline} almost [**certainly
have concerns** about the **effectiveness** of its **second-strike
capability**]{.underline}. Assuming a similar level of alert for each of
the periods considered, our modeling suggests that the number of Chinese
warheads that might survive a first strike has increased over time, from
four in 1996 to six in 2003, 13 in 2010, and between 15 and 27 in 2017.
More importantly, the systems deployed have become more dependable and
survivable over time. In 1996, survivability depended entirely on the
status of the Xia, with silo-based CSS-4 Mod 2s (DF-5As) being in fixed
locations and therefore highly vulnerable to attack. Since 2003,
however, new classes of road-mobile missiles, the CSS-10 Mod 1 (DF-31)
and, later, the CSS-10 Mod 2 (DF-31A), have been deployed, representing
a second type of mobile asset in the Chinese inventory. Unlike the CSS-4
Mod 2 (DF-5A), these missiles are solid-fueled and are therefore capable
of launch on short notice. The Jin-class SSBN (Type 094), five of which
are either complete or near completion, will replace the Xia-class (Type
092) by 2017 and provide a far more robust sea-based deterrent. Despite
these developments, however, Beijing continues to harbor concerns about
the survivability of its nuclear forces. Chinese leaders express
particular unease about the future of U.S. missile defenses and their
potential impact on the nuclear balance.52 While we did not attempt to
model missile defense with any fidelity, our nuclear exchange modeling
suggests that [the planned number of deployed [**U.S. GBIs alone**
(**without considering**]{.mark} the **[SM-3]{.mark} or [other
systems]{.mark}**[) could]{.mark} **continue to [outnumber]{.mark}**
[China's expected **survivable second-strike
warheads**]{.mark}]{.underline} as late as 2017. Any expansion of the
missile defense architecture or enhancements to its capabilities, such
as a move toward multiple exo-atmospheric kill vehicles on each
interceptor, would further heighten concerns in Beijing about its
retaliatory capability. Moreover, Chinese planners may question whether
[the United States, with]{.underline} its [**sophisticated space-based**
and **air-breathing ISR assets**, might be able to locate and **attack a
larger portion** of China's nuclear forces than our modeling
suggests]{.underline}. [Our model]{.underline} probably [**assumes a
higher-alert posture** for China than it **presently
practices**]{.underline}, though it is true that China now has much
greater capability to keep a portion of its force on alert, should it
choose that course. [New generations of [Chinese land-based
missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., the DF-31A) [are movable but **[not
highly mobile]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Chinese analysts question whether,
in fact, [**[SURTASS-equipped ships]{.mark}** near China are seeking to
[**collect acoustic data** on]{.mark} PLAN [SSBNs to **facilitate
their**]{.mark} **trail and [destruction]{.mark}** during a crisis or
conflict]{.underline}.53 And Chinese concerns about advanced
conventional munitions affecting the strategic balance are also
increasingly pronounced.

#### Their countermeasures are hypothetical and easily overcome

Austin **Long et al. 17** {Dr. Austin Long is a Senior Political
Scientist at the RAND Corporation and non-resident Senior Fellow at the
Foreign Policy Research Institute. 1/7/2017. "The Limits of Damage
Limitation."

[[Glaser and Fetter]{.underline}]{.mark} conclude their analysis without
extending the measure-countermeasure competition very far. In so doing,
[they **[fall prey to the "fallacy of the last move,"]{.mark} as though
there were no counters to the countermeasures they
propose**]{.underline}.2 For instance, [China can employ decoy mobile
missile complexes, but countering decoys is routine in long-term
military competitions.3]{.underline}

[In the case of surveillance of mobile missiles, U.S. space-based radar
(**[SBR]{.mark}**]{.underline}) or other \[End Page 193\] wide-area
surveillance [**could be used to [cue other sensors]{.mark},** such as
those using multi- or hyperspectral imaging. These sensors could then
[detect]{.mark} subtle differences between a [decoy missile]{.mark}
complex and an actual missile complex. Stealth is likewise no
panacea]{.underline}; it too is [subject to
countermeasures]{.underline}. Of course, responses on both sides can
continue. But without more detailed analysis, it is difficult to say
whether the United States or China will win the measure-countermeasure
battle over a protracted period of time.

Likewise, [Glaser and Fetter's argument that China can [deploy]{.mark}
its mobile [ICBMs in mountainous areas to]{.mark} limit SBR line of
sight ignores SBR's overhead perspective.]{.underline}4 Further, the
road networks in valleys between mountains that could block radar
coverage are often limited and steep. [This [would]{.mark} canalize
mobile ICBMs operating in these areas and impose significant operational
penalties. The countermeasure in this case might cost more in an
operational sense]{.underline} than it would benefit the mobile missile
force; for example, a brake failure on a descending transporter erector
launcher (TEL) would be a disaster, [and a very slow climb would [make a
located TEL a sitting duck.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Moreover, Chinese use of underground facilities and tunnels to conceal
TELs might end up being perversely helpful to U.S. planners. [The United
States has dedicated **enormous resources to [intelligence
capabilities]{.mark} intended to detect and [map underground
facilities]{.mark}**.5]{.underline} If [U.S. intelligence is able to
detect the entrances or exits to such facilities, then they would become
highly vulnerable to attack.]{.underline}

Additionally, [[Glaser and Fetter]{.mark} acknowledge but [do not
assess]{.mark} two other [systems]{.mark}]{.underline} that we have
argued elsewhere [could be used [to hunt mobile missiles:
stealthy]{.mark} penetrating [u]{.mark}nmanned [a]{.mark}erial
[v]{.mark}ehicle[s]{.mark} [and]{.mark} unattended [ground
sensors.]{.mark}6]{.underline} Admittedly, classification makes it
difficult to fully evaluate these systems; nevertheless, [they could
contribute greatly to tracking mobile missiles. Both of]{.underline}
[these technologies are amplified by efforts to automate and rapidly
integrate the data they provide for mobile missile
hunting.7]{.underline}

The difficulties in obtaining survivable C2 that bedeviled the
superpowers during the Cold War belie Glaser and Fetter's somewhat
blithe assessment of Chinese C2.8 [[C2]{.underline}]{.mark} problems may
be even more challenging today, as mobile command posts (even those in
the air) [[can be]{.mark} tracked and [targeted with]{.mark} the same
sensors that track mobile missiles]{.underline}. In addition[,
non-kinetic options for disrupting C2 have proliferated over the past
four decades.]{.underline} Even during the Cold War, [the United States
had apparently developed]{.underline} \[End Page 194\] [electronic
warfare techniques to disable Soviet strategic C2 systems]{.underline}.9
Today[, the possibility for [offensive cyber operations]{.mark} against
such systems is believed to be substantially greater]{.underline}.10

OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES: WARTIME ENDURANCE

[Survivable second-strike forces must endure through all phases of a
conflict. Yet Glaser and Fetter give short shrift to the potentially low
wartime endurance of Chinese forces]{.underline}.

[Glaser and Fetter assert that strict radio communications procedures
and use of land-lines will suffice to keep Chinese mobile ICBMs secure.
These countermeasures are difficult to sustain over time,]{.underline}
however, and all are subject to potential attacker responses. Mobile
operations will likely impose demands for frequent communications when
coordinating movement, halts, fueling, and rest breaks between the TEL
and multiple support vehicles. It is also likely, given Cold War
experience and current Chinese practices, that Chinese mobile ICBMs
would communicate their status to higher headquarters at least
sporadically.11 Unlike ballistic missile submarines, mobile missile
patrols travel in open territory. Road conditions, weather, crew health,
and other factors could negatively affect such patrols, which are also
potentially vulnerable to attack from special operations units or other
ground forces.

In the face of these possibilities, [sustained communications silence
will become increasingly difficult over time. If [communications]{.mark}
are radio frequency, they are [vulnerable to interception]{.mark} by
U.S. signals intelligence sensors]{.underline}. Low probability of
intercept transmissions will reduce but not eliminate that vulnerability
for frequently communicating and difficult to duplicate TELs, which can
be the target of barrage attack if imprecisely located. The use of
dedicated military landlines would greatly restrict patrol areas while
increasing mobile missile vulnerabilities if those lines were detected.
Commercial landlines would impose fewer operational restrictions, but
could be more easily penetrated. The United States was able to tap
Soviet undersea naval communications in the Cold War; if motivated, it
could likely tap Chinese commercial phone lines before a conflict
begins.12

In addition, [Glaser and Fetter argue that China could jam or attack SBR
satellites during wartime.]{.underline} This is by far the most
compelling of their countermeasure arguments[.]{.underline} In wartime,
though, [[jammers can]{.mark} potentially [be targeted, and]{.mark} the
fact that [an area]{.mark} is being protected by [jamming could
cue]{.mark} other [sensors to the]{.mark} likely mobile ICBM patrol
[area. Anti-satellite systems can]{.mark} likewise [be targeted.]{.mark}
Wartime is likely to produce first-strike advantages in the
surveillance-countersurveillance competition]{.underline}, which will
not benefit the party that has to move from a vulnerable to a less
vulnerable posture. \[End Page 195\]

Furthermore, as Glaser and Fetter point out, "\[[F\]or its DF-31As to
survive, China must be able to launch them from unprepared
sites]{.underline}." [Glaser and Fetter's assumption, however, that
China will be able to rely on "the Global Positioning System and other
modern positioning and navigation services" is a dubious wartime
proposition (]{.underline}p. 66). It seems more likely that
[[Chinese]{.mark} mobile [ICBMs]{.mark} will [fire only from
sites]{.mark} that have been [pre-surveyed]{.mark} and geolocated in
peacetime. Given the DF-31A's weight and maneuverability challenges,
this will impose even more limitations on China's wartime
operations.]{.underline}

POLITICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL DIFFICULTIES

Even if the Chinese prove capable of technically demanding wartime
operations, history suggests that they may face political and
organizational challenges in preparing their forces during peacetime.
This is especially true in the area of nuclear C2. All [states face a
sharp trade-off between negative control (assurances against
unauthorized use) and positive control (assurances for authorized use)
over their nuclear weapons. This trade-off produces [strong incentives
not to pursue]{.mark} the pre-delegation and [launch-on-warning
measures]{.mark} that [Glaser and Fetter assume]{.mark} China will
implement. These incentives]{.underline} may be [particularly strong in
authoritarian states, where the threat of internal unrest to nuclear
forces, strains in civil-military relations,]{.underline} and worries
about political succession may all bias decisions toward prioritizing
negative control over survivable nuclear C2.

This pattern was demonstrated in the only other comparable case: the
Cold War Soviet Union.13 Moscow's civilian leadership abhorred
pre-delegation. [The Soviets also prioritized negative control in their
launch procedures, which required no less than three members of the high
command to authorize weapons release and two generals to generate
portions of the launch code]{.underline}. As Glaser and Fetter
themselves point out, **[[China presently appears to favor negative
control]{.mark} over an invulnerable posture for its mobile ICBMs in
peacetime]{.underline}** (pp. 72--73).

In sum, [Glaser and Fetter omit from their analysis technical,
organizational, and political factors favorable to U.S. damage-limiting
capabilities]{.underline}. Yet damage limitation could be inadvisable
even if technically plausible. We now turn to the political utility of
damage limitation.

### \--2NC\-\--AT: Subs

#### SSBNs fail

**Kristensen and Norris, '18** Hans M. Kristensen, director of the
Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists and
his collaboration with researchers at NRDC in 2010 resulted in an
estimate of the size of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile that was only
13 weapons off the actual number declassified by the U.S. government,
and Robert S. Norris, senior fellow with the Federation of American
Scientists in Washington, DC and a former senior research associate with
the Natural Resources Defense Council, June 25^th^, 2018, "Chinese
nuclear forces", Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Volume 74, Issue 4:
Special issue: Missile Defense, around the world and, perhaps, in space,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2018.1486620>, EO

[[China currently operates a]{.mark} fleet of [four]{.mark}
Jin-class]{.underline} (Type 094) [nuclear-powered ballistic missile
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline} (SSBNs). All are based at the Longposan
naval base near Yulin on Hainan Island.

Each Jin SSBN is designed to carry up to 12 JL-2s (CSS-N-14), a
submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that is a modified version
of the DF-31. Each JL-2 is equipped with a single warhead (and,
possibly, penetration aids). [The JL-2 has not been flight-tested to its
full range but is thought to have a range of 7,000-plus km]{.underline}.
A 2015 Pentagon report estimated its range is 7,400 km (US Defense
Department 2015, 9), and a 2016 Pentagon report put the range at 7,200
km (US Defense Department 2016, 26). The 2017 NASIC report sets the
range at 7,000-plus km (US Air Force, National Air and Space
Intelligence Center 2017, 33). That would be sufficient to target
Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Russia, and India from waters near China -- but
[unless the submarine carrying the weapon sailed significantly eastward,
**it [could not target the]{.mark} continental [United
States]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We are uncertain how many SSBNs China plans to build. The US Office of
Naval Intelligence predicted more than a decade ago that China might
build five Jin-class SSBNs (Kristensen 2007). The 2015 Pentagon report
agreed with that projection, saying "up to five may enter service"
before China begins work on a next-generation SSBN (US Defense
Department 2015, 9), and the US Director of National Intelligence stated
in 2018 that China "might produce additional JIN-class nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarines" (Coats, 7).

Although the Jin-class is more advanced than China's first experimental
SSBN -- the single and now inoperable Xia (Type 092) -- [it is
[still]{.mark} a **[very noisy design]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Kristensen
2009b). [It seems]{.underline} more [likely that [China will]{.mark} end
production after five boats and [turn its efforts to **develop**]{.mark}
**and produce [a better third-generation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Type
096) **[[SSBN over the next decade]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The next SSBN
is expected to carry a new missile, the JL-3.

It remains uncertain whether Jin submarines have ever sailed on
deterrent patrols with nuclear weapons on board. US Chief of Naval
Operations Vice Admiral Joseph Mulloy said in early 2015 that one
Chinese SSBN had gone on a 95-day patrol (Osborne 2015). In late 2015,
STRATCOM Commander Admiral Cecil Haney said Chinese SSBNs had been at
sea, and that he didn't know if they had nukes on board but had to
assume they did (Gertz 2015). In early 2016, the head of the US Defense
Intelligence Agency said the Chinese navy "deployed the JIN-class
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine in 2015" on an extended
patrol far from Chinese waters (Stewart 2016, 12).

These statements indicate that although one of the Jin submarines
apparently sailed on an extended voyage in 2015, it is not clear that it
carried nuclear warheads, or whether it was conducting a formal
deterrent patrol. The voyage might have been a [first step towards
developing the capability to conduct deterrent patrols in the
future]{.underline}.

[To achieve that capability, the Chinese SSBN fleet will face several
doctrinal, technical, and operational constraint]{.underline}s. Although
Chinese missile forces frequently practice the procedures required to
load warheads onto missiles, [China's Central Military Commission has
long **resisted handing out nuclear warheads** to the armed services to
deploy on missiles under normal circumstances. **[Giving]{.mark} custody
of [nuclear warheads to]{.mark} deployed [submarines during peacetime
would constitute a significant change of Chinese]{.mark}
policy**]{.underline}. Moreover, [before doing so, the Central Military
Commission and China's navy would **first have to build up experience to
operate an SSBN force during realistic military operations**, which
would require development of improved command-and-control technologies
and procedures]{.underline}.

The SSBNs would also need a destination. [Even if China deployed
nuclear-armed SSBNs to sea in a crisis]{.underline}, where would they
sail? [For a JL-2 to be able to strike targets in the continental United
States, a Jin [SSBN would have to sail across]{.mark} the East China Sea
and well into [the Pacific Ocean]{.mark}, through **[dangerous choke
points]{.mark} where it [would draw atte]{.mark}ntion and be vulnerable
to hostile antisubmarine warfare**]{.underline} (see Figure 1).

China's main concern is making sure that its minimum nuclear deterrent
would survive a first strike, and for that reason it spends considerable
resources on modernizing and hiding its land-based missiles. This
frankly makes its submarine program puzzling, for [it seems much riskier
for China to deploy nuclear weapons at sea, where submarines can be sunk
by adversaries]{.underline}, than to hide the nuclear weapons deep
inside China's vast landmass (Kristensen 2014).

https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/657917}//JM

THE FADING PROBLEM OF FRATRICIDE [One type of [fratricide occurs
when]{.mark} the prompt effects of [nuclear
detonations]{.mark}---radiation, heat, and
overpressure---[destroy]{.mark} or deflect [nearby warheads]{.mark}. To
protect those warheads, targeters must separate the incoming weapons by
at least 3--5 seconds.33 A second source of fratricide is]{.underline}
harder to overcome. Destroying hard targets typically requires
low-altitude detonations (so-called ground bursts), which vaporize
material on the ground. When the [debris]{.underline} begins to cool,
6--8 seconds after the detonation, it solidifies and [forms a dust cloud
that envelops the target. Even small dust particles can be lethal to
incoming warheads]{.underline} speeding through the cloud to the target.
Particles in the debris cloud take approximately 20 minutes to settle
back to ground.34 For decades, these two sources of fratricide, acting
together, posed a major \[End Page 21\] problem for nuclear planners.35
Multiple warheads could be aimed at a single target if they were
separated by at least 3--5 seconds (to avoid interfering with each
other); yet, all inbound warheads had to arrive within 6--8 seconds of
the first (before the dust cloud formed). As a result, assigning more
than two weapons to each target would produce only marginal gains: if
the first one resulted in a miss, the target would likely be shielded
when the third or fourth warhead arrived.36 [[Improvements in
accuracy]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [have [greatly mitigated the
problem]{.mark} of fratricide]{.underline}. As figure 1 shows, [the
[proportion of misses---the main culprit]{.mark} of
fratricide---compared to hits [is fading]{.mark}.]{.underline} To be
clear, some weapons will still fail; that is, they will be prevented
from destroying their targets because of malfunctioning missile
boosters, faulty guidance systems, or defective warheads. [Those kinds
of [failures]{.mark}, however, [do not]{.mark} generally [cause
fratricide, because the warheads do not detonate]{.mark} near the
target. [**Only those that miss**---]{.mark}that is, those that travel
to the target area and detonate outside the LR---[will **create a dust
cloud**]{.mark}]{.underline} that shields the target from other incoming
weapons. In short, **[[leaps in accuracy are]{.mark} essentially
[reducing]{.mark} the set of three outcomes]{.underline}** (hit, fail,
or miss[) **to just two**: hit or fail. **The \"miss\" category, the key
cause of [fratricide]{.mark}, has virtually
disappeared.**]{.underline}37

Again, nuclear stability depends on fear of retaliation devastating
enough to overwhelm any justification for a first strike. Of interest
here is whether cyber warfare directed against an enemy's NC3 could
allay that fear by reducing the certainty or efficacy of retaliation.
The answer to that question depends on which of the big nuclear powers
one considers. [Because it has the most survivable retaliatory forces,
and because [neither Russia nor China has BMD or the equivalent of
global conventional strike]{.mark}, the United States has the least
reason to worry about the strength of its strategic
deterrent]{.underline}.

### \--2NC\-\--AT: A2AD

#### We'd beat A2AD

**Gompert et al. 16** -- David, former Principal Deputy Director of
National Intelligence and is a Senior Fellow for the RAND Corporation,

Garafola is a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation ("War with China:
Thinking Through the Unthinkable", RAND Corporation, 2016//Kosack

[While intensity depends on the use and loss of engaged U.S. strike and
Chinese A2AD capabilities]{.underline}, [the significance of total
military potential, including reinforcements and mobilization capacity,
could increase the longer the war's duration]{.underline}. Likewise,
[economic resilience, political support, and international assistance
could affect the ability of one or both sides to continue
fighting]{.underline}. [[Both the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}tates [and China have considerable]{.underline}]{.mark},
[if [asymmetric]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [capacity to prolong a
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} [that neither one is militarily compelled
or politically ready to end]{.underline}. A critical question is whether
one side or the other can achieve such a clear advantage in the early
stages of an intense conflict that the other has little choice but to
concede. [The U.S. ability to achieve such an advantage is declining as
China improves its A2AD capabilities]{.underline}. At the same time,
[China's increasing ability to prevent a decisive, early U.S. advantage
does not necessarily translate into its ability to conclude a war
quickly on its terms.]{.underline} Because [a mild conflict would place
smaller demands on total war-making capacity]{.underline} than a severe
one would, [it could have a greater potential than the latter to drag
on---even becoming a "frozen conflict."]{.underline} Conversely, and
obviously, [a long, severe conflict would involve greater costs on both
sides than other cases in military, economic, and political
terms]{.underline}. That [a long, severe conflict would be the most
costly does not mean it is the least likely]{.underline}. The
disposition at any moment to keep fighting depends not only on results,
losses, and costs to that point but also on expectations of what is to
come. As long as neither side expects to lose, hostilities might
continue. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[presently has more military capacity
than China]{.mark} to wage a long, severe war]{.underline}. For one
thing, the United States has substantial forces located in or designated
for other regions that it could bring to bear on a conflict in the
Western Pacific, though security conditions in those regions might make
it reluctant to do so.16 ([Over the years, the Pentagon has crept away
from its traditional standard of having sufficient total forces to win
two major wars simultaneously]{.underline}.) Furthermore, **[[U.S.
forces today could degrade Chinese A2AD capabilities faster than Chinese
A2AD capabilities could degrade U.S. forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
While both might suffer significant losses in early severe hostilities,
U.S. prospects currently look better than China's. [**Future conditions
could differ, owing to the potential for greater losses of U.S. forces
from Chinese A2AD** and]{.underline}, in turn, [reduced Chinese losses
from those U.S. forces]{.underline}. Moreover, as U.S.
military-operational advantages wane, China's position as the "home
team" could become less of a liability and more of an asset, owing to
internal lines of communication and movement. [A corollary of these
shifting military odds is that the expected duration of
war]{.underline}, however intense, [could increase as Chinese
capabilities improve, for the simple reason that China will retain more
warfighting capability and face less pressure to yield]{.underline}.
More generally stated, the less lopsided a war is likely to be, the less
likely it is to end quickly in victory by the stronger side. Since
Chinese and U.S. capabilities, operating concepts, incentives, and
expectations all point to severe hostilities, this could mean that a war
could last longer and be costlier than has been assumed or,
paradoxically, than either side would want.

### \--2NC\-\--AT: Uncertainty

#### Yes there is some uncertainty in data, but at best it's a difference in like 5 nukes\-\--that's negligible for nuclear winter math

#### In fact it's a neg argument because China has an incentive to overhype their capabilities for deterrent effect, whereas the US has every incentive to hide their knowledge and best capabilities

Center for International Security Studies, 11/8/17, "HARD CONSTRAINTS ON
CHINA'S NUCLEAR FORCES,"
https://warontherocks.com/2017/11/china-nuclear-weapons-breakout/

[China's nuclear forces and policies are **constrained**]{.underline},
first and foremost, [by the country's distinctive approach to nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. As Jeffrey Lewis has written, [Chinese leadership
has]{.underline} historically [believed]{.underline} that [nuclear
deterrence is]{.underline} largely [unaffected by the size and
configuration of the adversary's nuclear arsenal, so long as the country
can threaten a counterstrike of **a few --- or even one --- nuclear
warheads**]{.underline}. Marshall Nie Rongzhen, a leading figure in
China's early nuclear weapons program, called this "the minimum means of
reprisal." Recent research by Fiona Cunningham and M. Taylor Fravel,
based on reviews of Chinese doctrinal and academic writings and
interviews with Chinese military and civilian experts, indicates that
[these fundamental views have not changed]{.underline} and that
[[China]{.mark} is likely to [**continue adhering** to]{.mark} its
relatively restrained strategy of ["assured
retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}." In recent Track-1.5 and Track-2
dialogues between the United States and China, Chinese participants have
said that China could credibly threaten the United States with only "a
few," a "handful of," or even "one" nuclear warhead.

Designed to support more limited goals, China's nuclear forces are
generally believed to be smaller and less alerted than those of other
states. [The country **has [yet to develop]{.mark} an [early warning
system]{.mark}** and some [experts believe China would **wait**]{.mark}
**several [days]{.mark}** [after]{.mark} suffering [a nuclear strike
before launching its]{.mark} own nuclear
[counterattack]{.mark}]{.underline}. Observers believe [[Beijing does
not mate its nuclear warheads]{.mark} to missiles]{.underline} in
peacetime, instead storing them separately. According to the counting
rules of the New START treaty, China has [nearly [zero deployed nuclear
weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}
