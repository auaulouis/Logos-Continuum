#### Conditioning assistance rarely changes behavior

Wielding influence and securing tactical cooperation is the second. This
may translate into trading assistance for access to bases, airspace, or
other transit routes. [The United States sometimes uses assistance to
incentivize]{.underline} short-term tactical [cooperation]{.underline}
against shared threats. In other cases, assistance is intended to
reassure allies and partners of America's commitment to its security,
either in general or against common enemies. Here it is worth noting
that plans to slash the State Department's budget and cut foreign
assistance compound concerns about U.S. abandonment and further reduce
American influence. [Finally, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has
[tried]{.mark}, often without [success, to use assistance as a]{.mark}
[lever to shape a recipient's behavior]{.mark} either domestically or
internationally]{.underline}. Some U.S. objectives overlap with one
another. Others conflict. And [lest we forget, [our partners also get a
vote]{.mark}. American [objectives]{.mark} for security assistance
[often do not align with theirs]{.mark}, due in large part to
differences in how the United States and a recipient prioritize and
perceive threats. The number of different objectives at play complicates
efforts to condition assistance; [enforcing conditions]{.mark} to
achieve one set of objectives could [hamper efforts to achieve another
set]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, after the Bahraini government's
security forces launched a major crackdown on protesters]{.underline}
during the Arab uprisings, the [United States temporarily restricted
arms sales to the country. Some members of the Obama administration also
argued for placing conditions on security assistance. Others worried
that this would undermine Bahrain's support for U.S. basing and
access]{.underline}, which is important for Afghanistan, Iran
deterrence, and counterterrorism operations. As a result of competing
priorities, the United States often chooses not to condition assistance,
as was the case with Bahrain, or attempts to do so in an ad hoc manner.
Worst of all, the United States sometimes imposes conditions, but then
blinks first and backs down when they are not met.

#### Countries will not allow intrusive monitoring

[[Positive conditionality]{.mark} [requires]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to verify]{.mark} the [efforts]{.mark} undertaken by
the partner government, which in turn [necessitates]{.mark} more
[intrusive]{.mark} [monitoring]{.mark}. [Many countries will balk at
this as a]{.mark} [violation of
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but the United States should
insist upon it as a condition of military assistance. A larger presence
will not only enable better monitoring of the host government's
coup-proofing actions, but may also mitigate the internal security
dilemma that drives such behavior. The worst paranoid excesses of the
Maliki regime did not occur until after 2011, when the United States was
no longer present on the ground as a safety net protecting his regime.

#### Positive conditionality fails because recipients pretend success

[[Negative conditionality is]{.mark} generally criticized to be
[ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline} because sanctions imposed as a result
of conditionality might hit the poor instead of the targeted
government25 and the recipient country's government might easily find
access to alternative funding resources. [In contrast, the application
of positive conditionality is much less contested in the critical
discussion]{.underline}. The EU's enlargement strategy is generally used
as a clear example of the effectiveness of positive conditionality to
boost the democratic space in the Eastern European countries. In fact,
the desirability of EU membership appears to have prompted candidate
countries to adhere to a host of conditions contained in the so-called
Acquis Communautaire. [Yet, there are still problems with]{.underline}
the way EU uses [positive [conditionality]{.mark}: it [does not]{.mark}
always [deliver]{.mark} the [incentives]{.mark} promised]{.underline}
(extra aid, for example), [or at least it does not deliver them quickly.
[Governments]{.mark} may even [pretend progress without actually

[[Enforcement of human rights initiatives]{.mark} will often **[damage

guilty units or nations. [The issue is [compounded when]{.mark} the [US
does not hold states **equally accountable**]{.mark} to the US code on
foreign aid and policy standards]{.underline}. Until recently, many US
embassies did not share vetting results with partner nations, despite
legal requirements to share the data with the host nation to avoid
damaging relationships.2 As of 2017, the DOS publishes an annual list of
suspended units on its website.3 [This year, an advisor to the Supreme
Court of Bangladesh disclosed that the country is debating whether it
should follow procedures established by the Leahy Laws]{.underline} that
would remediate Bangladeshi units sanctioned from receiving aid, noting
that Bangladesh would then go to the PRC for support. [The advisor
identified **[inconsistencies]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} how the US
administered its [human rights policies]{.mark} to close allies such as
**Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others**]{.underline}.4 The [US must stand
up for human rights abroad but must **evenly enforce** a policy that
does not damage relations, ultimately [prevent]{.mark}ing the [US from
influencing partners]{.mark} to adhere to human rights
concepts]{.underline}.

3.4 At What Cost? The Salience of Donor-Recipient Relations

Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2009) assert that [[leaders use foreign aid
to buy policy concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further, they argue that
the [salience of these policy concessions is one key determinant of
whether a donor provides aid to a potential recipient and, if aid is
provided, how much aid is allocated]{.underline}. I argue that [donors
[consider]{.mark} the [salience]{.mark} of these concessions [when
deciding whether to punish human rights]{.mark} violators. If a donor
decides to punish a potential recipient by withholding or reducing aid,
the [opportunity cost]{.mark} of such action [is losing]{.mark} the
policy [concession]{.mark}]{.underline}. I expect, therefore, that as
the value of the concessions increases, the probability that a donor
decides to punish a violator decreases. 27 I conceptualize the salience
of policy concessions using two dimensions: security and economic ties.
3.4.1 Security Ties Many scholars place national security at the top of
any list of foreign policy goals (c.f. Morgenthau 1951; Waltz 1979;
Kennan 1985). [It would be **[too]{.mark} [idealistic to assume]{.mark}
that [human rights concerns can trump national security]{.mark}
concerns** in making foreign policy. In fact, [punishing]{.mark} [human
rights violators may be **counterproductive**]{.mark} to security goals.
For example, **[violators]{.mark} may [respond]{.mark} to being punished
[by retaliating]{.mark}** in such a way that hurts the donor's national
security interests]{.underline}. [For example, a recipient may
[restrict]{.mark} donor [access to military bases or air]{.mark}
[space]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a 1979 lecture on foreign policy and
human rights, Morgenthau states: We have a great interest in continuing
the normalization of our relations with mainland China, and for this
reason we are not going to hurt her feelings. On the other hand South
Korea is an ally of the United States, it is attributed a considerable
military importance, and so we are not going to do anything to harm
those relations. (Morgenthau 1979: 7). Another example of the strategic
importance of foreign aid lies in Cold War foreign policy. In
particular, western donors were concerned that cutting foreign aid could
precipitate a fall to communism. [For example, the United States used
its foreign aid program during the Cold War to prop rightist regimes in
the western hemisphere to contain communism]{.underline} (c.f. Carleton
& Stohl 1986; Apodaca & Stohl 1999; Regan 1995). [In addition, foreign
aid often directly or indirectly supported repressive regimes over
leftist opposition]{.underline} (Regan 1995). [In these cases, [cutting
aid would have clear negative implications]{.mark} for the donor's
strategic interests]{.underline}. Morgenthau's concern -- and he is not
alone (c.f. Gillies 1996) -- is that **[criticizing or punishing a human
rights violator would]{.underline} [[very likely harm
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with that country and, in turn, the
soured relationships could **[hurt]{.mark} the [strategic]{.mark} or
material [interests of]{.mark} the [donor]{.mark}**. When donors use
foreign aid to punish human rights violators, that foreign [aid cannot
be used to buy]{.mark} important policy [concessions]{.mark}. This
represents the opportunity cost for using foreign aid as a punishment
tool. If a donor has an interest in buying a policy concession from a
recipient, then it is unlikely to manipulate its aid policy to punish
human rights violations when, instead, it needs to provide aid to buy
the policy concession. One way to conceptualize the strategic importance
of potential donors is security alignment. **Donors are [more inclined
to buy]{.mark} policy concessions [from states with which they
are]{.mark} closely [aligned]{.mark}** than enemies]{.underline}. Bueno
de Mesquita and Smith (2009) find that ["recipients who are moderately
aligned with the donor receive the most aid"]{.underline} (331). [If
security alignment signifies the presence of important policy
concessions, then it follows that close allies are unlikely to be
punished for human rights violations because these countries can offer
the donor valuable policy concessions]{.underline}. For example, until
the mid1970s, the United States consistently turned a blind eye to
rights violations by South American dictators with whom the U.S. was
allied. Hypothesis 1: Donors are less likely to punish recipients as the
strategic alignment between them increase, all else equal.

Admittedly, [[pursuing]{.mark} a [tougher course of action on
values]{.mark} and principles [comes with risks]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Even [measured steps could create serious rifts among allies,]{.mark}
with the potential of paralyzing the alliance]{.underline}. Because NATO
operates by consensus, [any [punitive action]{.mark} on an ally [could
provoke retaliatory action]{.mark} [on]{.mark} other [NATO]{.mark}
business]{.underline}. In reaction to Norway's stark criticisms against
the Portuguese and Greek regimes at a June 1971 foreign ministers
meeting, then-NATO Secretary General Manlio Brosio warned that "[if we
undermine our solidarity, we run the risk of undermining the substance
of our alliance]{.underline}." Overcoming this dilemma between
prioritizing values and preserving unity requires a graduated,
collective, and dispassionate approach. First, NATO will need to be
proportionate when dealing with an ally violating trans-Atlantic values.
[Allies should start with discussions behind closed doors]{.underline}
rather than publicize the dispute. Open and frank dialogue among allies
should always be the first step before adopting restrictive measures.
[[If NATO moves to]{.mark}o]{.underline} quickly or
[[aggressively]{.mark}, it [risks being counterproductive]{.mark} by
widening divisions in the alliance]{.underline}. At the end of the day,
this progressive approach should have a deterrent effect on NATO
countries, especially on those that value their membership in the
alliance and do not want to be singled out as "bad allies."

and can no longer be used]{.underline}. Indeed, [in the context of
[democratizing a country]{.mark}, [several factors might infuence the
outcome other than]{.mark} just the [willingness]{.mark} of the
government. These include the [presence]{.mark} or absence [of a strong
opposition]{.mark} and civil society, the degree of [development]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [country]{.mark}, the [socio-economic situation]{.mark}
in the country, and the country's history]{.underline}.80 [The
[complexity]{.mark} [of]{.mark} these [intervening factors]{.mark}
clearly [indicates]{.mark} that a countrybased [democracy promotion's
approach appears a must in order]{.mark} to enhance the effectiveness of
political aid as an instrument of democracy promotion]{.underline} in
SSA. A great step has been made in this sense by the EU in the revised
CPA (in 2010), where more attention is given to flexibility and to the
individual circumstances of each ACP country.

Hard Is Not Impossible

[These failings notwithstanding, there exists no shortage of arguments
in favor of the status quo and against shifting America's focus in
security assistance to security-sector reform and conditional
[a]{.mark}id. [In]{.mark} an **[era of great-power competition]{.mark},
[Russia]{.mark}, [China]{.mark}, or regional [competitors]{.mark} may
simply step in to [fill the gap]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the [partner
nation if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [insists upon
unwelcome reforms]{.mark} in exchange for aid.]{.underline} I know [this
is a valid concern]{.underline} because I have sat in meetings where
**[[partners]{.mark} [made]{.mark} thinly veiled [reference]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} other [nations which may provide assistance if]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} unable or
[unwilling]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Still, the quality and
[technological edge of **U.S**]{.mark}**.** kit and the total-package
approach which includes **training and follow-on [support]{.mark} do
[provide the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a competitive
advantage]{.mark}**. But the bureaucratic apparatus responsible for
delivering aid is far too slow and, as a result, is a liability. To
outcompete, the **security assistance enterprise itself requires major
reform to shorten typical lead times** from years to months. The
Pentagon and State Department need the agility to turn aid on and off
like a switch or rheostat.]{.underline}

[Another argument against placing preconditions on security assistance
is that the **[stakes are too high to deny]{.mark} a partner a [critical
capability]{.mark}** [while waiting for reform]{.mark} to happen. This
is the "[we can't let them]{.mark} [fail]{.mark}" mentality. It is also
valid]{.underline} --- but only in certain crisis situations where aid
is needed immediately, and reform truly cannot wait. Ukraine today is a
good example. [[Rather than ceasing aid writ large]{.mark} until a
condition is met, **[place]{.mark} [conditions on]{.mark}** discrete
**packages of [aid]{.mark}**. The **[intent should]{.mark} be [to
provide sufficient]{.mark} [incentive]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
host-[nation]{.mark} government [to modify
behavior]{.mark}**,]{.underline} not threaten national
survival[.]{.underline} During the years I spent in Afghanistan, the
security threats faced by the government never appeared to afford the
breathing space to withhold aid while institutional reform took place.
In hindsight, doing so may have required coalition forces to carry a
greater operational burden while the Afghan forces sorted themselves
out, but it also would have been worth it. As the events of August 2021
demonstrated, 20 years of unconditional capacity-building built
shockingly little capacity. Implementing this change requires a
recurring review of Defense Department-led train and equip programs to
determine which truly qualify as crisis situations. Those which do not
should be moved under State Department control for more deliberate,
reform-focused approach.

There is also the simple argument that [**instituting [meaningful
reform]{.mark} in a recalcitrant partner nation [is
hard]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} This is true.]{.underline} But hard is not
impossible. The security assistance enterprise should approach reform
not in broad, sweeping terms but incremental steps. Rather than
requiring the partner to eliminate corruption wholesale across the
security forces, perhaps require that a particularly corrupt commander
be removed before providing assistance to that unit. In the case of Iraq
in the late 2000s, the United States might have required Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to fire certain commanders guilty of sectarian excesses
or modify the personnel policy to make the armed forces more broadly
inclusive. In other cases, reform measures may be as mundane as
switching to an electronic pay system to reduce the opportunity for
graft. Such a change in approach would also require a change in how the
United States prepares officers for security assistance duties. The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency has made great strides in its
educational program to professionalize the security assistance workforce
in recent years. It could further improve this program by embedding
security sector reform more deeply into the curriculum.

Better Rewards, Tougher Inducements

[The United States is **not getting the most for its security assistance
dollars**. [Programs]{.mark} intended to build partner capacity tend to
underperform because **they [fail to address underlying weakness in
defense]{.mark} [institutions]{.mark}** or take principal-agent problems
into account. To build meaningful, long-lasting capacity in partners and
better align security assistance with policy goals, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [should shift]{.mark} from a "building partner capacity"
**approach [to a reform focus using conditional aid as
leverage]{.mark}**. Doing so in an environment where security assistance
is yet [another **arena for strategic competition**]{.mark} [with
Russia]{.mark}, [China]{.mark}, and others will require internal reform
of the U.S. security assistance apparatus. Rather than a slow-moving
bureaucracy, the United States needs an agile and streamlined security
assistance enterprise [able to deliver aid rapidly when needed]{.mark}
and be [paused or turned off]{.mark} just [as]{.mark} easily when
[conditions require]{.mark}. In short, the **United States needs sweeter
carrots and harder sticks**.]{.underline}

While the current U.S. effort to arm and equip Ukrainian forces is the
most visible example today, it is not representative of the day-to-day
work of security assistance which the United States carries out around
the world. In most cases, the greater threat facing these partners is
not an invading army but rather defense institutions for which reform is
needed but not properly incentivized. **[[Modifying]{.mark} the [U.S.
approach]{.mark} to security assistance [is one way to create that
incentive]{.mark} and [better align aid with policy
goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Putin's True Fear]{.underline}

[The **more [serious]{.mark} [cause of tensions has been]{.mark} a
[series of democratic breakthroughs]{.mark}**]{.underline} and popular
protests for freedom throughout the 2000s, what many refer to as the
"Color Revolutions." [Putin [believes]{.mark} that [Russian]{.mark}
national [interests]{.mark} have been [threatened]{.mark} by what he
portrays as U.S.-supported coups.]{.underline} After each of
them---Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring
in 2011, Russia in 2011--12, and Ukraine in 2013--14---[Putin has
[pivoted to more hostile policies]{.mark} toward the United States, and
then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.]{.underline}

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first
round of expansion in 1997 because he believed his close ties to
President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing
over this comparatively smaller matter. Through Partnership for Peace
and especially the NATO-Russia Founding Act, Clinton and his team made a
considerable effort to keep US-Russian relations positive while at the
same time managing NATO expansion. The 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia to
stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo severely tested that strategy but
survived in part because Clinton gave Yeltsin and Russia a role in the
negotiated solution. When the first post-communist color revolution
overthrew Slobodan Milosevic a year later, Russia's new president,
Putin, deplored the act but did not overreact. At that time, he still
entertained the possibility of cooperation with the West, including
NATO.

However, the next round of [[democratic expansion in]{.mark} the
[post-Soviet world]{.mark}]{.underline}, the 2003 Rose Revolution in
Georgia, [[escalated]{.mark} U.S.-Russian [tensions]{.mark}
significantly. Putin [blamed]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
directly [for assisting]{.mark} in this [democratic]{.mark}
[breakthrough]{.mark}]{.underline} and helping to install what he saw as
a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Immediately after
the Rose Revolution, Putin sought to undermine Georgian democracy,
ultimately invading in 2008 and recognizing two Georgian
regions---Abkhazia and South Ossetia---as independent states.
U.S.-Russian relations reached a new low point in 2008.

A year after the Rose Revolution, the [most consequential democratic
expansion in the post-Soviet world erupted in Ukraine]{.underline} in
2004, the [Orange
Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Orange-Ukraines-Democratic-Breakthrough/dp/0870032216).
In the years prior to that momentous event, Ukraine's foreign-policy
orientation under President Leonid Kuchma was [relatively balanced
between east and
west](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ponars-policy-memo-291-paradoxes-kuchmas-russian-policy),
but with gradually improving ties between Kyiv and Moscow. That changed
when a [falsified presidential
election](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/McFaul-16-3.pdf) in
late 2004 brought hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians into the streets,
eventually sweeping away Kuchma's---and Putin's---handpicked successor,
Viktor Yanukovych. Instead, the prodemocratic and pro-western Orange
Coalition led by President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yuliya
Tymoshenko took power.

Compared to Serbia in 2000 or Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in
Ukraine in 2004 was a much larger threat to Putin. First, the Orange
Revolution occurred suddenly and in a much bigger and more strategic
country on Russia's border. The abrupt pivot to the West by Yushchenko
and his allies left Putin facing the prospect that he had "lost" a
country on which he placed tremendous symbolic and strategic importance.

To Putin, the Orange Revolution [**[undermined]{.mark} a core [objective
of his [grand
strategy](https://www.csis.org/blogs/post-soviet-post/four-myths-about-russian-grand-strategy)]{.mark}**:
to [establish]{.mark} a privileged and [exclusive sphere of
influence]{.mark} across the territory that once comprised the Soviet
Union. Putin believes in spheres of influence; that as a great power,
Russia has a right to veto the sovereign political decisions of its
neighbors. Putin also demands exclusivity in his neighborhood: [Russia
can be the only great power]{.mark} to exercise such privilege (or even
develop close ties) with these countries]{.underline}. This position has
hardened significantly since Putin's conciliatory position of 2002 as
Russia's influence in Ukraine has waned and Ukraine's citizens have
repeatedly signaled their desire to escape from Moscow's grasp.
Subservience was now required. As Putin explained in a [recent
historical article](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181),
in his view Ukrainians and Russians "were one people" whom he is seeking
to reunite, even if through coercion. For Putin, therefore, the loss of
Ukraine in 2004 to the West marked a major negative turning point in
U.S.-Russian relations that was far more salient than the second wave of
NATO expansion that was completed the same year.

Second, those Ukrainians who rose up in defense of their freedom were,
in Putin's own assessment, Slavic brethren with close historical,
religious, and cultural ties to Russia. If it could happen in Kyiv, [why
not in Moscow](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480974)? Several years
later, it almost did happen in Russia when [a series of mass
protests](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480973) erupted in Moscow, St.
Petersburg, and other cities in the wake of fraudulent parliamentary
elections in December 2011. They were the largest protests in Russia
since 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. For the first time in
his decade-plus in power, ordinary Russians showed themselves to have
both the will and the capability to threaten Putin's grip on power. That
popular uprising in Russia, occurring the same year as the Arab Spring,
and then followed with Putin's return to the Kremlin as president for a
third term in 2012, marked another major negative turn in U.S.-Russian
relations, ending
the [reset](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-Hot-Peace-Ambassador/dp/0544716248) launched
by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in 2009. **[[Democratic]{.mark}
[mobilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, first the Middle East and then
Russia---[not NATO expansion---**[ended]{.mark} this last chapter of
[U.S.-Russian cooperation]{.mark}**. There have been [no]{.mark} new
chapters of [cooperation since]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[But U.S.-Russian [relations]{.mark} [deteriorated]{.mark} ever
[further]{.mark} in 2014, again [because of]{.mark} new [democratic
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}. The next democratic mobilization to
threaten Putin happened a second time in Ukraine in 2013--14. After the
Orange Revolution in 2004, Putin did not invade Ukraine, but wielded
other instruments of influence to help his protégé, Viktor
Yanukovych, [narrowly win the Ukrainian
presidency](https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/understanding-ukraines-presidential-shift/) six
years later. Yanukovych, however, turned out not to be a loyal Kremlin
servant, but tried to cultivate ties with both Russia and the West.
Putin finally compelled Yanukovych to make a choice, and the Ukrainian
president chose Russia in the fall of 2013 when he reneged on
signing [an EU association
agreement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-under-pressure-from-russia-puts-brakes-on-eu-deal/2013/11/21/46c50796-52c9-11e3-9ee6-2580086d8254_story.html) in
favor of membership in Russia's Eurasian Economic Union.

To the surprise of everyone in Moscow, Kyiv, Brussels, and Washington,
Yanukovych's decision to scuttle this agreement with the EU triggered
mass demonstrations in Ukraine again, bringing [hundreds of
thousands](https://euromaidanpress.com/2016/02/20/the-story-of-ukraine-starting-from-euromaidan/2/) of
Ukrainians into the streets in what would become known as
the [Euromaidan](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-modern-ukraine-was-made-on-maidan/) or
"Revolution of Dignity" to protest Yanukovych's turn away from the
democratic West. The street protests lasted several weeks, punctuated by
the killing of dozens of peaceful protestors by Yanukovych's government,
the eventual collapse of that government and Yanukovych's flight to
Russia in February 2014, and a new [pro-Western
government](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/world/europe/ukraine.html) taking
power in Kyiv. Putin had "lost" Ukraine for the second time in a decade.

This time, [**[Putin]{.mark} [struck back with military]{.mark}
[force]{.mark}** to punish the alleged American-backed]{.underline},
neo-Nazi [usurpers]{.underline} in Kyiv. Russian armed forces seized
Crimea; Moscow later annexed the Ukrainian peninsula. Putin also
provided money, equipment, and soldiers to back separatists in eastern
Ukraine, fueling a simmering war in Donbas for eight years, in
which [approximately 14,000 people have been
killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/russia-ukraine-conflict-photos-2014/).
After invading, not before, Putin amped up his criticisms of NATO
expansion as justification for his belligerent actions.

In response to this second Ukrainian democratic revolution, [Putin
concluded that cooption through elections and other nonmilitary means
had to be augmented with greater coercive pressure, including military
intervention]{.underline}. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has
waged [an unprecedented
war](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Putin_s_War_Against_Ukraine/frfXAQAACAAJ?hl=en) against
Ukraine using a full spectrum of military, political, informational,
social, and economic weapons in an attempt to [destabilize and
eventually topple Ukraine's democratically elected
government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/06/heres-why-putin-wants-to-topple-ukraines-government-not-to-engineer-a-frozen-conflict/).
Ukraine's relationship with NATO and the United States is just a symptom
of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign,
democratic Ukraine.

Putin's Real Casus Belli: Ukrainian Democracy

Amazingly, eight years of unrelenting Russian pressure did not break
Ukraine's democracy. Just the opposite. After Putin's annexation and
ongoing support for the war in Donbas, Ukrainians are now more united
across ethnic, linguistic, and regional divides than at any other point
in Ukrainian history. In 2019, President Volodymyr Zelensky won in a
landslide, winning popular support in every region of Ukraine. Not
surprisingly, Putin's war also has fueled greater popular support among
Ukrainians for joining NATO.

So now, [[Putin]{.mark} has [decided on a new strategy for
ending]{.mark}]{.underline} Ukrainian [[democracy]{.mark}:
**[massive]{.mark} [military]{.mark} [intervention]{.mark}**. **Putin**
**claims that his purpose is to stop NATO expansion. But that's a
fiction**]{.underline}. Nothing in the past year in Ukraine-NATO
relations has changed. It is true Ukraine aspires to join NATO someday.
(The goal is even embedded in the Ukrainian constitution.) But while
NATO leaders have remained committed to the principle of an open-door
policy, they have also clearly stated that Ukraine today is not
qualified to join. Putin's casus belli is his own invention.

[Putin has fabricated this crisis about NATO expansion to
undermine]{.underline} Ukrainian [democracy]{.underline} even more
directly. Already, the Russian military mobilization on Ukraine's
borders has triggered [significant damage to the Ukrainian
economy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putin-has-seriously-wounded-ukraines-economy-without-firing-a-single-shot/) and
fueled new divisions among Ukraine's political parties over how Zelensky
has handled the crisis. Some argue that Zelensky should have created a
new grand coalition or unity government; others lament his alleged
inadequate preparations for war. And some contend that Zelensky showed
his diplomatic inexperience by arguing with U.S. president Joe Biden
about the probability of a Russian invasion at a time when unity with
the West is most needed. In other words, Putin's military mobilization
already achieved some early successes in his war against Ukrainian
democracy.

Paradoxically, Putin's use of force may have strengthened Ukrainian
democracy in the short term. His [decision to invade
Ukraine](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67836) by sending
Russian forces into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions (still recognized as
sovereign Ukrainian territory under international law) has united
Ukrainians and strengthened Zelensky's popularity and image as a leader
of the nation. But the long-term survival of Ukraine's democracy hangs
in the balance, and Putin's [bellicose
rhetoric](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/67828) suggests
that Moscow's assault is just beginning. A blitzkrieg invasion and rapid
encirclement of Kyiv could result in Zelensky's forcible removal from
power. New elections held at gunpoint could deliver the desired
government, just as they did in [post--World War II Eastern
Europe](https://ipn.gov.pl/en/digital-resources/articles/7193,Rigged-elections-19-January-1947.html) in
the shadow of Soviet tanks. It is too early to predict the outcome. But
Putin's objective is clear.

[**[Putin may dislike NATO]{.mark} expansion, [but]{.mark} [he is not
genuinely frightened by it]{.mark}.** [Russia]{.mark} [has]{.mark} the
[largest army in Europe]{.mark}, now much more capable after two decades
of lavish spending. [NATO is]{.mark} a [defensive]{.mark}
alliance]{.underline}. It has never attacked the Soviet Union or Russia,
and it never will. Putin knows that. [[But Putin is threatened
by]{.mark} a successful [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine. He
cannot tolerate a successful, flourishing, and democratic Ukraine on his
borders, especially if the Ukrainian people also begin to prosper
economically. [That undermines the Kremlin's own regime stability and
proposed rationale for autocratic state leadership]{.underline}. Just as
Putin cannot allow the will of the Russian people to guide Russia's
future, he cannot allow the people of Ukraine, who have a shared culture
and history, to choose the prosperous, independent, and free future that
they have voted for and fought for.

Though the chance of deescalation is remote, further negotiations and
the [threat of
sanctions](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/sanctioning-russia-over-ukraine-no-silver-bullet-200031) could
still---in theory---prevent a Russian invasion beyond Ukraine's Donbas
region in the coming days or weeks. But regardless of where Putin
finally orders his troops to halt---be it Luhansk and Donetsk or
Kharkiv, Odessa, Kyiv, or Lviv---the Kremlin will remain committed to
undermining Ukrainian (and Georgian, Moldovan, Armenian, etc.) democracy
and sovereignty for as long as Putin remains in power and maybe longer
if Russian autocracy continues. Tragically, George Kennan's warning in
his 1947 Foreign Affairs article on "The Sources of Soviet Conduct"
still holds true today:

"\[The\] Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its
purposes in a hurry ... Here caution, circumspection, flexibility and
deception are the valuable qualities ... And being under the compulsion
of no timetable, it does not get panicky under the necessity for such
retreat. Its political action is a fluid stream which moves constantly,
wherever it is permitted to move, toward a given goal."

[There [should be no illusions about]{.mark} Putin's long-term strategic
[goal of stopping democratic]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
Ukraine and the rest of the region.

#### Putin lashes out to [boost self-preservation]{.underline} -- he fears democratic expansion, not NATO

**Tafuri 22** -- David Tafuri, international lawyer at Arent Fox,
opinion contributor to The Hill, served as the US Department of State's
Rule of Law Coordinator for Iraq at the US Embassy in Baghdad and an
outside foreign policy advisor to President Barack Obama ("**[[Putin

FGY

As the world waits to learn
if [Putin ](https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin/)will order a
full-scale military offensive in Ukraine, Washington seems to be
stumbling over a simple question: [How much does Russian aggression in
Europe matter to U.S. interests?]{.underline}
One [view](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/584619-why-the-us-shouldnt-try-to-deter-a-russian-invasion-of-ukraine) is
that Ukraine's status is more important to Russia than to us, especially
because Ukraine is not a part of NATO. Others go further, questioning
whether even NATO members, guaranteed protection by [Article
5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm), are
worth defending. 

Media
have [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/27/tucker-carlson-support-putin-republicans/) Tucker
Carlson's growing influence in Republican circles on this question. Two
years ago, he previewed his stance when
I [debated](https://video.foxnews.com/v/5989829150001#sp=show-clips) him
on his show. He argued that NATO members Estonia and Latvia, are, like
Ukraine, not worth defending if invaded by Russia. I countered, as I
explain in more detail here, that it's in America's vital interest to
support these sovereign nations --- precisely because Putin is targeting
them for their decision to turn away from the governance model on offer
from Russia.

To understand why Putin's threat to invade Ukraine --- or any other
independent state in Europe --- matters, consider why he might do
it. Putin wants you to believe it's because NATO expansion to Ukraine
threatens the Russian people and Russia's security. He doesn't genuinely
believe this. It's propaganda.

NATO is a defensive alliance. No member of NATO, since the fall of the
Berlin Wall, has conveyed a credible threat to peoples or places inside
Russia's current borders. In fact, NATO sought a
constructive [relationship](https://carnegiemoscow.org/2021/10/20/why-russia-officially-broke-with-nato-pub-85611) with
Russia after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R., until Putin steered the
country onto its present course. Putin is a careful study and knows that
NATO isn't interested in gobbling up Russian territory or subjugating
Russian people. Similarly, a sovereign and independent Ukraine presents
no actual threat to Russian lands.

[Putin fears an independent Ukraine with strong ties to the
West]{.underline} for the same reason he [sent
troops](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-sends-troops-into-kazakhstan-as-protests-turn-deadly/) to
Kazakhstan last month to put down peaceful protests, [poisoned and
imprisoned](https://time.com/6140102/alexei-navalny-russia-profile/) Alexei
Navalny, his political opponent in Russia, and [directed Russian spy
services](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/senate-committee-unanimously-endorses-spy-agencies-finding-that-russia-interfered-in-2016-presidential-race-in-bid-to-help-trump/2020/04/21/975ca51a-83d2-11ea-ae26-989cfce1c7c7_story.html) to
interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. [There's [one]{.mark}
[**common thread** running through]{.mark} each of these endeavors ---
and nearly [every]{.mark} other foreign policy [initiative]{.mark} now
[championed by Putin]{.mark}: [He **wants to undermine
democracy**]{.mark}, wherever it is, or can take root, [especially in
countries on Russia's border]{.mark} that [he's worried he can't
control.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Why does he fear democracy so much?]{.underline} Sure, Putin is a Cold
War enthusiast, but his main priority is not to restore the eminence of
old U.S.S.R. in Eastern Europe. [It's [to]{.mark} **[boost]{.mark} his
own prospect for [self-preservatio]{.mark}**[n]{.mark}. To Putin, this
means [[consolidating](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-putin-controls-russia) all
political powers]{.mark} in Russia inside his office and carefully
**[guarding]{.mark} [against]{.mark} the [appeal of democratic
challengers to]{.mark} his "[forever
presidency]{.mark}."**]{.underline} Last year,
Putin [amended](https://www.theweek.co.uk/106126/putin-s-plan-to-rule-for-longer-than-stalin) the
Russian constitution so he can remain President until at least 2036.
This will make him Kremlin's [longest
serving](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/putin-signs-law-that-could-make-him-russias-longest-serving-ruler-since-stalin) leader
since Peter the Great, even longer than Stalin.

[NATO has never posed a real threat to Putin's supremacy inside
Russia. But a **[well-functioning democracy on Russia's border]{.mark},
which could [inspire]{.mark} new [democratic movements within
Russia]{.mark}**, would. And this **[threat could be especially
dangerous for Putin]{.mark}** if it re-focused Russians inward, at their
own
lamentable [economy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/04/23/the-kremlin-has-isolated-russias-economy),
instead of on Putin's outward bluster that NATO is the [greatest]{.mark}
[threat]{.mark} to their well-being]{.underline}.

[Because the true source of Putin's ire is the adoption of more
democratic institutions by sovereign states in Russia's neighborhood,
**Putin is actually challenging not a particular nation or alliance, but
the spread of democracy and rule of law.**]{.underline}

[When the sovereignty of nations striving for more stable democracies is
threatened, U.S. commitment to democracy in general is at
stake.]{.underline}

[The U.S. cheered Ukraine during three defining events in its
democracy]{.underline}: first, when it held a referendum in 1991 and [90
percent](https://www.ft.com/content/0cbbd590-8e48-4687-a302-e74b6f0c905d) of
its population voted in favor of independence; second, during [the
"Orange
Revolution"](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/how-ukraines-orange-revolution-shaped-twenty-first-century-geopolitics/) in
the winter of 2004, when people took to the streets of Kyiv to protest
an election clearly rigged to benefit the Kremlin-backed candidate (the
pro-Western candidate [survived an attempted assassination by
poison](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-43611547)), and third,
when a groundswell of democratic protests in
2013 [forced](https://www.vox.com/2022/1/30/22908600/ukraine-crisis-putin-russia-one-people-myth-nato-europe) former
President Viktor Yanukovych from power after his decision to back out of
a popular trade agreement with the EU in fealty to Moscow. [All three
were clear rejections of Russia, in favor of democracy.]{.underline}

[What Russia is posing to do now, after 30 years of Ukrainian
independence, is a clear violation of international law. The lack of a
response could **[usher]{.mark} the [collapse]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a
[rules-based order]{.mark}** which the U.S. has nurtured]{.underline}
since the end of WWII. The U.N. is already absent on the issue of
Ukraine's sovereignty because of
Russia's [veto](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/why-united-nations-can-t-solve-ukraine-crisis-n1288480).

In 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait without any legal basis for doing so,
the
U.S. [organized](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/gulf-war) a
coalition and mobilized in Kuwait's defense, with
U.N. [authorization](http://unscr.com/en/resolutions/678). This sent a
message to aggressors around the world that if they invade their
neighbors, they could be destroyed.

If Putin successfully invades Ukraine without serious consequences, it
would send the opposite message --- and might lead Putin to believe he
can do it again, including to one of those NATO democracies in Eastern
Europe that [Tucker
Carlson ](https://thehill.com/people/tucker-carlson/)believes aren't
worth defending.

It would also signal to other nationalist regimes with extraterritorial
aspirations --- including China, Iran, and Turkey --- that they too
could orchestrate cross-border offensives to stamp out democratic
tendencies in their region without repercussion.

#### Putin is [uniquely emboldened]{.underline} by democratization 

**West 22** -- John West, adjunct professor at Tokyo's Sophia
University, executive director of the Asian Century Institute ("Saving
democracy from Russian rage", *The Interpreter*, 3/14/2022,
<https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/saving-democracy-russian-rage>)
FGY

Much is being written about Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, and much
more will surely be said in the months and years ahead of this
potentially epoch-defining event. But some of the most insightful and
almost prescient analyses were made well before the conflict, such as in
Larry Diamond's excellent 2020 book, [Ill winds: Saving democracy from
Russian rage, Chinese ambition, and American
complacency](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/588987/ill-winds-by-larry-diamond/).

Diamond, a professor at Stanford University, documents the political
transformation of the world through the ["[third wave of
democratisation]{.mark}", beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by
a big bang after the fall of the Berlin wall, with the democratisation
of central and eastern Europe. But then [began]{.mark} a [global]{.mark}
[democratic recession]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Badly governed, poorly performing democracies are indeed accidents
waiting to happen. It may be difficult to remember but there were hopes
back in the 1990s that a nascent Russian democracy might mature under
the leadership of Boris Yeltsin. But the country's politics were then
hijacked by Vladimir Putin. Putin led a backslide to authoritarianism.

Diamond begins the chapter "Russia's global assault" by recalling the
famous "Long Telegram" written in 1946 by George F. Kennan, the number
two official at the US Embassy in Moscow. Kennan wrote of the "Kremlin's
neurotic view of world affairs" and "a traditional and instinctive
Russian sense of insecurity" and "a fear of more competent, more
powerful, more highly organised" Western societies. The Soviet Union's
leaders knew that their "fragile and artificial" regime was "unable to
stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western
countries". Kennan predicted a [[relentless]{.mark} [Soviet campaign to
"disrupt]{.mark} national self-[confidence]{.mark}" [in]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Europe]{.mark} and "to
[stimulate]{.mark} all forms of [disunity]{.mark}" [within Western
democracies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Diamond argues that [[Putin's view of Russia]{.mark} and the world is
[strikingly]{.mark} [similar]{.mark} [to]{.mark} that of the [Soviet
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} whom Kennan described in the Long Telegram.
[Putin [believes]{.mark} that the **[West is seeking to encircle
Russia]{.mark} and [keep it weak]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Despite his
unrivalled power, Putin is deeply insecure about the legitimacy of his
rule. And he **[panics]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [sight of popular
demonstrations]{.mark}, which he [blames]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [Western
plots]{.mark} to unseat him**.]{.underline}

[So **Putin has [responded by vast military interventions]{.mark},
[cyber]{.mark}-[hacking]{.mark}, and other interference and influence
operations** [against]{.mark} the [West]{.mark} and its interests. He is
using the openness and pluralism of Western democracies to subvert
them and taking advantage of the West's reluctance for military
engagement.]{.underline}

[In sum, Putin's Russia is "[waging]{.mark} a [global assault on
democracy]{.mark}",]{.underline} according to Diamond.

#### Should does not mean absolutely mandatory, it's a discretionary term

Judge **Mulrroney**, Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement
Administration Chief Administrative Law Judge **and** Katherine
**Legel**, Judicial Law Clerk at the Drug Enforcement Administration,
**2017**

"CURRENT NAVIGATION POINTS IN DRUG DIVERSION LAW: HIDDEN ROCKS IN
SHALLOW, MURKY, DRUG-INFESTED WATERS," Marquette Law Review, p. 384

[The [Agency]{.mark}]{.underline} disagreed with the ALJ\'s
interpretation of the Oklahoma provisions, and [[held]{.mark} that
\"[should\" does not really mean \"should]{.mark},\"]{.underline} at
least in those provisions, [but actually [means]{.mark}
\"[must]{.mark},\" and connoted a mandatory obligation]{.underline} in
the context of the provisions at issue. 292 The Agency based its
decision on its interpretation of cases from the Seventh Circuit, the
D.C. Circuit, a federal district court in Florida, and a dictionary
definition of \"should,\" as well as an analysis of the Oklahoma Medical
Practice Act and a Policy Statement. 293 Interestingly, a Tenth Circuit
(which includes Oklahoma) case which held that \"\"should\' indicates a
recommended course of action, but does not itself imply the obligation
associated with \"shall,\'\" received no mention in the Agency\'s
decision in Pope. 294 Thus, [contrary to the [Agency\'s view]{.mark},
the pertinent Circuit Court of Appeals [holds]{.mark} the view that the
[most reasonable interpretation of the word \"should\" is really]{.mark}
\"should\" - [a discretionary term]{.mark}]{.underline}. 295 The Agency
did not discuss the fact that there is some level of conflict in the
circuit courts about whether to treat \"should\" as mandatory or
permissive, 296 but the Agency has apparently taken the position that,
if the state law supplying the practice standard in a DEA case uses the
word \"should,\" the Agency is likely to read that word as \"must,\"
irrespective of federal circuit law on the issue. 297

#### The term "should" carries flexibility and discretion

Sam Foster **Halabi**, Assistant Professor, University of Tulsa College
of Law. J.D., Harvard Law School, **2010**

"ARTICLE: THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION\'S FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON
TOBACCO CONTROL: AN ANALYSIS OF GUIDELINES ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE OF
THE PARTIES", 39 Ga. J. Int\'l & Comp. L. 121, 136

The purpose, scope, and applicability of the guidelines variously
declare that States \"should,\" \"should consider,\" \"should
endeavour,\" \"should ensure,\" and \"should require\" the measures
adopted by the COP. 66The text of the FCTC uses the word \"shall\" as to
certain of Parties\' obligations. 67The use of the word
\"[[should]{.underline}]{.mark},\" in most contexts, [[is]{.mark}
\"[precatory, not mandatory]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 68Yet the word
\"[should\" may also be used to [express]{.mark} a duty or
[obligation]{.mark} albeit [with]{.mark} a degree of
[flexibility]{.mark} or discretion]{.underline}. 69FCTC Article
11.1(b)(iv) illustrates this distinction, requiring that warnings and
messages \"should be 50% or more of the principal display areas but
shall be no less than 30% of the principal display areas.\"
70Furthermore, many of the measures adopted without objection by the COP
are styled \"recommendations,\" the ordinary meaning of which does not
entail mandatory action. 71In the following sections, the treaty
language is juxtaposed with key language from the guidelines in an
effort to sort out obligations imposed by the treaty language,
obligations clarified by virtue of guidance from the guidelines, and
non-obligatory provisions of the guidelines that are precatory or
recommendatory. 72

#### Should means encouragement, not requirement

Ryan **Williams**, received his law degree in 2008 from Louisiana State
University , graduating with honors. He was a member of the Law Review
and served as a Senior Editor during his Senior year, **2008**

"Reputation and the Rules: An Argument for a Balancing Approach under
Rule 8.3 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct", 68 La. L. Rev.
931, p. 936

As in Canon 29, [use of the permissive \"[should]{.mark}\"
[implies]{.mark} that the Georgia Rule is merely [hortatory]{.mark}; it
[encourages]{.mark} reporting misbehavior [without]{.mark}
[requiring]{.mark} it]{.underline}. Georgia Rule 8.3 goes a step further
than Canon 29, in fact, by explicitly disclaiming any threat of
disciplinary proceedings for failure to comply.

#### It's not a mandatory obligation

Gil **Fried**, University of New Haven **and** Robin **Ammon**, Slippery
Rock University, **2001**

"What is Appropriate Signage for the Sport Industries?," Journal of
Legal Aspects of Sports, p. 190

The everyday use of signage affects the efficient and safe flow of
vehicular traffic. Tort liability for traffic signage related issues is
predicated upon standards established by each states\' Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Under these guidelines government
entities are required to develop uniformity in communicating safety
concerns. Uniformity means that the same type of device should be used
for the same type of road condition, which helps drivers to develop and
maintain certain expectancies (Blashke, 1990). The MUTCD uses terms such
as \"shall,\" \"should,\" and \"may\" to suggest or demand the
application of traffic control devices. [If the word \"[shall]{.mark}\"
is [used]{.mark} it is [a mandatory term]{.mark} and the state has to
follow the guidelines. In contrast, the term \"[should]{.mark}\"
[indicates]{.mark} only a [strong recommendation]{.mark}, but
[not]{.mark} a [mandatory]{.mark} recommendation]{.underline}. A good
example of this difference can be seen with stop signs. The MUTCD states
that stop signs \"shall\" be an octagon and further provides that when
two highways intersect the stop sign \"should\" be posted on the minor
street (Blashke, 1990[). The difference between \"shall\" and \"should\"
is very significant]{.underline} for traffic sign cases since liability
is harder to prove if the state was not required to post a sign when
compared with instances where the state failed to post a required sign.

allies should use momentum from [Assistant Secretary for Europe and
Eurasia Wess Mitchell's recent remarks]{.underline} at the Heritage
Foundation, where [he reaffirmed that when it comes to [NATO]{.mark},
"\[w\]e [have to be clear that we stand for strong]{.mark}
[democracy]{.mark} as the foundation of our security and
prosperity]{.underline}." [Based on this positioning,
[Washington]{.mark} would likely [support NATO allies if they insist
that democracy]{.mark}, [human]{.mark} [rights]{.mark}, and [rule of law
be a focus of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
summit and its communiqué.

the alliance, and that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark}

of their transgressions give NATO a role in maintaining this pressure,
too.

More broadly, [[Biden\'s team will emphasise]{.mark} human rights and

#### US human rights pressure fails because of hypocrisy

Unimaginably, [the [US is like a loose cannon with its double
standards]{.mark} and hypocrisy [in lecturing]{.mark} and pillorying
[other countries' human rights shortcomings]{.mark} as if it has the
moral and ethical superiority on this matter. It is as if the US is the
world's human rights judge and role model]{.underline}. Truth be told,
the US hardly befits a nation that is a role model of human rights to be
emulated by other countries. [Relative to its size and power, the
[US,]{.mark} at the moment, [is]{.mark} one, if not the [most
brazen]{.mark} and [impertinent guilty party]{.mark} or delinquent in
the international human rights community]{.underline}. [Nevertheless,
[it is unashamed to castigate]{.mark} [other countries]{.mark} across
the world for their human rights deficiencies]{.underline} [[as if it
has the moral ascendancy]{.mark} and [credibility to do so]{.mark},
given that the US does not practice what it preaches more often than
not]{.underline}. To note, [the US is the only major world power that
has failed to fully ratify or adhere to any of the significant human
rights instruments introduced by the]{.underline} United Nations
([UN)]{.underline} or other human rights bodies.

[The [US has faced accusations of voter suppression]{.mark}]{.underline}
by introducing policies such as requiring citizens to show ID and
prohibiting early votes, both of which disproportionately affect Black
Americans and disabled people. The report highlights that [[people of
colour and]{.mark} specifically Black Americans are "[particularly
v]{.mark}ulnerable]{.underline} to abuses of every single right
measured". [This highlights a [worrying disregard for]{.mark} [human
rights]{.mark} which appears to affect vulnerable minority groups at a
higher level]{.underline}. THE HYPOCRISY OF THE US [America has taken a
leading role in condemning human rights abuses worldwide]{.underline}.
In December 2019, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned Iran for
violating human rights, including "the violent crackdown on protestors
in November 2019". This US subsequently placed sanctions on Iran. [The
current [protests]{.mark} taking place in the US [demonstrate the
country's outright hypocrisy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The death of George
Floyd at the hands of US police officers has triggered worldwide
protests against police brutality. American protestors have largely been
met with further violence from the police. What began as a series of
peaceful protests quickly became widespread chaos, with police cars
driving into protestors, elderly men being pushed to the ground and
seriously injured, and assaults on innocent reporters. Pompeo has also
criticised Tehran for using violence against anti-government protestors.
He stated that "we pray for a day when ... all peoples can speak and
assemble freely without fear of their own governments." Whilst this
violation of human rights should certainly be condemned, [it is
[difficult to see how]{.mark} [any country could learn lessons from the
US,]{.mark} where the state is encouraging the use of violence against
its own citizens during protests]{.underline}. For instance, Trump
tweeted a controversial warning to protestors, stating that "when the
looting starts, the shooting starts". This statement was flagged by
Twitter as violating their guidelines by "glorifying violence". These
protests are a clear example of the US committing the same violations it
condemns overseas. THE EFFECTS OF HYPOCRITICAL POLICY [The
[hypocrisy]{.mark} demonstrated by the US [has a huge impact on]{.mark}
the [enforcement of international human rights]{.mark}. The [US has a
reputation for boasting]{.mark} about its citizens' freedoms and claims
to set an example for the rest of the world. US violations]{.underline},
however, [of its own citizens freedoms have allowed countries such as
China and Russia to undermine American efforts to condemn human rights
abuses. [America's]{.mark} recent [violations]{.mark} are [likely to
prohibit any effective intervention]{.mark} when encouraging other
countries to respect human rights]{.underline}.

Externally, [the war [waged by America in countries]{.mark} like
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria alone have already [caused]{.mark} more
than 20 million [people to become]{.mark} either [refugees]{.mark} or
[migrants]{.mark}]{.underline}. [During the US withdrawal of its troops
from Afghanistan, a US drone killed 10 members of an Afghan
family,]{.underline} including seven children, among which the youngest
was only two years old. [Also, to date, the US still holds 39 detainees
at the Guantanamo high-security prison]{.underline}. Hence, given all
these, it is imperative to ask if the US, a title-holder in pointing
fingers at the human rights shortcomings of other countries, will take
responsibility and address its dismal human rights record within its
borders and beyond? Conclusion Indeed, "righteous indignation should be
reserved for the truly righteous." But [[America is far from being
righteous]{.mark} given its blatant dismal human rights record within
its borders and beyond]{.underline}. [America [lecturing the world on
human rights is a farce]{.mark}, for it [doesn't have the moral
ascendancy and integrity]{.mark} given its gloomy human rights
record]{.underline}. [Instead of schooling other countries on their
human rights shortcomings, the US]{.underline} probably [needs some
self-introspection and should first address its human rights
situation]{.underline}.

#### Failure to shore up democracy at home makes global democracy promotion impossible

[[American diplomats have long understood]{.mark} that
[hypocrisy]{.mark} [has]{.mark} a [cost,]{.mark} especially [for a
nation that seeks to champion]{.mark} the ideals of [democracy]{.mark}
and human rights as the cornerstone of global peace and
security]{.underline}. As E.J. Dionne Jr. rightly pointed out in his
June 10 Thursday Opinion column, "[Our national security now depends on
civil rights," failing to shore up our democratic institutions and
uphold human rights at home deepens the United States' credibility
deficit and weakens its effectiveness as a champion of these values
abroad. And that has serious national security
implications]{.underline}, because we know --- from hard data and grim
experience --- that Americans are safer when democracies set the rules
of a global order. But though it's true that [our [adversaries]{.mark}
will [use]{.mark} this [hypocrisy to discredit]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in the global struggle of ideas, there's
a deeper and more [direct security threat posed by]{.mark} our [failure
to live up to]{.mark} those [ideals at home]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Societal divisions that result from systemic racism and other human
rights violations]{.underline} left to fester, combined with weak
institutions seemingly incapable of addressing these challenges, [make
us]{.underline} [not just a weaker champion but also a weaker
nation]{.underline}, increasingly vulnerable to attacks of all kinds
from those with a different vision of the world.

### at: avoids politics 

#### The counterplan threatens NATO allies. That links to politics.

[NATO is a popular punching bag for President Trump.]{.underline} Days
before coming into office, he called it "obsolete." As president, he's
railed against European spending on defense and noted time and again
that many NATO allies don't meet the target of 2 percent of gross
domestic product on defense. Other U.S. politicians --- in Congress, for
example --- have rushed to make sure NATO allies know that the United
States remains committed to the alliance. But as NATO approaches its
70th birthday Thursday, it's worth asking --- [are [Americans]{.mark}
[still behind NATO]{.mark} or have they been swayed by Trump's
arguments?]{.underline}

[According to a new study by the Program for Public Consultation of the
School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and released by
the nonpartisan organization Voice of the People, **the American people
remain committed to NATO**, too.]{.underline}

Respondents were put in the position of policymakers and presented with
arguments for and against remaining in NATO. [Just over 8 in 10, or
**[83 percent]{.mark}**, of the roughly 2,400 respondents [said]{.mark}
that **the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark} remain in
[NATO]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

"The idea is that you're putting the respondent in the shoes of the
policymaker so they've really heard the essential side of the issue,"
said Steven Kull, director of the survey.

the Oval Office of the White House, on Tuesday. (Evan Vucci/AP)

[And **support bridged the proverbial aisle**, with 90 percent of
Democratic respondents and 77 percent of Republicans saying the United
States should remain in NATO.]{.underline} (Since at least 2009,
according to the Pew Research Center, Democrats have taken a more
favorable view of NATO.)

"Given that there is substantial discussion questioning whether NATO
membership is necessary, and given that Russia has become relatively
weak and that it's been some years since the Cold War, [I thought it was
[striking]{.mark} that **[support]{.mark} for NATO membership is as
robust** as it is]{.underline}," said Kull, noting that, [**even [in
"very red districts]{.mark}**," 78 percent of respondents thought the
United States should remain in NATO (and that millennials, many who do
not remember the Cold War, overwhelmingly supported that option, with 77
percent opting to remain).]{.underline}

But it isn't just that Democrats and Republicans alike think the United
States should remain in NATO. Respondents were presented with three
choices --- press Europeans to spend more on defense and threaten to
disengage if they do not; urge Europeans to spend more but do not
threaten to disengage; or remain part of NATO but bring military
investments in line with what Europeans spend.

[The most popular option was actually to bring U.S. military investments
in line with the investments Europeans are making.]{.underline}

"It wasn't a conclusion we should necessarily spend less --- it's more
to bring U.S. military investments in line with the European level,"
Kull clarified, the thinking being that, " 'Well if the Europeans are
comfortable at the level that they're at, maybe we should adjust ours.'
"

B[ut the significant thing to Kull was that **[most people did not favor
threatening NATO allies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For both Democratic and
Republican respondents, [[**threatening to disengage** was the **least
popular** option]{.mark}, with only 4 percent of Democrats and 21
percent of Republicans saying that they found it to be the most
convincing.]{.underline}

It's "one more indicator of how robust support is for the alliance,"
Kull said. "[That the threat to withdraw was so widely
rejected.]{.underline}" A little something for NATO to celebrate,
perhaps, on its 70th birthday.
