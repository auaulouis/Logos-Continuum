#### NATO can't afford to upset Turkey -- they're geostrategically important in the southern bloc and have Russia as an ally

[Turkey will not leave NATO, but press for its interests --- expert Head
of the Russian International Affairs Council Andrey Kortunov noted that
**without Turkey \"NATO\'s southern flank will lose a lot, if not
everything\"**]{.underline} MOSCOW, May 30. /TASS/. [Turkey will
continue to pursue an independent military policy, but will refrain from
\"challenging\" the United States or quitting the North Atlantic
alliance]{.underline}, the head of the Russian International Affairs
Council, Andrey Kortunov, told TASS on Monday. \"Turkish President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, while being a full-fledged member of the North Atlantic
Alliance, pursues an independent, externally unrestrained military
policy. The way I see it, he will continue like this this further on,\"
Kortunov said. [Erdogan \"firmly defends his interests, for he is well
aware that Turkey will not be expelled from NATO, while he will not
leave on his own]{.underline},\" the analyst said. At the same time,
Kortunov predicts Ankara's conflicts with NATO. \"[There will be harsh
statements and threats from both sides, but I don\'t think it will come
to Turkey\'s withdrawal or expulsion from NATO. It would cost both sides
too much.\"]{.underline} Turkey's interests [Without Turkey, Kortunov
explained, \"NATO\'s southern flank will lose a lot, if not
everything,\" since the country is the bloc's leading member and its
armed forces are inferior only to those of the US. For this reason, he
continued, the Turkish leadership will be pressing for concessions from
the US and EU countries, \"but it will never challenge
them.]{.underline}\" Erdogan has a whole list of complaints against the
United States, Kortunov recalled. For instance, Turkey wants the lifting
sanctions related to its purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense systems
and its return to the US F-35 fighter program. \"There is as great deal
to bargain about. Clearly, Erdogan will not get everything, but he will
be able to get something in the end,\" he believes. The expert also
suggested that the Turkish side might be able to defend its interests on
the issue of Finland and Sweden joining NATO. For one, the Turkish
leadership wants these countries to curtail their traditional support
for the Kurdish opposition. \"I think they will eventually come to an
agreement. Here, concessions are expected not only from Stockholm, but
also from Brussels,\" Kortunov explained. While commenting on the
Turkish leader\'s contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the
expert noted: \"[In the alliance, **no one would want Erdogan to play
his own game with Moscow behind its back. But it be impossible to
prevent it, so they will have to leave everything as it
is.\"**]{.underline} The analyst stressed that [Turkey had long had a
very special relationship with the North Atlantic Alliance and declared
certain interests that often do not coincide with the stance of other
NATO members.]{.underline} The Turkish leadership, Kortunov forecasts,
will continue to pursue a policy that, in a sense, might violate the
unity of the bloc. \"However, in this regard, [Erdogan will go as far as
he will be allowed to,\" he stressed. \"He will be declaring his special
interests in Libya or the Eastern Mediterranean, he will put himself in
opposition to some European countries, or position himself as a global
advocate of Islam, but I don\'t think he will go to
extremes.\"]{.underline}

#### Turkey has leverage over the US, not the other way around. Turkey also doesn't solely rely on the US b/c they have Russia and Iran.

Seeking '[Axis of Good' Against U.S., Russia Taps Allies of
Convenience]{.underline} A trilateral meeting of the [leaders of Iran,
**Russia and Turkey**]{.underline} seemed to suggest a new anti-American
alliance. But there are major fissures between the countries, too.

Putin to Iran, a member of the Russian Parliament and television talking
head, Yevgeny G. Popov, said that the two countries hoped to form an
"axis of good," mocking former President George W. Bush's description of
Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an "axis of evil." Trolling American
foreign-policy blunders and rhetoric is a popular sport in Russia, from
Mr. Putin, the president, on down, but the growing affection between
Russia and Iran is that of two isolated, sanctions-stricken countries
whose main connection is their active opposition to the United States,
its allies and its domination of the multilateral world order. While the
United States likes to wrap its alliances in grandiloquent words about
shared values and democracy, Russia, Iran and China, Moscow's other
openly supportive pal and American rival, are far more transactional in
their connections. But transactional relations do not make for lasting
alliances or disguise the strains within them. "Russia is isolated on
the global stage in a way it's never been," said Charles A. Kupchan, a
former American official who is a professor at Georgetown University.
"[Putin is looking for recognition and acceptance wherever he can get
it, and that he can get it in Tehran speaks volumes]{.underline}." Even
China, which has stood by its anti-American partnership with Russia,
"has carefully kept its distance from the war in Ukraine," Mr. Kupchan
said. "And even though the lion's share of the world's countries aren't
enforcing the sanctions regime against Russia, they get it: that
Russia's invasion was a bald act of aggression." Damage from a rocket
strike in Sloviansk, Ukraine, on Tuesday. As the war grinds on, [Turkey
has created a vital role for itself as the mediator between Moscow and
Kyiv.]{.underline} Neither Russia nor China has eager allies or much
soft power, said Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official who
is research director for the Berlin-based European Council on Foreign
Relations. "No one really likes China, but everyone understands their
power," Mr. Shapiro said. "[Russia is worse --- they have the soft power
of a drunken porcupine. But they have a lot of assets, too, including
energy, and the will to use their military."]{.underline} Most of the
world just wants to stay out of what it sees as a superpower conflict
being fought over Ukraine, said François Heisbourg, a French defense
analyst with the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. If half the
world's population is staying publicly out of this war, half of that
half is India and China, Mr. Heisbourg said, and the United States has
been largely successful in keeping China from aiding Russia militarily
in Ukraine and in not heavily pushing India, which is no friend of
China's and remains dependent on Russian arms. With Western sanctions
having a "colossal" impact on Russia, in Mr. Putin's own words, Moscow
needs places to do business, especially as the sanctions bite harder
over time. Iran, isolated by even tougher American economic sanctions
over its nuclear program, is happy to do business with Russia, Mr.
Kupchan said. Russia also needs more surveillance of the battleground in
Ukraine, and Washington has revealed Moscow's interest in buying both
armed drones and observation drones from Tehran. Russia and Iran have a
long and complicated history. Ties and trade improved after the collapse
of the Soviet Union, which was the first country to recognize the
Islamic Republic after the country's 1979 revolution, though Moscow went
on to back Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. In general, the two
countries have had a mutual interest in pushing back American power in
places such as Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Relations improved with the
deterioration of Russia's ties to the West and the steady imposition of
sanctions on Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014. In 2021,
mutual trade hit record levels, though at a relatively modest amount of
about \$3.5 billion. Hassan Rouhani, left, then the president of Iran,

does not share Iran's enmity toward Israel and does not want Tehran to
develop a nuclear weapon. Moscow has been largely helpful in
negotiations to restore the 2015 nuclear deal between six world powers
and Iran that former President Donald J. Trump abandoned in 2018, and
that President Biden has been trying fitfully to resurrect.
ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Mr. Biden and Israeli
leaders repeated their promises last week to do everything necessary to
prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, including military action. And
Russia has no interest in a Western military campaign against Iran,
which becomes a real possibility if there is no renewed nuclear deal.
Russia and Iran are also competing to sell their sanctioned and
discounted oil to China and other countries. Though the quality of the
crude is different in both countries, it is difficult to imagine them
forming some sort of cartel to sell sanctioned oil, Mr. Shapiro said. On
Syria, however, they are largely aligned in their longtime support of
the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. And Syria was the stated focus
of the summit in Tehran, which included the Turkish president, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan. Image A joint Russian-Turkish patrol in northeastern

Turkey has no interest in being part of any new axis or alliance with
Russia or Iran. Instead, Ankara has very artfully managed a foreign
policy that is diversified and open to all sides and that gives it
considerable leverage with both Moscow and Washington. "[Turkey is
skillfully walking a middle path, **signaling to the Americans that it
won't just be a compliant ally** and do what we want, but they're
signaling the same thing to the Russians]{.underline}," Mr. Shapiro
said. Mr. Heisbourg agreed. "[The Turks continue to play both sides
against the middle and they are in a very strong position to do so," he
said. "It's a highly profitable game politically, economically and
strategically --- but that excludes any new alliance." **Turkey has
created a vital role for itself as the mediator between Russia and
Ukraine** --- effectively the mediator between Washington, NATO and
Russia]{.underline}. It has [worked with all sides, including the United
Nations, to try to get Ukrainian (and Russian) grain exports out through
the Black Sea to the developing world. Mr. Erdogan has bought Russian
antiaircraft missiles and has not joined Western sanctions against
Russia, which has irked Washington. But **Turkey remains a key NATO ally
of the United States, signed a tough anti-Russian communiqué at the NATO
summit in Madrid, has sold Ukraine weapons and drones that are helping
to kill Russians, and has removed its block on the entry of Finland and
Sweden into NATO**, at least for now.]{.underline} Turkey's mediation
may bring even more benefits, Mr. Kupchan said. Mr. Erdogan has
credibility and channels to both Moscow and Washington, as well as to
Kyiv, and "if he can broker a deal to get Ukrainian grain flowing again,
that might be the first step to pivot to diplomacy, a
confidence-building measure that would require concessions by both
Russia and Ukraine, but could be done under the rubric of humanitarian
aid," Mr. Kupchan said. Mr. Erdogan at talks in Istanbul in March

France-Presse --- Getty Images What Turkey clearly wanted from this
trilateral summit, however, was narrower --- a green light to conduct a
new military incursion into northern Syria against the Syrian Kurds, who
Mr. Erdogan says are allies with the P.K.K., or Kurdistan Workers'
Party, which he and the West consider terrorists. Attacking the Kurds is
popular in Turkey, even among Mr. Erdogan's opposition, and is part of
his effort to win re-election next year, Mr. Heisbourg said. And Syria
is the only issue where the policies of all three countries intersect,
even though their interests are different. Iran and Russia have been the
firmest allies of Mr. Assad. But [Turkey has backed armed groups
fighting for his removal; has sent its troops into northern Syria; and
has kept Syrian, Iranian and Russian troops from conquering Idlib
Province, still mostly controlled by anti-Assad rebels]{.underline}.
"[With so much leverage, now is a great time for Erdogan to beat up on
the Kurds]{.underline}," Mr. Heisbourg said. While Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, warned Turkey against further attacks
in Syria, Mr. Erdogan was unfazed. And it's likely that Russia does not
much care, so long as the Turkish intervention is limited to the north.
More likely, Mr. Heisbourg suggested, Mr. Erdogan used the meeting in
Tehran to inform Russia and Iran of his plans and to try to avoid
unnecessary confrontation.

#### Turkey doesn't need the US' security guarantees b/c they have Russian arms sales 

**Jones 21** Dorian Jones (Dorian Jones reports for VOA from Istanbul.
He was worked for a variety of outlets including BBC Sky News, Deutsche
Welle, and CBC), 5-17-2021, \"Turkey to Go Ahead with Russian Weapons
Purchases Despite US Objections,\" VOA,
https://www.voanews.com/a/europe_turkey-go-ahead-russian-weapons-purchases-despite-us-objections/6205910.html

[Turkey is threatening to go ahead with Russian military purchases
despite warnings from Washington. The threat comes as the impasse
between the NATO members deepens over Ankara\'s purchase of a Russian
missile system.]{.underline} With Washington stepping up its pressure on
Ankara to reverse its purchase of the Russian S 400 missile defense
systems, [Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar this month defended its
intentions, dismissing American concerns.]{.underline} This is not an
offensive system, Akar said, adding, this system can\'t threaten anyone
in any way where it is deployed. It is not a risk, threat, or danger to
anyone, the official said. [Washington says the S 400 missiles advanced
radar poses a threat to NATO defense systems and calls for its removal.
But Ankara has said it is considering purchasing more batches of the
Russian missiles. One source close to the government says **Turkey has
already struck a deal with Moscow**.]{.underline} Russian S-400
surface-to-air missile launchers take part in a second night of
rehearsals for the WWII Victory Parade in Moscow on June 18, 2020. Last
month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Turkey could face
sanctions if it bought other Russian weaponry, including additional S
400 missile systems. Concerns over the S 400 have already resulted in
Washington's blocking Turkey from modernizing its aging combat aircraft
with America\'s advanced F-35. But Turkish presidential advisor Mesut
Casin warns Washington is forcing Turkey only further to deepen its
military ties with Russia. [\"We need 200 combat aircraft. This is the
reality on the table, but the US don\'t give the combat aircraft. And so
you (the US) pressure (Turkey) to buy the Russian combat aircraft; we
don\'t want to buy it,\" said Casin. \"**But if the US don\'t give the
combat aircraft, we can buy the Russian combat aircraft, because we need
the combat aircraft.\"**]{.underline}

### 1AR QPQ -- AT: Turkey Cooperates Now 

#### Turkey only agreed to let Sweden and Finland join NATO b/c they agreed to help Turkey fight terrorists, not because Turkey wanted to strengthen its relationship with NATO 

**Fazeli 22** Mahmoud Fazeli (Analyst of International Affairs),
07-2022, \"Reasons of Turkey's U-Turn to Admit Sweden &amp; Finland
Membership in NATO,\" Strategic Council on Foreign Relations (Iran),
https://www.scfr.ir/en/strategic-perspective/note/144983/reasons-of-turkeys-u-turn-to-admit-sweden-finland-membership-in-nato/

Immediate demands of Turkey in order to show her green light for joining
of Sweden and Finland to NATO were to "recognize YPK as a terrorist
organization, putting an end to PKK/YPG activities, admitting the very
same demand by Sweden and Finland, and if possible, to generalize the
demand to NATO level, extradition of a number of terrorists whose names
had already been given to the said countries and ultimately, lifting
arms embargo of the said countries against Turkey". From Turkey's point
of view, "[NATO should end its rising opposition against
Turkey]{.underline}, [which has been increased with strengthening
relations between the U.S. and Greece.]{.underline} Achieving a fair and
just solution on militarized island of Aegean Sea, delivering of F-16
fighters to Turkey and considering security concerns of Turkey in its
probable operations in Syria" should also be taken into consideration.
While before leaving for Madrid to attend in NATO Summit meeting,
Erdogan was not showing any willingness to lift his veto on admission of
Sweden and Finland, but a few hours after his arrival to Madrid he
confirmed the membership of the two countries. [Turkey reminded the two
countries of the conditions to be met. Only after taking promises from
Sweden and Finland to assist fighting against Kurd groups, Erdogan
accepted that the two countries become NATO members. Turkey's measure to
agree the membership of the two countries in NATO was a big surprise to
all.]{.underline} With signing a trilateral agreement among Turkey,
Sweden and Finland, Ankara dropped her opposition on the membership of
the two Nordic countries in NATO, instead, [Finland and Sweden will
address to Turkey's concerns in connection with terrorism.]{.underline}
The two countries pledged not to assist YPD/YPG terrorist groups as well
as Gulen. Likewise, [there will be no arms embargo applied to Turkey,
Sweden and Finland]{.underline}. Sweden promised to adjust its national
stances concerning arms export to NATO allies. Article 9 is one of the
important points of the agreement according to which a Permanent Joint
Mechanism will be established to monitor the aforementioned issues.
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Justice Ministers as well as intelligent
services will jointly be active in the said mechanism and will monitor
their performance. Other NATO member countries as well as the EU members
may also attend in the joint mechanism.
