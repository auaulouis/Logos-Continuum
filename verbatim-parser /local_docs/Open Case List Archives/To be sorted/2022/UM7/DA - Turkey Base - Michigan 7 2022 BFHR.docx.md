## Swinland

### Turkey Ups\-\--NEG\-\--Add to older cards already in the file 

#### Swinland was an [election ploy]{.underline}\-\--even if it was technically cooperation, Erdogan got concessions and spun it as anti-NATO

Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.underline} **[was staunch in
his demands]{.underline}** [of Sw]{.underline}eden and
F[inland]{.underline}, which [centered on their relationships with
groups that Turkey's government deems a terrorist threat.]{.underline}

What is a big win for NATO is also a **[victory for
Erdogan]{.underline}**, analysts say, and [one that the president needed
in order to **shore up domestic support** as his economy
flounders]{.underline} and Turks struggle with inflation that's exceeded
70%.

"Win all around, apart from Putin who is the big loser in all this,"
Timothy Ash, an emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management,
wrote in a note Wednesday. "Good decision by [Erdogan]{.underline}. He
**[takes some political capital into elections]{.underline}**."

"He [negotiated hard, right]{.underline} up to the last minute, **[and
got real wins with assurances]{.underline}**" [on security
issues]{.underline} and likely on more military equipment from the U.S.,
Ash wrote. "He had his call with Biden and will get his one-on-one with
Biden at Madrid. He comes back in from the cold with the West."

Turkey 'got what it wanted'

The breakthrough with Turkey followed four hours of talks and weeks of
deliberations and debate, culminating in a trilateral agreement between
Turkey, Sweden and Finland. The [agreement involved the Nordic countries
lifting arms embargoes they had previously imposed on Turkey, toughening
their laws against Kurdish militant activists]{.underline} that Ankara
deems to be terrorists, and [addressing Turkish extradition requests for
suspected Kurdish fighters.]{.underline}

#### Swinland was [not cooperation]{.underline}\-\--this [confirms our uniqueness]{.underline}

In the weeks and months ahead, [Erdogan will]{.underline} **[talk up his
success]{.underline}** in Spain [as he ratchets up his **re-election
campaign**]{.underline}. With less than a year to go before he faces an
electorate in severe economic distress, [the president will take any
opportunity for chest-thumping he can get.]{.underline}

But Turks paying close attention to the 11th-hour machinations in Madrid
will know **[Erdogan gained very little]{.underline}** ---
[and]{.underline} may have **[lost a lot]{.underline}**. If he got a few
talking points for his campaign speeches, the president [gave up a
chance to return Turkey to the high table of international
affairs.]{.underline}

He could have played it differently. [Instead of holding up
Sw]{.underline}eden and F[inland]{.underline}, Erdogan [might have used
his status as NATO's longest-serving leader to be the statesman at a
time of strife]{.underline}. His views about the crisis growing along
NATO's eastern borders, with the war in Ukraine and anxiety in the
Baltics, would have been especially valuable because he enjoys a closer
relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin than anybody else in
the alliance.

Instead, [his gamesmanship confirmed **Erdogan's reputation within NATO
as a spoiler** who pursues]{.underline} **[personal advantage above the
collective good.]{.underline}** When Sweden and Finland join the
alliance, the list of members with bitter experience of his self-serving
opportunism will grow by two. The others, already angered by his making
common cause with Putin and compromising the security of the group as a
whole by purchasing Russian missile-defense systems, won't forget that
when a major crisis confronted them all, Erdogan chose to play parochial
politics.

#### Its [not cooperation]{.underline}, it's a transaction\-\--Erogan is extracting demands from NATO to play to his [nationalist platform]{.underline}

**AP 6/30 ­---** AP, "Erdoğan warns Turkey could still block Finland and
Sweden's accession to Nato," The Guardian 6-30-2022,

Just two days after agreeing to lift deal-breaking objections to Sweden
and Finland's Nato accession, [Turkey's]{.underline} president has
[warned]{.underline} that [Ankara could **still block the
process**]{.underline} [if the two countries fail **to fully meet his
expectations.**]{.underline}

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said at the close of the alliance's summit in
Madrid that the 10-article agreement with the Nordic pair was a victory
for Ankara and addressed all its "sensitivities".

He [particularly stressed the satisfying]{.underline} of **[Turkey's
demand]{.underline}** [for Sw]{.underline}eden and Fin[land to
**extradite terror suspects**]{.underline} [with links to outlawed
Kurdish groups]{.underline} or the network of an exiled cleric accused
of a failed 2016 coup in Turkey.

But Erdoğan added that **[if the two Nordic countries renege on their
promises]{.underline}**, [Turkey's parliament could]{.underline}
**[refuse to ratify the deal reached]{.underline}** on Tuesday. [Nato
accession must be formally approved by all 30 member states, which gives
each a blocking right.]{.underline}

"This business will not work if we don't pass this in our parliament,"
Erdoğan said. "[First, Sw]{.underline}eden and F[inland]{.underline}
**[must fulfil their duties]{.underline}** and those are already in the
text ... But if they don't fulfil these, then of course there is no way
we would send it to our parliament."
