#### A compromised innovation bill will pass soon --Biden is pushing for the bill -- framing it as counter inflationary and creating a sense of urgency

**AIP 6/29**

American Institute of Physics, "Congress Searches for Compromise on
Landmark Innovation Bill" June 29, 2022
https://www.aip.org/fyi/2022/congress-searches-compromise-landmark-innovation-bill

[Negotiations to reconcile]{.underline} the House's America
[COMPETES]{.underline} Act of 2022 with the Senate's U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act (USICA) [are in the final stretch]{.underline}, with
Democratic leaders pushing to pass a compromise bill by the time
Congress departs for its usual August break. [The urgency stems from
the]{.underline} dwindling time remaining to reach a deal before the
[November election]{.underline} diverts lawmakers' attention and the
current legislative session expires at the end of the year. [The bills
reflect broad bipartisan interest]{.underline} in improving U.S.
capabilities in research and technology development relative to China
and other competitor nations, and each includes \$52 billion in direct
funding for semiconductor R&D and manufacturing. However, the bills
sharply diverge over matters such as how to shape a multiagency R&D
push, how to build up regional R&D capacity, whether to expedite visas
for technically skilled foreign citizens, and how to protect U.S.-funded
research from exploitation by rival governments. Lawmakers also attached
a host of provisions unrelated to science policy to each bill, opening
up debates over far-flung matters such as trade and environmental
policy. Any final bill will require the support of at least 10
Republican senators to avoid a filibuster, which gives the Senate
additional leverage in the negotiations. Democrats narrow ambitions in
search of deal [Negotiators have been working behind closed
doors]{.underline} since the 107-member conference committee tasked with
reconciling the legislation held its first meeting in May. House Speaker
Nancy [Pelosi]{.underline} (D-CA) [said]{.underline} earlier this month
that [they are "narrowing" the scope]{.underline} of the legislation in
hope of [reaching compromise]{.underline}, without indicating what they
have dropped. She and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a key
proponent of the legislation, met with their Republican counterparts
last week to discuss prospects for a final deal. "We expressed our
belief that there is no reason that we should not pass this bill through
Congress in July," Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement. "Democrats
have already made accommodations in the name of reaching an agreement,
which we are optimistic can happen soon." However, some Republicans
reportedly prefer to revisit the legislation next year since they may
gain control of Congress after the midterm elections. Nevertheless, any
final bill would still require support from both parties and the Biden
administration. T[he semiconductor funding has put lawmakers under
particular pressure]{.underline} to complete the bill, with some leaders
in the industry warning a delay could lead them to invest in other
countries that have already moved ahead with incentives. President
**[Biden has]{.underline}** also **[made the case for quick
action]{.underline}** on the legislation, **[arguing it has measures
that will help reduce supply chain disruptions that contribute to
inflation.]{.underline}** "[Pass the damn bill and send it to me," Biden
said]{.underline} in May. "It's going to help bring down prices, bring
home jobs, and power America's manufacturing comeback."

There are no magic bullets here, but there is much [[Biden
can]{.underline}]{.mark} do. His campaign commitment to adopt federal
"Buy American" policies to favor domestic producers is sensible and a
political no-brainer. Investing in domestic priorities like
infrastructure, education, and energy to create non-tradeable jobs and
[[boost US competitiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} over the longer term is
[[a heavi]{.underline}]{.mark}er [[lift,
politically]{.underline}]{.mark}. Still, [[some]{.mark}
[Republicans]{.mark} on Capitol Hill]{.underline} will [[find it in
their political interests]{.underline}]{.mark} try [[to work with Biden
on these efforts]{.mark}, [especially if they are connected
to]{.mark}]{.underline} recovering from the pandemic and [[making
America more competitive vis a vis China. The more Biden
invests]{.underline}]{.mark} intelligently [[here, the more it will
ease]{.underline}]{.mark} anti-globalist
[[pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[at home]{.underline}]{.mark} and
strengthen US credibility as a reliable partner abroad. **[[This is

#### Successful reconciliation quickly revitalizes competitiveness versus China

**Augustine 3-1**-2022, retired chairman & CEO of Lockheed Martin and
former undersecretary of the Army (Norman, "America\'s competitive edge
is shrinking --- Congress can reverse the trend," The Hill,
<https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/596255-americas-competitive-edge-is-shrinking-congress-can-reverse-the-trend>)

[**[S]{.mark}**cience [and]{.mark} [**t**echnology]{.mark}
matter]{.underline}. Several studies, two of which led to Nobel prizes,
have indicated that up to [85 percent of the [growth in]{.mark}
America's [GDP can be attributed to]{.mark} advancements in just two
fields, science and **[tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline}. The United
States cannot hope to compete with China, industrially or militarily, on
a person-to-person basis given the latter's four-times greater
population. [America's [competitiveness will depend
on]{.mark}]{.underline} such assets as **[freedom]{.underline}**, free
**[enterprise]{.underline}**, **[allies]{.underline}**,
**[[innovativeness]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and prowess in]{.mark}
science and [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**. But in all-important
basic research, America ranks 29th among nations in the fraction of R&D
that is federally funded. In 2007, it was my privilege to lead a study
of America's competitiveness that was requested by Congress and overseen
by the National Academies. Twenty individuals, university presidents,
corporate CEOs, former and future presidential appointees and several
Nobel Laureates performed the study. The 565-page document that was
produced, known as the "Gathering Storm" report, concluded that America
had moved onto a path that would lose the scientific leadership it had
been building since the 1940s, and that this was largely due to the lack
of investment in research and the failure of our nation's primary and
secondary public schools to produce a sufficient number of graduates
qualified to pursue careers in science, engineering and mathematics. The
most recent well-regarded international test of academic achievement of
15-year-olds placed the U.S. in 17th place in science and 37th in
mathematics. China ranks number one in each, but only tests students in
a few major cities. The qualifications and interest of America's youth
in pursuing careers in science and technology is suggested by the
fraction of college students receiving their undergraduate degrees in,
for example, engineering, wherein America ranks 76th worldwide --- just
behind Mozambique. Congress acted on the Gathering Storm report,
enacting the **[[America COMPETES]{.underline}]{.mark}** Act [[of
2007]{.underline}]{.mark}. Subsequently, it [[legislated several bold
plans to sustain U.S. leadership]{.mark} in science and technology,
[but]{.mark} it has, [unfortunately]{.mark}, consistently [failed to
provide]{.mark} the [funds]{.mark} needed to implement those plans.
Ironically, [China]{.mark} seems to have [adopted]{.mark} many [key
parts of the plans]{.mark} and funded them.]{.underline} According to a
new analysis by the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
current annual federal expenditures on research (even with funding
growth set merely at the rate of inflation in the years beyond those
specifically addressed in the reports) are now \$6.7 billion below where
they would have been under the COMPETES Act of 2007 and \$4.9 billion
below where they would have been had the COMPETES Act of 2010 been
funded. Had federal funding kept pace with China's overall R&D growth
rate during the period, the shortfall is \$47 billion. It is, of course,
not China that stipulates how much America invests in basic research
(currently 0.2% of GDP --- about what our citizenry spends on beer) or
the quality of our public schools. As Pogo the Possum was prone to
pronounce, "It is us." [[Congress's passage of]{.mark} the
[competitiveness legislation]{.mark} before it, [along with the research
investments it]{.mark} [calls for, is **essential** if America is not to
awaken]{.mark} one day [in the **not too distant future** to find itself
a **formerly competitive nation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### US tech leadership solves nuclear war

Strategy in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the

disruptive technology cause nuclear war?,\" Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/11/will-disruptive-technology-cause-nuclear-war/>)

Recently, analysts have argued that emerging technologies with military
applications may undermine nuclear stability (see here, here, and here),
but the logic of these arguments is debatable and overlooks a more
straightforward reason [why new technology might cause **nuclear
conflict**: by upending the existing balance of power among
nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. This latter concern is more probable
and dangerous and demands an immediate policy response. For more than 70
years, the world has avoided major power conflict, and many attribute
this era of peace to nuclear weapons. In situations of mutually assured
destruction (MAD), neither side has an incentive to start a conflict
because doing so will only result in its own annihilation. The key to
this model of deterrence is the maintenance of secure second-strike
capabilities---the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and respond
with a devastating counterattack. Recently analysts have begun to worry,
however, that [new strategic military technologies may make it possible
for a state to conduct]{.underline} a [successful first strike on an
enemy]{.underline}. For example, Chinese colleagues have complained to
me in Track II dialogues that the United States may decide to launch a
sophisticated cyberattack against Chinese nuclear command and control,
essentially turning off China's nuclear forces. Then, Washington will
follow up with a massive strike with conventional cruise and hypersonic
missiles to destroy China's nuclear weapons. Finally, if any Chinese
forces happen to survive, the United States can simply mop up China's
ragged retaliatory strike with advanced missile defenses. China will be
disarmed and US nuclear weapons will still be sitting on the shelf,
untouched. If the United States, or any other state acquires such a
first-strike capability, then the logic of MAD would be undermined.
Washington may be tempted to launch a nuclear first strike. Or China may
choose instead to use its nuclear weapons early in a conflict before
they can be wiped out---the so-called "use 'em or lose 'em" problem.
According to this logic, therefore, the appropriate policy response
would be to ban outright or control any new weapon systems that might
threaten second-strike capabilities. This way of thinking about new
technology and stability, however, is open to question. Would any US
president truly decide to launch a massive, bolt-out-of-the-blue nuclear
attack because he or she thought s/he could get away with it? And why
does it make sense for the country in the inferior position, in this
case China, to intentionally start a nuclear war that it will almost
certainly lose? More important, this conceptualization of how new
technology affects stability is too narrow, focused exclusively on how
new military technologies might be used against nuclear forces directly.
Rather, [we should think]{.underline} more [broadly about how new
technology might affect global politics, and]{.underline}, for this, [it
is helpful to turn to scholarly international relations
theory]{.underline}. The dominant theory of the causes of war in the
academy is [the "[bargaining]{.mark} model of war."]{.underline} This
theory [[identifies rapid shifts in the balance of power as a **primary
cause of conflict**]{.mark}. International politics]{.underline} often
[presents states with conflicts that they can settle through peaceful
bargaining, but when bargaining breaks down, war results. Shifts in the
balance of power are problematic because **they undermine effective
bargaining**]{.underline}. After all, why agree to a deal today if your
bargaining position will be stronger tomorrow? And, a [clear
understanding of the military balance of power can contribute to
peace]{.underline}. (Why start a war you are likely to lose?) [But
shifts in the balance of power muddy understandings of which states have
the advantage]{.underline}. You may see where this is going. [[New
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [threaten to [create]{.mark}
potentially **[destabilizing shifts in]{.mark} the [balance of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For decades, [stability in]{.underline}
Europe and [Asia has been supported by US military power.]{.underline}
In recent years, however, [the balance of power in Asia has begun to
shift, as China has increased its military capabilities]{.underline}.
Already, [[Beijing has become]{.mark} **more [assertive]{.mark}** in the
region, [claiming]{.mark} contested [territory]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the South China Sea. And the results of Russia's military modernization
have been on full display in its ongoing intervention in Ukraine.
Moreover, [China may have the [lead]{.mark} over the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[in emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies [that could be decisive for]{.mark} the future of
military acquisitions and [warfare, including 3D printing]{.mark},
hypersonic [missiles, quantum computing, 5G]{.mark} wireless
connectivity, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}). And Russian President Vladimir Putin is
building new unmanned vehicles while ominously declaring, "Whoever leads
in AI will rule the world." [[If China]{.underline}]{.mark} or Russia
[[are able to incorporate new tech]{.mark}nologies into their militaries
[before the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, then [this [could]{.mark} lead to the
kind of rapid shift in the balance of power that often [cause]{.mark}s
[war.]{.mark} If [Beijing]{.mark} believes emerging technologies provide
it with a newfound, local military advantage over the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, for example, [it
[may]{.mark} be]{.underline} more [willing]{.underline} than previously
[to **[initiate conflict over Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if
Putin thinks new tech has strengthened his hand, he may be more tempted
to launch a Ukraine-style invasion of a NATO member.
[[Either]{.underline}]{.mark} scenario [[could bring]{.mark} these
nuclear [powers into]{.mark} direct [conflict with the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [and
once nuclear armed states are at war, [there is]{.mark} an [inherent
risk of nuclear conflict through limited]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}
strategies, **nuclear [brinkmanship]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} **simple
[accident]{.mark}** or **inadvertent escalation**. This framing of the
problem leads to a different set of policy implications. The concern
is]{.underline} not simply technologies that threaten to undermine
nuclear second-strike capabilities directly, but, rather, any
[technologies that can result in a meaningful shift in the broader
balance of power]{.underline}. And the solution is not to preserve
second-strike capabilities, but to preserve prevailing power balances
more broadly. When it comes to new technology, this means that [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should seek to
maintain an innovation edge]{.underline}. Washington should also work
with other states, including its nuclear-armed rivals, to develop a new
set of arms control and nonproliferation agreements and export controls
to deny these newer and potentially destabilizing technologies to
potentially hostile states. These are no easy tasks, but t[he
[consequences of Washington **losing**]{.mark} **the race for
[tech]{.mark}**nological **[superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} to its
autocratic challengers just [[might mean **nuclear
Armageddon**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[A \$52 billion packag]{.mark}e of incentives and subsidies [to bolster
US semiconductor manufacturing is far from dead]{.mark},]{.underline}
[d[espite]{.mark} Senate Republican leader Mitch [McConnell's threat
t]{.mark}o scuttle the legislation containing it in order to stall
passage of President Joe Biden's economic plan.
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [have multiple paths to get the chips money,
which has broad bipartisan support]{.mark}, through
Congress.]{.underline} McConnell stunned Democrats on Thursday by
tweeting he would stand in the way of the wider China competition
legislation of which the semiconductor provision is a part so long as
Democrats plan to use the partisan budget process to ram through a
separate package of tax increases on the wealthy and corporations,
incentives for green energy, and prescription drug price limits. [While
[the ploy]{.mark} is aimed at stopping the budget package, it [comes as
Republicans have also been pushing Democrats to abandon plans]{.mark} to
add big-ticket spending items to the China bill, which has been the
subject of closed door talks for months]{.underline}. [[Commerce
Secretary]{.mark} Gina Raimondo, in an interview with the Washington
Post, [called McConnell's threat a mere "bump in the road"]{.mark}
designed to increase his leverage in negotiations. "The only entity in
the world that benefits from this bill not passing is China," she said
in the interview. **[Enactment of the semiconductor incentives is a top
priority for the Biden administration]{.mark}** as well as manufacturers
such as Intel Corp. and companies that are heavy users of chips. While
the global semiconductor shortage has eased somewhat, there is still
limited production for certain chips used in cars and home
appliances]{.underline}. The wrangling over the bill comes as
semiconductor stocks took a beating, driven by concerns arose about
demand cooling for chips as the US economy faces recession fears.
[[McConnell made his threat as]{.mark} Senate Majority Leader Charles
[Schumer and]{.mark} Senator Joe [Manchin o]{.mark}f West Virginia, a
key Democratic vote, [were nearing a deal]{.mark} on the specifics of a
\$1 trillion budget and tax packag]{.underline}e. Republicans have
largely rallied behind their Senate leader, including those who
supported the competition and chips bill. [The McConnell move is not
without political and procedural risks. Democrats, including House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's spokesman Henry Connelly, attempted to frame the
effort as being soft on China while standing in the way of prescription
drug cuts.]{.underline} That message could blunt efforts of Republicans
to present themselves in the midterms as both tough on Beijing and
fighting to lower spiraling costs. [[Democrats could ignore McConnell's
threats,]{.mark} pass their economic package with a simple majority in
August and then hold a potentially painful vote on a completed China
bill just before the elections to hammer the issue home.]{.underline} At
that point, with no chance to stall the economic plan, some Senate
Republicans could peel off and vote for the bill. Eighteen Republicans,
including McConnell, voted for the legislation when it passed the Senate
in March. [In a second scenario, [if Schumer and Manchin's talks fall
apart]{.mark} as Build Back Better talks did in December, [then all
sides simply let the China bill move forward. Given this real
possibility,]{.mark} Republican and Democratic [staff are continuing to
work on the details of the]{.mark} House and Senate [China bills to try
to make progress on a unified bill that could pass both
chambers.]{.mark}]{.underline} The biggest differences remaining on the
competition bill revolve around trade policy, according to people
familiar with the situation. Democrats are trying to add payments to
workers displaced by trade deals under a program called Trade Adjustment
Assistance. There is also controversy over restrictions on investments
by Americans and American companies in China, and a research and
development tax provision. Democrats are widely seen walking away from
an attempt to add immigration visa expansion and climate provisions to
the bill after earlier dropping a marijuana banking provision. In a
third scenario, Democrats can under Senate rules add the \$52 billion
chips bill to the budget bill if Schumer and Manchin agree to do so.
Other aspects of the China legislation can be tweaked from so-called
authorizations to appropriations to make them comply with Senate budget
rules. Provisions related to Taiwan policy, outward-bound US investment,
research security and federal procurement may not be allowed in the
budget package, however. Finally, Democrats have a Senate-passed version
of the China bill sitting in the House. They could simply pass it and
send it to Biden without adding more spending. McConnell Tactics
McConnell's gambit of holding a bipartisan China competition package
hostage while Democrats try and jam through a scaled-back economic plan
isn't the first time he's used the lure of a bipartisan deal as leverage
to try and slow or kill Biden's larger agenda. [A year ago, McConnell
insisted that Democrats separate the bipartisan infrastructure plan from
the larger Democratic "Build Back Better" effort.]{.underline} That
increased tensions and confusion in the Democratic caucus. House
liberals eventually caved on their insistence of simultaneously passing
the infrastructure package alongside a massive Democratic plan, while
negotiations with Manchin dragged on. [Ultimately Democratic divisions,
rather than any McConnell ploy, led to the collapse of the \$2.2
trillion Build Back Better plan, but McConnell exacerbated Democratic
infighting.]{.underline}

semiconductors and overall supply-chain disruptions. Ms. Raimondo

Noting that [the Senate bill already represents a true bipartisan
compromise]{.underline}, Mr. Young argues that it would be unreasonable
to expect the final agreement to split the difference between the House
and Senate versions. Instead, it should be much closer to the Senate
bill. Mr. Schumer understands this, he said, as do Commerce Secretary
Gina Raimondo and the White House, but apparently Mrs. Pelosi does not.
Mr. Young was candid about the trade provisions of the bill, a major
sticking point. During Senate deliberations, he said, some Republican
senators insisted on new trade language, and the ensuing disagreement
was successfully resolved in negotiations between Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and Mike Crapo, the committee's ranking
Republican. This bipartisan agreement wasn't acceptable to House
Democrats, and the matter is being relitigated between Mr. Crapo and
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal. Describing their
positions as "principled disagreement," Mr. Young is "concerned" that
their differences might prove difficult to resolve soon. Consumer groups
and app developers believe that the Wyden-Crapo trade provisions will
undermine the Europe Union's regulatory framework for digital trade.
Mrs. Pelosi also appears to believe this. Mr. Wyden defends his language
as a serious effort to fight authoritarian forces engaged in "digital
censorship," although he is open to refinements distinguishing between
censorship and regulations addressing data privacy, antitrust
enforcement, and antiharassment regulations. Mr. Young says the
conferees should focus on resolving disagreements that can be
successfully negotiated while setting aside intractable disputes for
another day. He expressed optimism that provisions concerning the
National Science Foundation, national-security innovation, domestic chip
production, regional technology hubs, and workforce development for
advanced production fall into the "resolvable" category. He believes the
government's credibility is on the line. "We have an opportunity to show
that regular order can produce a broad bipartisan bill," he says, but
this is unlikely to happen, he added, unless President Biden pushes it
across the goal line. In remarks on the America Competes Act last month,
a frustrated president exclaimed, "Pass the damn bill and send it to
me." [Unless he gets directly involved, this probably won't happen, and
America's best chance in decades to boost domestic innovation and
manufacturing could die in committee]{.underline}.

[[Negotiations to reconcile]{.mark} the House's [America
COMPETES]{.mark} Act of 2022 [with]{.mark} the Senate's U.S. Innovation
and Competition Act ([USICA) are in the final
stretch]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} with Democratic leaders pushing
to pass a compromise bill by the time Congress departs for its usual
August break. [[The urgency stems from the dwindling time
remaining]{.mark} to reach a deal before the November election diverts
lawmakers' attention and the current legislative session expires at the
end of the year. [The bills reflect broad bipartisan interest in
improving U.S. capabilities]{.mark} in research and technology
development relative to China and other competitor nations, and each
includes \$52 billion in direct funding for semiconductor R&D and
manufacturing. However, the bills sharply diverge over matters such as
how to shape a multiagency R&D push, how to build up regional R&D
capacity, whether to expedite visas for technically skilled foreign
citizens, and how to protect U.S.-funded research from exploitation by
rival governments.]{.underline} Lawmakers also attached a host of
provisions unrelated to science policy to each bill, opening up debates
over far-flung matters such as trade and environmental policy. Any final
bill will require the support of at least 10 Republican senators to
avoid a filibuster, which gives the Senate additional leverage in the
negotiations. [[Negotiators have been working behind closed
doors]{.mark} since the 107-member conference committee tasked with
[reconciling the legislation]{.mark} held its first meeting in May.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said earlier this month that they are
"[narrowing" the scope]{.mark} of the legislation [in hope of reaching
compromise]{.mark}]{.underline}, without indicating what they have
dropped. She and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a key
proponent of the legislation, met with their Republican counterparts
last week to discuss prospects for a final deal. "[We expressed our
belief that [there is no reason that we should not pass this
bill]{.mark} through Congress [in July,]{.mark}"]{.underline} Pelosi and
Schumer said in a statement. "[Democrats have already made
accommodations in the name of reaching an agreemen]{.underline}t, which
we are optimistic can happen soon." However[, some Republicans
reportedly prefer to revisit the legislation next year since they may
gain control of Congress after the midterm elections.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, any final bill would still require support from both
parties and the Biden administration. [The semiconductor funding has put
lawmakers under particular pressure to complete the bill, with some
leaders in the industry warning a delay could lead them to invest in
other countries that have already moved ahead with
incentives]{.underline}. President Biden has also made the case for
quick action on the legislation, arguing it has measures that will help
reduce supply chain disruptions that contribute to inflation. ["[Pass
the damn bill and send it to me," Biden said]{.mark} in
May.]{.underline} "It's going to help bring down prices, bring home
jobs, and power America's manufacturing comeback." Intel CEO Pat
Gelsinger testified at a March hearing on the case for semiconductor
industry subsidies. (Image credit -- Senate Commerce, Science, and
Transportation Committee) [[The semiconductor money would fund programs
authorized in the CHIPS for America Act]{.mark}, which Congress passed
in early 2021.]{.underline} Of the total, \$39 billion is for
manufacturing incentives and most of the remainder is for R&D
initiatives, with almost all the money channeled through the Commerce
Department. Backers of the CHIPS Act have also advocated for Congress to
create a tax credit specific to the semiconductor industry, but
lawmakers appear to have abandoned the idea of attaching it to the
compromise legislation to avoid complicating negotiations. The top
Republican for tax policy in the House, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), argued
at the conference kickoff meeting that the legislation should not
include tax provisions, especially any that favor a specific industry.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), a lead advocate of the semiconductor tax
credit, told FYI that he and Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) attempted to
include it in the original legislation. "We were told \[the credit\]
wasn\'t going to be feasible in the Senate when we passed the CHIPS Act,
and so we opted for the emergency spending. But I still think in the
long term it's going to take a reliable source of support, and that
probably means an investment tax credit, not just spending," he said.
Budget targets for science agencies up in the air [While the
semiconductor funding is among the most consequential aspects of the
bills, their [R&D]{.mark} policy sections [would also set ambitious
targets for ramping up selected federal science agency
budgets]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Actually meeting those targets
would still require Congress to supply the funding through the annual
appropriations process. Nearly three years ago, [Schumer first floated a
proposal to create a massive new directorate at the National Science
Foundation to drive progress in vanguard technologies such as artificial
intelligence and quantum computing, and he teamed up with Sen. Todd
Young (R-IN) to advance the idea legislatively]{.underline}. Senators
substantially revised the proposal as it progressed through the chamber,
paring back its spending goals for NSF, carving out large roles for the
Department of Energy and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and
attaching a broad policy update for NASA. [The bill the Senate
ultimately passed, USICA, recommends Congress ramp up NSF's annual
budget from its current level of \$8.8 billion to \$21.3 billion over
five years]{.underline}, with the technology directorate's annual budget
growing to \$9.3 billion. It also recommends DOE and DARPA each receive
about \$17 billion above their base budget over the same period for
complementary R&D on the technology areas funded by the new NSF
directorate. Meanwhile, [the House Science Committee disagreed with the
Senate focus on technology development and advanced a distinct vision
for the NSF directorate oriented around applying science to "societal
challenges" such as climate change, social inequality, and
cybersecurity.]{.underline} The committee also proposed Congress channel
extra funds into existing programs across NSF, the DOE Office of
Science, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And in
a further break with the Senate, it opted not to loop NASA into the
legislation. [The committee ultimately produced bipartisan legislation
that recommends Congress ramp up NSF's annual budget to nearly \$18
billion over five years, with the new directorate growing only to \$3.4
billion. O]{.underline}ver the same period it also recommends increasing
the Office of Science budget from \$7.5 billion to \$11.1 billion and
the NIST budget from about \$1 billion to almost \$1.8 billion. The
committee has argued its proposals reflect a deeper understanding of the
agencies' strengths and have broader support from science organizations
than the approach taken by USICA. But critics counter that the point of
the Senate legislation is to prioritize select technologies, and Young
has said he plans to stand firm on his vision for the NSF directorate.
[The House ultimately made the committee's legislation a central plank
of the COMPETES Act, which it passed in February on a party-line vote,
with Republicans primarily objecting to provisions not arising from the
Science Committee.]{.underline} Some senators have embraced aspects of
the House's vision, with leaders of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee introducing legislation for the DOE Office of
Science that hews closely to the Science Committee proposals. However,
it is unclear whether their proposals would displace the funding
recommendations for DOE in USICA or add to them, or how much support
they have among senators.

dmr

For all his many political struggles, President Joe **[Biden
is]{.underline}** quietly **[delivering on one of the
central]{.underline}** --- and most implausible --- **[promises of his
campaign: restoring a sense of]{.underline}** normalcy and
**[bipartisanship to the legislative process.]{.underline}** The latest
example is an apparent bipartisan deal on gun regulation, which finally
puts vague Republican rhetoric on school security and mental health into
action while also embracing modest Democratic proposals on such matters
as background checks and red-flag laws. The bill will probably not
dramatically alter the level of gun violence in the US. But it should do
some good, and re-establishes the idea that Congress can act in response
to dramatic events. Before the gun deal, of course, [**Biden worked with
Congress to deliver the kind of bipartisan infrastructure legislation
that both his predecessors only talked about**. There have also been
many more obscure bills, ranging from legislation changing the
regulation of ocean shipping to a major overhaul of the US
P]{.underline}ostal [S]{.underline}ervice. Bipartisan science funding
legislation has been languishing for months now, but that's due to
boring House-Senate disagreements that are being worked out by a
conference committee --- a process so old-school it had become basically
forgotten in Washington. [**Progress is** also **being made on
bipartisan bills** about such thorny issues as Chinese investment in US
companies and antitrust scrutiny of big technology
companies.]{.underline} Much of this work is happening through a process
I like to call the Secret Congress: Members quietly working together
while allowing the political press to focus on Hunter
**[Biden's]{.underline}** laptop, which books are in which school
libraries, the latest Marjorie Taylor Greene tweet or any of the million
other controversies that engage the body politic. The Secret Congress
dynamic, of course, is one reason why it's difficult for Biden to secure
credit for delivering on this promise. During Barack Obama's presidency,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was open about the fact that he
was reluctant for Republicans to engage constructively on any topic lest
the passage of bills come to reflect positively on an incumbent
president he hoped to defeat. Biden has a much lower public profile than
his recent predecessors. And while his **[team has been constructively
engaged on all these issues]{.underline}**, it's been a quiet form of
engagement that aims to be helpful without hogging the spotlight or
preventing the members themselves from owning the process. Conservative
firebrands found plenty of (real and fake) controversies with which to
fill the air and maintain a sense of combat even as they collaborated on
policy. Meanwhile, quite apart from Biden's efforts, there is the fact
that Donald Trump's presidency helped break down the doors of
ideological dogmatism on the right. Republicans don't talk about it much
these days, but the Trump administration's willingness --- led by
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin --- to work with House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the CARES Act is the
only reason the 2020 elections didn't turn into a party-destroying
landslide. A free-market approach that devastated consumer spending
power and led to liquidated many businesses would have ruined the
economy, ruined Trump's political standing, and driven the GOP into the
ground. Trump lack of ideological purity, and Democrats' willingness to
bargain in good faith, saved the economy and the Republican Party ---
and perhaps opened the doors to further rounds of creativity. Alas,
Biden has not had nearly such good fortune with his economic management.
The multiple inflationary shocks --- first a fiscal stimulus that spent
too much too quickly, then a central bank that was probably too slow to
react, then a war in Ukraine that's ravaged the supply side of the
global economy --- have wrecked Biden's public standing. When a
president is unpopular due to bad economic news, the public doesn't give
him credit for anything. And columnists of all stripes are wont to
criticize an unpopular leader. But the fact remains that **[important
elements of Biden's agenda have succeeded]{.underline}**, notably
including a Russia policy that has secured strong bipartisan and even
international support despite the economic cost. The cloak of
unpopularity, meanwhile, makes it even easier for bipartisanship to
continue. In his current state, [Biden is not politically threatening to
Republicans, so they have no reason to avoid collaborating on bills they
happen to like.]{.underline} A new proposal from Republican senators
Mitt Romney, Richard Burr and Steve Daines to consolidate and simplify
various family support programs in a way that would cut poverty and
reduce marriage penalties has earned some cautious praise from
Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and could be the basis for more
bipartisan work. At the end of the day, life as a legislator is more fun
if you get to legislate. **[Sheer exhaustion with the tedium of
obstruction has helped make Biden's approach work]{.underline}**.

portrayed as true. "We are addressing all aspects of election security,
given, of course, the midterm elections that are upon us, and the

Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee. [[Republican

[House [Republican leaders are calling on Congress to pass legislation
that would shut down]{.mark} a new Department of Homeland Security
working g[roup tasked with combatting disinformation]{.mark} [and block
federal funds from being used for similar activities]{.mark}. The Biden
administration has come under fire since Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas recently announced the creation of the
group]{.underline}, called the Disinformation Governance Board, because
opponents argue its purpose is vague. In response to the backlash, DHS
released a fact sheet last week about the group\'s goals, which it said
are to protect \"Americans\' freedom of speech, civil rights, civil
liberties, and privacy\" in the department\'s disinformation work.
Mayorkas said at a Senate hearing about his department\'s budget request
last week that DHS has worked over the last decade to prevent
disinformation from threatening the nation but that he thought there
weren\'t enough safeguards to ensure that its work doesn\'t infringe on
fundamental rights. \"And so we put together a working group to ensure
that the guide, guardrails, are in place, that we have clear
definitions, that we have good policies and practices in place, to
protect the very rights that also are our responsibility not to infringe
upon,\" he said. [House Minority Leader [Kevin McCarthy]{.mark},
R-Calif., said Wednesday that the group, which he d[ubbed]{.mark}
President Joe [Biden\'s \"ministry of truth,\" was an \"un-American
abuse of power]{.mark},\" and he accused Democrats of aiming to use the
group to \"manipulate the facts and discredit the truth when it\'s
inconvenient for their narrative]{.underline}.\" \"[It's a scheme
conjured up by Washington Democrats to grant themselves the authority to
control free speech,\" McCarthy said at a news conference calling for
the group\'s termination. \"T[hey fear Americans\' having unfettered
access to information because it will challenge the power that they want
to have]{.mark} over people's lives.\" McCarthy and other key GOP
lawmakers claimed that the administration wants to exploit the office
and manipulate information. They also accused the group\'s executive
director, Nina Jankowicz, of previously spreading
misinformation]{.underline}. Jankowicz was a disinformation fellow at
the Wilson Center, a public policy think tank, where she studied the
intersection of democracy and technology in Central and Eastern Europe.
When her appointment was announced late last month, she tweeted that she
would help shape the government\'s \"counter-disinformation efforts\"
and said \"a HUGE focus of our work, and indeed, one of the key reasons
the Board was established, is to maintain the Dept's commitment to
protecting free speech, privacy, civil rights, & civil liberties.\"
[[Rep. Lauren Boebert]{.mark}, R-Colo., who introduced the measure to
dismantle the group, [said]{.mark} Wednesday that \"[free speech is
under attack here in America]{.mark}\" and that it is part of the
administration\'s efforts \"to try to silence dissenting
voices.\"]{.underline} \"[[Misinformation has become a rallying cry for
the left to discredit facts that are inconvenient to their liberal
agenda,]{.mark}\" she said. \"The Russia collusion hoax, Hunter Biden's
laptop, the Covid lab leak theory were all labeled misinformation by big
tech until the truth finally prevailed.\"]{.underline} Boebert\'s bill
has no chance of coming up for a vote in House, where Democrats have a
majority. But Republicans could try to influence spending decisions,
including discussions about defunding the group, in debate on the next
government spending package. Separately[, 20 state attorneys general
sent a letter to Mayorkas last week threatening to take legal action
against DHS over the board if it isn\'t disbanded. The GOP group wrote
that "the existence of the Disinformation Governance Board will
inevitably have a chilling effect on free speech" and that "the
resulting damage to our political system and our culture will be
incalculable.]{.underline}

#### Republicans like disinformation -- they retaliate to any attempts to curb it

**Feinberg 22**
\[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/disinformation-board-dhs-republican-anger-b2073419.html\]//LP

[A]{.underline} longstanding [Department of Homeland Security [effort to
combat foreign disinformation has touched off outrage amount
Republicans]{.mark} who say the department is assembling an Orwellian
"ministry of truth,]{.underline}" but experts and former GOP insiders
say [the sturm-und-drang over the [DHS program shows how much the
Trump-era iteration of the Party of Lincoln has come to depend on lying
as a political strategy]{.mark} and therefore fears not being able to
count on their lies going unchallenged.]{.underline} Last week, Fox News
reporters began pressing White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki about a
news item, first reported by Politico, which stated that DHS was
standing up a "disinformation governance board" to counter foreign
disinformation and misinformation "related to homeland security," led by
ex-Wilson Center fellow Nina Jankowicz. Ms Jankowicz, who holds a
master's degree in Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies from
Georgetown University\'s School of Foreign Service, is a well-known
expert who has studied the nexus between democracy and technology and
how disinformation can undermine democracies, with a particular
specialisation in Central and Eastern Europe. [But the appointment of Ms
Jankowicz to helm DHS's anti-disinformation efforts touched off a a
geyser of grievance among Republican officeholders and their
conservative media allies, citing public statements she'd made
describing the October 2020 New York Post reporting on a laptop thought
to have belonged to Hunter Biden as a "Trump campaign product" and other
statements perceived to be at odds with conservative media narratives
regarding Mr Biden and Mr Trump.]{.underline} Though a 2 May fact sheet
released by DHS laid out the department's aims, including a focus on
"disinformation that threatens the security of the American people,
including disinformation spread by foreign states such as Russia, China,
and Iran, or other adversaries such as transnational criminal
organizations and human smuggling organizations," [[Republicans were
animated by the false belief that the Biden administration was
establishing some manner of universal arbiter of what is true and what
is not for political purposes.]{.mark}]{.underline} At a Wednesday
hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs
Committee, [Senator Rand Paul appeared to believe the DHS board would be
retroactively fact-checking news outlets, and asked Secretary Alejandro
Mayorkas if the board would have deemed the infamous dossier on Donald
Trump compiled by a former MI6 agent, Christopher Steele, to be "Russian
disinformation".]{.underline} After Mr Mayorkas explained the board's
function, to ensure \"guardrails, definitions," and "standards\" meant
to safeguard civil rights, privacy, and free speech, Mr Paul resumed his
complaints. \"[Here\'s the problem: [We can\'t even agree what
disinformation is.]{.mark} You can\'t even agree that it was
disinformation that the Russians fed information to the Steele
dossier,\" Mr Paul noted. \"I[f you can\'t agree to that, how are we
ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation]{.mark} so
you can police it on social media?\" The Kentucky senator said the
"greatest propagator of disinformation" in world history has been the US
government, and accused Mr Mayorkas of having "no idea what
disinformation is". \"You think the American people are so stupid they
need you to tell them what the truth is? You can\'t even admit what the
truth is with the Steele dossier. I don\'t trust government to figure
out what the truth is,\" he said.]{.underline} And on Thursday, [more
than 170 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed on to
a belligerent letter to Mr [Mayorkas calling the board
"problematic]{.mark}" and suggesting that "an organization charged with
securing the homeland engaging in anything that could have an impact on
speech" raises ethical concerns because, in their estimation, it "could
be utilized as a political tool under the guise of security". [The
Republican representatives added that the DHS efforts to combat
disinformation would take away from the department's "primary mission
sets,"]{.mark} including securing the US border.]{.underline} But Aaron
Reichlin-Melnick, a senior policy counsel at the American Immigration
Council, said combatting disinformation is a necessary aspect of the
department's core border security mission. Mr Reichlin-Melnick said
human traffickers and smuggling operations have long preyed upon
vulnerable people looking to come to the US through a variety of
disinformation streams, including social media and traditional media
advertising. "This is a bipartisan issue that has been something that
the Trump administration struggled with, the Obama administration
struggled with, and now the Biden administration is struggling with.
Many people arrive at the southern border with false ideas about what US
border policy looks like. That\'s because --- not surprisingly ---
people who are fleeing their home countries are not going on to Google
and checking for relevant US laws and policy before they leave," he
said. "People often receive their information about US border policy
through WhatsApp groups, through Facebook memes, and through TikToks and
other forms of social media that is often incorrect --- there is also
disinformation that is pushed out by migrant smugglers who are trying to
drum up demand for people to pay to leave their home countries and come
to the United States". He said a significant number of families who
arrived at the US-Mexico border during 2018 and 2019 --- at the height
of the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy that separated
parents from their children upon arrival --- "sincerely believed"
then-president Donald Trump had "passed a law allowing any migrant
families arriving at the border to be admitted into the United States".
"Of course, the idea that President Trump was a pro-migrant president is
absurd on its face, but many people arrived to the border truly,
honestly, believing that because they have been told so by smugglers,"
he said. [Yet the real-world consequences of foreign disinformation
don't seem to be an operative concern for many in conservative
media]{.underline}. According to Media Matters for America --- a liberal
group which monitors conservative news outlets including Fox News -- Fox
mentioned the DHS plan more in more than 100 weekday segments over the
last nine days, with prime time hosts such as Tucker Carlson describing
the effort in bizarre terms such as calling it Mr Biden's "Ministry of
Truth". Kayla Gogarty, a researcher with Media Matters, said GOP and
conservative media outrage over Ms Jankowicz and the DHS board is part
of a familiar pattern in which Fox programming and Republican
politicians stoke anger over some "shiny object". "[It\'s a lot of that
same fearmongering and misinformation that we see coming out of the
right," she explained. It\'s this one big ecosystem, with Fox News,
pushing it out to their large swath of audiences". Michael Steele, the
former Maryland Lieutenant Governor and Republican National Committee
chairman, told The Independent members of the Trump-era iteration of his
party tend to show "a particular sensitivity about disinformation"
because they themselves traffic in what he called "some of the most
profoundly corrosive disinformation there is".]{.underline} "When you
hear someone like Ron Johnson talking about how we should be afraid for
our liberty and our values? Yeah, we\'ve been listening to you for the
last few years and we are concerned --- that\'s why this was created,"
he said. Republicans in both the House and Senate have already vowed to
block DHS from spending any funds on combatting disinformation if they
take control of Congress next year. But Mr Steele said there's a better
way for members of his party to short-circuit the need for DHS to do
anything about disinformation. "If you want it to go away, you don\'t
need to cut the budget, you don\'t need to defund it --- just stop
lying," he said. ["[It's amazing to me, but this is how they twist the
narrative]{.mark}, and they wrap it in the flag and liberty and values.
And they\'re crapping on all of that".]{.underline}

### L Space Agreements 

#### Multilateral agreements over space are politically deadlocked -- 50 years of empirics prove secrecy and sovereignty concerns mean the plan drains pc

**Goguichvili et al. 21** \[Sophie Goguichvill is a Program Associate at

In an age where space is evolving and developing more rapidly than
intergovernmental organizations can keep up, it is abundantly clear that
the current global space governance framework---a product of the Cold
War---is no longer adequate. In its current state, the global space
governance framework excludes many space activities and allows actors to
operate under wide-ranging and often conflicting interpretations of
existing agreements. While there have been many attempts to improve the
governance framework, progress in this area has stagnated, in large part
due to diplomatic impasses between international actors and has
negatively impacted the sustainable development of space. Of the five
international agreements previously mentioned, the Outer Space Treaty
(1967), Rescue Agreement (1968), the Liability Convention (1972), and
the Registration Conventions (1974) require substantial clarification in
order to apply many of their principles to new space activities and
issues, such as satellite servicing, space traffic management, tourism,
or space debris mitigation. The Moon Treaty (1979) has too few
signatories to be effective altogether. [Although countries have
attempted to improve or complement these agreements over the years, no
new multilateral agreements have been produced since the 1970s. In their
place, non-binding norms have emerged in large part due to the ease by
which they can be created and set into effect, however effective or
ineffective they may be.]{.underline} [Often slow to action, limited in
authority, and bogged down by political deadlock,]{.underline}
international bodies like COPUOS---and more indirectly, UNOOSA---which
were established to advance global space governance, [are failing to
further their mission.]{.underline} While this has not dissuaded
spacefaring nations from proposing new multilateral policies addressing
evolving uses of space through international fora, important
technological advancements---such as the rapid advancement of the
commercial space sector---are often overlooked. This raises concerns,
namely because private entities are not bound by the Outer Space Treaty
or any of the other agreements. Another obstacle of note is that
different States have different priorities when it comes to transparency
and confidence building measures (TCBMs) and often, competing economic
and military interests tend to stall those efforts. Satellite over

passive support from various states and private actors on nonbinding
agreements---such as the UNGA principles as well as the Code of Conduct
for Outer Space Activities---will not hold in the long-run]{.underline}.
One thing is clear: multilateral efforts have not proven completely
effective, and more is needed to provide order as new space interests
are pursued. In response to recent failures to advance international
agreements, the development of national space policies is on the rise.
Take the U.S., for example, whose concerted government-wide efforts to
refocus its attention on space led to the creation of a new National
Space Policy, as well as a series of Space Policy Directives, which
outline and provide rules of the road for American space activities in
the wake of pressing international challenges. These documents cover our
human space exploration program (SPD-1); commercial space regulations
(SPD-2); national space traffic management (SPD-3); the creation of the
Space Force (SPD-4); cybersecurity in space (SPD-5); and space nuclear
power and propulsion (SPD-6). With the addition of the U.S.-led Artemis
Accords, these documents taken together are a means to establishing
modern customary international law and norms of behavior beyond the Cold
War-era provisions of the foundational U.N. space treaties. The growth
of the commercial space sector has proven to be the single development
related to space since the groundwork of international space governance
was laid in the 1960s and 1970s. This has by and large contributed to
commercial interests receiving greater prioritization as new national
policies are developed. Although prioritized less than national security
(i.e., military) or civil (i.e., science and exploration) space policy,
commercial space has begun to emerge as a third component in national
space policy strategies. [The preference to develop domestic policies
over international agreements reflects both the emerging value of
commercial space and the stagnation of international space
governance]{.underline}. The U.S. and Russia stand apart from other
nations, as they have the most robust set of national laws and
regulatory organizations designed with international space commitments
in mind. But among the 28 nations with domestic space policies, there is
little policy convergence. States' decisions to develop unilateral space
policies with little concern for international cooperation is creating
more limitations than benefits. Failing to cooperate only aggravates
existing policy confusion, stalling the development of commercial space
activities. Prominent examples include satellite servicing operations
and space traffic management, both of which hold significant economic
value but cannot be fully developed without improved cooperation due to
their need for shared norms and best practices, much in the same way
civil aviation could not function effectively if states did not agree on
norms and best practices for air traffic control or flight safety. As a
global commons, if the goal is to take advantage fully of the economic
value of near-Earth space, then unilateral national policies cannot
replace international agreements. Current trends suggest that the number
of space actors and their interests will increase over the coming years.
Consequently, competition over the utilization of space will likely
expand and intensify with more actors pursuing their interests and
disagreements becoming more common. Current international space
governance will not be able to handle the changing nature of space
development. New governance, structured differently, is needed. Next
Steps for Responsible Space Governance Space has unquestionably
undergone some significant changes since the turn of the century and
therefore, so has its threat landscape. Although space was once seen as
a peaceful sanctuary for scientific purposes, it has become the new
playing arena for great power competition between the U.S., Russia, and
China. Besides the superpowers, there are now a greater number of
nations and non-state actors partaking in space activities and the role
of commercial actors in space is becoming more considerable by the day.
Although the privatization of space has so-far proven to be primarily a
Western phenomenon, nations around the world are beginning to adopt the
public-private partnership model and will continue to follow suit. As
such, since an increasingly democratized and more accessible space will
inevitably bring with it more man-made threats and challenges to space
sustainability, the current system of space governance will need to be
strengthened to effectively deal with near-future challenges. [The
process of developing new rules of the road in space has been
complicated by the rapid proliferation of space technology among novel
actors.]{.underline} Throughout the Cold War era, when technology was in
the hands of few states, reaching consensus on treaties was much easier
due to a shared interest by the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council to control the spread of technology. Today, the same
technologies that were in the hands of a select few are in the hands of
dozens of countries. As such, there is less incentive to collaborate on
amending or updating Cold War era provisions, which has led to gridlock
in the international bodies originally established to advance global
space governance. [In the absence of multilateral consensus on managing
space activities]{.underline} through intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs), namely the U.N., and specialized international fora stemming
from the U.N. (i.e. UNOOSA, UNCOPUOS, and the CD), non-state actors
[have played an increasingly influential role in the development of
space law. Currently, the international space law regime gives legal
authority to regulate and manage space activities to nation states, not
international bodies]{.underline}, through Article VI of the Outer Space
Treaty. International bodies---such as UNCOPUOS---play a critical role
in establishing standards and facilitating coordination, but the
licensing and enforcement of those standards is at the national level.
Non-state actors\' successful contributions to global space governance
are directly correlated to the broader trend of a strained multilateral
order where international norms, standards, and voluntary (or
non-binding) agreements are preferred over legally binding treaties. The
declining ability of IGOs to create widely accepted treaties and
agreements that effectively manage space activities consequently means
that non-space faring nations are losing what little access they already
had to shaping space governance. Hence, it is no surprise that
successful governance through the paragon of space law---legally binding
and verifiable measures---has become impossible to achieve in the
current international political climate. [States today have shifted
their attention to creating norms through voluntary, non-legal measures
with the goal of achieving mutual understanding and reducing suspicion,
competition, rivalry between states bypassing international legal bodies
altogether.]{.underline} For space governance to continue being
successful, states must think through modern challenges creatively and
collaboratively---in the long-run, strictly bilateral agreements,
national policies, and passive support on non-binding agreements will
not be sufficient. [It is important to note that ineffective and
outdated multilateral treaties and agreements are not obstacles unique
to global space governance alone, but rather, global governance and
multilateralism more broadly.]{.underline}

A group of House [[Democrats introduced a bill]{.underline}]{.mark}
Wednesday to abolish the nation's newest armed service, [[eliminating
the Space Force]{.mark}]{.underline} and giving the Air Force its
responsibilities. Backed by five members of the House Progressive

of California's Bay Area. "[[Our mission must be to support the American
people, not spend billions on the militarization of
space]{.mark}."]{.underline} The move, trumpeted in a news release,
comes amid increasingly rancorous budget negotiations between Democrats
and Republicans in the Senate[. Republicans have threatened to thwart
Democratic efforts to raise the government\'s debt limit and tie up a
Democrat-backed spending plan that\'s required to avert a shutdown of
federal agencies on Oct. 1.]{.underline} Colorado Springs Republican
U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn bristled at the introduction of the bill to kill
the Space Force, which came after it was rejected as an amendment to a
wider Pentagon measure. "This is an frivolous bill that has no hope of
passing,\" Lamborn said in an email. \"The creation of the Space Force
was a bipartisan effort from the beginning. This reorganization of our
national security space enterprise resulted from the belated recognition
of space as a warfighting domain and the increasing threat to critical
space assets posed by our near-peer competitors.\" House Armed Services
Committee votes to postpone Space Command's move from Colorado Springs
The measure would have to gain traction to pass the House, where the
Space Force has had support from both sides of the aisle. Even if the
House backed it, the measure would face almost certain defeat in the
Senate, where Democrats hold control by the narrowest of margins and the
space service has had bipartisan backing. The bill to kill Space Force
is co-sponsored by U.S. Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.; Rashida Tlaib,
D-Mich.; Marc Pocan, D-Wisc.; and Chuy Garcia, D-Ill. [The Space Force,
approaching its second birthday, was created amid rising tensions in
orbit between America, Russia and China]{.underline}. Pushed by
President Donald Trump, the new service was intended to give space
troops a seat in high level discussions of U.S. war plans while giving
missions in orbit more prominence in budget discussions. Analysis: After

four Space Force installation, Colorado is home to bulk of the new
service\'s troops and its key capabilities. At Colorado bases, Space
Force troops, dubbed guardians in Pentagon lingo, operate almost all of
the Pentagon\'s spacecraft, including the Global Positioning System and
missile warning satellites. This week at an Air Force Association
conference, the Space Force\'s top general said the service is working
to prevent war from reaching orbit rather than fighting battles beyond
Earth\'s atmosphere. "I am convinced that if we can protect our critical
capabilities and deny an aggressor benefit, or impose a cost they cannot
bear, we may prevent war for extending to other domains," Raymond told
the conference. The new service, which falls under the Department of the
Air Force, will eventually include an estimated 1,300 troops. Unlike the
Air Force, Navy and Army, the Space Force doesn\'t include troops in
supporting roles. The service relies on the Air Force for jobs including
cooks, cops, lawyers and medics. In a departure from the partisan
battles common on Capitol Hill in recent months, Lamborn said most
lawmakers from both parties have backed the the new service. \"Most
Democrats don't want to abolish the Space Force, as the Biden
administration has endorsed our newest service, and congressional
Democrats on the Rules Committee rejected this bill as an amendment to
the Nation Defense Authorization Act,\" Lamborn said. \"I continue to be

On Wednesday, California [[Democratic Rep.]{.mark} Jared Huffman f[iled
a bill to abolish the U.S. Space Force, which he describes as
"flagrantly" wasteful.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Space Force was
established by former President Donald Trump in 2019. Though it is the
smallest branch of the Armed Forces, [[it's been widely slammed by
progressives for h]{.mark}aving 16,000 personnel and [costing billions
of dollars a year]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Huffman's No Militarization of
Space Act would axe the Space Force completely. "[The long-standing
neutrality of space has fostered a competitive, non-militarized age of
exploration]{.mark} every nation and generation has valued since the
first days of space travel. But since its creation under the former
Trump administration, the Space Force has threatened longstanding peace
and flagrantly wasted billions of taxpayer dollars," Huffman said in a
statement. "Our mission must be to support the American people, not
spend billions on the militarization of space," Huffman
continued,]{.underline} saying that money going toward the Space Force
would be better spent fighting the climate crisis, COVID-19 and
inequality in the U.S. Representatives Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), Mark
Pocan (D-Wisconsin), Jesús "Chuy" García (D-Illinois) and Maxine Waters
(D-California) joined Huffman in introducing the bill. [Before President
Joe Biden was inaugurated, [progressive lawmakers wrote a letter to the
incoming administration asking officials to eliminate the Space
Force]{.mark}, criticizing its formation for being unnecessary and for
further militarizing the U.S, which is already immersed in a culture of
endless war. "Maybe, just maybe, we should make sure our people are not
dying because they lack health insurance before we start spending
billions to militarize outer space," wrote Sen. Bernie Sanders
(I-Vermont) in 2018. The Space Force is tasked with gathering military
intelligence from space]{.underline} and monitoring and transmitting GPS
signals from satellites --- but although the force has now been in
existence for over a year, its function is not exactly clear as yet. In
2018, retired astronaut Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) pointed out that the
U.S. already had an arm of the military serving the same purpose as the
Space Force: the Air Force Space Command, which was reorganized and
reformed into its own branch. A press release on [[the Huffman bill says
that the formation of a separate Space Force "creat\[ed\] bureaucratic
confusion and further waste]{.mark}." The branch received \$15.4 billion
in funding for the fiscal year 2021, though it was taken from the Air
Force budget. The bill directs the Space Force to be reabsorbed into the
Air Force. Critics worry that the Space Force's existence as its own
separate entity will eventually lead to further funding for the Defense
Department. "Militarizing space is an unconscionable waste of billions
of tax dollars, and it risks extending the worst mistakes of history to
the final frontier by inviting conflict and escalation," said Sean
Vitka, senior policy counsel for Demand Progress. "[Americans don't want
more wasteful military spending]{.mark}, which means Congress should
pass the No Militarization of Space Act before the Space Force budget
inevitably skyrockets."]{.underline} Political experts have speculated
that it is unlikely Biden will support getting rid of the military
branch, which has bipartisan approval. Meanwhile, Congress this week is
set to authorize the largest budget the Pentagon has ever seen.

[Space Force]{.underline} The Trump administration has said it wants the
establishment of a "Space Force" included in next year's defense policy
bill. That position has contributed to increasingly diverging opinions
between House and Senate lawmakers. [Republicans in the Senate --- who
were initially skeptical of creating a separate branch of the military
for space --- have appeared more open to the idea since Trump got
involved.]{.underline} Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman James
Inhofe (R-Okla.), a Trump ally who will keep the gavel in the next
Congress, has said he has an open mind but is awaiting more cost
details. The Senate may lose one of its most vocal Space Force critics,
albeit on the Democratic side. Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), who led the
chamber's opposition to a similar plan from the House last year, is
fighting for his political life in a reelection race that appears headed
toward a recount. Meanwhile, [[Democrats in the House have grown more
entrenched in their opposition to Space Force]{.mark} ever since Trump
injected himself into the debate. Smith, who supported the House's space
corps plan last year, came out against Space Force in September. He said
that while he believes the military needs to do a better job of
prioritizing its presence in space, a separate branch is not the most
cost-effective way to do so.]{.underline} Space Force still has some key
Democratic support in the House. Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), who worked
alongside Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) to lead the chamber's space corps
push, said in September that he hopes Trump's involvement doesn't "ruin
the debate" about it. [[Smith has said this year's defense budget of
\$716 billion is "too high,]{.mark}" and in a Thursday letter announcing
his run for chairman he vowed to target "inefficiency and waste" at the
Pentagon. [The Washington Democrat has argued that lawmakers need to
start making tough choices]{.mark}]{.underline} about spending and
taxing as rising deficits have been compounded by the GOP's 2017 tax-cut
law. [Defense hawks and the Pentagon pushed for the \$716 billion to
help address what they characterized as an urgent readiness crisis. Few
Democrats argue that the military is not facing readiness
issues,]{.underline} but Smith has said the military needs to be "smart"
about how it spends its money. He has cited the Navy's 355-ship goal,
saying the focus on a number is flawed logic because "capability
matters." Senate Republicans argue that defense cuts would reverse any
readiness progress that's been achieved. They say the budget needs to
continue the growth trend from the past two years in order to fully
emerge from the readiness hole. Asked by The Hill in October about the
potential House-Senate split and the looming return of budget caps,
Inhofe expressed confidence that the defense budget would at least stay
flat. "[[We have to catch up," Inhofe said.]{.mark} "We have to keep
that up, or all that we have done in catching up in those last two
fiscal years will go out the window. So that's not just going to
happen."]{.underline} But in this case, Democrats may actually have an
ally in Trump, who recently ordered his administration to propose a
\$700 billion defense budget for fiscal year 2020 --- a \$16 billion cut
from this year and \$33 billion less than the initial plan for 2020.

[The House Appropriations Committee says it will not support DoD's
\$72.4 million request to establish a Space Force headquarters, and
wants the Pentagon to study alternative options.]{.underline} The
committee is scheduled to mark up the defense bill on Tuesday. The draft
report accompanying the committee's proposed fiscal year 2020 defense
spending bill notes that the decision to not back the \$72 million
request should not be read as a complete rejection of the idea of
establishing a Space Force. "[The Committee recommendation does not
fully fund the request]{.underline} to establish the proposed Space
Force," says the draft report obtained by SpaceNews. "[The Committee
makes this decision without prejudice and includes funds for the
Department to examine and refine alternative organizational
options]{.underline} that will streamline the management and
decision-making process [and minimize overhead cost and
bureaucracy."]{.underline} The House and Senate Armed Services
Committees are reviewing the administration's Space Force legislative
proposal and considering whether to authorize the new service in the
2020 National Defense Authorization Act. Appropriators are not policy
makers. Only the HASC and SASC can authorize DoD to establish a new
military service. [But it's up to the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees to fund the new branch and decide how much. Defense officials
have said they estimate the Space Force will cost no more than \$2
billion over five years but have not provided detailed analysis to back
that up, according to congressional officials.]{.underline} The Senate
Armed Services Committee has done due diligence and directed the
Congressional Budget Office to analyze the future costs of the Space
Force, U.S. Space Command and the Space Development Agency. The CBO in a
report laid out a number of scenarios. On the Space Force, it projects
costs significantly higher than \$2 billion over five years. The
Pentagon has challenged those estimates. [DoD has proposed legislation
to establish the Space Force as a separate service within the Department
of the Air Force, with an Undersecretary for Space and a Chief of Staff
for Space. "While the Committee appreciates the intent of the proposal,
the plan leaves many unanswered questions and lacks important details
and supporting analysis to justify the proposed size, scope, cost,
roles, and authorities for the new military service."]{.underline}
Appropriators say in the draft report that they support DoD efforts to
advance the military's space capabilities but are not convinced that
requires setting up a new military branch. "The Committee is very
concerned with the rapid advances potential adversaries are making to
develop capabilities that threaten United States space assets on orbit,"
the report says. The committee "understands that this is an urgent
problem that will require the Department to reorient its strategies,
organizational constructs, and program priorities to meet the reality of
these threats." However, the report notes that it is "fully within the
Department's current authority to make space a higher priority without
creating a new military service and is not persuaded that the specific
plan proposed justifies the additional overhead cost and disruption
across the Department." The HAC's defense subcommittee last week agreed
to give DoD \$15 million to further study how a space service could be
organized. Space policy analyst Marcia Smith noted that the House
Appropriations defense bill is moving faster than HASC action on the
NDAA, which is creating "a bit of confusion regarding the status of the
Space Force debate." [The defense subcommittee could have approved the
\$72.4 million request contingent upon the passage of authorization
legislation, but it did not, Smith wrote. "Their action is viewed as
lukewarm support for the idea, at best."]{.underline} Other
space-related provisions National security space launch --- The House
Appropriations Committee in the draft report commends the Air Force for
its launch procurement strategy to increase competition and eliminating
its reliance on Russian rocket engines. ["The national security space
launch program is going through a critical transition as it phases out
legacy launch systems and considers a variety of new and upgraded
rockets to meet the full slate of national security mission
requirements," the report says. The committee also said it is concerned
with the "significant level of technical and programmatic risk this
transition entails, including risk of a potential gap if any of the new,
unproven rockets develop problems or experience setbacks]{.underline}."
Appropriators agreed to fully fund the Air Force's request for the
National Security Space Launch program and "urges the Secretary of the
Air Force to proceed expeditiously with its strategy in order to
minimize the risk of a gap in assured access to space." Satellite
communications --- The draft report calls for a restructuring the
military's satellite communications programs. "The current military
satellite communications architecture comprises independently designed,
purpose-built spacecraft; ground systems; and user terminals intended to
meet differing mission requirements for strategic, wideband, and
narrowband communications," says the report. In fiscal year 2019, the
Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were tasked with developing
an integrated architecture and acquisition strategy for wideband and
narrowband communications and were directed to consider both government
and commercial systems, user terminals, and network capabilities. The
committee encourages the Secretaries of the Navy and the Air Force to
consider transferring responsibility for future narrowband satellite
communications systems from the Navy to the Air Force to help create an
integrated communications architecture. [Missile warning satellites ---
Appropriators question the strategy for the Next Generation Overhead
Persistent Infrared (OPIR) program. The 2020 budget seeks nearly \$1.4
billion, an increase of \$752 million above the 2019 enacted level. The
committee cut DoD's request by \$201 million.]{.underline} It agrees
with DoD that there is an "urgent need to field a more resilient
capability against growing space threats[." But in the report they raise
flags about the "rapid budget growth and the Air Force strategy of
relying on significant reprogramming requests to keep the program on
schedule." The committee questions whether the use of fast-prototyping
authorities given to DoD under Section 804 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 is appropriate for this program.
The committee also asked DoD to provide a long-term strategy for missile
defense and hypersonic defense.]{.underline} The committee "views the
current Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Block O program as
an important interim step to a currently undefined, but much needed,
future comprehensive OPIR architecture," the report said. It included a
legislative provision requiring the Space Development Agency and the Air
Force to lay out a plan to develop a "unified and integrated space
architecture."

[Houston, the Pentagon's new space acquisition agency may have a
problem. In its proposed funding bill for fiscal 2020, House defense
appropriators are seeking to cut off funding for the Space Development
Agency]{.underline} until the Defense Department meets several
conditions. While the legislation still has a long way to go before it
becomes law, [it could spell trouble for the newly established SDA ---
especially if Senate lawmakers raise similar objections.]{.underline}
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan signed off on the SDA in
March. The agency is supposed to be a fast acquisition arm for emerging
space capabilities that may not have a validated requirement, and its
first task is to field a layer of low-Earth orbit satellites capable of
transferring data among the military's terrestrial and space assets.
However, [critics have contended that SDA's purpose has not been defined
clearly enough, a position that House defense appropriators seem to find
valid.]{.underline} [The bill stipulates that no funding can be spent on
the organization]{.underline} until the Defense Department submits a
detailed plan to establish the SDA, [what projects it will take on over
the next three years and how much funding will be required for those
efforts. It also wants information about how SDA and the Air Force will
collaborate on a holistic space architecture]{.underline}, and the
process both organizations will use to guide prototyping efforts into
fully fledged programs. Lawmakers also want to know where the SDA will
be based and how many personnel will staff it --- a prospect that could
bring local jobs, a boon to any member of Congress --- as well as a plan
to transfer SDA from the Defense Department to the Air Force or Space
Force by the end of FY22. [The bill echoes concerns raised by Air Force
Secretary Heather Wilson, who has vocally opposed the creation of SDA.
In February, she told reporters that she didn't understand why a new
space acquisition agency was needed, given the establishment of the
Space Rapid Capabilities Office and the Air Force's own work to make the
Space and Missile Systems Center more efficient.]{.underline} Even as
Shanahan pressed forward with the establishment of SDA, naming Fred
Kennedy as head of the organization, Wilson continued to speak out
against it. "Let me be clear: The United States Air Force is funding the
development of low-Earth orbit systems and commercially based systems
for some of our missions," Wilson told the audience at the Space
Symposium in April. "But launching hundreds of cheap satellites into
theater as a substitute for the complex architectures where we provide
key capabilities to the war fighter will result in failure on America's
worst day if relied upon alone." While [the House appropriations bill
can be seen as a modest victory for Wilson]{.underline}, it may be a
Pyrrhic one: [It also orders that funding the Air Force's next
generation of missile warning satellites be cut by half]{.underline}
until the Defense Department meets its requirement to supply more
information about SDA. The service's next-generation Overhead Persistent
Infrared program has been touted by the Air Force for its rapid
approach. In fact, the service is seeking \$632 million in FY19 because
the program is moving so quickly that it has met milestones quicker than
expected and needs more money to continue prototyping the sensor
payload, its acquisition executive Will Roper said in April. [House
appropriators' desire to put limits on the next-gen OPIR could stem from
worries about whether that constellation may be too similar to one of
the systems that the Space Development Agency intends to
field.]{.underline} After fielding the initial "transfer layer" of
low-Earth orbit satellites meant to augment the department's data
transfer capabilities, the SDA plans to launch a "tracking layer" of
missile warning satellites, SDA head Kennedy said last month. Kennedy
also suggested that the next-gen OPIR could be changed or reduced in
scope if the tracking layer was successful. "Rather than wait to 2025"
to get the next-gen OPIR in orbit, "what I'm arguing is that we try to
put up some form of capability in 2022 and show that we can do it. We
may not have perfect global coverage, but we'll have some level of
coverage --- at least regionally --- addressing most of that threat," he
said.

[An early December government shutdown is a real possibility, since a
divided Congress can't agree on military spending]{.underline},
Democrats insist on help for young immigrants and President Donald
Trump's position can change with each lawmaker he talks to. Most of
Washington is focused on overhauling the nation's tax code, but
lawmakers face a combustible mix of must-do and could-do items, with the
current government spending bill set to expire Dec. 8. On the list are
immigration and a U.S.-Mexico border wall; an impasse over children's
health care; pent-up demand for budget increases for the Pentagon and
domestic agencies; and tens of billions of dollars in hurricane aid.
[There's plenty at stake for Republicans]{.underline} controlling
Washington. Politically, there's an urgency to avoid a debilitating
shutdown just as the GOP hopes to wrap up an overhaul of the tax code
that's its top priority. [And legions of GOP defense hawks are adamant
that the Pentagon receive a huge 2018 budget hike approaching \$80-90
billion.]{.underline} Trump and many followers want the U.S.-Mexico
wall. [Democrats retain considerable power in the endgame --- their
votes are needed --- and are pressing demands of their own]{.underline}.
They want protections for immigrants who were brought to the U.S.
illegally as young children. They also demand budget increases for
domestic agencies. "I think we're headed in a good direction on the
spending caps," Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said Monday. "I don't know that
will get to immigration this year but that's a pretty easy thing to
settle if the Democrats will give the president some of what he wants. I
think he would be willing to be pretty forward-leaning on kids who were
brought to the country illegally." For his part, Trump tends to waver
depending on the situation --- siding with Democrats on a debt deal in
September, promising Republicans last week that the controversial
immigration issue won't be part of the year-end spending measure.
Meanwhile, the tax debate is taking up energy, time and political
capital, and GOP leaders seem reluctant to issue controversial decisions
that might harm its chances. Here's a rundown of non-tax issues facing
Congress and Trump [Ideally, top leaders in both parties would like to
agree on new spending levels]{.underline} and pass a catchall bill by
the Dec. 8 deadline. [That's looking increasingly unlikely]{.underline}.
Another temporary funding bill would be needed to avert a government
shutdown, but many Democrats say they won't be able to support any
measure that doesn't include help for so-called "Dreamer" immigrants
facing deportation. That increases the odds of a shutdown.
[Congressional leaders are conducting secret talks on raising the
spending levels and say they are optimistic of a deal. B]{.underline}ut
there's no sign of one yet. A possible agreement could add perhaps \$100
billion to the budget for the current year alone, which is sure to cause
sticker shock among the GOP's fiscal conservatives. Trump's demands for
the border wall --- a nonstarter with Democrats --- could spark a
shutdown battle. Then there's aid to areas devastated by Hurricanes
Harvey, Irma and Maria. The White House promises to submit a request
later this month for "several tens of billions of dollars" aimed mostly
at helping Texas and Florida. That's likely to bring the total
appropriated since September for hurricane relief to more than \$100
billion, which is likely to rankle deficit hawks. House and Senate
negotiators are putting the final touches on an annual defense policy
bill for the 2018 fiscal year that's expected to increase the Pentagon's
core budget by billions of dollars more than the \$603 billion Trump
requested. There's some urgency to the talks since Senate Armed Services
Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., is battling an aggressive form of brain
cancer. The defense policy bill is expected to expand U.S. missile
defenses in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear weapons
programs. [Lawmakers also are trying to resolve a long simmering debate
over the creation of a new branch that would be in charge of the U.S.
military's space assets.]{.underline}

### I/L PC Key -- Issue Specific

"Biden needs an easy win: House Dems should pass the America Competes
Act now" July 7, 2022
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3548678-biden-needs-an-easy-win-house-dems-should-pass-the-america-competes-act-now/

In case you missed it, a bill totaling \$52 billion to bolster America's
dominance in technology that passed the Senate overwhelmingly one year
ago is now in danger of dying in Congress. It is not one more story
about Republican obstructionism. Rather, it is about Democrats in the
House of Representatives adding a series of pet projects to a bill that
would otherwise have passed by now. Their actions and the attempt to
resurrect parts of the Build Back Better program have caused
Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to
have second thoughts. As William Gaston notes in a Wall Street Journal
commentary, the original version, called the Endless Frontier Act, was
drafted in May 2020. The main objective was to bolster domestic
production of semiconductor chips and to boost federal support for
applied research in technology. While nothing happened during the 2020
elections, an amended version passed the Senate in May 2021 by a 68-32
vote, with 19 Republicans including McConnell voting for it. Thereafter,
the bill languished in the House of Representatives for nine months
before being passed as the America Competes Act in February 2022 along
partisan lines. Since then, it has been difficult to narrow differences
between the Senate and House versions. So, why is it important that a
bipartisan deal be struck? One reason is the importance of improving
U.S. technology prowess from an economic perspective. The information
technology sector represents over 9 percent of U.S. GDP. It's the fourth
largest sector, behind real estate, government and manufacturing.
Moreover, it has been a key engine of economic growth and leads the
global landscape in innovation, as highlighted in a 2019 report by the
Brookings Institution. Meanwhile, China's over-arching goal is to
overtake the U.S. economy as it transitions from reliance on
manufacturing to increased emphasis on developing its technology sector.
And even though Chinese President Xi Jinping has made a series of
mistakes on the regulatory front that may hinder its objective, the
Chinese government is likely to marshal resources to promote it. Another
consideration is national security: Over the past three decades U.S.
production of computer chips has fallen from about 40 percent of global
production to 10 percent. And despite the U.S. being a leader in chip
design and research, President [Biden has conceded "we don't have the
ability to make the most advanced chips now -- right now."]{.underline}
Today, 75 percent of production originates in East Asia, and 90 percent
of the most advanced chips are made in Taiwan. The authors of a report
by the Center for a New American Security contend that the U.S. is
already more dependent on Taiwan's high-end microchips than it was on
Middle Eastern oil in decades past. In their view, it has the potential
at some point to incite a U.S.-China conflict. Meanwhile, the urgency of
improving domestic capabilities in domestic production of computer chips
has been highlighted by ongoing supply-chain disruptions associated with
the COVID-19 pandemic. One year ago, U.S. officials were confident that
the worst was over. But there is still no indication this is happening:
PBS recently reported that new U.S. car sales plummeted by 21 percent in
the second quarter over a year ago owing to shortages of computer chips,
which have also driven up prices of new and used autos. On several
occasions this year, Biden has singled out Intel for committing to build
a fabricating plant in Ohio that would develop state of the art
chip-making technology. In January, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the
company would invest up to \$100 billion to build the world's largest
chip-making complex if it could be assured of receiving some federal
support. But with the legislation now up in the air, Intel has since
indicated that it is considering delaying its initial \$20 billion
investment, which was slated to be launched this month. Amid these
developments**[, Biden has urged Congress to "Pass the damn bill and
send it to me.]{.underline}**" However, as David Ignatius observes,
Biden appears unwilling to "crack some heads" to get the job done: "You
can't fix everything in our messed-up country. But you can deliver on
your promise to create good high-tech jobs in the semiconductor industry
and compete with China for the strategic high ground." The impasse over
the semiconductor legislation is emblematic of a larger issue. Namely,
Biden's legislative agenda has sought to enact the most sweeping social
programs since LBJ's Great Society when Democrats control both house of
Congress by the narrowest of margins. One would hope that Biden and
progressive Democrats would have learned by now that the way to produce
tangible results is to narrow the focus of bills they consider. Indeed,
[the major economic accomplishment of the Biden administration was the
recasting of the infrastructure bill to gain bipartisan support. Now it
has an opportunity to demonstrate how the federal government can play a
role in enhancing U.S. technology prowess by helping to develop state of
the art manufacturing capability. If this isn't clear to progressive
Democrats, Biden should tell them in no uncertain terms that he wants
the America Competes Act to be passed without further
delay]{.underline}.

As has been well-publicized, on July 9, 2021, President
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** issued an "Executive Order on Promoting
Competition in the American Economy" (the "EO" or "Order").1 As the
preamble articulates, the EO**[['s]{.underline}]{.mark}** focus is to
"promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers."
The lengthy and detailed Order is sweeping in its breadth, **[[aiming to
enhance competition]{.mark} across dozens of industries]{.underline}**,
[and sets fort]{.underline}h federal agency-[specific instructions as to
how particular goals should be carried out]{.underline}. A Rallying Cry
to the "Whole-of-Government" The EO seeks to harness the coordinated
power of the full federal government, emphasizing "that a
whole-of-government approach is necessary to address" competition
concerns in the U.S. economy.2 To that end, the Order establishes a
White House Competition Council, to be led by the Director of the
National Economic Council ("NEC").3 An integral part of the Office of
White House Policy, the general bailiwick of the NEC is to advise the
president on economic policy matters. By embedding the new council
within the White House, President **[[Biden is sending the strong
message that competition is a focus area over which he intends to keep
close tabs and invest his personal political
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Biden's negotiating experience and PC are key. Now is key

[[Biden]{.underline} [ran on his **long experience** in the Senate
and]{.underline}]{.mark} his belief that **[[he could make]{.mark} the
[Congress work again]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[He was able to pass
significant legislation on infrastructure with bipartisan support,
and]{.mark} he **[could]{.mark}** **[burnish his record with
the]{.mark}**]{.underline} U.S. Innovation and Competition Act
(**[[USICA]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [[It passed the
Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} in June (68 to 32) [[but has been
languishing in the House]{.underline}]{.mark} along with the Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act (CHIPS),
which is a component of the broader bill, USICA. Republicans and
Democrats love this legislation because it stands up to China and it
establishes new semiconductor facilities in the United States, along
with a National Semiconductor Technology Center. Anybody paying
attention to the supply chain crises knows there's a crippling shortage
of semiconductors. An analysis by Goldman Sachs found 169 industries are
affected, with automobiles and electronics hit the hardest. This
legislation could have passed and been signed by Biden six months ago,
alleviating some of the supply chain issues that the administration is
grappling with today. There's still no timetable for passage, and no
apparent rush by the House, where the leadership indicated it wanted to
write its own bill as opposed to accepting what was sent over by the
Senate. Back in the spring of 2021 when the CHIPS Act sailed through the
Senate with 68 votes, everything seemed possible to achieve. "The mood
was the sky's the limit, and to some extent the administration got
caught up in that," says Bill Galston, a senior fellow in governance
studies at The Brookings Institution. "After their stunning early
victory with the American Rescue Plan, the administration may have
concluded the force was with them --- and so they outran their political
supply lines." This always happens, says Third Way's Matt Bennett.
"Presidents' reach far exceeds their grasp. It happened to Clinton on
health care, Obama on cap and trade (carbon tax) and Biden on voting
rights, George W. Bush on privatizing social security and Trump on
getting rid of the ACA (Affordable Care Act). [[Presidents]{.mark}
always [try for the moon, and]{.mark} they [often fall
short]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's not unusual, not surprising, and

### I/L PC Key -- Committee Action

#### PC is key to influence [committee]{.underline} outcomes

[[Considering]{.mark} that [roll-call votes]{.mark} ultimately
[decide]{.mark} the president's [legislative]{.mark} [fate,]{.mark}
executing a [vote-centered strategy is]{.mark}]{.underline} not only
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}, but often [integral]{.underline}, for
an administration looking to marshal the president's agenda to passage.
What is more, because endgame expectations condition all earlier stages
of the legislative process, the administration's potential for
prevailing on important roll-call votes casts the shadow in which all
other bargaining takes place. [[Thus]{.mark}, it is for good reason
that]{.underline} practitioners and [[political
scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} alike have
**[[highlight]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed pivotal voters and
[[vote-centered lobbying]{.underline}]{.mark} when discussing the
presidential--congressional relationship. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**
even as **[[vote-centered lobbying is]{.underline}]{.mark}** one
essential option in the president's strategic arsenal, it is
**[[not]{.mark} [the only option]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Charles
Jones noted: However they are interpreted, roll call votes cannot be
more than they are: one form of floor action on legislation. If analysts
insist on scoring the president, concentrating on this stage of
lawmaking can provide no more than a partial tally. Jones (1994: 195) It
is an admonition that Congressional Quarterly (CQ) staffers have
emphasized year after year when characterizing the president's
legislative record by analyzing roll-call votes12. Discussing President
Eisenhower's legislative success in 1953, CQ issued a nowfamiliar
caveat: ...[[the President's leadership often was tested]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} the]{.underline} glare spotlighting [[roll
calls]{.underline}]{.mark}...[[Negotiations off the floor]{.underline}
**[and action in committee]{.underline}**]{.mark} sometimes **[[are as
important as the recorded votes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (Congressional
Quarterly Almanac 1953: 77).

#### PC is necessary all the way up to the finish-line

UC-Irvine, 2010, "Pushing the Agenda: Presidential Leadership in U.S.
Lawmaking, 1953-2004," pg. 50

That said, [in cases where the president and his leading allies do
disagree]{.underline}\-\--if not on policy preferences, on matters like
priorities or strategy\-\--[[the White House **must lobby**]{.mark}
**their [congressional leaders to ensure]{.mark} that [they carry the
president's water]{.mark}**]{.underline} (rather than their own). Hence,
[presidents want supportive leaders to use their prerogatives to keep
the president's proposed policies among those from which legislators
choose.17 Getting their leaders "onboard"]{.underline} with the
president's preferences [is the administration's first
order]{.underline} of business, [and the bargaining tactics they
use]{.underline} for this purpose [runs the spectrum]{.underline}, from
personal appeals to public pressure to political deals.¶ But [[even upon
securing]{.mark} their [support, the White House's work]{.mark} with
these supportive leaders [is **far from done**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
anything, it has barely begun. [Now the White House and their leading
legislative allies must work together to best promote their overlapping
interest]{.underline}s.18 To this end, they should share policy
information and political intelligence, not to mention the burden of
putting them to good use. In short, after first bargaining over what
policy they will advocate, the president and his leading allies should
coordinate efforts to best execute that advocacy.¶ 2.2.2.1.2 Deterring
leading opponents. When the president and his leading allies advocate a
particular policy alternative, ultimately deciding its destiny is the
members' distribution of preferences in light of rival alternatives. The
key variables at this point, therefore, are the preference distribution
and the rival alternatives. The first of these\-\--that is, the White
House's endgame strategy of shifting members' preference distribution
via vote-centered lobbying\-\--has already been discussed, but still
unexamined is the administration's strategy for affecting rival
alternatives. Let me now consider this crucial component of the White
House's earlygame strategy. ¶ By way of introduction, it is worth
emphasizing the president's motivation for affecting rival alternatives:
beating the status quo is almost always easier than beating a strategic
opponent. Accordingly, rather than just pulling pivotal voters toward
the president's position (and away from opponents'), [the White House
may also want to cut a deal with leading opponents, getting them to
"pull their punches" against the president's proposal,]{.underline} or
at least something close to it. The obvious theoretical question
begging, then, is the same one White House officials actually ponder:
**[[Why would an opposing leader]{.mark} ever [endorse]{.mark} key
planks of [the president's]{.mark} legislative
[agenda]{.mark}?]{.underline}**¶ Well, one way to secure leading
opponents' submission is simply by fiat. If the president and his
leading allies can prohibit, by rule, leading opponents from challenging
their position, then the president's policy options are constrained only
by the range of potentially passable policies. But even if this brand of
strategic censorship may occasionally occur via restrictive rules in the
House of Representatives, it is not generally a viable strategy and
certainly not a reliable one. First, the president's party is often in
the congressional minority, and second, even when in the majority, the
Senate does not allow the president's leading allies to impose
restrictive rules on their leading opponents. Far from it.¶ [Lacking the
ability to censor leading opponents by decree, how can an administration
keep leading opponents from challenging [the president]{.mark}'s
initiatives? To foreshadow, the basic answer is that **White House
officials [can deter leading opponents inasmuch as the president can
convince them]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the intrapolicy benefits of
fighting are low and the extrapolicy costs are high. Let me elaborate.¶
Figure 2.10 lays out the tenets underlying the White House's options for
deterring their leading opponents, adding to the now-familiar policy
space a leading opponent, O, who joins the president, P, and pivotal
voter, f (who can occupy any number of positions, f to f ). For the
purposes of clarity, here I assume that the president and his supportive
leader, S, agree on the policy and work together promoting it. Because
an administration can rarely (if ever) get pivotal voters to support the
president's ideal outcome, **[[deterring]{.mark} leading
[opponents]{.mark} from challenging the president's bill]{.underline}**
(or some version of it) **[[requires]{.mark} that [the White House
lobby]{.mark} more than pivotal voters]{.underline}**; they must also
target opposing leaders. The reason is that to be successful,
[presidential aides must convince their leading opponents that the
policy loss they will suffer from "pulling their punches" is small and
can be offset by gains on other fronts]{.underline}. In Figure 2.10,
then, the nature of demobilizing the opposition lobbying should aim to
minimize the opposing leader's potential policy impact\-\--that is,
minimize the disparity between policies when he or she fights (say, f )
and policies when he or she does not (say, f )\-\--and compensate the
leader for the difference.¶ Developing this strategy further, it is
worth reiterating that leading opponents' decision is not a calculus
about fighting to get one's own preferences but rather fighting to get
whatever the pivotal voter will ultimately support (f, or wherever f
would end up after being targeted by the White House's lobbying
arsenal). Accordingly, the more pivotal voters' preferences match the
president's proposal, the less incentive an opposing leader has to
challenge that position (because he or she will get something close to
it anyway). The first hypothesis for deterring the opposition,
therefore, is somewhat surprising: the White House should lobby pivotal
voters to make them more supportive of the president's preferred
position. Notice that although behaviorally equivalent to a pure
vote-centered lobbying strategy, here [the White House's rationale for
lobbying pivotal voters is not for their votes per se but rather to
weaken leading opponents' bargaining posture.]{.underline}¶ Beyond
pulling pivotal voters' preferences toward the president's position, [an
additional way in which the administration can lessen opposing leaders'
incentive to fight the White House is to convince leading opponents to
dislike the president's position less]{.underline} (to move O toward f
). Importantly, this does not require that the White House induce
leading opponents to support the president's position, much less vote
for it. Instead, the [administration need only convince opposing leaders
that the effects of their counteroffensive would be minimal]{.underline}
or, at least, could be better served elsewhere. Accordingly, the second
deterringthe- opposition hypothesis is that the White House should
target leading opponents with the same lobbying tactics used in the
legislative endgame; [[the president should engage]{.mark} his leading
[opponents with]{.mark} **[arm-twisting]{.mark} and browbeating,**
private appeals and public pressure.]{.underline}¶ Of course, a third
way to diminish leading opponents' incentive to fight is to compromise
the president's position (offer f instead of f ). This is not to say
that the administration should capitulate all or even concede much;
rather, [the White House should compromise only enough to mollify
leading opponents.]{.underline} Hence, this aspect of the
demobilizing-leading-opponents hypothesis suggests that the White House
should be willing to compromise with leading opponents, negotiating a
"deal" that is more moderate than the best of the potentially passable
policies but still better than what the president could get with an
endgame floor fight. This is a point worth reiterating: the White House
should only divert lobbying resources to leading opponents if doing so
yields greater influence than would be possible through vote-centered
lobbying alone.¶ This key point about agenda-centered lobbying leads to
the final insight: [because the president seeks a "deal" that is worse
for leading opponents than what they could get by challenging him, [the
administration must **compensate**]{.mark} **these leading [opponents to
offset the difference]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This
"**horse-trading**]{.mark}" **[can be on exogenous
issues]{.mark}**\-\--**for example, [a different bill]{.mark}**, an
executive or judicial nomination, or some other executive-controlled
offering]{.underline}\-\--but often occurs within the confines of the
same bill. Typically, the president's part of the logroll is included as
the bill's first title, leading opponents' part as its second.

For all his many political struggles, President Joe **[Biden
is]{.underline}** quietly **[delivering on one of the
central]{.underline}** --- and most implausible --- **[promises of his
campaign: restoring a sense of]{.underline}** normalcy and
**[bipartisanship to the legislative process.]{.underline}** The latest
example is an apparent bipartisan deal on gun regulation, which finally
puts vague Republican rhetoric on school security and mental health into
action while also embracing modest Democratic proposals on such matters
as background checks and red-flag laws. The bill will probably not
dramatically alter the level of gun violence in the US. But it should do
some good, and re-establishes the idea that Congress can act in response
to dramatic events. Before the gun deal, of course, [**Biden worked with
Congress to deliver the kind of bipartisan infrastructure legislation
that both his predecessors only talked about**. There have also been
many more obscure bills, ranging from legislation changing the
regulation of ocean shipping to a major overhaul of the US
P]{.underline}ostal [S]{.underline}ervice. Bipartisan science funding
legislation has been languishing for months now, but that's due to
boring House-Senate disagreements that are being worked out by a
conference committee --- a process so old-school it had become basically
forgotten in Washington. [**Progress is** also **being made on
bipartisan bills** about such thorny issues as Chinese investment in US
companies and antitrust scrutiny of big technology
companies.]{.underline} Much of this work is happening through a process
I like to call the Secret Congress: Members quietly working together
while allowing the political press to focus on Hunter
**[Biden's]{.underline}** laptop, which books are in which school
libraries, the latest Marjorie Taylor Greene tweet or any of the million
other controversies that engage the body politic. The Secret Congress
dynamic, of course, is one reason why it's difficult for Biden to secure
credit for delivering on this promise. During Barack Obama's presidency,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was open about the fact that he
was reluctant for Republicans to engage constructively on any topic lest
the passage of bills come to reflect positively on an incumbent
president he hoped to defeat. Biden has a much lower public profile than
his recent predecessors. And while his **[team has been constructively
engaged on all these issues]{.underline}**, it's been a quiet form of
engagement that aims to be helpful without hogging the spotlight or
preventing the members themselves from owning the process. Conservative
firebrands found plenty of (real and fake) controversies with which to
fill the air and maintain a sense of combat even as they collaborated on
policy. Meanwhile, quite apart from Biden's efforts, there is the fact
that Donald Trump's presidency helped break down the doors of
ideological dogmatism on the right. Republicans don't talk about it much
these days, but the Trump administration's willingness --- led by
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin --- to work with House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the CARES Act is the
only reason the 2020 elections didn't turn into a party-destroying
landslide. A free-market approach that devastated consumer spending
power and led to liquidated many businesses would have ruined the
economy, ruined Trump's political standing, and driven the GOP into the
ground. Trump lack of ideological purity, and Democrats' willingness to
bargain in good faith, saved the economy and the Republican Party ---
and perhaps opened the doors to further rounds of creativity. Alas,
Biden has not had nearly such good fortune with his economic management.
The multiple inflationary shocks --- first a fiscal stimulus that spent
too much too quickly, then a central bank that was probably too slow to
react, then a war in Ukraine that's ravaged the supply side of the
global economy --- have wrecked Biden's public standing. When a
president is unpopular due to bad economic news, the public doesn't give
him credit for anything. And columnists of all stripes are wont to
criticize an unpopular leader. But the fact remains that **[important
elements of Biden's agenda have succeeded]{.underline}**, notably
including a Russia policy that has secured strong bipartisan and even
international support despite the economic cost. The cloak of
unpopularity, meanwhile, makes it even easier for bipartisanship to
continue. In his current state, [Biden is not politically threatening to
Republicans, so they have no reason to avoid collaborating on bills they
happen to like.]{.underline} A new proposal from Republican senators
Mitt Romney, Richard Burr and Steve Daines to consolidate and simplify
various family support programs in a way that would cut poverty and
reduce marriage penalties has earned some cautious praise from
Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and could be the basis for more
bipartisan work. At the end of the day, life as a legislator is more fun
if you get to legislate. **[Sheer exhaustion with the tedium of
obstruction has helped make Biden's approach work]{.underline}**.

other controversies that engage the body politic. The Secret Congress
dynamic, of course, is one reason why it's difficult for Biden to secure
credit for delivering on this promise. During Barack Obama's presidency,
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was open about the fact that he
was reluctant for Republicans to engage constructively on any topic lest
the passage of bills come to reflect positively on an incumbent
president he hoped to defeat. Biden has a much lower public profile than
his recent predecessors. And while his **[team has been constructively
engaged on all these issues]{.underline}**, it's been a quiet form of
engagement that aims to be helpful without hogging the spotlight or
preventing the members themselves from owning the process. Conservative
firebrands found plenty of (real and fake) controversies with which to
fill the air and maintain a sense of combat even as they collaborated on
policy. Meanwhile, quite apart from Biden's efforts, there is the fact
that Donald Trump's presidency helped break down the doors of
ideological dogmatism on the right. Republicans don't talk about it much
these days, but the Trump administration's willingness --- led by
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin --- to work with House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on the CARES Act is the
only reason the 2020 elections didn't turn into a party-destroying
landslide. A free-market approach that devastated consumer spending
power and led to liquidated many businesses would have ruined the
economy, ruined Trump's political standing, and driven the GOP into the
ground. Trump lack of ideological purity, and Democrats' willingness to
bargain in good faith, saved the economy and the Republican Party ---
and perhaps opened the doors to further rounds of creativity. Alas,
Biden has not had nearly such good fortune with his economic management.
The multiple inflationary shocks --- first a fiscal stimulus that spent
too much too quickly, then a central bank that was probably too slow to
react, then a war in Ukraine that's ravaged the supply side of the
global economy --- have wrecked Biden's public standing. When a
president is unpopular due to bad economic news, the public doesn't give
him credit for anything. And columnists of all stripes are wont to
criticize an unpopular leader. But the fact remains that **[important
elements of Biden's agenda have succeeded]{.underline}**, notably
including a Russia policy that has secured strong bipartisan and even
international support despite the economic cost. The cloak of
unpopularity, meanwhile, makes it even easier for bipartisanship to
continue. In his current state, [Biden is not politically threatening to
Republicans, so they have no reason to avoid collaborating on bills they
happen to like.]{.underline} A new proposal from Republican senators
Mitt Romney, Richard Burr and Steve Daines to consolidate and simplify
various family support programs in a way that would cut poverty and
reduce marriage penalties has earned some cautious praise from
Democratic Senator Michael Bennet and could be the basis for more
bipartisan work. At the end of the day, life as a legislator is more fun
if you get to legislate. **[Sheer exhaustion with the tedium of
obstruction has helped make Biden's approach work]{.underline}**.

#### The bipart infrastructure bill proves PC works

**Schofield 11-9**-2021 (Rob Schofield, Director of NC Policy Watch, has
three decades of experience as a lawyer, lobbyist, writer and
commentator, President Biden's remarkable record of accomplishment under
nearly impossible circumstances,
<https://ncpolicywatch.com/2021/11/09/president-bidens-remarkable-record-of-accomplishment-under-nearly-impossible-circumstances/>)

[[Remind]{.underline} [yourself]{.underline}]{.mark} for a moment [[of
the scale]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [scope]{.underline}
[[of]{.mark} the [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Biden]{.underline}
[faced]{.underline}]{.mark} [when he took]{.underline} [office in
January]{.underline} and the limited and inadequate collection of tools
that were at his disposal to tackle them. Forty-one weeks ago, our
nation had just survived a violent attempted coup d'état and the
outgoing president who had spurred it on by refusing to acknowledge the
fact of his defeat was about to be impeached for a second time.
Meanwhile, daily deaths from a global pandemic were peaking at their
highest levels, the national economy remained a mess, and a dire,
worsening, and largely unaddressed environmental emergency continued to
place the planet in an ever-tightening grip. Only Abraham Lincoln and
possibly Franklin Roosevelt entered their presidencies under more
difficult circumstances. What's more, unlike Lincoln and Roosevelt who
took office at a time in which their parties enjoyed large congressional
majorities, Biden entered the oval office with no such advantage.
Indeed, it was only thanks to two near-miraculous come-from-behind wins
in a pair of January Georgia Senate runoffs that Democrats wield any
authority at all on Capitol Hill. Now add to all this the fact that
[[the **impossibly narrow**]{.underline}]{.mark} Democratic
[[Senate]{.mark} "majority]{.underline}" (51-50 thanks to the presence
of Vice President Harris) [[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} determined
[[ideological conservatives]{.underline}]{.mark} like West Virginia's
Manchin and Arizona's Sinema, [and]{.underline} that the antiquated
Senate [filibuster]{.underline} rule that requires 60 votes to pass
almost anything meaningful, and [[it's a **marvel**]{.underline} [that
the nation has not descended]{.underline}]{.mark} [[into]{.mark}
complete political [gridlock]{.mark}]{.underline} and chaos. In
comparison to Biden, the Apollo 13 astronauts were well-equipped when
they jerry-rigged their spacecraft, quite literally on the fly, a half
century ago. [Amazingly]{.underline}, however, [[no]{.mark} national
[crash]{.mark}]{.underline} [has [ensued]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead,
[**[under]{.mark}** the **[President's]{.mark}**]{.underline} coherent,
sober, and science-based **[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
nation has aggressively locked horns with the pandemic by undertaking
one of the largest and most successful mass vaccination campaigns in
human history -- a campaign that, despite persistent sabotage efforts
from some on the political right, has saved millions of lives.
Meanwhile, thanks in large measure to Biden's aggressive and on-the-mark
stimulus policies, the economy has revived at a record pace and huge
strides have been made in slashing poverty -- especially child poverty.
And then there is the climate emergency, where, thanks to the
President's vision and simple common sense, the U.S. has rapidly
transformed its role from that of science and reality-denying roadblock
to a global leader. There are still miles to travel in this realm, but
[the]{.underline} massive [[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}
[legislation finally [approved]{.mark}]{.underline} this past weekend
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} small [[bipartisan
majorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in both house of Congress further
cements this vitally important policy 180. Now add to all this the
literally thousands of talented and diverse appointees Biden has named
to the judiciary, the ambassadorial corps, and the leadership of
numerous regulatory agencies -- most of whom have already effected huge
and positive federal policy shifts in everything from student loans to
toxic chemicals to human rights -- and the magnitude of his
administration's accomplishments in less than 300 days looms even
larger. [[Has]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} presidency [been
perfect]{.mark}? Of course [no]{.mark}t]{.underline}. Like all of his
predecessors, Biden has made his share of mistakes. Like Barack Obama,
he's likely wasted too much time in search of imaginary common ground
with ideological conservatives determined to undermine him at every
turn. While necessary, the Afghanistan withdrawal could have proceeded
more smoothly. And as with many other presidents, one also yearns at
times for a leader with the kind of rhetorical gifts that would enable
him to easily skewer and deflate his adversaries and inspire widespread
support for the kind of wholesale progressive changes the nation needs.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in the end,]{.underline} [this is
quibbling]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[In light of the huge]{.mark} political
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} under which he's been forced to operate
(and especially in comparison to the lawless corruption and intellectual
vacuity of his predecessor that inspired night terrors in millions --
maybe even billions -- of humans), Joe **[[Biden has]{.mark} [achieved a
remarkable record of accomplishment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Whatever the
future holds, our nation will be forever in his debt.

### AT PC Fails -- Theory

#### Political capital is necessary and sufficient for the president to achieve priorities. Overwhelming empirics.

**Siewert 18**, PhD, dissertation to obtain the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy in the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Johann Wolfgang
Goethe University to Frankfurt am Main (Markus, "\"It's Never Easy for
the President to Get Exactly What He Wants,"
[https://d-nb.info/1164077325/34)](https://d-nb.info/1164077325/34)//BB)

[One of the most important presidential strategies]{.underline} in the
legislative arena [is]{.underline} (trying) [to set the agenda of
Congress]{.underline} (see Wood 2009 for an extensive overview; Cohen
2012; Edwards and Wood 1999; Light 1999). The reasoning behind this is
straightforward: [[Since presidents have]{.mark} **only [few
tools]{.mark}** at hand [to **sway lawmakers**]{.mark} on how they cast
their ballot, [the focus]{.mark} of the White House [is]{.mark} set at
an earlier stage: by already [influencing what is considered in the
first place]{.mark}.]{.underline} Compared with the legislative
prevalence of executives in parliamentarian democracies, presidents in
the United States are clearly less able to dominate the agenda space.
Yet based on his constitutional right to recommend legislation deemed
necessary and appropriate (Art. II, Sec 3, U.S. Constitution), it is
primarily the resources of the executive branch - i.e., the departmental
bureaucracies, and the Executive Office of the President - which put the
president into the position to exert policy leadership via drafting
legislative proposals. Unmatched by any other single legislators or even
Congress as a whole, John W. Kingdon is right to argue that "\[...\]
[[no other]{.underline}]{.mark} single [[actor]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the political system [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[the]{.mark}
[capability of the president to set agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}."
(Kingdon 2003, 24). Previous research has shown that defining the agenda
is a promising strategy for the White House. Presidential initiatives,
both major and minor ones, almost always find their way into the
legislative hopper (Cameron and Park 2008, 51f; Cohen 2012, 24ff;
Edwards and Barrett 2000, 116ff). Accordingly, legislation proposed by
the administration makes up between 30% and 50% of the congressional
calendar, while the remaining proportion is initiated by members of
Congress, is based on recurring pieces of legislation, and are reaction
to external events or imminent crises (Edwards and Barrett 2000, 112ff;
Taylor 1998, 377ff; Theriault 2002). While this indeed makes the
president the single most important agenda-setter, it also demonstrates
that he does not dominate the legislative agenda of Congress (Sinclair
2006, 255--63). We can mainly identify three mechanisms how
[[presidential]{.mark} [agenda-setting]{.mark}]{.underline} affects the
lawmaking process in Congress. First, it [[enables the president to
define the boundaries of]{.mark} [policies under consideration,
and]{.mark} in this way to [structure the following
deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this sense, [[agenda setting
is]{.underline}]{.mark} first and foremost about
[[obtaining]{.underline}]{.mark} the Deutungshoheit - i.e., the
[[prerogative of interpretation]{.underline}]{.mark} - [[over
the]{.mark} policy [debate]{.mark}]{.underline} through setting the
terms of the debate, [[moving first on certain policy aspects]{.mark},
and [via framing and priming of core arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Edwards and Wood 1999; Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake 2005). George W. Bush,
for instance, during his 2000 presidential campaign advertised his plans
for massive across the board tax breaks which, at that time, were
perceived as a mere "pipe dream" on both sides of the political spectrum
(Milbank 2001). Cutting taxes, and especially to this extent, did not
rank high among the priorities of lawmakers nor the American public. The
arrival of Bush in the White House, however, completely changed the
dynamics of debate. It put the tax cut proposal upfront of the
legislative agenda during his first half year as president, and
Democrats in the end had to accept an amount of tax breaks which came up
to more than double of what they called reasonable six months before
during the election campaign. Bill Clinton, on the other hand, was
largely rolled by the issue dynamics in the debates regarding the
overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service in 1997. Favoring only minor
reforms, he had to concede early on to pressures from the public and
Congress who, fueled by several major scandals, thirsted for a
largescale reorganization of the IRS instead of a fine-tuning approach
preferred by Clinton (Broder 1997). Of course, these are only two
illustrations highlighting how presidents can succeed but also fail in
setting the tone of the debate from early stages and through this
pre-structure the outcome of the lawmaking process. Second,
[**[pres]{.mark}**idential [leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} at the
agenda-setting stage [[helps]{.mark} to **[overcome collective
action]{.mark} [problems]{.mark}** within Congress and
among]{.underline} its 535 legislators [**[by providing a focal
point]{.underline}** [around which other]{.underline}]{.mark} [political
[actors']{.mark} policy [positions]{.mark} can
[crystalize]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cameron and Park 2008; Cohen 2012;
Neustadt 1991, 8f). The USA PATRIOT Act can serve as a prime example in
this regard, on which the New York Times stressed that "\[b\]y and
large, the House and Senate bills both use as a starting point a
proposal sent to Capitol Hill nearly two weeks ago by the White House."
(Lewis and Pear 2001). Since lawmakers in Congress today only have
scarce resources to draft their own bills, presidential input from the
beginning is often highly appreciated. Yet, a proposal from the White
House furthermore fulfills the role of first mover draft upon which the
subsequent debate can be structured. In this sense, it both offers a
distinct policy outline upfront and provides guiding posts for the
further deliberation process. Third, agenda-setting offers the White
House the opportunity to highlight its priorities, how they are
distributed across various policy issues, and in which way policies
should be packaged (Rudalevige 2005, 437ff; Wayne 2009b, 317ff).
[[Because]{.mark} the [resources of any administration to lobby
Congress]{.mark} [are not infinite and]{.mark} the [multiple]{.mark}
political [arenas are usually]{.mark} heavily [crowded with
myriad]{.mark} policy [items]{.mark} and problems striving to be solved,
[the White House **needs to prioritize**]{.mark} its policy
agenda]{.underline}. [[This involves]{.underline}]{.mark}, among other
things, to [[select]{.mark} some [issues]{.mark}]{.underline} over
others, [[decide]{.mark} about their
**[sequencing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, how to pursue them, **[[and how
much]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[p]{.mark}**olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital
**it**]{.underline} wants or **[needs [to spend]{.mark}]{.underline}**
on any given item. Therefore, the administration will focus on certain
policies with more attention, on others with less, depending on the
prioritization by the president but also upon other considerations, such
as the overall density of the policy agenda or imminent pressures of the
time. **[[The trick is to not overwhelm Congress with]{.mark} the
president's [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As Lyndon B. Johnson
famously quipped, "Congress is like a Whiskey drinker. You can put an
awful lot of whiskey into a man if you just let him sip it. But if you
try to force the whole bottle down his throat at one time, he'll throw
it up." (cited in Rudalevige 2002, 113). [Thus, [the failure to
prioritize]{.mark} easily [leads to **overload** of]{.mark} Pennsylvania
Avenue with [Congress]{.mark} at the one end, [and]{.mark} to
[**excessive demands and exhaustion** for the White House]{.mark} at the
other end. The rocky start of the [Clinton]{.mark} administration
[underlines this]{.mark} argument: since [the White House did not pursue
a 'rifle-approach' to **define clear policy priorities**]{.mark} for its
initial months and then execute them, [it got lost in]{.mark}
[numerous]{.mark} legislative [battles and mine-fields]{.mark} early on
in its first year. [Instead **it followed a 'shotgun-approach'**]{.mark}
**by addressing as many issues as possible at once [leading to an
overkill and chaos]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Rockman 1996; Sinclair
2000b).

### AT PC Fails -- Party Unity

#### Presidents have PC to solidify party unity

**Lee 2021**

Barton, Phd Political Economics @ UNSW Sydney, New South Wales and
Junior Research Fellow at University of Oxford (Magdalen College),
"Essays in Political Economics" August 2021

Most organizations---[in politics]{.underline}, business, and
academia---feature [leaders]{.underline} who [can sway collective
decisions]{.underline}. In business, a CEO may persuade her firm's board
to approve a project the board is initially skeptical about. She may do
so by appealing to personal friendships with members of the board, or
even by threatening to resign. In politics, **[U.S. presidents may coax
Congress into passing legislation that does not have the initial support
of the majority of members. They may]{.underline}**, for example,
**[claim a popular mandate for policies on which they campaigned, or
appeal to party unity]{.underline}**. Similarly, in academia, a senior
faculty member may push to hire a job candidate the recruiting committee
is initially inclined to reject, perhaps by exerting influence over
junior colleagues. That leaders have the power to influence decisions is
not controversial. Yet, power to influence is not an easy concept to
define, as it includes both formal and informal components. For example,
in Hollander's (1958; 1960; 1978; 2009) theory of "idiosyncrasy credit"
leaders have an account of credit with group members they can spend to
deviate from group norms and assert influence (see also Bass, 1990, Ch.
17).1 These credits are "given and received as rewards" from a leader's
social exchange with her followers (Hol- lander, 1978). Therefore, power
to influence derives from the leader's network of friends and allies
within the organization, the organization's informal system of favor
exchanges, and even the organization's culture (March, 1981, pp.
216--219).

### AT Winners Win -- Biden

#### Biden's pc is finite -- he has limited opportunities to pass recession solutions

**Smith 2021**

Noah, Prof \@Stony Brook University, "Biden Must Avoid Obama\'s Mistake
When Setting His Agenda; Stick to the crisis at hand or risk spurring a
backlash that could slow economic reforms and hurt Democrats in 2022,"
January 13, 2021,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/biden-must-avoid-obama-s-mistake-when-setting-his-agenda>

The universe of possibilities for the Biden administration radically
expanded after the Democrats clinched the Senate majority, but the
increase in **[[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital [isn't
infinite]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [When deciding which problems to tackle
first]{.underline}, President Joe [Biden should prioritize initiatives
that address the pandemic while moving the nation toward long-term goals
for public health and green-energy stimulus]{.underline}. Biden can
learn from the experience of Barack [Obama]{.underline}, whose [focus on
health]{.underline}-insurance [reform provoked a midterm backlash
and]{.underline} probably [forfeited a chance to boost the country out
of the Great Recession sooner]{.underline}. He should heed the words of
Winston Churchill who urged, "never let a good crisis go to waste."
[Because crises are times when the public understands that change is
necessary, it's possible to make **deep and lasting
reforms**.]{.underline} President Franklin D. Roosevelt understood this
when he focused parts of his New Deal on long-term alterations to
America's economic structure, such as Social Security and the National
Labor Relations Board. These policies not only contributed to the
recovery from the Great Depression --- the reason for Roosevelt\'s
election --- but created a more equal and stable economy in which
workers had more bargaining power and old people didn't have to live in
penury. [The U.S. was in the depths of the Great Recession when Obama
took office]{.underline} in 2009. With the benefit of unified Democratic
control of Congress, he passed [a]{.underline} fairly substantial
[stimulus]{.underline}. But it [was]{.underline} still [too small to
make more than a modest dent]{.underline} in the recession. It was too
weighted toward tax cuts and it didn't include much of a bailout for
underwater homeowners. Instead, [[Obama spent much of his]{.mark}
political capital on [passing]{.mark} the]{.underline} Affordable Care
Act, commonly known as [[Obamacare]{.underline}]{.mark}. Now, it's true
that health insurance was, and is, one of the country's biggest
problems. And it's also true that Obamacare substantially reduced the
ranks of the uninsured, which was a big, important victory. But the
system Obama crafted was a compromise, which left the problem of
ruinously high costs mostly unaddressed. The legislation failed to
satisfy many on the left, with a few now even labeling it as mass murder
for not making deeper reforms. Meanwhile, Obamacare remained unpopular
throughout Obama's term in office and may have substantially contributed
to the Democrats' catastrophic midterm election losses in 2010.
Alternate histories are difficult to imagine, but it seems likely that
[[had Obama spent his]{.mark} 2009 political capital [on things more
directly related to the recession]{.mark}]{.underline} --- such as more
infrastructure spending, a bigger bailout for underwater homeowners and
a stronger welfare state --- [[he\'d have realized a **higher return on
that p**]{.mark}**olitical [c]{.mark}apital**]{.underline}. In other
words, [a crisis does present an opportunity for long-term reforms, but
it's best to use that opportunity for reforms that address the immediate
crisis]{.underline}. [The Democratic victories in]{.underline} the
[Georgia]{.underline} Senate runoffs [have given Biden an unexpected
opportunity to **pass major legislation**]{.underline} in the first year
of his presidency, instead of relying on executive action and the faint
hope of bipartisan compromise. [The left will be clamoring for major
action]{.underline} on health care and a variety of [other momumental
issues, but [Biden needs to spend his p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital
[on reforms that are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[tied
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the COVID-19 pandemic and [[the]{.mark}
resulting [recession]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The first priority
is public health. COVID-19 exposed deep and catastrophic weaknesses in
the U.S. public health institutions. Right now, vaccination is
proceeding at a glacial pace due to an uncoordinated rollout that dumped
vaccines in the lap of state public health agencies utterly unequipped
to rapidly inoculate the entire populace. Biden needs to come right out
of the gate with a coordinated, well-funded vaccination plan that
reaches maximum vaccination rates as fast as possible. In doing so, he
also needs to bolster public health agencies and revitalize and reform
both the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug
Administration after years of neglect. This will be a bigger challenge
than is popularly realized because of the possibility that
vaccine-resistant virus strains will emerge. [Biden will need to
reorient much of the U.S. economy toward vaccine production and
distribution]{.underline} until COVID-19 has been decisively beaten all
around the world. [[It will take a **lot of money
and**]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot of [**[will]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
After the virus is beaten, the U.S. economy will still linger in
recession unless the government acts decisively to boost demand. The
best tool for doing this, as usual, is infrastructure investment. And
the rapid progress in solar power and batteries means that Biden has a
unique opportunity to address the climate crisis at the same time. A
huge build-out of solar power and electric-car charging stations,
including subsidies to rapidly replace fossil fuel plants and gasoline
vehicles, will ensure that the U.S. economy comes roaring back while
making huge steps toward decarbonization. Public health and green
infrastructure should be the top priorities for Biden in 2021 and 2022.
Yes, [there are lots of other things in America that need
reform]{.underline}, including health care. But [the realities of the
political system mean these will have to wait]{.underline}. Reforms must
fit the crisis of the day; [[**Biden can't afford to get sidetracked**
on a quixotic quest to fix everything]{.underline}]{.mark} that's wrong
with the American economy.

[[the more difficulty he could encounter in building]{.mark} bipartisan

### AT Winners Win

#### PC is finite and declines over time

Capital" UNSW Economics Working Paper 2019-04 March 30, 2019

We study how the leader chooses to spend her capital depending on her
initial stock of capital, the precision of her information, and whether
the issue at stake is more or less important for her. For example, [the
President of the United States may choose to spend her political capital
only on issues that were central to her campaign]{.underline}.
Similarly, senior faculty may choose to spend their political capital
only on job candidates in their own fields. We show that the leader
optimally chooses one of four leadership styles and that the chosen
style affects the dynamics of power within the organization. [Irrelevant
leaders have too little capital to influence decisions]{.underline} and
therefore never voice their dissent. [Leaders with sufficient political
capital]{.underline} but poor information choose to be patient: they
[save their capital and spend it only on issues that are important to
them]{.underline}. Although **[patient leaders spend their capital
sparingly, when they spend it they are unlikely to regain it and
therefore their power declines over time]{.underline}**. Leaders with
intermediate precision of information choose to be loud: they spend
their capital on all issues and their power declines over time. Finally,
the most informed leaders choose to be strong: they spend their capital
on all issues and their power grows over time. For a given stock of
political capital, leaders with the least precise information are more
likely to be patient. Therefore, conditional on disagreeing with the
majority of the organization, leaders are more likely to spend political
capital when their information is more precise. But the unconditional
probability of spending political capital on any given issue is
non-monotonic on the precision of the leader's information---while loud
leaders have less precise information than strong leaders, they are more
likely to voice their dissent on any given issue. More political capital
does not necessarily induce the leader to voice dissent more often. How
more capital affects the leaders' decision hinges on the marginal power
of political capital and therefore on the shape of the mapping of
political capital into power. Intuitively, when the marginal power of
capital is greater after the leader's preferred alternative is revealed
to be better (respectively, worse) than the default, then a larger
initial stock of political capital translates into a greater return
(respectively, smaller loss) to voicing dissent. We give a concrete
example within a linear framework. In this example, leaders with little
political capital have a greater chance of becoming irrelevant if they
choose to push for a decision today. Therefore they compare a small
chance of influencing today's decision with the risk of losing their
power in the future. For such leaders, a marginal increase in today's
capital (and therefore power) increases the potential power loss in the
future more than it increases today's gains. Therefore, [for small
stocks of capital, the probability of spending political capital may be
decreasing in capital]{.underline}. To put it another way: some patient
leaders have more political capital and power than some loud leaders
have. This relation is reversed for larger stocks of political capital,
for which a marginal increase in today's capital increases the
incentives for the leader to voice her dissent. However, as the leader's
power increases, the relation is reversed yet again, as very powerful
leaders can only achieve a small increase in power by voicing dissent.

Capital by Mark Bennister, Ben Worthy :: SSRN,\" No Publication,

Political capital is frequently used as a short hand for the diverse
range of attributes and advantages a leader brings with them to power
and develops in office. Compared to other forms of 'capital' it remains
under theorised. Since Pierre Bourdieu first outlined it, scholars have
viewed political capital either as being synonymous with personal skills
or a description of wider contextual attributes, particularly the link
between leader and public. It is frequently seen as analogous to
financial capital: [a political leader has a **fixed stock** of capital
that they can spend, hoard, fritter or gamble.]{.underline} This paper
takes a first look at the literature and applies it to 't Hart's
approaches to leadership study, drawing on examples predominantly from
US and UK politics. Following Lopez (2002) it takes the view that
political capital is both 'personal' (in terms of their own skills) and
'political' (in terms of events, institutional resources and context). A
politician with skills and attributes can use this to shape the context
in which they operate, creating a 'positive multiplier' as the personal
and political reinforce each other. Where events can also overwhelm
leaders and expose flaws and personality weaknesses, a 'negative
multiplier' takes effect. However, unlike money in the bank, [political
capital is **finite** and subject to depreciation as part of 'a natural
trajectory' whereby support and power is **lost over
time**.]{.underline} Yet this trajectory is not always uniform. [The
loss is inevitable]{.underline} but the rate and shape may not be.

### AT Polarization Broke Congress

#### Bipartisan passage of major legislation disproves

[The American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
are two major initiatives that passed despite intense polarization and
the Democrats\' narrow majorities in Congress]{.underline}. And [both
pieces of legislation have been integral to the nation\'s recovery from
the pandemic]{.underline}. The [Biden]{.underline} administration also
[oversaw the swift rollout of]{.underline} the Covid-19
[vaccines]{.underline}, which have been key to protecting the country
against the damage caused by new variants. On foreign policy, Biden has
enjoyed considerable success strengthening NATO and ratcheting up
economic sanctions against Russia while providing critical aid to
Ukraine. As New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote about his
off-the-record lunch with the President, \"What I felt afterward was
this: For all you knuckleheads on Fox who say that Biden can\'t put two
sentences together, here\'s a news flash: He just put NATO together,
Europe together and the whole Western alliance together---stretching
from Canada up to Finland and all the way to Japan---to help Ukraine
protect its fledgling democracy from Vladimir Putin\'s fascist
assault.\" [None of this erases the significant challenge global
inflation has on American families]{.underline}. To be sure, [the
President has taken steps to address this by shoring up key ports to
alleviate supply]{.underline} chain problems. The Federal Reserve has
just instituted the largest rate hike since 1994 to curb inflation
[and]{.underline} the administration [has committed itself to focusing
on this problem without undermining the strong jobs numbers that the
country has enjoyed.]{.underline}

### I/L Tech Leadership 1nr

#### The bill solves [tech leadership]{.underline}:

#### 1. [PPPs]{.underline}\-\--it facilitates collaboration through public-private partnerships to guide research and better commercialize technology

#### 2. [R&D]{.underline}\-\--it [unleashes]{.underline} private and public sector innovation.

**Oxman 22** -- Jason Oxman, B.A. cum laude from Amherst College, M.S.
and J.D. from Boston University, President and chief executive officer
of the Information Technology Industry Council; "Congress Must Reach
Agreement on the Bipartisan Innovation Act;" 03-09-22, ITI,
<https://www.itic.org/news-events/techwonk-blog/congress-must-reach-agreement-on-the-bipartisan-innovation-act>;

As President Biden meets with U.S. business leaders about the importance
of keeping the U.S. competitive, ITI echoes the president's call for the
U.S. Congress to pass the [Bipartisan [Innovation
Act]{.mark}]{.underline}. This legislation [[would **strengthen** **U.S.
tech**]{.mark}nological [**leadership** and **fortify**]{.mark} the U.S.
[**economy** by **increasing manufacturing**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
America, [**[strengthening]{.mark}** [**supply chains**, and
**addressing** **bottlenecks** in key areas]{.mark} like
**semiconductors**]{.underline}.

The Bipartisan Innovation Act is **[integral]{.underline}** [to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [future economic success and
**competitiveness**]{.underline} in the global marketplace. That's why
it is so important for the U.S. Congress to reach an agreement on the
historic competitiveness bills that have cleared both the U.S. House of
Representatives and the U.S. Senate -- the United States Innovation and
Competition Act (USICA) and America Creating Opportunities for
Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength
(COMPETES) Act.

As ITI outlined in a recent letter to Congressional leadership, these
bills will maintain and expand the United States' leadership in the
technology industry, creating new investment in communities across the
country. First and foremost, the [[bills]{.mark} will
[supercharge]{.mark} domestic [semiconductor manufacturing, research,
and design]{.mark} through [funding]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
Creating Helpful Incentives for the Production of Semiconductors (CHIPS)
for America Act. [This will help [ensure companies can **produce**,
**design**, and]{.mark} rely upon **semiconductors** to
**[innovate]{.mark}**, manufacture, and provide [products and
services]{.mark} to]{.underline} American [consumers, businesses, and
the U.S. government]{.underline}.

[[Semiconductors are essential for]{.mark} everything from
**[5G]{.mark}** and **[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} automobiles and [[smart appliances]{.mark},
underpinning critical services]{.underline} like distance learning,
telework, and healthcare delivery. By investing in the CHIPS Act, the
United States will address a critical imperative for its national
security and economic well-being. Congress should also pass a permanent
investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing, design, and
research. Another key technology area these bills would support is Open
RAN, through the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund, which
provides a down payment towards developing next-generation mobile
broadband technologies.

Congress has further shown an increased commitment in both the House and
Senate bills to [tech-focused **[r]{.mark}**esearch a**[n]{.mark}**d
**[d]{.mark}**evelopment]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[at agencies]{.mark}
including]{.underline} the National Science Foundation
(**[NSF]{.underline}**), **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[E]{.underline}**nergy [National
Labs]{.underline}, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(**[NIST]{.underline}**), and [the]{.underline} [Manufacturing USA
program]{.underline}. These [elements]{.underline} of the Congressional
competitiveness bills [[are critical for expanding]{.mark} America's
[tech]{.mark}nology [leadership and]{.mark} **strengthening** its
[**national innovation** **ecosystem**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Translating **new research** into]{.mark} **[commercialized
tech]{.mark}**nology [will mean **high-tech jobs** and]{.mark} **new
[firms]{.mark}**]{.underline} around the country, ensuring that the
benefits of these investments are broadly shared across the United
States.

#### 3. [Brain Drain]{.underline}\-\--it allows the US to [retain global talent]{.underline} and fix the [shortage]{.underline} of STEM workers.

**Rao 22** -- Steve S. Rao, Morrisville Town Council member, board
member of the American Immigration Council, serves on the N.C. League of
Municipalities Race and Equity Task Force; "Opinion: Senate Must Pass
COMPETES Act to Keep STEM Talent;" 04-18-22, Government Technology,
https://www.govtech.com/education/higher-ed/opinion-senate-must-pass-competes-act-to-keep-stem-talent;

Our [**global [competitors]{.mark}**, like **China**, [have been
**closing the gap**]{.mark} with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[for **decades**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- building
their economies, attempting to take over the manufacturing industry,
funding innovation, and producing products that keep technology running
worldwide.

[Without action from Congress]{.underline}, those [[competitors could
win]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[race for global
talent]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[taking **innovation** and **economic
strength** away]{.mark} from our shores]{.underline}.

To get ahead in this global competition, the U.S. [House]{.underline}
recently [passed the **[COMPETES Act]{.mark}**, which
[reforms]{.mark}]{.underline} the broken [**[immigration]{.mark}
system** [to allow **educated**]{.mark} and **skilled** **[STEM
workers]{.mark}** born in another country [to **stay** and **work** for
**American businesses**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I'm proud to be the son of immigrants who came to our country to find
the American Dream and I'm working now to ensure that dream is
accessible to others in my community.

As a council member for Morrisville, one of the fastest growing towns in
the Research Triangle Park, I know how crucial it is for the United
States to remain the best destination in the world for top talent, minds
and ideas.

To retain our spot as a global innovation leader, we can't sit by as our
competitive advantage in the market disappears. Congress should be
laser-focused on making America the best place in the world to get an
education, start a company, produce goods, and fund cutting-edge
developments.

Right now, [we continue to slip behind because]{.underline} our
[immigration]{.underline} system [doesn't promote highly-skilled workers
in science, technology, manufacturing and engineering by giving them a
pathway to stay and contribute]{.underline} to the U.S. [after they
receive an education]{.underline}.

Losing those students and professionals to other countries could prove
detrimental to North Carolina's economy. In fact, our tech industry adds
nearly \$49 billion to the economy each year, making N.C.'s technology
sector the 13th largest in the country. That sector also employs more
than 360,000 people and continues to grow.

However, that trend could soon reverse under current immigration
policies --- at a time when the U.S. needs more workers, not less.

[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[face a **national**]{.mark} and
statewide **[shortage]{.mark}** of **skilled
professionals**]{.underline}. Before the pandemic, [there were nearly
[**170,000** **open jobs** in]{.mark} the [**tech** and **innovation**
**sectors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, there are more than 3 million
open jobs in various STEM, healthcare, and professional services roles
nationwide. Creating options for international students to work in the
U.S. --- like the reforms in the [[COMPETES]{.mark} Act]{.underline} ---
[[could cut]{.mark} the **[STEM]{.mark}-related** [**workforce gap** by
a **quarter**]{.mark} and add more than \$230 billion to America's
economy]{.underline} over the next decade.

[Until Congress **acts**]{.underline}, the [[**self-inflicted** **brain
drain** of]{.mark} talented [professionals]{.mark}]{.underline} who go
to school in America and then are forced to leave and take their ideas
with them [[will]{.mark} [continue to **benefit**]{.mark} our
**[competitors]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- like China. We need our
leaders in D.C. to come together and find a bipartisan solution to
address our talent, manufacturing, and workforce shortage before it's
too late.

#### 4. Semiconductor independence\-\--the bill is [vital]{.underline} to [tech development]{.underline} and preventing [inevitable supply chain disruptions]{.underline}.

**Olson 4-12** -- Tyler Olson, covers politics at Fox Business; "China
bill could ease supply chain issues causing inflation, help US compete
in \'dangerous world\': Khanna;" 04-12-22, Fox News,
https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/ro-khanna-china-competition-bill-conferees-congress-house-of-representatives;

[When [Congress]{.mark} returns]{.underline} later this month [one of
its [top priorities will be]{.mark}]{.underline} coming to a
[[compromise on Chinese competition legislation]{.underline}]{.mark},
with dozens of lawmakers set to meet in a \"conference committee\" to
work out the details.

The effort is more than a year in the making, but [may be more important
than ever]{.underline}, according to Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who said
[it could help **address** the **root causes** of
**inflation**]{.underline}.

\"[One of the reasons]{.underline} the [price of cars have gone
up]{.underline}, the [price of]{.underline} some [electronic goods has
gone up, is [we have a shortage of semiconductors]{.mark}, where it\'s
too dependent on Taiwan and South Korea]{.underline},\" Khanna said.
\"[[We need]{.underline}]{.mark} to make those have those good, high
paying [[jobs]{.mark} here in the United States [so]{.mark} that
[we]{.mark} also [**aren\'t dependent** on
**shipping**]{.mark}]{.underline} those products [for [**thousands**
of]{.mark} [miles]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [with China\'s
**expansionist ambitions** in **Taiwan**, it\'s **critically important**
that that be in the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.\"

\"I am thrilled that Speaker Pelosi has named me as conferee for the
House's America COMPETES Act,\" Khanna also said. \"This bill will
spread opportunities while also strengthening our supply chains and
lowering costs for hardworking Americans.\"

On Tuesday it was announced that inflation in the U.S. hit a 40-year
high with the consumer price index rising 8.5% in March from a year ago.
The increase was partially driven by the Russian war on Ukraine but also
supply chain issues that have been dragging on the economy for months.

Khanna also said Russias\'s brutal war on Ukraine is part of the reason
[why [Congress shouldn\'t **delay**]{.mark} on the bill, [as]{.mark} the
[U.S. faces]{.mark} **major [threats]{.mark}** [to its **superpower
status** from **multiple fronts**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"[[We need]{.underline}]{.mark} to have [**[tech]{.mark}nology
[supremacy]{.mark}**, technology **[leadership]{.mark}** in the world,
[to]{.mark} make sure we\'re going to [**win** in **space**]{.mark}, to
make sure we\'re going to win with... [**hypersonic**
tech]{.mark}nology, with **[A.I.]{.mark}** technology,
**[q]{.mark}**uantum **[c]{.mark}**omputing technology]{.underline},\"
Khanna told Fox News in an interview. \"[**Putin\'s aggression** shows
us it\'s a **dangerous** world]{.underline}.\"

The [House and Senate passed different China competition
bills]{.underline} last year, leading to a nearly year-long stalemate
between the two chambers. They again passed different versions of the
more recent America COMPETES Act this spring, [with]{.underline} the
[Senate bill getting a bipartisan majority of 68 votes]{.underline}
while the [House version got]{.underline} just [one GOP
vote]{.underline}.

The [key for the conference committee will be to **bridge the gap**
between the **bills** to allow it to **clear 60 votes** **in the
Senate** without losing too many **House Dem**ocrat **votes** that it
doesn\'t pass]{.underline}.

Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who was one of the leading co-sponsors with
Khanna on the initial China bill last year, said the [House
version]{.underline} passed in February \"[is not a serious effort [to
make the]{.mark} [US more competitive]{.mark} with China]{.underline}.\"
[A **lack of [guardrails]{.mark}** [on **semiconductor funding**]{.mark}
was a **major problem**]{.underline}, Gallagher said. He also listed
other issues [including [**protecting** U.S. research]{.mark} from
**China** [and **ensuring investments**]{.mark} in the bill [are
**targeted** at]{.mark} the **[right sectors]{.mark}** of the
economy]{.underline},

[Gallagher is]{.underline} not a conferee for the latest effort. But his
office told Fox News Tuesday he [is [optimistic]{.mark} the conference
[committee can address]{.mark} those [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Khanna also said he believes Congress can come to an agreement on the
positive things in the bill.

\"It passed the Senate with bipartisan support, the COMPETES Act, and it
passed the House with bipartisan support,\" Khanna told Fox News.
\"It\'s based on the bill that\'s bipartisan, my bill with Sen. Schumer,
Todd Young and Mike Gallagher. [It\'s going to be the [**largest
increase** in **tech**]{.mark}nology and **[development]{.mark}** the
[**country has seen** since]{.mark} the **[Kennedy]{.mark}** years.
It\'s going to bring back production to America. It\'s going to allow
things like semiconductor manufacturing in Ohio]{.underline}.\"

### I/L Tech Leadership -- Semiconductors

#### The entire America Competes Act must pass for it to be successful in retaining STEM competition

Congress might be nearing the finish line on the bill supposed to
safeguard the nation's technological supremacy --- at a crawl rather
than the sprint lawmakers and the president alike seem to think is
necessary. [[The package must pass now or never;]{.mark} yet, as
important as getting the job done is getting it done right.]{.underline}
Sign up for a weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates
Despite some rhetorical cold water thrown by Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), [legislators and administration officials alike
are hopeful that the America Competes Act is close to finally passing.
[The legislation would send billions into technological research from
a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [to quantum computing to
nanoscience]{.mark}, as well as to help foreign scientists and engineers
stay in the United States. Perhaps most notably, it [would funnel a
whopping \$52 billion into shoring up domestic manufacturing of
semiconductor]{.mark}s, \$39 billion of that subsidizing new factories
through \$3 billion grants.]{.underline} While this sort of industrial
policy has brought dubious benefits in the past, a new argument for the
investment arrives every day. [Under the current status quo, [75 percent
of production of these critical computer chips takes place in East
Asi]{.mark}a --- rendering this economy all too vulnerable to supply
shocks, whether from pandemics, extreme weather events or geopolitical
tensions.]{.underline} The last of these risks seems higher than ever as
China adopts an increasingly threatening posture toward Taiwan, whose
chipmaker TSMC alone makes up 50 percent of the global market.
Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping's regime has announced a \$150 billion
program to bolster its own domestic semiconductor industry. This fund,
combined with similar offers from nations in Europe and elsewhere, might
lure even U.S. firms away from home. [Already, TSMC, as well as major
American manufacturers Intel and GlobalWafers, have warned they might
scale back their plans to construct facilities here if the promised
incentives remain on hold.]{.underline} Still, that doesn't mean
Congress should give these firms a handout without doing all it can to
ensure the money benefits the nation and its taxpayers rather than
merely the manufacturers and their [shareholders. [Some safeguards are
already in place,]{.mark} but there is plenty of room for tightening.
[Particularly important are protections that screen firms' outbound
investments to ensure they're not redirecting funds into propping up
competitors]{.mark}; so, too, is a robust process to review whether
proposed projects will provide a national security benefit to the United
States. Limits on stock buybacks by grant recipients would also help
ensure this strategic giveaway doesn't turn into a boondoggle. The
biggest mistake Congress could make now is focusing solely on the tens
of billions in factory-building subsidies and letting the rest of the
America Competes Act fall by the wayside. These grants alone will not on
their own catch the United States up to its East Asian peers. [Other
changes]{.mark}, some of them included in the bill, will prove even more
important --- [from cultivating and retaining STEM talent here to
coordinating with allies to keep enough chip-making capacity outside
China]{.mark}. But as long as Congress is set on handing money to
manufacturers, legislators should also make sure the manufacturers end
up giving something back.]{.underline}

#### America Competes Act is key to American innovation

**FAS 7/1** \[The Federation of American Scientists is a nonprofit
policy research and advocacy organization founded in 1945 to meet
national security challenges with evidence-based, scientifically-driven,
and nonpartisan policy, analysis, and research. After the devastating
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a group of atomic researchers,
deeply concerned about the use of science for malice, created an
organization committed to using science and technology to benefit
humanity. The group they created -- the Federation of Atomic Scientists
-- soon became the Federation of American Scientists in recognition of
the hundreds of scientists across diverse disciplines who joined
together to advance science policy and counter scientific
misinformation.https://fas.org/press-release/competes-usica/\]//LP

Today the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) calls upon Congress to
reach a final agreement by the end of July on H.R. 4521, the America
Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology,
and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act, and S. 1260, the U.S. Innovation
and Competition Act (USICA). "[[The need for this legislation is broadly
recognized,]{.mark} and delay or failure should not be an option. We
believe sensible bipartisan compromises can be reached on many of the
outstanding issues and that a final agreement coupled with supplemental
funding would bolster U.S. competitiveness, address supply chain issues,
and enhance U.S. security]{.underline}," the letter reads. [[Congress is
at the cusp of making major policy improvements a]{.mark}nd much-needed
investments that will enable the U.S. to remain the global leader in
science and technology. Without these improvements, however, the U.S.
stands to not only lose its status as global innovator, but lose
scientific talent seeking opportunity elsewhere.]{.underline}
"[[American scientific excellence and technological leadership is not
magically sustained]{.underline}]{.mark} -- it is fostered by policy
that nurtures and funds innovation. [[Congress should make a down
payment on American competitiveness]{.mark}, sponsor a generation of
world-class technological talent, and let the fruits of that talent make
the case for America's competitive edge,"]{.underline} says FAS CEO Dan
Correa. "[[The need for a new American investment in research and
development is widely recognized]{.underline}]{.mark}, so what better
moment for Congress to invest than now? The bipartisan bills before
Congress share a similar goal -- to supercharge American science.
[Congress should seize the moment and make the robust investments we
need]{.underline}," says FAS Associate Director of Research &
Development and Advanced Industry Matt Hourihan. "[[Congress has a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass legislation that will
strengthen our nation's commitment to prioritizing science and
technolog]{.mark}y, advancing American innovation and bolstering global
leadership]{.underline}. We urge both chambers of Congress to support
this bipartisan, bicameral legislation---investment in science and
innovation is essential for America's future," says American Association
for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) CEO Sudip Parikh. "[After nearly
three years of bipartisan efforts to craft this legislation, it's time
to finish strong and deliver a final agreement that helps propel
American science, innovation, and competitiveness into the next decade
and beyond]{.underline}," says Association of American Universities
(AAU) President Barbara R. Snyder. "[[Congress is on the brink of
passing legislation with the potential to bolster U.S. research and
development investments]{.mark} to better support innovations that not
only spark new discoveries, but also solve intractable challenges facing

#### To stay competitive the US must pass USICA

I grew up in San Jose, CA. When I was born here, this city and area was
filled with orchards of apricot, peach, cherry, and other fruit trees
and was known then as \"The Valley of Heart's Delights.\" Two of the
largest canning factories were only a few miles from my house, and
during the summer, I would wake up in the morning to the smell of
apricots, peaches, and plums cooking as the fruit was prepared for
canning. However, with the birth of the semiconductor industry in the
late 1950s, our region underwent a radical transformation that made it
what is known today as Silicon Valley. Companies like Shockley
Semiconductor, Fairchild, Intel, and dozens of others who created
semiconductors and related technology took root in our region. Now
thousands of tech companies call this area their home. Sadly almost all
of the orchards are gone and replaced by business complexes and housing
to support the growing tech companies in the Valley. In our digital
age[, [semiconductors have become a foundational technology]{.mark} not
only in digital devices but in everything from refrigerators and a
plethora of home appliances to cars, planes, and just about every form
of transportation that exists today.]{.underline} Initially, all
semiconductor manufacturing was in the U.S. But by the end of the last
century, that had primarily shifted to Asia. [[Today over half of the
world\'s chip-making is in Taiwan]{.mark}, and only about 12% is in the
U.S.]{.underline} In January of 2021, Congress passed the Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductor (CHIPS) for America Act.
[Then in June 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the United States Innovation
and Competition Act (USICA) which appropriates funds to finance the
programs outlined in the CHIPS Act. USICA includes \$39 billion for chip
plant construction over five years and another \$11.2 billion for the
CHIPS act for research and development.]{.underline} In a report from
the Center for Strategic and International studies, they pointed out
that- [\"[USICA is a sweeping piece of legislation which includes a
range of initiatives meant to boost innovation within the United
States]{.mark}, including investment in regional technology centers
across rural and micropolitan America. Despite passing the Senate with a
68-32 vote, some House Democrats disagreed with portions of the bill
dealing with funding for federal research and technological innovation.
After a failed attempt to attach USICA to the FY22 National Defense
Authorization Act in November 2021, Senate Democrats agreed to wait
until 2022 to reconcile the bill with their House
counterparts.]{.underline} In late January, House Democrats unveiled
their own version of USICA, titled the America COMPETES Act, which
includes identical funding for the CHIPS Act (\$52 billion) but cuts
roughly \$200 billion, which USICA dedicated towards other programs like
regional technology hubs. [[The bill received praise from Senate
Democratic leaders]{.mark} and President Biden, but the America COMPETES
Act will still likely face a lengthy reconciliation period as lawmakers
deliberate over provisions that the House bill omits."]{.underline}
While the Senate and House dawdle with this urgent issue, [[the threat
of China taking control of Taiwan]{.mark}, a goal from which they will
not be deterred, [grows daily. Just imagine if China had Taiwan]{.mark}
under their control and, by default, [would be lord over 50% of the
world\'s semiconductor manufacturing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some
legislatures argue that it is up to the industry to solve this problem.
Yet, over [history, the U.S. government and military-funded significant
technological achievements that have benefited it and
society]{.underline}. Moreover, this argument holds little water given
the major threat of China\'s move on Taiwan and possibly controlling a
large percentage of semiconductor manufacturing that it could hold
hostage and use as bargaining chips to get its way in the future.
[[Intel, Samsung, and even TSMC are working hard to build semiconductor
plants on U.S. soil,]{.mark} but at best, they will not be up and
running until 2024-2025]{.underline}. Add to that the concern that the
U.S. cannot even field the amount of tech talent needed to run these
plants when they come on line in the future. [\"A new report estimates
th[e U.S. will need to add 70,000 to 90,000 jobs to serve up to 20
domestic fabs]{.mark} in coming years for the most critical
semiconductor applications. To meet that number, the U.S. needs to
increase its workforce talent by 50%,]{.underline} according to
Eightfold A.I.\'s report.\" [[Our legislatures need to wake up]{.mark}
to this desperate need to bring control of semiconductor manufacturing
back to the U.S. and allow the U.S. to control its technology destiny.
These big semiconductor companies invest billions of their own money in
these U.S. fabs. A significant boost of funds from the U.S. government
could go a long way towards speeding up the process]{.underline} and
also help train more tech workers needed to operate these new fabs. This
week, GlobalWafers Co. said it planned to put a factory in Sherman,
Texas, that would be the first U.S. silicon wafer factory in more than
two decades in the U.S. and create as many as 1,500 jobs. However, the
company stated that the plant would require financial incentives
included in the CHIPS Act to move forward. The WSJ reported the
following statement from GlobalWafers\' president about the importance
of passing the CHIPS act for them to proceed- \"[If the CHIPS Act is not
passed, we have to pivot to South Korea,\" said the company\'s
president, Mark England, who said costs there would be substantially
less. " [All three branches of the U.S. government must prioritize and
push this legislation]{.mark} with broad support from both parties and
reconcile these bills quickly. Every day they wait to pass this vital
act is another day closer to the potential of China\'s ability to
control the future of at least 50% of semiconductor
manufacturing.]{.underline}

[To continue to lead innovation, the U.S. needs more STEM-focused Ph.D.s
and consider prioritizing green cards for immigrants with these
skills]{.underline}. Not doing so yields the technological advantage and
edge to countries with strategic interests in [technology. The America
COMPETES Act, "which is being conferenced with the Senate-passed USICA
bill, includes an immigration provision under section 80303 that exempts
advanced degree holders in STEM fields from green card caps. In 2020,
international students supported an estimated 410,000 American jobs,
particularly in STEM]{.underline}. In 2021, 54% of international
students pursued a major in a STEM field, and in 2019 almost half of all
masters and doctorates awarded in STEM fields went to international
students. Yet, in 2019, over 918,000 IT jobs went unfilled. [[American
companies]{.underline}]{.mark}, not only technology-focused ones,
[[struggle to meet the STEM critical skills shortage]{.mark} and find it
increasingly challenging to hire graduates with the degrees needed to
drive innovation. To]{.underline} address this issue, [[the
D]{.mark}epartment of [H]{.mark}omeland [S]{.mark}ecurity recently
[announced an expansion to the Optional Practical Training
program]{.mark}, a 12 month temporary work permit available to
international students graduating from U.S. degree-granting
institutions. T]{.underline}he new measures add 22 qualifying fields of
study to the STEM Designated Degree Program list, increasing the number
of international STEM students in emerging tech fields. However[**,
[this will not be enough to meet the labor shortage.]{.mark}** The
United States Innovation and Competition Act ([USICA) aims to develop
domestic capacities in semiconductor]{.mark} [R&D]{.mark} using \$52
billion authorized through the CHIPS for America Fund]{.underline}, and
in key technology areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum
science, as part of the \$120 billion Endless Frontiers Act investment
to ensure the U.S. remains competitive in these fields. However, funding
these fields means hiring qualified candidates to do the work. Many of
those candidates are international students who want to stay in the U.S.
after graduating from their programs. [Ex[panding green card caps for
international students graduating in these fields will go a long
wa]{.mark}y toward filling that need for tech experts in the United
States. This is not the first time the U.S. has expanded green card
access to meet critical skill shortages. The Immigration Act of 1965
included a crucial provision that "gave preference to professionals with
skills in short supply in the United States."]{.underline} This brought
thousands of medical professionals and engineers to the U.S. to fill
labor shortages across the country. This program was widely considered a
bipartisan success and led to the growth of critical domestic
industries. Many of those families still reside in the U.S., and their
children lead the next generation of innovation. [The crucial difference
between then and now is that the IT sector is globally competitive and
projected to grow as more countries invest in their domestic tech
capabilities.]{.underline} Demand for STEM skills in the U.S. and abroad
[[Graduates of STEM programs are in high demand across the
globe]{.mark}. As the IT sector grows, demand for STEM skills in the
U.S. will also increase]{.underline}. In January 2022 alone, over
340,000 unfilled IT jobs were posted in the U.S., up by 12% from last
year. Since 2016 the sector has grown 209%. Globally the shortage of IT
workers is predicted to reach 82 million by 2030. Training these
graduates in the U.S. and exporting them to their home countries fills
unmet demand abroad, leaving U.S. companies without the labor needed for
domestic innovation. [Approximately half of the international students
studying in the U.S. are enrolled in STEM-related programs. Nearly half
of the 2019 graduate students in STEM fields were foreign nationals on
student visas]{.underline}. At the master's level, in 2019, 50% of all
engineering degrees and 57% of computer science degrees were awarded to
international students, and international students composed one-third of
all doctorates in science and engineering. [Even so, [the U.S. is only
third in the world in awarding science and engineering bachelor's
degrees,]{.mark}]{.underline} according to the National Science Board,
behind India and China. However, the U.S. has produced the most Ph. D.s
in science and engineering for many decades, although China has led
since 2007 if you count only natural sciences and engineering. Partially
due to the challenges in [staffing, U.S. companies have been shifting
their R&D operations overseas for many years. B]{.underline}y 2015, U.S.
multinationals had invested more than \$50 billion in overseas R&D
operations, with increasing shares in China, India, and Israel. Given
the aims of USICA and America COMPETES to re-shore much of these
operations in the U.S., ensuring access to the necessary skilled
engineers, scientists, and inventors to continue this work will be
essential. Debates over Green Cards for STEM Graduates [Three relevant
debates are being considered as Congress considers expanding access for
green cards in USICA. The first is whether the H1-B Visa is the more
appropriate mechanism for filling the labor gap]{.underline}. Green
cards provide permanent residence and offer the possibility of
citizenship, but currently are extremely backlogged due to annual
per-country caps. We have previously described some of the tradeoffs
between the two mechanisms. There is a need to dual-track reforms to
each as there are issues with how they are administered, from wait times
to expiring unused visas. For this piece, we are highlighting how green
cards can address STEM skill gaps since USICA is explicitly addressing
that issue. [The second is the argument that U.S. workers will be
displaced if we increase access to green cards for international
students graduating in the U.S. This assumes that domestic U.S. citizens
are available to compete in the labor market, but many of these roles
are going unfilled.]{.underline} However, this argument also presumes
that the market for graduates in STEM is fixed, but the intent of
retaining graduates, from all countries, in key STEM fields is to
kickstart innovation and R&D in the U.S., increasing demand for many
more jobs. This is not an "either/or" situation. The U.S. should pursue
domestic policies that provide education and retraining in the STEM
fields for U.S. citizens, and we have recommended that Congress
prioritize these areas. But we should also take advantage of the foreign
talent already training in the U.S. to continue to keep our advantage
and grow these critical sectors. [The final common argument is that
because the current green card process has country quotas, prioritizing
STEM fields would disproportionally favor applicants from countries with
a robust STEM workforce, such as China or India]{.underline}. Those who
have been "waiting in line" but do not have a STEM education do not
qualify for this new prioritization. [[Congress needs to address green
card application procedures from a historical perspective,]{.mark} and
reforms are required to streamline the process]{.underline}. BPC has
recommendations on these issues. However, of critical importance to the
U.S. as a whole, in the field of STEM, there is a national
competitiveness issue that also needs to be addressed. India and China
have advanced technology sectors that directly compete with U.S.
interests. If [[the U.S. can keep international students in the U.S. to
fill our labor needs and provide them a path to citizenship,]{.mark} we
will not have to compete with those graduates once they return to their
country of origin.]{.underline} Final Thought [As Congress conferences
on USICA, they should consider how the policy goals will get done with
our current labor and skill shortages.]{.underline} Suppose we are to
spend billions to boost our competitiveness in relation to countries
with advanced STEM industries. In that case, [we [must increase the
number of workers, including international students at American
universities,]{.mark} with STEM skills in the U.S. By increasing the
number of green cards for international Ph.D. students, the U.S. can
ensure that we have the people in place domestically to remain
competitive internationally]{.underline}. Requiring these critical
graduates to return home means we are subsidizing the development of
competitive labor markets abroad. [Careful consideration should be made
to reform the immigration process in the U.S. In this case, a minor
tweak in the process will yield dividends for years.]{.underline}

## !\-\--Tech Leadership

#### China will is key to US tech leadership. Prevents Chinese dominance.

[[A proposal]{.mark} in Congress [to boost]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S.
[[competitiveness]{.mark} in advanced tech]{.underline}nology [[could
mean millions of]{.underline}]{.mark} education and [[industry
dollars]{.mark} for the region]{.underline} and be a "generational
opportunity" for Pittsburgh, a city that boasts its status as the
birthplace of driverless tech and the cradle of numerous start-ups.
[[Bills]{.underline}]{.mark} in both chambers outline billions in
investment to [[support]{.mark} [initiatives]{.mark} all the way
[from]{.mark} K-12 STEM [education to **semiconductors**, **quantum
computing**, **climate**]{.mark} **science research** [and]{.mark} "high
intensity [laser]{.mark}" exploration]{.underline}. And [could [ensure
U.S. **leadership and security**]{.mark} --- namely **[from China's
creeping dominance]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- **[for decades to
come]{.underline}**, advocates and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle
say. While the D.C. spotlight has been focused on the massive bipartisan
infrastructure law and President Joe Biden's stalled social and climate
spending bill, tech insiders in Pittsburgh see the innovation-focused
legislation as one of the most significant moves the U.S. could make.
Under consideration is an estimated \$200 billion Senate bill titled the
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or **[USICA]{.underline}**. The
sprawling, bipartisan 2,000-page proposal [aims to establish National
Science Foundation programs for the commercialization of artificial
intelligence, advanced computing and other areas while also protecting
domestic research and expanding trade provisions with
China]{.underline}. On the House side, bipartisan support is strong for
multiple bills that would double the National Science Foundation
research funding to \$78 billion over five years and direct \$50 billion
over the same time period for Department of Energy projects. "**[[This
is a generational scale investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in that type
[of **economic development**, in strengthening]{.mark} our **[core
research universities]{.mark}**, but also putting money in there for
translational research \[to private industry]{.underline}\]," said Brian
Kennedy, senior vice president of operations and government affairs for
the Pittsburgh Technology Council, which represents 1,000 companies in
the Pittsburgh region. The tech leader estimates that in "the very short
term" roughly \$100 million to \$200 million in funding could roll into
southwestern Pennsylvania. "But in all honesty I think that's just the
tip of the iceberg," said Mr. Kennedy, who cited what previous
investments have done for the university lab-to-company pipeline. "If
you look at Pittsburgh's story in terms of tech, it's really hard to
tell it without mentioning Carnegie Mellon and the University of
Pittsburgh," he continued. Mr. Kennedy traced the thread from inside the
robotics and computer science labs to the marquee Pittsburgh-based
manufacturing hubs and tech companies across the city. Carnegie Mellon
University's Advanced Robotics Institute established itself where once
the city's steel mills sat on Hazelwood Green. Argo AI has led
Pittsburgh to the forefront of autonomous vehicle testing, he said, and
Astrobotic soon will direct a mission to the moon from its North
Side-based control room. "[[It's]{.mark} the kind of [investments that
are front-and-center]{.mark} on the planet right now]{.underline} ---
[**[AI]{.underline}**, **[biotech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nology,
**[[cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These are all the core
capabilities of Pittsburgh, and [they're]{.underline} also [the core
things pressing everyone on the planet]{.underline}." China China's
advances in technological innovation have become a top concern among
tech leaders, defense officials and lawmakers. The world's second
largest economy became the top manufacturer of high-tech goods in 2020,
and it either already has sped ahead or is poised to overtake the U.S.
in the next decade in various advanced technologies, according to a
report published this month by the Harvard Kennedy School. [China has
become a major competitor]{.underline} to the U.S. in artificial
intelligence, and America's 5G infrastructure rollout is years behind
its rival, the study reported. Additionally, the report asserts that
while the U.S. is a leader in other areas, including semiconductor
design, green energy and cell therapy, [[China is building]{.mark}
competitive [capacity]{.mark} in manufacturing and
biotechnology]{.underline}. This leads some experts to conclude that
[[America's plan is behind the curve]{.underline}]{.mark}. "I wish they
passed this bill 10 years ago," said Kevin Chen, a professor with the
University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering. "This is
really a no brainer[. I can tell you what happens [if this bill is not
passed. The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as a country [is going to
continue to **under invest in technology**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[especially in this **important** **technology**]{.underline}," he said.
"Think about 5G. The U.S. government didn't invest a lot of R&D into 5G.
Who's leading right now? I think you know that: Huawei," he said,
referring to the Chinese tech company. "\... You don't want to be in
that situation for semiconductors." In either substance or rhetoric,
both U.S. chambers point to [the **[innovation
bills]{.mark}**]{.underline} as an **[[answer]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
[**[this threat]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[[It's]{.mark} one small step for Congress, [one **huge leap** for
American competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By passing]{.underline}
the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act ([USICA]{.underline}) with
strong bipartisan support, [[the Senate went a long way]{.mark} in
[countering]{.mark}]{.underline} what Secretary of State Antony Blinken
called "[[the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st
century]{.underline}]{.mark}" --- [[China's]{.mark}
[growing]{.mark}]{.underline} military, geopolitical, and economic
[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} under the leadership of General
Secretary Xi Jinping. Xi's biggest fear is for the United States to have
another Sputnik moment and commit to the equivalent of a moonshot.
[[USICA is designed to]{.underline}]{.mark} do exactly that by
**[[tak]{.mark}ing [the technological advantage away from
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** Inc. **[[and
return]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [[it to the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Ensuring tomorrow's technology is trusted
technology that empowers free societies facing perpetual authoritarian
threats. From my experience of creating categories by building four
market-leading companies, I can tell you securing these advanced
industries is not cheap. However, [when the government targets smart
investment in research and development with partners from the private
sector, we get a tremendous bang for our buck]{.underline}. [Just look
at]{.underline} the [Apollo]{.underline} program. Our \$140 billion
investment (today's dollars) put a man on the moon. [The program not
only led to American leadership in aerospace but resulted in hundreds of
spin-off products]{.underline} --- from kidney dialysis machines to
micro-electronics. It's still paying dividends. In 2018, U.S. leadership
in aerospace and commercial aviation contributed \$2.3 trillion in GDP
to the U.S. economy. That initial \$140 billion investment continues to
yield \$4.1 trillion in annual recurring GDP. [Since the 1960s, however,
[U.S. government]{.mark} long-term [investments in research have been
declining]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We once led the world. Now, we rank
9th]{.underline} globally in total R&D and 12th in publicly financed
R&D. Corporate investments are crucial, but they are typically
constrained to be shorter-term in nature due to the 90-day shot clock
for quarterly earnings. [[For the sake of our **national security and
continued global leadership**,]{.mark} [it\'s critical]{.mark} that
[high-tech R&D is a public-private partnership]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The **U.S**.]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**nnovation and
**[C]{.underline}**ompetition **[A]{.underline}**ct [has]{.underline}
quite a few [[valuable provisions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The main one is
its Endless Frontier Act component which authorizes about \$150 billion
over five years for scientific and technological research in 10
tech-intensive industries that America simply cannot cede to China Inc.,
including [semiconductors, 5G, AI, clean energy, cybersecurity, quantum,
robotics, biotechnology, and others]{.underline}. The CHIPS Act portion
of the USICA is derived from our team's historic \$12-billion onshoring
of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), appropriates
nearly \$53 billion to bring back American semiconductor manufacturing
after we lost it. The bill's crucial emphasis on Taiwan puts real muscle
behind the Lee Economic Prosperity Partnership and the Science and
Technology Agreement we signed as a result of my trip to Taiwan last
fall as the highest-ranking State Department official in 41 years. That
Taiwan trip was one of the reasons why this small-town Ohio boy ended up
No. 3 on Dictator Xi's sanctions list. I received this distinction not
for what I said as under secretary of State, but for serving my country
and getting results. However, the main reason was building the Clean
Network Alliance of Democracies, which defeated Xi's master plan to
control 5G through Huawei. The Wall Street Journal called the Clean
Network "an undisputed success" and perhaps the "most enduring
foreign-policy legacy" of the last four years. With Huawei now
neutralized, USICA's \$1.5 billion infusion for 5G innovation will
accelerate American companies' efforts to get back in the 5G game. The
Clean Network was a product of my mission to take economic statecraft to
the next level by developing and operationalizing a Global Economic
Security Strategy (GESS) --- which later became another bipartisan bill,
The Global Economic Security Strategy Act of 2019 --- aimed at driving
economic growth, maximizing national security, and combating economic
aggression. It consisted of three pillars: 1) turbocharge economic
competitiveness and innovation; 2) safeguard American's assets, such as
intellectual property, supply chains, financial and education systems;
and 3) form a network of trusted partnerships comprised of like-minded
countries, companies, and civil society that operates by a set of
democratic trust principles for all areas of economic collaboration,
which turned into the Clean Network. The Endless Frontier Act, initially
conceived in October 2019, was one of the byproducts of the first pillar
of the Global Economic Security Strategy. Our team at the State
Department worked with Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, a
Democrat from New York, and Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana,
to reboot America's technological leadership at a time when [we face an
urgent threat from the Chinese Communist Party.]{.underline} The
bipartisan legislation which was introduced a few months later was
designed to spawn tomorrow's trusted technology by boosting investment
in high-tech research vital to our national security. Most
significantly, [[USICA is a catalyst for such private-sector, and **even
allied**, R&D investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. The strategic plan
presented by Paul Touw, my senior advisor and fellow founder of Ariba,
and me to senators and congressmen demonstrated how to grow this
critical high-tech research investment to \$500 billion with matches
from the private sector and our closest technological allies. We later
validated this and garnered significant interest from companies and
countries that became members of the Clean Network. [The beauty of [this
approach]{.mark} is that it not only [compounds the government's R&D
funding]{.mark} in 10 national security sectors [but also
maximizes]{.mark} the commercialization of [those investments]{.mark} by
[leveraging private-sector resources and know-how]{.mark}]{.underline}.
From an economic diplomacy standpoint, [it also enhances collaboration
and increases economic competitiveness with our
Techno-Democracies]{.underline}-10 (TD-10) partners **[[to counter
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** Inc. The TD-10 was designed as a powerful
coalition of 10 to 12 like-minded countries assembled to compete with
China Inc. by focusing on the development, protection, dissemination,
and use of emerging technologies. USICA's focus on economic statecraft
with its investment in alliances and partnerships, coupled with the
increase of the Development Finance Corporation's (DFC) funding from
\$60 billion to \$100 billion, significantly bolsters the continued
expansion of Clean Network beyond the original six lines of effort.
USICA also gives a shot in the arm to the clean infrastructure
initiative we rolled out as the Blue Dot Network, aptly renamed the
Clean Green Network. It was gratifying to see the G-7 recently get
behind this initiative because it serves as an equitable and unifying
alternative to China's "One-Belt One-Way Toll Road to Beijing," as one
Asian foreign minister called it. [By passing the U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act, [the Senate did its part to send a powerful
message]{.mark} to our citizens, private sector, allies and the Chinese
Communist Party itself that America is united]{.underline} in its
commitment to preserve our precious freedom from authoritarianism.
[[It's **now the House's turn**]{.mark} to take the baton and then,
let's get on with the moonshot]{.underline}.

#### Solves through [start-up]{.underline} talent

**PTI 1-26**-2022 ("New legislation supported by Joe Biden proposes
startup visas to attract talent," *Business Today*,
<https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/world/story/new-legislation-supported-by-joe-biden-proposes-startup-visas-to-attract-talent-320373-2022-01-26>)

The ambitious [[America COMPETES]{.underline}]{.mark} Act of 2022, which
was introduced in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday, [[proposes
to open up **new visas**]{.mark} for talented individuals from across
the world with a new startup visa]{.underline}. President Joe Biden, who
supports the legislation, said the **[America Competes]{.underline}**
Act, 2022 is an important step forward in advancing legislation that
[will [make]{.mark} the **[supply chains stronger]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
[reinvigorate]{.mark} the [innovation]{.mark} engine of the country\'s
economy [to outcompete China]{.mark} and the rest of the **world [for
decades to come]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Act, among other things,
amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to create a new
classification of \"W\" non-immigrants for entrepreneurs with an
ownership interest in a startup entity, essential employees of a startup
entity and also their spouses and children. According to the provisions
of the bill released by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the bill when signed
into law directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish
procedures for foreign nationals with an ownership interest in a startup
entity to self-petition for lawful permanent resident status as an
immigrant entrepreneur if the entity demonstrates a proven track record
of success through job creation and significant revenue generation or
receipt of investment capital. It also directs the Secretary of Homeland
Security to establish procedures for foreign nationals with an ownership
interest in a startup entity to self-petition for classification as a
W-1 non-immigrant and to receive extensions of such classification for
up to eight years if the entity meets certain growth benchmarks.
[[It]{.mark} also [provides]{.mark} for]{.underline} a limited number of
W-2 [[visas for personnel who are essential to th]{.mark}e growth and
success of the [startup]{.mark} entity]{.underline} if the startup
serves as the basis for the W-1 status of a founder. The bill exempts
from the numerical limits on immigrant visas certain foreign nationals
(and the spouses and children of such aliens) who have earned a doctoral
degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) from a
qualified US research institution or a foreign institution if the degree
is the equivalent to a doctoral degree issued by a qualified US research
institution. The bill provides the Secretary of Homeland Security
discretion to classify an individual as a W-1 non-immigrant for a
three-year period initially if the individual possesses an ownership
interest of not less than 10 per cent in a startup entity, the foreign
individual will play a central and active role in the management or
operations of the startup entity or the applicant possesses the
knowledge, skills or experience to substantially assist the startup with
the growth and success of the business. During the 18-month period
preceding the filing of the petition, the startup entity needs to have
received at least USD 250,000 in qualifying investments from one or more
qualified investors or at least USD 100,000 in qualifying government
awards or grants, the bill notes. In a statement, Biden said [the
proposals]{.underline} laid out by the House and Senate [represent the
sort of transformational [investments]{.mark} in American industrial
base and research and development that [helped power the United
States]{.mark} [to lead the global economy]{.mark} in the 20th
century]{.underline} and expand opportunities for middle-class families.
\"[They will help [bring manufacturing jobs back]{.mark} to the United
States]{.underline} and they are squarely focussed on
[easing]{.underline} the sort of [supply chain bottlenecks like
semiconductors that have led to higher prices]{.underline} for the
middle class,\" he said. \"Building on the historic investments in the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I signed last year \-- and on signs
of progress like last week\'s Intel announcement and today\'s GM
announcement \-- comprehensive competitiveness legislation will power
our economy to create good-paying jobs for all Americans, no matter
where you live or whether you have a college degree, and will help
tackle the climate crisis,\" Biden said. \"Today, the House takes action
to transport our nation into the future, with the America COMPETES Act:
bold, results-oriented legislation that will strengthen America\'s
national and economic security and the financial security of families,
and advance our leadership in the world,\" Pelosi said. \"[America
COMPETES makes historic investments]{.underline} to strengthen
America\'s economy, security and global leadership. To compete
effectively with the People\'s Republic of China (PRC), the legislation
leverages our core strengths and values, and presents a positive,
whole-of-government agenda that rises to the challenges and
opportunities of the 21st century,\" said Congressman Gregory Meeks,
Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee. To bolster economic
competitiveness, America COMPETES has provisions to secure critical
supply chains, shape the rules and standards that govern global commerce
and development, empower American workers and businesses, and invest in
science and innovation, he said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer
said the introduction of the vital America COMPETES Act of 2022 in the
House is an important step forward to setting up a conference with the
Senate-passed US Innovation and Competition Act, so that they can
quickly negotiate a final bill for the president to sign into law. \"[We
have no time to waste in **[improving American
competitiveness]{.mark}**, [**strengthening our lead in global
innovation** and addressing **supply chain challenges**,]{.mark}
including in the semiconductor industry]{.underline},\" he said.

American-guaranteed collection of laws, democratic values, economic and
defense treaties that have produced seven unprecedented decades of peace
and prosperity, you'll wonder why you ever worried about anything else.
[[If U.S. global leadership slides]{.underline}]{.mark}, Kagan asserts,
[[the invisible protective bubble we've enjoyed since 1945 won't just
deflate. It will **explode**. Good-bye rules-based trade, hello
shortages of food]{.underline}]{.mark} and essential products.
[[Dictators not just threatening but **using nuclear weapons**. More
innocents repressed or killed in civilized
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. Cross-border migrations magnitudes
beyond the crises of today's detention centers and Mediterranean
rescues. Dark Forces Re-emerging The botanical metaphor in Kagan's book
title began our recent conversation. "We've been living in a tranquil
garden of largely peaceful practices and liberal expectations across
much of the world, ignoring the dark forces of jungle multiplying under
the rocks. If we don't defend civilization's cultivation---especially
American's guarantee of peace and economic integration across the
world---the toxic creatures and weeds will roar back." Thus China's
determined military rise, Russia's continuing aggressions, fiery
authoritarians on the march in so many once democratic countries. As
Kagan continued, "Trump has been damaging the system---he too seems to
have forgotten what good it has delivered---but actually America's
desire for maintaining the global order has been diminishing for years.
After the dissolution of the Soviet empire in the 1990s, people talked
about 'the end of history"---that America didn't have to worry anymore
about war or aggression. History doesn't end, it simply paused. The
ugliest aspects of human nature are surging again." Vanishing
Leadership, Vanishing Peace Kagan's apocalyptic message, repeated in
other recent writings, is lucid and terrifying, all the more devastating
for its relentless use of history. It's a footnoted plea that "we've
seen this movie before." He reminds us that Americans have frequently
turned away from defending world order, with regrettably familiar
outcomes: to be dragged in later at greater cost (e.g. helping to stop
Hitler earlier might have prevented World War II); or, simply hoping
that "the problem would go away," to watch it get ten times worse (e.g.
Obama's policy in Syria). Kagan acknowledges that America has sometimes
misstepped (e.g. Viet Nam, Iraq), but he still argues that [[overall our
**foreign engagement** has produced more peace and
prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark} than not. "History shows," he
summarized, "that world order has never been achieved without some
constructive force to keep the peace. The relative
**[[harmony]{.underline}]{.mark}** and fair play we've created in the
modern world [[**will vanish** if the U.S. forsakes international
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}."

From the COVID-19 pandemic and a deeply struggling economy to the
critical need for racial justice and immediate action on climate change,
President [[Biden]{.mark} now [confronts one of the most daunting
inheritances]{.mark} of any U.S. president]{.underline} in at least a
century. His administration also faces a looming strategic challenge:
whether the United States and its allies and partners will be able to
find common cause in [[accelerating]{.mark} the development of
[next-generation tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}. [[If the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and its democratic partners
[[develop]{.mark} and deploy next wave [tech]{.mark}nologies
[first]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[they will generate **significant
strategic advantages**]{.mark} [and strengthen]{.mark} [their position
in **rule-setting forums**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In turn, this [[will
enable them to help craft norms]{.mark} and regulations for emerging
technologies that are reflective of democratic values]{.underline}.
Simply put, **[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological [[competition sits
at the core of great power competition]{.mark} and ideological
rivalry]{.underline} for the 21st century and beyond. [And [with the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} and its democratic allies [[seeking to outpace
authoritarian regimes]{.mark} such as those in Beijing and Moscow,
[**tech innovation** will be a **critical determinant** of the
continued]{.mark} **strength and [resilience of the l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder**]{.underline}.

#### LIO solves nuclear war, climate change and tech disruption\-\--[all]{.underline} existential. 

**Harari 18**, Professor of History at Hebrew University of Jerusalem
(Yuval Noah, "We need a post-liberal order now," *The Economist*,
<https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now>)

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. [**All
attempts** to divide the world]{.mark} into clear-cut nations
have]{.underline} so far **[[resulted in war]{.mark} and
genocide]{.underline}**. When the heirs of Garibaldi, Mazzini and
Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it
proved impossible to find a clear line dividing Italians from Slovenes
or Poles from Ukrainians. This had set the stage for the second world
war. The key problem with the network of fortresses is that each
national fortress wants a bit more land, security and prosperity for
itself at the expense of the neighbors, and without the help of
universal values and global organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree
on any common rules. Walled fortresses are seldom friendly. But if you
happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as America or
Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a more
extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a global
empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny the
necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?" Such extreme
isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic realities.
Without a global trade network, all existing national economies will
collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries will not be
able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of almost all
products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing cost me
about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from Israeli-grown
cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing Israeli oil,
it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist leaders from Donald
Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on the global trade
network, but none thinks seriously of taking their country completely
out of that network. And we cannot have a global trade network without
some global order that sets the rules of the game. Even more
importantly, whether people like it or not,
[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
three [[common problems that]{.mark} make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that [can **only be solved through global
coop**]{.mark}**eration**. [These are **nuclear war, climate change
and**]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}nological [disruption]{.mark}**. You cannot
build a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming, and [no
nation can regulate]{.mark}]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.mark}) or [bioengineering single-handedly]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[It won't be enough if only the European Union]{.underline}]{.mark}
forbids producing killer robots [[or only America]{.underline}]{.mark}
bans genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential
of such disruptive technologies, if even one country
[[decides]{.underline}]{.mark} to pursue these high-risk high-gain
paths, other countries will be forced to follow its dangerous lead for
fear of being left behind. [[An **AI** ]{.mark}**arms race** [or]{.mark}
a **[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[[**guarantees the worst outcome**.]{.mark} Whoever wins]{.underline}
the arms race, **[[the loser will]{.mark} likely [be humanity]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms race, [all regulations will
collapse]{.underline}. Consider, for example, conducting
genetic-engineering experiments on human babies. Every country will say:
"We don't want to conduct such experiments---we are the good guys. But
how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We cannot afford to remain
behind. So we must do it before them." Similarly, [consider developing
autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline}, that can decide for themselves
whether to shoot and kill people. Again, [every country will say:
"This]{.underline} is a very dangerous technology, and it [should be
regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we don't trust our rivals to
regulate it, so we must develop it first]{.underline}". [[The **only
thing** that can]{.mark} [prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} such [destructive
[arms races is **greater trust**]{.mark} **between
countries**]{.underline}. [This is **not an impossible
mission**]{.underline}. If today the Germans promise the French: "Trust
us, we aren't developing killer robots in a secret laboratory under the
Bavarian Alps," the French are likely to believe the Germans, despite
the terrible history of these two countries. [We need to build such
trust globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point when Americans and
Chinese can trust one another like the French and Germans. Similarly, we
need to create a global safety-net to protect humans against the
economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will create
immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley, while the
worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose economies
depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to software
engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory workers and
truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is still very
national. [[Unless we find solutions on a global level]{.mark} to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and [the
resulting chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration
[[will **destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is
the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as Brexit. In
itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what Britain
and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit help
prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change? How
does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and bioengineering?
Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all of these
problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit is one
less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on regulating
AI. In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the
21st century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective [global
coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only viable
blueprint**]{.mark} for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered by
**[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, [governments]{.mark} all over the
world [are undermining]{.mark} the foundations of [the liberal
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the world is turning into a network of
fortresses. The first to feel the impact are the weakest members of
humanity, who find themselves without any fortress willing to protect
them: refugees, illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. But if the
walls keep rising, eventually the whole of humankind will feel the
squeeze.

### !\-\--AI Leadership Good

#### U.S. AI leadership solves geopolitical conflict

Princeton University, where he researches institutional reform in U.S.
foreign policy agencies

(Ryan Dukeman, Nov 25, 2020, "WINNING THE AI REVOLUTION FOR AMERICAN
DIPLOMACY," ability edited, War on the Rocks,

[Precognition [algorithms]{.mark}. [System-of-systems
\[shutdown\]]{.mark} ~~paralysis~~. An "all-seeing digital system of
social control]{.underline}." To nonexperts, these technologies may seem
incomprehensible --- the stuff of science fiction and 1984. But to
authoritarian states' military and political leadership, [these are
[game-changing]{.mark} [advances]{.mark} that [could]{.mark} be the key
**to [upend]{.mark}ing [the international]{.mark}
[system]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps most importantly, [some of these
technologies could be integrated sooner than one might
think]{.underline}. According to one prominent journalist, in China and
soon elsewhere, "the panopticon is already here." [[Big data and]{.mark}
artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark}) [are restructuring the
**geopolitical divide** between nations that harness its potential and
those that do not]{.mark}, [transforming]{.mark} the nature of
[conflict]{.mark}, [empowering]{.mark} [asymmetric and nonstate
actors]{.mark}, and yielding increasing returns for first
movers.]{.underline} [**[As oil factored]{.mark} significantly
[into]{.mark} the great geopolitical [conflicts of the 20th
century]{.mark}, [so too will the politics of data and artificial
intelligence]{.mark}** quickly become the politics of international
security, for better or for worse.]{.underline} As the Department of
Defense's 2018 AI strategy notes, "AI refers to the ability of machines
to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence --- for
example, recognizing patterns, learning from experience, drawing
conclusions, making predictions, or taking action --- whether digitally
or as the smart software behind autonomous physical systems." [[The
United States is the global leader]{.mark} in such technologies [for
now]{.mark}, but its national security bureaucracy is poorly configured
to capitalize on this advantage.]{.underline} In particular, the
government is sidelining the very agency that could both lead on the
global policy challenges of AI and benefit from applying AI to its way
of working. I'm talking, of course, about the State Department. Yes, you
read that right: For the United States to win the data wars, the State
Department should become an interagency leader in AI. While the AI and
national security debate has predominantly focused on its applications
in warfare, espionage, and homeland security (including election
security), it has so far missed the critical relevance of AI for
American diplomacy. This is a mistake, because in the coming decades AI
will be essential both as a top-tier agenda item in strategic
competition against digital authoritarianism and as a tool for more
responsive, informed, and effective foreign policymaking. AI is the next
"gray rhino" security threat: a slow-building event that, when it
finally hits, can be even [[more disruptive than]{.mark} conventionally
recognized [threats like **interstate rivalry** or
**terrorism**]{.mark}. As such, [it deserves an]{.mark} affirmative,
**cross-issue digital democracy [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}
championed by the State Department. The department is uniquely
positioned to lead on this agenda, leveraging the interdependent
security, human rights, and economic dimensions of AI to advance
governance in line with American values. Relatedly, the State Department
can also help right the "institutional imbalance" of a militarized
foreign policy and empower civilian diplomats by capitalizing on AI in
its ways of working, including areas like strategic planning, crisis
response, and other core diplomatic functions. A Digital Democracy
Agenda for the Next "Gray Rhino" The ongoing pandemic has broadened the
national security community's conception of threats to include so-called
gray rhinos. In addition to disease and the accelerating climate crisis,
AI presents the third such threat, but is unfortunately under-resourced
in current foreign policy budgeting. While the defense budget treats AI
as a technological innovation for guarding against other threats, the
national security and defense strategies do not treat it as a
significant threat in its own right. This is a mistake. [If poorly
managed, [the economic, security, and human rights impacts of
authoritarian-enabling AI pose a serious threat]{.mark} to the American
way of life, [and should be planned for and prioritized]{.mark}
accordingly.]{.underline} First and foremost, [frontier [technologies
constitute a digital battleground]{.mark} for near-peer competition
[between]{.mark} the [United States, China, and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. China in particular has focused diplomatic
and state-capitalist efforts on shaping a global approach to digital
governance that allows for unmitigated domestic surveillance and state
infringement on free speech. This effort is not just a mercantilist
attempt to supplant American firms' AI leadership with that of Chinese
state-owned enterprises --- it is also meant to shape an international
order reflective of China's abusive domestic system. These
[[techno-authoritarian models]{.mark} of digital governance [are in
direct opposition to American values and pose a threat to U.S.
leadership]{.mark} [on]{.mark} issues of [human rights, economic
security]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} protection of [intellectual
property]{.mark}]{.underline}. [AI]{.underline} similarly [enables
disinformation campaigns and election interference]{.underline} (e.g.,
through generative networks used to create deepfakes[), as well as more
advanced, detection-evading cyber attacks, [and thus should be]{.mark}
internationally [regulated as an **anti-democratic force
multiplier**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT Tech Bad

#### 4^th^ wave technologies are inevitable---the only question is does the U.S. get left behind

**XR Association White Paper 21**, THE INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY LANDSCAPE
OF THE FUTURE AND THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF IMMERSIVE TECHNOLOGIES,
https://xra.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EFA-White-Paper-Final.pdf

III\. ENSURING THE UNITED STATES SHAPES THE FUTURE TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEM
[[The]{.mark} [new industrial revolution is]{.mark} already
[underway]{.mark}]{.underline}, and immersive technologies are playing a
crucial role. In combination with other technologies, as well as on
their own, immersive technologies will bring dramatic changes to society
and to people's individual lives. Currently, VR applications can be
classified as industry applications or public applications. The former
includes areas such as manufacturing, medicine, education, military, and
e-commerce. The latter includes games, social networking, movies, and
live broadcast. As noted above, according to Goldman Sachs, the VR/AR
industry will reach USD \$80 billion by 2025. The XR era has emerged.
[[China recognized]{.mark} the outsized [potential of]{.mark} immersive
[technology]{.mark} years ago [and]{.mark} [has taken impressive
steps]{.mark}]{.underline} towards controlling its future. XR is
featured prominently in the CCP's Made in China 2025 strategy, and the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the National
Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Science and
Technology, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Commerce have
all released detailed strategies concerning XR. In addition, Chinese
provincial and municipal local governments are proactively building
industrial parks and labs to promote the development of local VR
industries.14 [[China is not the only nation investing heavily in XR.
Countries that had early 5G commercialization plans,]{.mark} including
[Japan]{.mark} and [South Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}, planned for VR as
a key 5G application field. Indeed, governments are generously funding
XR research and development, and [[XR-related inventions are increasing
exponentially.]{.underline}]{.mark} 16By the end of May 2017, the number
of global VR patents had reached 59,000, with about 29,000 patent
families. Those numbers have continued to grow. [[Now is the time for
the U.S. to step-up its]{.mark} public [investment]{.mark} in immersive
technology [and]{.mark} to [forge]{.mark} mutually-beneficial
[XR]{.mark} development and production [partnerships with U.S. allies
like]{.mark} the countries of [NATO, Southeast Asia, and
India]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Sino-U.S. relations continue to be **strained and**]{.mark} **further
[exacerbated]{.mark}** [by China's close ties with Russia and Beijing's
desire to stay neutral on]{.mark} the war in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Relations are low and impossible

**Qinggo 1-23**-2022, Professor and former Dean of the School of
International Studies at Peking University (Jia, "Waiting for spring to
come in China--US relations," *East Asia Forum*,
<https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/01/23/waiting-for-spring-to-come-in-china-us-relations/>)

[[At]{.mark} the beginning of [2021, there were modest
hopes]{.mark}]{.underline}. The good news was that Joe Biden had won the
US presidential election. Trump's trade war had sent the relationship
into a deep dive. His manipulation of the China question for domestic
political gain contributed to its further deterioration. His handling of
the Taiwan issue towards the end of his term increased the risk of
accidental conflict across the Taiwan Strait. [Biden is the polar
opposite of Trump]{.underline}. He belongs to the US policy mainstream,
characterised as professional, decent and cool-headed. Some believed
this was a positive sign for China--US relations and held prospect a
more pragmatic approach toward China. The Chinese government shared this
view and signalled its willingness to work with the new administration.
[[After]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} administration officially [took
office]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} Yang Jiechi, in charge of China's
foreign relations, said 'it is a task for both China and the United
States to restore the relationship to a predictable and constructive
track of development and build a model of interaction between the two
major countries that focuses on peaceful coexistence and win-win
cooperation'. But many in Washington interpreted Yang's message as an
effort to blame the United States for the problems between the two
countries instead of an expression of goodwill. On assuming office,
Secretary of State Antony Blinken defined the new administration's
approach towards China as a mixture of competition, confrontation and
cooperation. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} soon [[became clear that
competition]{.mark} [would continue to dominate US policy towards
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Washington blasted]{.mark} China's
behaviour on a range of issues, including Hong Kong, [Xinjiang]{.mark},
[Taiwan]{.mark}, the **[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**ea [and human rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. Blinken
labelled China's policies in Xinjiang as a 'genocide'. The Biden
administration also stepped up efforts to rally its allies to 'push
back' on China. [[Washington's uncompromising posture drew]{.mark}
frustration and [anger from]{.mark} Beijing]{.underline}. Many in
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** concluded that the Biden
administration's China policy was worse than the Trump administration's
since it sought to create an international anti-China front. A
tit-for-tat exchange between Beijing and Washington followed. At the two
countries' first high-level face-to-face meeting in Alaska on 13
November 2021, there was a heated exchange. Despite some cooperation on
particular issues, like climate change, the conflict between the two
sides has increased. The issue that drew the most attention turned out
to be Taiwan. Taiwan authorities' efforts to push for independence
coupled with increasing US endorsement and support elicited a tougher
stance from China, which included sending military aircraft to patrol
the vicinity of Taiwan. The vicious cycle of interactions between
Beijing, Taipei and Washington increased the likelihood of a military
showdown. Against this background, the virtual summit meeting between
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Biden on 16 November was more about how
to set guard rails for the relationship than exploring the possibility
of substantive cooperation. Despite the summit, the relationship between
Beijing and Washington continues to slide. The most recent bickering
includes a US official boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, sanctions
over Xinjiang and Chinese retaliation. Why has the relationship evolved
in this way? The rise of China has elevated security concerns among US
realists about China's strategic intentions, especially in the light of
China's military moves to defend its proclaimed territorial sovereignty
in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Political developments in
China have also disappointed US liberals who had banked on the hope of
encouraging political reform in China through engagement. [Trump's
race-to-the-bottom anti-China rhetoric provided a vent for frustration
with China for both US realists and liberals alike and contributed to a
political atmosphere in the United States in which being tough is the
right and only posture when it comes to China]{.underline}. [Given the
anti-China consensus in the US Congress]{.underline} and the slim
majority the governing Democrats enjoy, **[[Biden has had to remain
tough on China]{.underline}]{.mark}** to get anything done at home. This
includes the appointment of cabinet officials, passing bills to contain
COVID-19 and rebuilding infrastructure. How the two countries interacted
with each other, which was characterised by megaphone diplomacy for
domestic consumption, undermined any goodwill that remained for
stabilisation and improvement of the relationship. In the short run,
[[these factors are **unlikely to change**]{.mark}. [The 2022 mid-term
elections bode ill for]{.mark} China--US [relations]{.mark} because the
[Republicans]{.mark} [who stand]{.mark} on an [even tougher]{.mark}
policy toward China [appear likely to win]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under
these circumstances, the [Biden administration is unlikely to be able to
advance a pragmatic approach toward China]{.underline}. Ahead of the
20th Party Congress, [China is also unlikely to compromise]{.underline}.
**[[The stabilisation]{.mark} and improvement [of China--US relations is
likely to remain a distant prospect]{.mark}]{.underline}** for some time
yet.

[If [the first meeting between the Biden administration and Chinese

[[rejected that China should abide by the US-backed]{.mark}
"[rules-based international order]{.mark}"]{.underline} Blinken
advocated for, [which Yang noted is]{.underline} also "[advocated by a
small number of countries]{.underline}." Instead, Yang asserted it was
"important for all of us to come together to build a new type of

respect." [The **yawning gap between** the two sides makes it
clear]{.underline}: "[[This is the battle for the international

[more]{.underline}. [**[Anything less]{.underline}**,]{.mark} experts
said, [[would]{.mark} implicitly [invite China to run roughshod]{.mark}
over the world.]{.underline} Progress can still be made despite the
tensions. Where interests align --- on climate change, North Korea,
Afghanistan, and other issues --- both sides can find common ground. But
the American Enterprise Institute's Zack Cooper told me
[[cooperation]{.mark} for cooperation's sake [shouldn't be the desired
outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The goal should be a results-oriented
relationship," he said. "What's the point of discussion if we're not
actually going to resolve any of the problems?" Experts said this isn't
quite a new Cold War, though it may feel like it. That's because the
real sticking points are about trade, technology, and the rules of
cyberspace rather than the threat of nuclear annihilation. [This is a
superpower rivalry for a new era --- and it's likely going to get worse
before it gets better.]{.underline} "The relationship has deteriorated
to the worst point that I've seen in the last two decades," said
Economy. While ties haven't reached rock bottom, "[[we've got conflict
in]{.mark} pretty much **[every]{.mark} single [policy
area]{.mark}**.]{.underline}" [[Engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} with
China [[didn't]{.mark} [work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Biden is pursuing a
course correction.]{.underline} Engagement with China, meaning
consistent and significant dialogue on areas of mutual interest, defined
Washington-Beijing relations since the Nixon era. There was bipartisan
agreement on that in the US, and recent presidents George W. [Bush
and]{.underline} Barack [Obama]{.underline} both approached Beijing in
this way. Both [wanted China to become a "responsible
stakeholder]{.underline}." That's a wonderfully wonky Washington term
that mostly means they hoped Beijing would come to abide by the global
rules of the game on everything from trade to military affairs to
international relations, even as the country gained immense power.
[[Instead of]{.mark} bullying or [threatening China]{.mark} to force it
to stop doing things like cheating on international trade rules,
stealing other countries' intellectual property, and grievously
violating human rights at home]{.underline} (among other things), [[the
strategy was to develop close]{.mark} economic [ties]{.mark} with
China]{.underline} and encourage it to become more integrated into the
world economy. [[The hope was that would lead Beijing to start
acting]{.mark} more [responsibly]{.mark} on its own because it would be
in its self-interest to do so. **[That didn't
happen]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though. [Instead,
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} under President Xi Jinping [[became]{.mark}
more [authoritarian]{.mark} internally [and]{.mark} far more
[aggressive]{.mark} on the world stage.]{.underline} Among many acts,
[China has forcibly placed roughly]{.underline} 2 million [Uyghur
Muslims in concentration]{.underline} camps, [stripped Hong Kong of its
democracy, and turned Taiwan into a global flashpoint that could erupt
into a much larger conflict.]{.underline} And [its aggressive behavior
toward the US and its interests continues]{.underline}. B[eijing has
stolen US tech]{.underline}nological and personnel [secrets]{.underline}
for its own advantage, [antagonized US allies]{.underline} in the South
China Sea, [killed]{.underline} or imprisoned more than a dozen American
[informants]{.underline}, and [taken millions of]{.underline} US
[jobs]{.underline} over the past two decades. Most recently, China
reportedly [hacked America's payroll agency.]{.underline} The Trump
administration, then, felt it was time for the US to correct course.
"What do the American people have to show now, 50 years on from
engagement with China?" Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
asked a crowd at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum last
month. "The old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won't get
it done. We must not continue it and we must not return to it." [Trump's
team confronted China mostly via a trade war]{.underline}, aiming to
hurt Beijing's economy by displacing it from the center of global supply
chains and barring it from exporting some of its technology to the US
and partner nations. [That approach partially worked]{.underline}, in
that some jobs in China moved elsewhere, Beijing suffered an economic
slowdown, and certain allies were made more skeptical of Chinese
technologies companies like Huawei. Trump's actions also socialized the
idea in Washington that competition with China was a worthwhile
endeavor, even if his methods didn't receive bipartisan support. [But
most [experts warned]{.mark} that the administration's [unilateral
plan]{.mark} of attack]{.underline}, [[without **significant
buy-in**]{.mark} **from other countries**]{.underline}, [[wouldn't be
enough to compel Beijing]{.mark} to alter its behavior]{.underline}.
[They were right.]{.underline} As Trump left office, China, for example,
proceeded to imprison Uyghurs and take more control of Hong Kong while
doing little to change its trading practices with the US. All that
bluster, then, didn't accomplish Trump's goal of fundamentally changing
the way Beijing acted in the world. [Enter]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration. [[Biden's China strategy is
competitive]{.underline}]{.mark} by nature [Biden has been clear on the
need to counter China]{.underline}. "American leadership must meet this
new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing
ambitions of China to rival the United States," he said during a
February speech. "We'll confront China's economic abuses; counter its
aggressive, coercive action; to push back on China's attack on human
rights, intellectual property, and global governance. But we are ready
to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so," he
continued. Pushing Beijing to protect human rights and not use force or
coercion to achieve its goals, while leaving the door to cooperate on
areas of mutual interest, is the Biden administration's China game plan.
"[Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be,
collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must
be]{.underline}," Blinken said during a March 3 foreign policy address.
To do that, the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [has two
main plays.]{.underline} First, [they hope to [enlist allies]{.mark} and
partners [in an]{.mark} international [effort to compel Beijing]{.mark}
to change its ways.]{.underline} Biden firmly believes the US will only
get the upper hand on China by proving it has a coalition of friends
willing to thwart Beijing's most troublesome policies in unison. Think
of it like a geopolitical gang-up: [the US and its crew versus a mostly
lonely China]{.underline}. "[[We need to rally the democratic world
together more than eve]{.mark}r]{.underline}," a former Biden staffer
told me last year. "It'll be a democratic alliance to save the world."
Biden's meeting earlier this month with "the Quad" --- a coalition of
anti-China nations featuring India, Australia, and Japan --- is case in
point. While they don't openly say the express aim of the group is to
counter Beijing's actions in the Indo-Pacific, most experts say that is
very clearly the point of the group. Second, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [wants to revitalize America at home]{.underline}. That
means, among other things, improving the nation's democracy, pursuing
racial equity, becoming more competitive economically and
technologically, and rebuilding trust in the US as the world's leader.
This is an important part of the China plan, experts say. "We've got a
lot of work to do," said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power
Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank
in Washington, DC. "It's a whole issue of rejuvenating America." The
thinking, most experts and US officials note, is [that [a stronger
America working]{.underline}]{.mark} [in lockstep [with]{.mark} [allies
will give it more leverage to challenge China's aggressions]{.mark} and
influence when working with Beijing on shared concerns.]{.underline}

[There seems to be a growing consensus in Beijing that U.[S.-China
relations will **remain rocky**]{.mark} for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. Even so, President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}
Jinping and others [[have been touting that]{.mark} [time]{.mark} and
momentum [are on China's side]{.mark} in its quest [to move]{.mark}
closer [to the center of the world stage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese
officials recognize that they will need to overcome obstacles in their
country's pursuit of its national goals. To do so, [[China appears to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} pursuing a three-pronged medium-term strategy:
maintaining a non-hostile external environment in order to focus on
domestic priorities; [[reducing dependence on America]{.mark} while
increasing the rest of the world's dependence on China]{.underline};
[[and expanding]{.mark} the reach of [Chinese influence
overseas]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, China's actions are
generating significant reactions, both at home and abroad. Whether China
can learn from this feedback loop to address its own vulnerabilities
remains an open question, one that only China will be capable of
answering. [Understanding China's]{.underline} evaluation of -- and
[response to]{.underline} -- [sharp shifts in U.S.-China
relations]{.underline} and its international environment
[have]{.underline} **[rarely been more important]{.underline}**. [Given
its expanding economic reach and growing strategic weight]{.underline},
[China's actions now directly impact lives in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and around the world.]{.underline} Yet, in some
respects, it has become more difficult to see clearly what assumptions
and decisions are guiding China's changing approach to America and the
world. There has been more heat than light in many recent American
debates about China's ambitions. Travel restrictions due to COVID-19
have eliminated opportunities for both informal in-person exchanges with
Chinese officials and first-hand observation of Chinese society, which
often have served as one of the richest sources of insight into the
policy zeitgeist in Beijing. And into this vacuum, many American
scholars have come to rely more on interpreting official and
semi-official Chinese texts to develop conclusions on China's strategic
direction. ​My previous government service at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
and in the White House National Security Council (NSC) has instilled me
with humility about extrapolating China's strategic designs from its
publicly available statements and reports. Nevertheless, drawing from
over 50 hours of Zoom-based dialogues with Chinese officials and
scholars, a review of Chinese officials' speeches and Chinese expert
commentaries, and over a decade of interacting with senior Chinese
officials on such questions, I do believe it is possible to draw some
preliminary observations about China's evolving approach to its changing
international environment. ​The starting point of my analysis is to
observe how far Chinese foreign policy has moved during the past two
years. Writing for China Leadership Monitor in March 2019, former Obama
administration National Security Council (NSC) Senior Director for Asia
Evan Medeiros observed that, "[[China's reaction]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}
overtly [[hostile China strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}\]
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} far more [[cautious]{.underline}]{.mark} --
and even conciliatory at times -- than confrontational. Beijing was
primarily focused on limiting down-side risk and, to a limited extent,
exploring opportunities for upside gains."\[1\] Medeiros concluded, "A
pattern became very clear in 2018: in the face of confrontational U.S.
statements and actions, China maintained substantial engagement with a
wide variety of Americans, made very careful public statements, and
advocated negotiated solutions. Calibration and proportionality were
driving China's playbook far more than the tactics of opprobrium,
isolation, and push-back."\[2\] ​[[This]{.mark} evaluation of China's
[orientation]{.mark} toward the United States [remained]{.mark} largely
[intact through January 2020]{.mark}]{.underline}, [when both sides
finalized negotiations on a "phase-1" trade deal]{.underline}. [[In the
weeks that followed, **the**]{.mark} **bilateral [dynamic shifted
sharply]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Facing the humanitarian and financial
losses resulting from the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19, President
[Trump shifted from touting Xi]{.underline} Jinping [as his friend to
branding China as his enemy]{.underline} and the source of the pain that
many Americans were feeling. [And China largely
reciprocated]{.underline}, pointing its propaganda cannons at America's
response to the public health crisis and the cascade of social,
economic, and political problems that flowed from it. In subsequent
months, [[a tit-for-tat pattern emerged]{.underline}]{.mark}, e.g., on
treatment of each side's journalists, on consulate closures, on
recriminations over each side's involvement in the origin of COVID-19,
and on sanctions of high-level individuals in both countries. [Beijing
began mirror-imaging America's economic pressure toolkit]{.underline}.
Like the United States, China developed laws and regulations for export
controls, national security investment screening, policy-related visa
sanctions, and extraterritorial provisions in laws and administrative
regulations. [[Beijing]{.mark} also [grew **less restrained**]{.mark} in
its actions [at home and abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Chinese
authorities advanced a campaign of brutal suppression in
Xinjiang]{.underline}, [tightened control of Hong Kong]{.underline},
crushed dissent across the country, engaged in [deadly clashes with
Indian troops]{.underline} for the first time in 45 years, punished
countries and individuals that challenged China's preferred narratives
on sensitive issues, and [pointedly criticized the performance of
Western democracies]{.underline}. [[These actions represented a
**significant departure** from the foreign policy focus on
calibration]{.mark} and caution [that HAD BEEN observable as recently as
spring 2019]{.mark}.]{.underline} CHINA'S EVALUATION OF THE UNITED
STATES [There appears to be broad agreement among officials and experts
in China that America's power in the international system is declining
relative to China's]{.underline}. Many Chinese experts diagnose
America's anxiety about its relative decline as driving its reflexive
efforts to undermine China's rise. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign
Minister Wang Yi gave expression to this viewpoint, for example, in his
end-of-year interview with Xinhua on January 2, 2021. Reflecting on
U.S.-China relations over the previous year, Wang concluded: ​In recent
years, [[China-US relations have run into **unprecedented
difficulties**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fundamentally, [it comes down to
serious misconceptions of U.S. policymakers about China]{.underline}.
Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy
based on this misperception is simply wrong. What has happened proves
that the U.S. attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not
just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused
severe disruptions to the world. ...China policy toward the United
States is consistent and stable.\[3\] ​In other words, Wang put forward
Beijing's boilerplate explanation for the downturn in relations -- it's
America's fault. ​There are a diminishing number of Chinese officials or
experts who remain willing, at least visibly, to question this
explanation of the downturn in U.S.-China relations. One of the few to
do so, albeit subtly, is Wang Jisi, president of the Institute of
International and Strategic Studies at Peking University. In a January
2021 op-ed, Wang observed, "Our actions at home and in the world
determine to a large extent the attitude of the U.S. toward us. I
believe that China, not the United States, can turn the tide of
U.S.-China relations at historical junctures, although this position may
be debatable."\[4\] ​One issue where there does appear to be convergence
of views inside China, though, is the expectation that there will be
continuity in America's strategic orientation toward China from Trump to
Biden. [Even as [Chinese experts]{.mark} acknowledge that the Biden
administration likely will adopt a more nuanced tone and professional
approach for dealing with problems, they expect [the **root causes** of
American antagonism toward China will remain
unchanged]{.mark}.]{.underline} Reflecting this view, Yuan Peng, an
advisor to China's top leaders and president of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), assesses, "A divided
United States and polarized politics will limit Biden's room to maneuver
and force him to focus more energy on domestic challenges. ...Biden's
first priority is to reunite the United States. ...The U.S. will be
consumed with dealing with its own structural challenges for many
years."\[5\] Peking University's Wang Jisi similarly has concluded,
"American policy toward China will continue unchanged under Biden."\[6\]
[[Beijing appears to be preparing for a long-term struggle with
a]{.mark} [declining]{.mark} but still dangerous [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} Privately, according to a well-informed
policy advisor, [[China's leadership has]{.mark} re-evaluated long-term
trends and [concluded that it **no longer can base its**
]{.mark}**national [plans on expectations]{.mark} [of]{.mark} generally
[stable relations with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}.\[7\] Partly as a result, [Chinese
leaders have pulled forward plans to promote a "dual circulation"
economic strategy]{.underline}. In rolling out the strategy, President
Xi Jinping explained, "Only by being self-reliant and developing the
domestic market and smoothing out internal circulation can we achieve
vibrant growth and development, regardless of the hostility in the
outside world."\[8\] China's spokespeople and official Chinese state
media have sought to set public expectations for a long-term struggle
with the United States. Key security officials, such as Politburo member
and domestic security chief Guo Shengkun, have warned of the likelihood
of a long-term struggle with the United States.\[9\] ​CHINA'S EVALUATION
OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM China's leaders now often refer to "profound
changes unseen in a century" to describe their evaluation of the current
fluidity IN the international system. These changes often are presented
as a paradox, presenting both risks and opportunities for China. ​On one
side of the coin, "profound changes unseen in a century" portend
dangerous challenges to China. Politburo member and top diplomat Yang
Jiechi framed the challenges by noting, "The world economy has been hit
hard. ...The pandemic has had a tremendous impact on international
trade, investment, consumption, and other economic activities. ...The
pandemic \[also\] has exacerbated social cleavages, ethnic conflicts,
and political confrontations. ...The number of international security
risks has increased."\[10\] On the other side of the coin, Yang
observed, "Reform of the international order has sped up. The PRC has
taken the lead in controlling the epidemic on a global scale, and in
achieving full resumption of work and production, all parties have
increased their expectation and reliance on China."\[11\] ​Thus, [despite
expectations of a protracted struggle with the United
States]{.underline}, [[a view of China as an **ever more central actor
in the international system** appears to be gaining traction inside
China]{.mark}.]{.underline} At least outwardly, [China's leaders have
grown self-congratulatory in their assessment of global trends working
in China's favor.]{.underline} In October, Xi Jinping told cadres at the
5th Plenum that "time and momentum are on our side."\[12\] Similarly,
Chen Yixin, secretary general of the Central Political and Legal Affairs
Commission -- the top oversight body for China's domestic security --
told a study session on January 15, "The rise of China is a major
variable \[in the world today\]...the rise of the East and decline of
the West has become a trend; changes of the international landscape are
in our favor."\[13\] CHINA'S STRATEGIC GOALS Discerning Beijing's
medium- and long-term strategic objectives has become one of the most
heated debates in Western discourse on China. Proponents of viewing
China as a malevolent power that seeks to impose its vision and its
values on the rest of the world have been emboldened in recent years,
largely as a result of China's brutish behavior at home and abroad.
China's trampling of its citizens' rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong has
undermined arguments outside of China that the country will pursue its
national ambitions in a benign manner. From my vantage, [Beijing sees
itself as progressing along a continuum leading to China's restoration
as a central actor]{.underline} in Asia and a leading power [on the
world stage]{.underline}, a country [with greater ability to shape
rules, norms, and institutions toward its preferences]{.underline}.
China's leaders have consistently made clear their desire to have their
political and economic models respected.\[14\] It also has been a
consistent feature of Chinese foreign policy to push for deference to
its "core interests."\[15\] China's foreign policy practitioners have
explained that the country's external relations should support its
national goals, particularly its sustainable development.\[16\] These
goals include realization of the country's 14th five-year plan, its 2035
plan, and its second centenary goal of becoming a prosperous, strong,
advanced country by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 2049.\[17\] In recent years, [key Chinese
voices also have become more willing to articulate China's global
ambitions]{.underline}. For example, Politburo member Yang Jiechi has
written about the need for China's foreign policy to lay a foundation
"for national rejuvenation and provide an important guarantee for us to
lead the world's great changes and shape the external environment"
(emphasis added).\[18\] ​[[To reach its long-term goals, Beijing
recognizes it must]{.mark} first [overcome]{.mark} near-term
[obstacles]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[One such potential obstacle is the
formation of allied blocs to]{.mark} oppose Chinese initiatives and to
[obstruct China's rise]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Such concerns have taken
on added urgency]{.underline}]{.mark} with Joe Biden's election as
President [[given Biden's]{.mark} sustained [emphasis on coordinating
with allies]{.mark} and partners to push back against Chinese behaviors
of concern.]{.underline}

### AT Semiconductor Turn

#### Zero the turn---it's a cartoon---China won't invade to get semiconductors because it would never work

**Calhoun 21** (George, Quantitative Finance Program Director, at
Stevens Inst. of Technology, the same guy who probably wrote the other
team's card, but this one is 17 days later, "Why China (Probably) Won't
Go To War Over Taiwan's Semiconductor Riches" 9/29/21

In a recent column, [I drew the [parallels between]{.mark}]{.underline}
the economic and geopolitical tensions entangling
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1941 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
challenges facing [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} today. **[The storyline
[is cartoonishly simple]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 1941, Japan's
constricted access to a critical resource (oil) led them to launch
military action in Southeast Asia and the Pacific (including Pearl
Harbor). It also aligned with their expansionist pretensions (they were
already in Manchuria and parts of the mainland by then). In 2021, China
is feeling similarly constricted for a critical resource
(semiconductors), and Beijing's policy options for addressing this
problem might seem to converge with its expansionary tendencies, and its
long-term concerns over the status of Taiwan. [Could taking over Taiwan
also solve the semiconductor problem?]{.underline} China has tried for
over two decades to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in
semiconductor technology, with very limited success. Meanwhile, Taiwan
has become a dominant power in the global semiconductor industry.
Something like 75% of the world's integrated circuit manufacturing
capacity is based there. When it comes to the most advanced fabrication
technologies, Taiwan outshines even the U.S. today -- for example, 92%
of the world's capacity for the manufacturing "nodes" of 10 nanometers
and below is currently located in Taiwan. [Is the prize ripe enough to
provoke Beijing to start a war?]{.underline} Does this construct make
sense? Is military action by China, aimed at annexing Taiwan and taking
control of Taiwanese semiconductor assets, likely? Is it even feasible?
The short answer is **[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[War would not solve
China's problem]{.underline}]{.mark}. We should assume that [[Beijing
understands that]{.mark}. The]{.underline} counter[[arguments]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} a [military]{.mark} scenario]{.underline} -- at least
one that is [driven by]{.underline} China's [semiconductor
constraints]{.underline} -- **[[are very strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The caveats fall into three inter-locking categories: Technological
Issues Industry Structure Issues Supply Chain Issues \[In pulling
together what follows, I want to acknowledge -- and recommend -- two
particularly valuable sources: A Report issued in June 2021 by The White
House (& the Department of Commerce for the relevant section on
Semiconductors), entitled "Building Resilient Supply Chains,
Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad-Based Growth -
100-Day Review Under Executive Order 14017" A Report issued in April
2021 by the Boston Consulting Group and the Semiconductor Industry
Association, entitled "Strengthening the Global Semiconductor Supply
Chain in an Uncertain Era"\] [**Technology Challenges** The Japanese had
it easy]{.underline}. In 1941, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) was
the fourth-largest exporter of oil in the world, behind the U.S., Iran,
and Romania. When Japan invaded Southeast Asia in late 1941 and early
1942, their military strategy was predicated above all upon surprise --
to secure these oil fields intact, denying the Dutch or the British the
chance to destroy the wells and refineries. Japan was largely
successful, and once in possession, could pump the oil without
difficulty (until American forces eventually forced them out). It was
feasible to take over the assets by force, and maintain them in full
operation. The grab worked. [This is not the case for Taiwanese
semiconductor]{.underline} manufacturing [facilities]{.underline}
("foundries"). Integrated circuit ([[IC]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[fabrication]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [the most
[complex]{.mark} manufacturing operation]{.underline} ever developed. It
is also one of the most fragile, in the sense that it operates with
extraordinarily tight tolerances for both the purity of the raw
materials, and "the subatomic level of precision" at which many of the
steps in the fabrication process are carried out. [The
[tech]{.mark}nological [challenges are]{.mark} severe]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} constitute [[a **significant barrier** to the success
of any hostile takeover]{.mark}.]{.underline} Complexity as a Barrier IC
fabrication is "an incredibly complex process, involving hundreds of
steps completed over several months" (White House Report). (It is also
incredibly expensive -- but that is another story. If the solution was
simply financial, China might have an easier time of it.) There are many
stages in the conversion of raw silicon into a finished integrated
circuit, as shown in this graphic drawn from the BCG/SIA Report: This is
not a single-loop process. Stages 1 through 4 here may be "repeated
hundreds of times with different chemicals to create more layers,
depending on the desired circuit features" (BCG/SIA). For the most
advanced IC fab techniques, it takes 2 to 3 months to complete the
fabrication of a wafer. [The complexity is challenging even for the
industry leaders]{.underline}, who have decades of experience. Even
Intel, the largest semiconductor company in the world by sales, and
generally regarded as the inventor of the first commercially available
microprocessor IC's, has stumbled in its manufacturing program, falling
behind Taiwan Semiconductor Mftg Corp. and Samsung in the development of
the latest generation of chip fabrication technologies. [This is not a
plug-and-play business]{.underline}. There is an immense amount of human
know-how and expert technical skill involved in operating this
mega-machine. [[Even if China]{.mark} were to [find itself in]{.mark}
intact [possession of]{.mark} the physical [infrastructure]{.mark} in
Taiwan's foundries]{.underline} tomorrow, [[would they know how to run
it]{.mark} on their own? **O[f course not.]{.mark}**]{.underline} They
don't have the experience. (Mainland Chinese IC companies have been
frantic to recruit Taiwanese experts to help get their operations
going.) Following a takeover, the new [Chinese owners would still be
heavily reliant upon the highly-skilled Taiwanese workforce they had
just "annexed."]{.underline} It takes little imagination to see how
disaffection, or outright defection, of key employees could become the
proverbial monkey wrench. The cotton fields in Xinjiang may be workable
with forced labor, but an IC foundry is not. **[Fragility]{.underline}**
As A Barrier: The Challenge of the "11 Nines" Every stage of IC
fabrication is based on extremely tight tolerances. This applies to the
raw materials, all the inputs to the production process, "ultra pure
gases, ultra pure water" - even the electricity must be ultra-reliable.
The entire process must take place in "cleanrooms" -- "Typical ambient
room air contains 35,000,000 particles for each cubic meter in the size
range 0.5 μm or larger while an ISO 1 cleanroom permits no particles in
that size range and just 12 particles for each cubic meter of 0.3 μm and
smaller." (Wikipedia) The extreme purity required for the silicon wafers
is indicative: "The semiconductor chain begins with polysilicon of
ultra-high purity -- 99.99999999999 percent pure... often referred to as
"11 Nines" -- with impurities equal to just one grain of sand in 16
Olympic-sized swimming pools." - White House Report In other words,
[[two grains of sand]{.underline}]{.mark}, or 13 specs of dust (so to
speak) [[will bring down the house]{.mark}.]{.underline} Leaving aside
the possibility of sabotage, as well as the sort of disruptions that
occur in military operations, or indeed with management changes of any
kind, the traditional "happy with crappy" approach of many mainland
Chinese manufacturers is not likely to mesh well with these super-tight
tolerances. All in all, transferring an IC fabrication facility and
capability under the conditions of a Chinese takeover would not be a
turn-key proposition. **[Industry Structure Issues]{.underline}**
Although it is often referred to as if it were a monolithic category,
[the Semiconductor industry includes companies with very different
business models]{.underline}. A very simplified breakdown into the key
sub-sectors is shown here. (There will be a more detailed column on this
coming soon.) All of these functions must interact to produce an
integrated circuit, and all these businesses are thus mutually
dependent. Control of one segment is not enough to constitute
self-sufficiency. For that, a country would need to have a strong
presence in all of these segments. A rundown of the current national
positioning in these segments would show the following: Design: This
segment creates 50% of the total value added to a chip (according to the
BCG/SIA report). The U.S. dominates the Design segment (e.g., the
fabless IC companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia and many others). China
has virtually no foothold. Fabrication (Foundries): This segment creates
24% of the value-added. It is dominated by Taiwan (principally Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., TSMC). China is trying to become a
player, but they are several generations behind the leader and have only
a very small market share. Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment: This
is the most tech-intensive segment, and accounts for 11% of the
value-added. It is dominated by the U.S., with significant shares also
held by Japanese and one Dutch company. China has no real share of this
market. Assembly/Packaging/Test: This is the most commoditized segment,
providing just 6% of the value-added. China has a modest presence in
this business. Thus, even if we imagine that Taiwan's presence in the
foundry segment were to flip over, or be absorbed, without impairment,
into the Chinese semiconductor economy, that would not provide Beijing
with the self-sufficiency it wants. Foundries are expensive to build and
challenging to operate, but the U.S. has the inherent capability to do
it. It would be painful but we could cope. China as yet lacks the means
to develop the Design and Manufacturing Equipment capabilities ---
without which the foundries cannot function. In other words, [[if there
were to be a complete break]{.underline}]{.mark} -- or, as the wonks
like to put it nowadays, if there were a "decoupling" of the global
semiconductor supply chain -- which would hurt everyone, a lot, at least
for a while -- [[the U.S. would be in a better position]{.mark} to
adjust [than China]{.mark} would be. **[Supply Chain]{.mark}
Challenges**]{.underline} The reference to [the global supply chain
[raises]{.mark} the third strategic [obstacle]{.mark} to any plan to
"solve" China's semiconductor problem by annexing Taiwan]{.underline}
and its foundries. As the White House Reports states, "[The supply
chains for semiconductor manufacturing are immense]{.underline}." The
micro-level technological fragility of the fabrication facility
described above is mirrored at the macro-level by the tremendous
complexity of the semiconductor supply chain, and the corresponding
vulnerability of many of the linkages in those networks. The White House
Report zeroes in on one example, involving one input category
(chemicals) and one IC type (memory chips): "Aside from the immediately
apparent inputs such as wafers and photomasks, [[the manufacturing of
semiconductors requires hundreds of chemicals]{.mark} and dozens of
gases]{.underline}. A 2018 study of chemical use in two memory device
fabrication facilities found they each used over 400 chemical products
weighing over 45,000 tons per year. As many as 49 gases alone may be
used in semiconductor production. Many of these chemicals have their own
extensive supply chains that may depend on limited or single sources of
supply." The networks created to support the production of a single IC
can be vast. According to an Accenture report published in 2020 - "Each
segment of the semiconductor value chain has, on average, 25 countries
involved in the direct supply chain and 23 countries involved in
supporting market functions. In fact, a semiconductor product could
cross international borders approximately 70 or more times before
finally making it to the end customer." Individual companies are
enmeshed in these networks to an astonishing degree of dependency. "The
Semiconductor Industry Association notes that one of its members has
over 16,000 suppliers, more than half outside the United States." --
White House Report Autarky Is Impossible [The conclusion]{.underline} --
that is, the rational conclusion -- [is that [the military solution
**would not work for China**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Taiwanese
dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} of the foundry segment is a very
important feature of the semiconductor industry and indeed of the 21st
century digital economy. But it is not a standalone asset, viewed from a
macro perspective. It [[is part of a globalized eco-system that China
cannot]{.mark} really [escape from]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nor is it, as
shown, a turn-key-able asset, a fungible capability that could easily be
placed under "new management" in the event of a military takeover. [The
technological and logistical complexity of this critical sector
invalidate any theory of "semiconductor autarky"]{.underline} or full
self-sufficiency, certainly for China -- and probably also for the U.S.
(a caveat for the CHIPS bill and other measures gestating in Congress
right now).

### AT China Peaceful

#### China is revisionist\-\--the [Xi doctrine]{.underline} declares Chinese [territorial expansion]{.underline} and risks a CCP [nuclear Pearl Harbor]{.underline}. 

**Thayer and Han** **19**, \*Bradley A. Thayer is Professor of Political
Science at the University of Texas San Antonio. \*Lianchao Han is vice
president of Citizen Power Initiatives for China and a visiting fellow
at the Hudson Institute. (June 12^th^, 2019, "The 'Xi Doctrine':
Proclaiming and Rationalizing China's Aggression," *National Interest*,
[https://nationalinterest.org/feature/%E2%80%98xi-doctrine%E2%80%99-proclaiming-and-rationalizing-china%E2%80%99s-aggression-62402](about:blank))

Using the occasion of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this month,
[Chinese [Minister of]{.mark} National [Defense]{.mark}]{.underline} and
State Councilor Gen. [Wei]{.underline} Fenghe,
[[delivered]{.underline}]{.mark} a sharp message to the United States,
which may be termed [[the "Xi Doctrine" on]{.mark} China's [use of
force]{.mark}]{.underline}, after Chinese premier Xi Jinping. Wei
declaring both China's resolve to aggress to advance its interests and a
rationalization for the use of force. [Wei's]{.underline} de facto
[threat of war should not be lost]{.underline} in his nuances,
deliberate ambiguity, or in translation. [His remarks were so bellicose
that the world has noticed, as was]{.underline} certainly [intended by
the]{.underline} leadership of the Chinese Communist Party
([CCP)]{.underline}.

[[Empirical evidence of]{.mark} China's [aggression is]{.mark}
increasingly [common]{.mark}, [from]{.mark} its [attempt to]{.mark}
**[dominate]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} **[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, [the
**[neo-imperialist]{.mark} effort** to gain control of states through
the [Belt and Road]{.mark}]{.underline} Initiative, [to its
[technological imperialism]{.mark} to]{.underline} [control]{.underline}
5G and [artificial intelligence]{.underline} technologies. [What
is]{.underline} rather [less frequent are [statements]{.mark} from
high-level Chinese officials [proclaiming the country's]{.mark}
**[intent]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark} **[aggressive]{.mark}** and offering
an attempted legitimizing principle **justifying** that
**aggression**.]{.underline}

While much of the content of Wei's remarks were in keeping with the
gossamer pronouncements on China's peaceful intentions, as well as a
paean to Xi Jinping's leadership, they still conveyed that China is
ready and willing to resort to war if the United States stands in its
way of global expansion; and [they made clear that China must go
to]{.underline} war, or even a **[nuclear war]{.underline}**, [to occupy
Taiwan.]{.underline}

Specifically, there are four elements that comprise the Xi Doctrine and
are indications of China's signaling its willingness to use force. The
first component is a new and alarming proclamation of the undisguised
threats to use force or wage an unlimited war. [China is becoming bolder
as its military power grows.]{.underline} This is evidenced in Wei's
muscular remarks on the People's Republic of China's approach against
Taiwan, his explicit statement that China does not renounce the use of
force against Taiwan, and his effort to deter the United States and its
allies from intervention should an attack occur. Wei forcefully stated:
"If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has
no choice but must go to war, and must fight for the reunification of
the motherland at all costs." "[[At all cost" means]{.mark} that [China
will not hesitate to use]{.mark} **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}** or
launching another **Pearl Harbor** to take over Taiwan]{.underline}.
This is a clear warning of an invasion.

Second, [[the Xi Doctrine legitimizes]{.mark} territorial
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through his remarks, Wei sought to
convince the rest of the world that China's seizure of most of the South
China Sea is an accomplished fact that cannot be overturned. He made
bogus accusations, which included blaming the United States for "raking
in profits by stirring up troubles" in the region. He insisted that only
ASEAN and China must resolve the issue. [He claimed that China's
militarization on S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea islands and reefs [were]{.underline} an act of
[self-defense]{.underline}. [Should this be allowed]{.underline} to
stand, then [the Xi Doctrine will set a **perilous precedent** of
successful te**rritorial expansion**, [which will]{.mark} further
[entice China and jeopardize]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark} of the region.

Third, [[the doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark} targets the United States as
a cause of the world's major problems and [[envisions a]{.mark}
**[powerful China]{.mark}** [evicting the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
from the region]{.underline}. Wei obliquely identified the United States
as the cause wars, conflicts, and unrest, and sought to convey that the
United States will abandon the states of the South China Sea (SCS) when
it is confronted by Chinese power, a typical divide and conquer strategy
used by the CCP regime.

The Xi Doctrine's fourth element is the mendacity regarding China's
historical use of force and current actions. While the distortions of
history were numerous, there were three major lies that should be
alarming for the states of the region and the global community. First,
[Wei said that China had never invaded another country, which
is]{.underline} a claim [so transparently false it can only be a measure
of]{.underline} the [contempt]{.underline} he held for the audience.
[[China has a]{.mark} **[long history]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [including [against]{.mark} the
[Tibetans and Vietnamese]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} perhaps soon against [the
Taiwanese]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, Wei argued that hegemony does
not conform to China's values when, in fact, China proudly was Asia's
hegemon for most of the last two thousand years. Lastly, he claimed that
the situation in the SCS is moving toward stability---from China's
perspective this stability is caused by its successful seizure of
territory. In fact, the SCS is far less stable as a result of China's
actions. Efforts to counter this grab are denounced by Wei as
destabilizing, which is a bit like a thief accusing you of a crime for
wanting your property returned.

Wei's belligerent rhetoric is an indication that the CCP regime faces
deep external and internal crises. Externally, the Trump administration
has shocked the CCP with the three major steps it has taken. First, it
has shifted the focus of the U.S. national-security strategy and now
identifies China explicitly as its primary rival---abandoning the far
more muted policies of previous administrations. Second, Trump has acted
on this peer competitive threat by advancing tangible measures, such as
arms sales to allies and the ban of Huawei. Third, the administration
has made credible commitments to assure partners and allies to counter
China's aggression and bullying. These have unbalanced the CCP regime,
and its natural reaction is to bully its way out. Additionally, the CCP
regime has perceived that the world today has begun to consider the
negative implications of China's rise, and the United States is
determined to prevent what heretofore had been considered China's
unstoppable rise. From the perspective of CCP, conflict is increasingly
seen as inevitable and perhaps even imminent. Wei's bellicosity should
be seen in this light, and the PLA is tasked with fighting and winning
the war.

Internally, Xi's anti-corruption campaign that selectively targets his
political rivalries, and his abandoning the established rules such as
term limited of presidency, have introduced deep cleavages into the
unity of the regime unity. China's economic slowdown, made worse by the
U.S. trade war, is a fundamental challenge to the regime's legitimacy.
Xi's repression and suppression of the Chinese people, particularly
human-rights defenders, Christians, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other
minorities, have miscarried.

Drawing from the pages of unfortunate history, in a classic
social-imperialist move, the regime wants to direct these internal
tensions outward. At the same time, [the nationalistic fervor advanced
by the CCP's propaganda and by the rapid military modernization have
made many young militant officers in the PLA overconfident]{.underline}.
This is infrequently noticed in the West. They can hardly wait to fight
an ultimate war to defeat the arch-enemy. [This]{.underline} plainly
[dangerous mentality echoes the Japanese military's beliefs before Pearl
Harbor.]{.underline}

The bellicosity evinced in Wei's speech is serious and is not bluster
intended to deter. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cannot
meet China's threat with]{.underline}
**[[half-measures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which [are likely to
further]{.mark} **[encourage]{.mark}** China's **[aggressive
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[must respo]{.mark}nd to China's
belligerence [with]{.mark} greater strength, **[adamantine
determination]{.mark}**, and more vigorous diplomatic and military
measures]{.underline}. [[With]{.mark} the [Xi]{.mark} Doctrine, [China
has]{.mark}]{.underline} proclaimed and [**[rationalized]{.mark}** its
**[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A Trump Doctrine forged in
response has to reveal to]{.underline} all global audiences, most
importantly [the CCP leadership, the recklessness of the Xi
Doctrine]{.underline} and the supreme folly of aggression.

"China will not, repeat, not repeat the old practice of a strong country
seeking hegemony," Wang Yi, China's foreign minister,
[said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-eu/trump-shaping-new-liberal-order-to-block-russia-china-iran-says-pompeo-idUSKBN1O3102)
last September. It was a message that Chinese officials have been
pushing ever since their country's spectacular rise began. [[For
decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they have been at]{.mark}
**[pains]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[downplay]{.mark}** [China's power and
reassure]{.mark} other countries]{.underline}---especially the United
States---[of its **[benign intentions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Jiang
Zemin, China's leader in the 1990s, called for mutual trust, mutual
benefit, equality, and cooperation in the country's foreign relations.
Under Hu Jintao, who took the reins of power in 2002, "peaceful
development" became the phrase of the moment. The current president, [Xi
Jinping](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-04-17/chinas-new-revolution),
insisted in September 2017 that China "lacks the gene" that drives great
powers to seek hegemony.

It is easy to dismiss such protestations as simple deceit. In fact,
however, Chinese leaders are telling the truth: Beijing truly does not
want to [replace
Washington](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-09-21/stop-obsessing-about-china)
at the top of the international system. China has no interest in
establishing a web of global alliances, sustaining a far-flung global
military presence, sending troops thousands of miles from its borders,
leading international institutions that would constrain its own
behavior, or spreading its system of government abroad.

But [to [focus on this]{.mark} **reluctance**]{.underline}, [and the
**reassuring** Chinese **statements**]{.underline} reflecting it, [[is
a]{.mark} **[mistake]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although
[China]{.underline} does not want to usurp the United States' position
as the leader of a global order, its [actual aim is nearly as
**consequential**]{.underline}. In the Indo-Pacific region, [[China
wants]{.mark} **[complete dominance]{.mark}**]{.underline}; it wants to
[[force]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[out and become]{.mark} the region's
[unchallenged]{.mark}]{.underline} political, economic, and military
[hegemon]{.underline}. And globally, even though it is happy to leave
the United States in the driver's seat, [it wants to be powerful enough
to counter Washington]{.underline} when needed. As one Chinese official
put it to me, "Being a great power means you get to do what you want,
and no one can say anything about it." In other words, China is trying
to displace, rather than replace, the United States.

Stay informed.

The way that China has gone about this project has caused many observers
to mistakenly conclude that the country is merely trying to coexist with
American power rather than fundamentally overturn the order in Asia and
compete with U.S. influence globally. In fact, [**[ambiguity]{.mark}**
[has been]{.mark} **[part]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark}
**[strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [Chinese [leaders]{.mark} have
[recognized]{.mark} that in order [to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[they must avoid provoking an unfavorable
response]{.underline}]{.mark}, and so they have refrained from directly
challenging the United States, replicating its order-building model, or
matching its globally active military. Although Beijing has pursued an
indirect and entrepreneurial strategy of accumulating power, [make **no
mistake**]{.underline}: [the ultimate goal is to push the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [out]{.underline} of the
Indo-Pacific and rival it on the global stage.

Until now, China has succeeded in growing without provoking. Yet [there
is a limit to how powerful a country can get without directly
challenging the incumbent power]{.underline}, and [China is now reaching
that point]{.underline}. Under Xi, China has begun confronting American
power head-on. Given the country's internal challenges, China's rise
could still stall. But history has shown that in the vast majority of
cases in which a country was able to sustain its rise, the rising power
ended up [overtaking the dominant
power](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-08-15/china-vs-america),
whether peacefully or through war.

That does not mean that the United States cannot buck the historical
trend. [[To remain]{.mark} **[dominant]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[Washington will have to]{.mark} **[change
course]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It will have to deepen, rather than
lessen, its involvement in the liberal international order. It will have
to double down on, rather than abandon, its commitment to American
values. And perhaps most important, it will have to ensure that its
leadership benefits others rather than pursue a strategy based on
"America first."

Decades of government investment in R&D led to scientific breakthroughs
that gave us the tools we use every day, and public-private partnerships
have sparked innovations from the microchip to the internet. Government
R&D investment has led to economic growth, jobs and new startups. As
just one example, some of Google's earliest work was made possible, in
part, by the Digital Library Initiative, funded by the National Science
Foundation. But if you fast forward to today, the [U.S. government
investment in tech has moved to the slow lane. [Government-funded
research]{.mark} in the U.S. [has fallen]{.mark} by 60%]{.underline} as
a percentage of GDP --- from 1.9% of GDP in 1964 to just 0.7% today.
Many countries around the world are investing significantly in research
and development. For example, China has said that it will be increasing
government R&D funding by 7% annually and recently announced a five-year
plan to invest an additional \$1.4 trillion in developing
next-generation technologies. As a nation [[we]{.mark} now [have a

on an issue that will [determine]{.mark} our future

Existential Threats to Humanity: An Analysis of the Distribution of the
Forces of Total Destruction in International Security," Conference
Paper: *International Studies Association, 2021 Annual Conference*,

[[Humanity faces existential risks from]{.mark} the large-scale
destruction of Earth's natural environment]{.underline} making the
planet less hospitable for humankind (Wallace-Wells 2019). The decline
of some of Earth's natural systems may already exceed the "planetary
boundaries" that represent a "safe operating space for humanity"
(Rockstrom et al. 2009). Humanity has become one of the driving forces
behind Earth's climate system (Crutzen 2002). The major anthropogenic
drivers of climate change are the burning of fossil fuels (e.g., coal,
oil, and gas), combined with the degradation of Earth's natural systems
for absorbing carbon dioxide, such as deforestation for agriculture
(e.g., livestock and monocultures) and resource extraction (e.g., mining
and oil), and the warming of the oceans (Kump et al. 2003). While
humanity has influenced Earth's climate since at least the Industrial
Revolution, [[the]{.mark} dramatic [increase in]{.mark}
**[g]{.mark}**reen**[h]{.mark}**ouse **[g]{.mark}**as
emission**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the mid-twentieth
century---the "Great Acceleration" (Steffen et al. 2007; 2015; McNeill &
Engelke 2016)--- [is responsible for contemporary climate
change]{.underline}, which has reached approximately 1°C above
preindustrial levels (IPCC 2018). [[Climate change could
become]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[existential]{.underline}]{.mark}**
threat to humanity [[if the planet's climate reaches]{.mark} a
"[Hothouse]{.mark} Earth" [state]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ripple et al.
2020). What are the dangers? There are two mechanisms of climate change
that threaten humankind. The direct threat is extreme heat.
[[While]{.mark} human [societies possesses some capacity for
adaptation]{.mark} and resilience]{.underline} to climate change, [[the
physiological response]{.underline}]{.mark} of humans to heat stress
[[imposes]{.underline}]{.mark} [physical
[limits]{.mark}]{.underline}---with a hard limit at roughly 35°C
wet-bulb temperature (Sherwood et al. 2010). [[A rise in]{.mark} global
average [temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline} by 3--4°C [would]{.underline}
increase the risk of heat stress, while 7°C could render some regions
uninhabitable, and 11--12°C [[would leave much of the planet]{.mark}
[too hot for human habitation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sherwood et al.
2010). The indirect [[effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of climate change
could [[include]{.underline}]{.mark}, inter alia, [rising sea
levels]{.underline} affecting coastal regions (e.g., Miami and
Shanghai), or even [[swallowing entire countries]{.underline}]{.mark}
(e.g., Bangladesh and the Maldives); [[extreme]{.underline}]{.mark} and
unpredictable weather and natural [[disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}
(e.g., hurricanes and forest fires); [environmental [pressures]{.mark}
[on water and food]{.mark} scarcity]{.underline} (e.g., droughts from
less-dispersed rainfall, and lower wheat-yields at higher temperatures);
the possible [inception of [new bacteria and viruses]{.mark};
and]{.underline}, of course, [large-scale human]{.underline}
[migration]{.underline} (World Bank 2012; Wallace-Well 2019; Richards,
Lupton & Allywood 2001). While it is difficult to determine the
existential implications of extreme environmental conditions, [there are
historic precedents for the collapse of human societies under
environmental pressures]{.underline} (Diamond 2005). Earth's "big five"
mass extinction events have been linked to dramatic shifts in Earth's
climate (Ward 2008; Payne & Clapham 2012; Kolbert 2014; Brannen 2017),
and [a [Hothouse Earth]{.mark} climate [would represent terra
incognita]{.mark} for humanity]{.underline}. Thus, the assumption here
is [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [a Hothouse Earth climate [could pose an
existential threat]{.mark} to]{.underline} the habitability of [the
planet]{.underline} for humanity (Steffen et al. 2018., 5). At what
point could climate change cross the threshold of an existential threat
to humankind? The complexity of Earth's natural systems makes it
extremely difficult to give a precise figure (Rockstrom et al. 2009; ).
However, much of [[the concern]{.underline}]{.mark} about climate change
[[is]{.mark} over the danger of crossing "[tipping points]{.mark},"
[whereby]{.mark} positive [feedback loops]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Earth's climate system could [[lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially
[[irreversible]{.mark} and self-reinforcing "runaway" [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the [melting of Arctic
"permafrost" could produce additional warming]{.underline}, as glacial
retreat reduces the refractory effect of the ice and releases huge
quantities of methane currently trapped beneath it. A recent study
suggests that [[a "**planetary threshold**" could exist at]{.mark}
global average temperature of [2°]{.mark}C]{.underline} above
preindustrial levels (Steffen et al. 2018; also IPCC 2018).
[Therefore]{.underline}, the analysis here takes the
**[[2°]{.underline}]{.mark}**C rise in global average temperatures as
**[[represent]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [[the lower-boundary of an
existential threat to humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}, with higher
temperatures increasing the risk of runaway climate change leading to a
Hothouse Earth. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change set the goal of
limiting the increase in global average temperatures to "well below" 2°C
and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C. If the Paris
Agreement goals are met, then nations would likely keep climate change
below the threshold of an existential threat to humanity. According to
Climate Action Tracker (2020), however, current policies of states are
expected to produce global average temperatures of 2.9°C above
preindustrial levels by 2100 (range between +2.1 and +3.9°C), while if
states succeed in meeting their pledges and targets, global average
temperatures are still projected to increase by 2.6°C (range between
+2.1 and +3.3°C). Thus, while the Paris Agreements sets a goal that
would reduce the exis 6 - tential risk of climate change, the actual
policies of states could easily cross the threshold that would
constitute an existential threat to humanity (CAT 2020)

Manufacturing Competitiveness,"

Retrieved 3/3/2022)

Manufacturing is the lifeblood for many communities, providing
middle-class jobs and robust economic activity. Furthermore,
manufacturing has special value to smaller cities and towns,
particularly in the Midwest and Southeast, as well as for urban
communities of color where deindustrialization has had lasting negative
impacts. And, [[manufacturing has gained fresh attention over the past
two years]{.underline},]{.mark} starting with the nation's need for
medical goods during the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing now as snarled
supply chains have driven up prices for cars and other critical goods,
and [[looking ahead to **electric vehicles**]{.mark}, [**alternative
energy generation**, and **other innovative
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[needed to addresses **the
existential challenge of climate change**]{.underline}.]{.mark} A
centerpiece of [[the America COMPETES Act]{.underline}]{.mark} is the
CHIPS for America Fund, which [[allocates \$52 billion
to]{.underline}]{.mark} initiatives established by the CHIPS for America
Act and paves the way for America to fabricate computer chips as well as
[[reduce semiconductor supply chain disruptions. This fund could have an
outsized impact on the entire manufacturing sector in
America.]{.underline}]{.mark} As Mark Muro, Robert Maxim, and Stephen
Ezell at Brookings argue, [[semiconductor devices are essential to
today's digital economy, as they operate most cars and all
computers]{.underline}]{.mark}. The manufacturing and sale of these
devices are dependent on a robust semiconductor supply chain, and the
funding allocated by the act not only will ensure that the digital
economy operates without disruption, but also will strengthen the
nation's capacity for technology and innovation. Historically, this fund
has been particularly important, as the U.S. semiconductor industry for
years has lagged behind those of competitor countries. Researchers,
including those at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation,
found that only ten years after creating the semiconductor industry, the
United States lost its global leadership, and the nation's lack of
attention to this critical industry meant U.S. competitiveness continued
to erode. [The]{.underline} \$52 billion commitment to [American
computer chip production in [the America COMPETES Act will once again

teeing up talks with Senate,"
<https://www.science.org/content/article/house-passes-sweeping-u-s-innovation-bill-teeing-talks-senate>,
Retrieved 3/3/2022)

The effort, [[designed to maintain the country's
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[edge over China, took a major step
forward today when the U.S. House]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Representatives [[passed the America COMPETES Act]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The 2900-page bill must now be reconciled with a similar, comparably
massive bill called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) that
the Senate passed in June 2021. But ironing out the differences will
test the Democrats' razor-thin majorities in each body. Although USICA
(S.1260) was approved by a vote of 68 to 32, including 19 Republican
senators, COMPETES (H.R. 4521) was supported by just one Republican and
passed the House on a 220 to 210 vote. (One Democrat said nay.) Although
key House Republicans have said they support many of the
research-related elements in the bill, they strongly objected to other
provisions, including language on trade and labor policy. Negotiating a
compromise bill acceptable to enough lawmakers--and President Joe
Biden--to make it into law will be a complex task touching on a wide
range of issues. They include how to allocate new research funds, how to
protect U.S. research from foreign interference while also reshaping
immigration rules to make it easier for the United States to attract
foreign-born technical talent, and whether to take a more aggressive
stance to combat climate change. Both bills come with hefty price tags:
\$250 billion for USICA and \$350 billion for COMPETES. And both include
provisions that authorize the government to spend tens of billions of
dollars on research across several federal agencies. The numbers are
mostly aspirational; Congress would still have to approve most of the
spending through its annual budget process. Higher education lobbyists
hope legislators won't repeat what happened in 2007 and 2010, when
Congress failed to deliver promised big hikes in research spending that
it had authorized. The increased investments include adding an NSF
technology directorate and doubling the agency's overall budget over 5
years. The Department of Energy's Office of Science and its national
laboratories would get a similarly large boost. And the Department of
Commerce would get \$7 billion to establish a network of new regional
innovation hubs. The nation's semiconductor industry would receive \$52
billion, with the bulk of the money used to increase manufacturing
capacity but some also going to microelectronics research facilities.
Both bills call for tightening oversight of research collaborations with
China and a handful of other countries deemed to exert a "malign foreign
influence" on federally funded research. For example, both bills would
prohibit scientists with federal grants from participating in Chinese
talent recruitment programs and require universities to provide more
information about any foreign gifts they receive. The two bills also
seek to stamp out sexual harassment on college campuses, calling for a
uniform policy on reporting allegations and findings to federal funding
agencies. But there are also important differences between the two bills
on research policy. For example, the Senate wants NSF's new technology
directorate to focus on 10 key disciplines, such as artificial
intelligence and quantum computing. In contrast, the House bill asks NSF
to combat climate change, reduce economic and social inequality, and
build a robust scientific workforce along with advancing strategically
important fields. "The Senate bill implies a trade-off between
supporting key technologies to maintain our competitive edge and
improving the quality of life for all Americans," says a Democratic
staffer on the House science committee, which crafted many of the
research provisions in the COMPETES bill. "But we think that technology
is simply a means to an end, and that you can do both things." The House
and Senate also have competing visions of how to spread federal research
dollars more equitably across the country, including to institutions
that enroll large numbers of students from groups traditionally
underrepresented in science. The Senate bill requires that 20% of the
money slated for NSF and DOE be spent in the roughly two dozen states
that receive the fewest federal research dollars. In contrast, the House
bill avoids any mandatory set-asides, instead creating new programs that
target institutions in those have-not states. The COMPETES Act would
also change immigration policy to allow more foreign students to stay
after they earn advanced degrees in science and engineering at U.S.
universities. One provision would exempt them from the existing cap on
the number of applications for permanent residency status. The bill
would also create a new visa category for budding high-tech
entrepreneurs. Those measures are likely to be opposed by lawmakers who
want to shut off the flow of immigration, especially from China and
other countries seen as economic and military foes, and the Senate bill
contains no such changes. [[The House bill includes a **raft of
provisions on climate change**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [[it
would authorize a]{.underline}]{.mark} 2-year, \$8 billion [[U.S.
contribution to the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations's [Green Climate
Fund, aimed at helping emerging economies respond to the climate crisis.
It calls for spending \$600 million]{.mark}]{.underline} annually
through 2026 [[to help U.S. solar energy companies]{.underline}]{.mark}
become "less reliant on solar components made in China." [[And it would
give]{.mark} the Department of State [additional funds for
climate-related foreign aid, and for developing a]{.mark}]{.underline}
new 10-year [[strategy to mitigate global climate change
impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} The House bill's sweeping scope is its
strength, says Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson (D--TX), chair of
the House science committee. "[[With this legislation, we are making
investments to build clean energy solutions, address the climate
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, reinforce our national security, enhance
our semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, and so much more," Johnson
said in kicking off debate on the House floor that ended this morning.
"In short, we are acting to address the critical needs identified by the
scientific community, industry, academia, and other stakeholders as what
they need most to succeed in the 21st century."

(D-NY) and Senator Todd Young (R-IN), which [[would provide much
needed]{.mark}, and long [overdue, investment in]{.mark}]{.underline}
technology, entrepreneurship, [[science, research and development, and
will promote the long-term, global economic competitiveness of the
United States.]{.underline}]{.mark} We are encouraged by this bold and
visionary bipartisan effort to ensure the U.S. can outcompete our
foreign competitors, especially China. We encourage Congress to make
passage of this bill a top priority as we move into a period of economic
recovery and job growth post-COVID. Since the end of World War II, the
United States has been the unequivocal global leader in scientific and
technological ingenuity and innovation, and as a result, the American
people have benefited through good-paying jobs, economic prosperity, and
a higher quality of life. [[Today]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[America's leadership of innovative technologies is being compromised
by]{.mark} the aggressive and distortive practices of [our foreign
competitors]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [[the U.S. has been
underinvesting in]{.mark} the very ingredients that made the country a
global leader, namely [our]{.mark} superior [research and manufacturing
capabilities,]{.mark}]{.underline} favorable regulatory regime and
economic system, and skilled workforce, our competitors are deploying
significant, and at times, distortive resources, engaging in
anti-competitive practices such as intellectual property theft, and are
exerting influence beyond their borders attempting to dominate the key
technology fields of today and of the future. [[Without a comprehensive,
national investment strategy in critical and emerging technologies, our
country will continue falling behind in the race to create cutting-edge
solutions to the world's problems.]{.underline}]{.mark} It is crucial
that the U.S. bolster its own approach to ensure that our values remain
infused in the technologies of the future, especially as China and other
nations significantly increase their investments in emerging
technologies. Many regions and cities across the country are well-suited
to foster innovation and others have tremendous innovation potential.
But as a nation, we lack the comprehensive, wide-spread investment
needed to build nationwide strength in new and emerging technologies. In
order to remain the global leader in technology, the Endless Frontier
Act instills within the U.S. government a commitment to prioritize
science and technology advancements by creating a Directorate for
Technology and Innovation at the National Science Foundation, and
charges the foundation with creating and implementing a geostrategic
investment plan focusing on 10 key technology focus areas. Additionally,
[[this Act provides \$100 billion to reinvigorate American
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} in the discovery and application of new
technologies, as well as \$10 billion to designate a minimum of 10
regional technology hubs, which will be the global centers for R&D, and
to help regions throughout the nation develop strategies to build their
tech economies. [These efforts will [provide a lifeline to the future of
the American economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, prepare the U.S. workforce to
compete globally, encourage new company formation, and create high
skilled, good-paying American jobs. We are also pleased to see a
strategic focus on manufacturing innovation through the enhancement and
expansion of Manufacturing USA and by strengthening America's critical
supply chains, such as semiconductor supply chains.

Congress deserves mixed grades for its recent efforts to strengthen the
nation's cybersecurity and improve the resilience of its critical
infrastructure. [If Republicans and Democrats can find a path forward to
integrate]{.underline} the Senate's U.S. Innovation and Competition Act
([[USICA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the House's
[[America COMPETES]{.underline}]{.mark} Act, [Congress [could make
substantial, long-term investments in America's]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}**nology [future]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} two
[bills]{.mark} would [build upon]{.mark} important but [insufficient
cybersecurity provisions in recent legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which President Biden signed
into law in November, contained \$1 billion to enhance the cybersecurity
of state and local governments and established a Response and Recovery
Fund for major cyber incidents. Yet that law's support to specific
critical infrastructure sectors was inconsistent and missed some glaring
weaknesses, such as those of the water sector. Similarly, the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022, which the
president signed into law in December, had 40 cybersecurity-specific
authorizations. But during conference, Congress dropped some of the most
significant provisions, such as mandatory incident reporting. Now,
lawmakers get another bite at the cybersecurity apple as Congress sets
up its conference committee to adjudicate USICA (which passed on a
bipartisan basis last June) and the COMPETES Act (which passed last week
on a nearly partly-line vote). House and Senate lawmakers have a \$52
billion starting point: Both bills contain \$52 billion in funding for
the CHIPS Act, which establishes a grant program to support domestic
semiconductor production. Congress passed the CHIPS Act on a bipartisan
basis as part of the FY2021 NDAA. CHIPS funding is the most headline
grabbing (and expensive) single issue in the two bills, but it is by no
means the only important cybersecurity and critical infrastructure
provision. The USICA and COMPETES bills have similar cybersecurity
provisions in three arenas that House and Senate members can easily
reconcile and embrace. First, [[both bills]{.underline}]{.mark} seek to
[[rectify **dramatic shortages** in the federal cyber
workforce]{.underline}]{.mark}. [They [invest in STEM education and
create]{.mark} rotational [cybersecurity positions]{.mark} [giving
federal employees]{.mark} the flexibility to gain experience and
[skills]{.mark}]{.underline}. The House bill also expands "CyberCorps:
Scholarship for Service," a critical, ROTC-like program for the federal
cybersecurity workforce, from its current \$60 million annual budget to
\$90 million by fiscal year 2026. [[This]{.mark} [will increase]{.mark}
both the number of students ([future federal employees]{.mark}) and the
number of universities and community colleges involved]{.underline}.
Such a provision would likely receive bipartisan support in the Senate.
Second, [[both bills invest in]{.mark} U.S. leadership in international
technical **[standards-setting bodies]{.mark}** like the International
Telecommunication Union]{.underline}. This arena has become [[a crucial
battlefront in the contest]{.mark} between Western values **[of a free
and open internet]{.mark}** and the authoritarian push for ever-greater
state control and censorship]{.underline}. [Beijing has]{.underline}
aggressively [sought to gain leadership positions and promote
technically flawed proposals in these forums in order to distort and
weaponize the bodies against]{.underline} the interests of [America and
its partners]{.underline}. [Both [bills]{.mark}]{.underline} thus strive
to [**[improve America's response]{.mark}** to Chinese
maneuvering]{.underline}. [Third, both [bills]{.mark} [increase funding
for]{.mark} the State Department's Global Engagement Center, an
**important agency** for [battling foreign disinformation
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}. Next, the conference members should work
to reach agreement in several other areas tackled only in one chamber's
bill. The House bill, importantly, requires the executive branch to
develop a strategy for "information and communication technology
critical to the economic competitiveness of the United States." Such a
strategy would ensure that America is not dependent on untrusted vendors
beholden to foreign powers or who otherwise have lax security. Three
other provisions of note: the House bill 1) designates "Critical
Technology Security Centers to evaluate and test the security of
technologies essential to national critical functions," 2) creates
international capacity-building programs to improve the cybersecurity of
U.S. allies and partners, and 3) supports the software security and
digital privacy work of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. Meanwhile, [[the]{.mark} most significant
[provision]{.mark}]{.underline} unique to the Senate bill [[creates
a]{.mark} National [Risk Management Cycle to]{.mark} "[identify, assess,
and prioritize cyber]{.mark} and physical [risks to critical]{.mark}
[infrastructure]{.mark}." [Understanding these risks is]{.mark} the
**[foundational]{.mark}** step [to]{.mark} properly [resourcing]{.mark}
U.S. government [efforts to defend **against, mitigate, and deter these
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its comprehensive March 2020 report
on U.S. cyber strategy, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission noted that
the U.S. government "lacks a rigorous, codified, and routinely exercised
process" for identifying risk. [Even where the government has identified
critical infrastructure risks, a lack of sustained funding has limited
the mitigation and management of the risks over time. A National Risk
Management Cycle would]{.underline} begin to [rectify this
problem]{.underline}. A chance to improve research The Senate version
also includes provisions to create regional technology hubs built on
partnerships among industry, academia, and workforce groups to support
domestic high-tech job growth in areas of the country that have not been
historic innovation centers. [[A]{.mark} [**successful bipartisan
conference** should result in numerous meaningful cybersecurity
provisions enacted into law]{.mark}]{.underline}. While not as flashy as
CHIPS, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} [collectively [lead to more effective
**cybersecurity** and]{.mark} more **[resilient critical]{.mark}

#### Key to democracy

**Palmer 6-25**-2021, senior fellow on the National Security and
International Policy team at the Center for American Progress, and was
the attaché for the U.S. Department of Energy in Beijing (Nina, "The
Innovation and Competition Act is progressive policy," *The Hill*,
<https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/560198-the-innovation-and-competition-act-is-progressive-policy>)

Democrats and Republicans in Washington may have finally found an issue
they can both support. Earlier in June, the U.S. Senate passed the U.S.
Innovation and Competition Act ([[USICA]{.underline}]{.mark}) which
[proposes significant changes to science and technology
policy]{.underline} with an eye to U.S. China policy. Approved by a
surprisingly bipartisan 68-32 vote, the bill merges Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-N.Y.) Endless Frontier Act and Sen. Robert
Menendez's (D-N.J.) Strategic Competition Act. President Joe Biden has
urged speedy passage of the bill in the House, where it's headed next.

Progressives in [the]{.underline} House should support and advance this
\$250 billion [bill]{.underline}, which [**[contains strong
provisions]{.underline}** [that will]{.underline}]{.mark} [smartly [make
the U.S. more competitive]{.mark}]{.underline}, through investments in
communities, innovation, improving racial and gender justice and income
equality. [[The bill authorizes]{.underline}]{.mark} the most extensive
investment in U.S. innovation infrastructure in a generation, building
**[[technology hubs]{.underline}]{.mark}** in disadvantaged areas,
[[increasing]{.mark} federal [funding for]{.mark} both fundamental and
applied [research]{.mark}]{.underline}, increasing [[STEM
scholarships]{.mark} and [modernizing]{.mark} U.S. technology
[policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. The bill introduces measures to
combat systemic sexism in the scientific community and targets
minority-serving institutions (MSIs) for additional grants, scholarships
and support. [The bill also makes strides in recognizing and funding
climate change mitigation measures, including clean energy
development]{.underline} and conservation mechanisms. Most notably, it
expands the definition of STEM to include energy and environmental
studies, which will refocus a range of federal policies on these fields.
The bill also prioritizes clean technologies for inclusion in the
regional technology hub program.

It should not be surprising that USICA has received support from a broad
range of stakeholders, including many progressives. The Thurgood
Marshall College Fund voiced support for the bill's \$750 million grant
program to build research capacity at Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) and MSIs. The American Association of Universities,
a group of 66 leading research universities, also praised the bill,
calling it an "important step in renewing our country's commitment to
federally sponsored scientific research to better position the United
States for a healthier, more secure, more prosperous future." The bill
also contains many of the policy recommendations from the Human Rights
Watch regarding international responses to the Chinese government
genocide of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province.

So, what's not to like? As USICA moves to the House, some progressive
groups have voiced concerns about framing these investments around
competition with China. But competition with China is not synonymous
with conflict. We should ensure that we are building better, rather than
racing to the bottom. That is precisely how this legislation is crafted.
A competitive policy toward China that strengthens America should be
welcomed by progressive, and all, policymakers.

Competing with China to innovate, provide international development aid
and secure supply chains can result in positive-sum and highly
progressive policies, pushing American innovation to greater heights and
supporting a thriving economy for the American people. [[This bill is an
opportunity to show the strength of democracy]{.mark} and deliver public
goods [domestically and abroad]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
type of competition is not about China-bashing or xenophobia; rather, it
[provides]{.underline} an opportunity to address problems in the U.S.
that need to be fixed. It creates space for [healthy competition in
areas where American strength and opportunity have atrophied and where
we are being outpaced by China]{.underline}. [[Confronting the Chinese
government]{.underline}'s]{.mark} human rights abuses, poor labor
conditions, military excursions and instances of predatory aid
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} all fundamentally progressive
**[[positions]{.mark} that [reinforce American
values]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

There are a few key areas of this bill that could benefit from more
progressive activism in the House. The current bill expands research
security initiatives and the role of the FBI in China policy without
addressing systemic racism in these initiatives and institutions. It
also authorizes \$52 billion in economic aid to semiconductor
manufacturers without assuring that the money is used for real
investment and does not go to stock buybacks and other financial
maneuvers. The bill can and should go further in protecting human rights
in China. Progressives should advocate for inclusion of the main
provisions of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and the Hong Kong
Safe Harbor Act in this legislation, both of which have strong
bipartisan support.

Ultimately, passing a bill with such significant bipartisan support is,
in itself, a win for the American people. [This type of [cooperation

[[With democratic norms fraying]{.mark} from Southeast Asia to Central
Europe]{.underline}, [[Biden was right to warn of]{.mark} "the sustained
and alarming [challenges to democracy and]{.mark} universal
**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights]{.underline}." But too few
acknowledge that [[rising authoritarianism around the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}, [like climate change and]{.underline} the
evolution of lethal [viruses]{.underline}, [[can pose an **existential
risk**]{.mark} [to humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most people do not
appreciate the extent to which [[civilizations depend on]{.mark} pillars
of [norms]{.mark} and conventions]{.underline}. [Some of [these]{.mark}
have evolved organically over time]{.underline}, while [others
**[require]{.mark}**d [deliberation]{.mark} [and collective action.
If]{.mark} one of the **[pillars buckle]{.mark}**s, a [civilization
could]{.mark} well [collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline} Efforts to counter
the current threats to democracy should start with the fact that every
economy is embedded in culture and institutions. As Daron Acemoglu,
Simon Johnson, and James Robinson have argued, long-run growth may
depend more on institutions than on anything else. But institutions are
not always exogenous. As the growing field of cultural evolution shows,
human beings are adaptive learners who rely, often unwittingly, on
social learning to entrench norms that are necessary for a society to
flourish. Likewise, Avinash Dixit and Simon Levin argue that, in some
contexts, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[need to]{.mark} take
deliberate steps to [instill pro-social preferences]{.mark} that can
help us adapt to our changing world]{.underline}. We can do this through
education, and by deliberating and deciding as citizens to promote
certain kinds of collective behavior. That is what happened when
delegates from American states convened in Philadelphia in 1787 to
revise the existing Articles of Confederation and ended up drafting the
U.S. Constitution, which became the cornerstone of the new country's
long-term growth and prosperity. We are in a similarly challenging
situation today, as [cross-border flows of goods, services, and capital
flatten the world economically]{.underline}. [The rapid advance of
**[digital tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology, accelerated over the last
two years by the COVID-19 pandemic[, [is causing]{.mark} huge
[strains]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Increased [outsourcing]{.mark} of
production [has contributed to]{.mark}
[hypernationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which in turn is [[fueling the
rise of anti-democratic leaders who exploit]{.mark} people's
[desperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[President Biden hit a political wall]{.mark} this week]{.underline} in
his push for voting rights legislation, just as he did last year in
trying to pass his Build Back Better spending package. [It's time for
Biden to ask himself why he's in this morass.]{.underline} Sign up for a
weekly roundup of thought-provoking ideas and debates It sticks in my
craw to quote Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has
often been a wrecker in our national politics. [But he had it right when
he said Wednesday that Biden was elected with a mandate to "bridge a
divided country, lower the temperature, dial down the perpetual air of
crisis in our politics]{.underline}." [[Biden is failing]{.mark} in that
mission. Republican obstructionism is a big reason, but it's not the
only explanation. [Biden has been losing his way
politically]{.mark}]{.underline}. As he chases support from progressives
in his own party, he has failed to craft versions of his social spending
package and voting rights legislation that he could pass with fragile
majorities. He's been spinning his wheels. [A prime (but rarely
discussed) example of Biden's loss of momentum is the failure to enact
legislation to improve American competitiveness in chipmaking and other
technologies. This bill, known as the U.S. Innovation and Competition
Act (or USICA), passed the Senate back in June with a big majority, 68
to 32. Passage illustrated the strong bipartisan consensus that America
must respond to China's technology challenge]{.underline}. [But [USICA
stalled in the House]{.mark}. Democrats there were miffed at what they
saw as Senate attempts to dictate science policy]{.underline}. Some
[[progressives didn't want chipmaking to get in the way of battles for
child-care credits]{.mark} and other Build Back Better programs. And
[House Republicans wanted to sabotage any potential success for
Biden]{.mark}.]{.underline} So, [the bill languished. Speaker Nancy
Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a House-Senate conference in November, but
it never happened because the House hadn't passed a bill.]{.underline}
Rep. Bill Foster (Ill.), a leading Democrat on tech issues, [told me the
House should have gone to conference and approved the chipmaking portion
of the bill, at least. But that didn't occur, even though Biden's
national security team takes the China threat as seriously as
Republicans do. Moderate Democrats are baffle]{.underline}d. "It's nuts
that the House has been sitting on this good, important bill for
months," Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), one of its authors, told me in an
email. A similar concern came from Thomas E. Donilon, President Barack
Obama's national security adviser. "[It's inexcusable that Congress
hasn't moved forward on this,"]{.underline} he told me. [Pelosi's aides
say she wants to get a House version of the bill moving again soon. And
one Senate staffer hoped a House bill could pass in a few weeks ---
clearing the way for a real conference to resolve differences. "We are
working hard on trying to get USICA done in the House]{.underline}," a
White House official told me Thursday. But the official said it's not
clear if House Republicans will help. ["[To be blunt, it takes two to
tango." The larger question for Biden is whether there's any space left
for bipartisanship and conciliation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political
divisions have worsened over the past year, and Republicans, led by
McConnell, have rebuffed nearly all of his overtures. He had bigger
ambitions, on social and political revitalization. [But [with such
fragile Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, Biden will
struggle now to pass meaningful legislation]{.mark}]{.underline}. USICA
would be a good test. So would a scaled-back version of Build Back
Better that could win support from Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.). But
[successful presidencies carry a sense of political momentum, going from
success to success. Sadly, President Biden has lost much of that forward
drive.]{.underline} It's time for a restart, with less shouting and more
of Biden's trademark common sense.

[Senate Minority Leader Mitch [McConnell laid down an ultimatum for
Democrats]{.mark} on Thursday: [If you pursue a reconciliation]{.mark}
budget package, [forget about abou]{.mark}t that [economic
competitiveness legislation]{.mark} you want for the
midterms.]{.underline} Congress has been working on the competitiveness
package for more than a year, and Democrats desperately want to pass its
\$52 billion in domestic semiconductor funding before the midterms. But
[[McConnell said Thursday he would deprive that legislation of
necessary]{.mark} Republican [support if Democrats do not abandon their
talks]{.mark} for a pared back climate change and social spending
package that includes provisions to lower drug costs]{.underline}.
McConnell tweeted Thursday, referring to the Senate's version of the
competitiveness bill, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act: [Th[e
ultimatum is the greatest setback for Democrats' reconciliation
plan]{.mark}s since moderate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) killed the
original package, labeled Build Back Better, at the end of last year.
Democrats have since pursued a narrower agenda focused on climate change
measures and incentives for domestic manufacturing to aid the clean
energy sector, but no concrete plans have yet emerged from the
talks]{.underline}. Dems respond: White House Press Secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre called the tactic an \"outrageous threat\" and vowed that
the administration would not back down. \"[[Senate Republicans are
literally choosing to help China out]{.mark} compete the U.S. in order
to protect big drug companies. This takes loyalty to special interests
over working Americans to a new and shocking height]{.underline}.\"
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer shot back through a spokesperson,
saying McConnell \"is [holding American jobs in key U.S. industries
hostage to help China and protect his friends in big pharma allowing
them to keep screwing over Americans with outrageously high Rx drug
prices."]{.underline} Reminder: [[McConnell holds significant sway over
the competitiveness package]{.mark} because the final legislation that
emerges from a combined House and Senate conference committee will have
to garner at least 10 Republican votes to be approved in the
Senate.]{.underline} That committee has been negotiating since this
spring, and the White House and Democratic leaders are aiming to
conclude negotiations and pass the final package before the August
congressional recess.

[[Republicans won't back compromise legislation to boost domestic
semiconductor manufacturing]{.mark} and U.S. competitiveness with
China]{.underline} if Democrats continue to negotiate a partisan budget
package that can pass without GOP support, Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell said Thursday. "Let me be perfectly clear: [[there will be no
bipartisan USICA]{.underline}]{.mark} as long as Democrats are pursuing
a partisan reconciliation bill," the Kentucky Republican tweeted, using
the acronym for the expansive competitiveness measure that passed both
chambers in very different forms and is now in conference[. [McConnell's
pronouncement significantly complicates Democrats' summer legislative
agen]{.underline}]{.mark}[da, which includes trying to pass both the
competitiveness bill and the tax and spending package formerly known as
"Build Back Better" before the August recess]{.underline}. [McConnell
made his statement shortly after Senate Democrats announced they reached
agreement on a prescription drug pricing plan that's a key piece of the
budget reconciliation package they've been renegotiating to appease Sen.
Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va. Manchin in December announced his opposition to
the \$2.2 trillion House-passed tax and spending bill, which was already
scaled way back from Democrats' earlier plans. "Sen[. McConnell is
holding American jobs in key US industries
hostag]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark} to help China and protect his
friends in big pharma allowing them to keep screwing over Americans with
outrageously high Rx drug prices," Justin Goodman, a spokesperson for
Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, said in an email. The White House
took aim at the Republican leader as well, specifically calling out
plans for chipmaking plant expansions in states like Ohio and Idaho that
could be put on hold if the competitiveness bill stalls. Those two
states are home to two of the Senate GOP negotiators on the bill: Rob
Portman of Ohio, who's retiring, and Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, the
Finance Committee's ranking Republican. "This takes loyalty to special
interests over working Americans to a new and shocking height," White
House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. "We are
not going to back down in the face of this outrageous threat." Intel
Corp. last week put off a planned groundbreaking ceremony for its new
\$20 billion investment in Ohio, citing delays in getting the
competitiveness bill passed. Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology has
been weighing an expansion in the southeast part of the state, in part
prompted by state tax breaks; however, the state legislation is tied to
enactment of federal incentives, according to local media. 'Classic
McConnell' [[McConnell's Thursday statement suggests a July vote is now
out of reach]{.mark}]{.underline} unless Democrats abandon plans to
resurrect their reconciliation package, which is unlikely. Schumer and
Manchin have been holding private discussions on reconciliation for
months, but the prescription drug pricing plan announcement is the first
significant sign of progress to emerge from those negotiations. They've
not yet reached agreement on climate or tax provisions, the other
primary pieces of the downsized package they're negotiating, and Schumer
has said the legislation could be ready for floor action as soon as late
July. Ways and Means member Donald S. Beyer Jr., D-Va., said in a
Twitter thread that McConnell's announcement that Republicans would
block the competitiveness bill was just a public admission of a tactic
he's already deployed. "[[This isn't new, Mitch McConnell has been
stalling this bill for weeks; but now he's admitting it,"]{.mark} Beyer
said. "His obstruction is directly harming our economy, preventing job
creation, and halting production of a key need to improve supply chains.
Classic McConnell."]{.underline} McConnell's move has support within his
conference. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who was among the 19 Republicans
who voted for the Senate bill a year ago, retweeted McConnell, adding:
"Couldn't agree more." McConnell also voted for the original Senate
bill. Members of both parties have pointed to the competitiveness
legislation as desperately needed to help fix crucial supply chain
issues that have contributed to high inflation. Democrats think their
reconciliation package will also help cool inflation in the long term,
but Republicans argue those spending and tax increases will just
exacerbate the current problem. While Republicans are likely to continue
to blame President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats for inflation,
their decision to block the competitiveness bill could blunt their
midterm campaign argument that voters should elect Republicans to
Congress if they want real solutions to rising prices. "[This McConnell
threat to kill a bipartisan bill to improve American competitiveness
unless we keep prescription drug costs high strikes me as a
miscalculation]{.underline}," Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, tweeted. The
GOP tactic could also risk angering corporate donors. It's not just the
big chipmakers pushing the measure --- it's also companies across the
manufacturing spectrum that rely on a steady supply of semiconductors.
[CEOs of major companies ranging from Microsoft and Google parent
Alphabet to defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Northrop
Grumman banded together earlier this month to call on Congress to act
urgently to pass a bicameral compromise.]{.underline} "The rest of the
world is not waiting for the U.S. to act," dozens of CEOs wrote in a
June 15 letter to Schumer, McConnell, Pelosi and House Minority Leader
Kevin McCarthy. "Our global competitors are investing in their industry,
their workers, and their economies, and it is imperative that Congress
act to enhance U.S. competitiveness."

Anthony, Senior Fellow American Enterprise Institute, "Funding Isn't
Enough to Fix Science" May 28, 2021
<https://www.aei.org/op-eds/funding-isnt-enough-to-fix-science/>//LP

[[There is an urgent need to shore up America's research
establishment.]{.mark} But [inadequate funding is only the tip of the
iceberg]{.mark}: More fundamental problems have dogged American science
and innovation for years.]{.underline} Today, [our [breakthrough
scientific discoveries]{.mark} a[ppear]{.mark} less fundamental and
[less frequent than in decades]{.mark} past; scientists are spending
increasing amounts of time on paperwork, administration, and
bureaucratic compliance rather than on research itself; funding has
become concentrated in a handful of well-established
institutions]{.underline}; the average age of primary researchers
continues to climb; and the so-called replication crisis has raised
concerns about the reliability of many published findings. All of these
point to deeper, structural problems in America's R&D system. [The
goodwill provided by the current R&D push has created an ideal
opportunity to implement much-needed reforms to U.S. science funding.
Yet, as it stands, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) does
little, if anything, to address these problems.]{.underline} Yet, [the
USICA does little to address the many other systematic issues that have
bedeviled the American research establishment for years. Most
conspicuous, perhaps, is the so-called replication crisis. Independent
confirmation of experimental findings]{.underline} --- whether by
reproducing experiments or replicating experimental results --- is
[generally held to be an important, even essential, part of the
scientific process. Yet, in recent years, it has emerged that an
alarming number of published scientific findings cannot be reproduced or
replicated]{.underline}. The problem is particularly acute in
psychology, biomedical research, ecology, economics, and the social
sciences. [[The crisis is not,]{.mark} so to speak, [merely
academic.]{.mark} The types of research potentially implicated by it
include areas of science that have direct bearing on medicine, public
health, and government regulation]{.underline}. Lawmakers have taken
note. In 2018, Congress directed NSF to commission the National
Academies of Sciences (NAS) to study the crisis and provide a diagnosis
as well as potential prescriptions. There is deep and ongoing
disagreement within the scientific community about the nature and extent
of the crisis --- including whether it is a genuine problem and what, if
anything, can be done about it. Nevertheless, [[the NAS report points to
a growing consensus that the replication crisis is symptomatic of deeper
flaws w]{.mark}ith the way scientific research is currently organized
and conducted. These include obstacles to sharing scientific data,
inadequate statistical training among researchers, problems with the
peer-review system and grant culture, misaligned financial and
professional incentives, and the corrosive effects of
publish-or-perish]{.underline}. Yet, [the Senate bill hardly
acknowledges --- much less addresses --- any of these
problems.]{.underline} The USICA does give a nod to the problem of
geographic and institutional concentration. It is well known that
government research dollars are highly localized in a few wealthy
regions of the country and their prominent institutions. The bill
addresses this through a \$10 billion program of regional "tech hubs"
across the country with special provisions for historically black and
other minority-serving colleges. But the bill includes no serious
attempts to modify or reform existing funding formulas within the NSF or
other funding agencies, much less combat the various systematic problems
in American R&D that inhibit such geographic and institutional diversity
in the first place. [[The latest version of the bill does include
provisions intended to protect American research from undue foreign
influence or theft]{.mark}, including bolstering intellectual property,
cybersecurity, and supply-chain resiliency]{.underline}. These, too, are
important goals. Yet, insufficient attention has been paid to whether
and how these measures may help or hinder the other problems facing
American research, especially the compliance costs associated with
byzantine federal grant requirements. To be sure, [[these problems
cannot all be solved by a single funding bill]{.mark}. But some are
easier to address than others. Principal researchers should not be
spending 42 percent of their time on grant maintenance and
compliance.]{.underline} Besides diverting scientific talent from
research to paperwork, this creates barriers to entry for smaller
institutions with fewer financial and personnel resources. Lawmakers
could experiment with different ways to reduce the compliance burden,
from streamlining the federal grant process to waiving unnecessary
regulations and administrative requirements. Such simple reforms should
be tied to funding increases, rather than left as vague guidance to
agency staff. [[Other problems --- such as the replication crisis ---
are much harder to tackle]{.mark}. But there are a number of things
lawmakers could do in the scientific spirit of evidence-gathering and
experimentation.]{.underline} For starters, new R&D spending should
include allocations for research to study the replication crisis and
attendant problems and solutions (as the NAS report on reproducibility
recommends). Next, lawmakers could introduce more oversight and
accountability into the federal R&D system to see what kinds of funding
models work well for which purposes.

#### STEM education shortages

**Schneider 21** \[Mark Schneider is director of the Institute of
Education Sciences within the U.S. Department of Education.
https://www.yahoo.com/video/bill-doesnt-far-enough-investing-190100004.html\]//LP

Efforts are underway in Congress to enhance the scientific
competitiveness of the nation. [[These effort]{.mark}s are laudable, but
I fear they [do not do enough to establish the necessary educational
foundation]{.mark} in science, technology, engineering and math,
especially for Black and Hispanic youth. The United States Innovation
and Competition Act (USICA]{.underline}), recently passed by the Senate
and now being considered in the House of Representatives, would expand
the National Science Foundation to include a new Technology and
Innovation Directorate. The goal is to advance research and development
in key technology areas, including artificial intelligence,
semiconductors, quantum computing, advanced communications,
biotechnology and advanced energy. USICA contains provisions to support
work within NSF to bolster STEM in both the nation's K-12 schools and
institutions of higher education. For example, it raises the ceiling on
NSF investments in STEM and workforce development from less than \$1
billion this year to more than \$4 billion in 2026. Funds are also
authorized to increase the availability of undergraduate research
experiences, community college scholarships, apprenticeships, graduate
fellowships and traineeships. As a major effort to boost the future of
American technology, [[USICA is a good start --- but it's
incomplete]{.mark}. Attention to applied education research is missing,
meaning the very foundation for so much of the work that USICA will
support is weak.]{.underline} As a nation, there is a great deal that we
need [to learn about how to improve instruction in math and science.
[The evidence of the weakness of the educational foundation for American
STEM competitiveness is clear]{.mark} from the performance of our
students on both national and international assessments.
There]{.underline} is also evidence from a large-scale international
assessment of adult competencies that America's historical advantage,
based on having a skilled adult workforce, is eroding relative to global
competitors, particularly China. For example[, the most recent math and
science results from the 2019 National Assessment of Educational
Progress show that around a third of American eighth-graders are below
basic in math and science, a proportion that climbed to 40 percent by
12th grade.]{.underline} The proportion of Black and Hispanic students
who perform below basic is far larger: around two-thirds for Black
12th-graders and well over half for Hispanic 12th-graders. Students
perform somewhat better on the technology and engineering literacy
assessment, though large racial disparities remain. [[Blacks and
Hispanics together represent around one-third of the nation's
population]{.mark} --- and an even larger share of the student
population. It [is going to be difficult to build a diverse STEM
workforce]{.mark} with so many students from these groups underprepared
in core STEM disciplines.]{.underline} If we continue to neglect the
education of these students and the raw talent represented by so many
Americans, the U.S. will be trying to compete with at least one hand
tied behind our back. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development administers two large-scale international assessments that
give some additional insights into the ability of the U.S. to compete in
the increasingly global economy --- and the numbers are not good. The
Programme for the International Assessment of Students (PISA) compares
the literacy of 15-year-olds across the globe. In 2018, 77 nations and
"education systems" participated in PISA. [In mathematics[, American
15-year-olds rank around the middle of the pack globall]{.mark}y,
whether looking at average scores or the scores of the top performers.
Science performance is better, but still outside the global top
10.]{.underline} The organization also administers the Programme for the
International Assessment of Adult Competencies. Most recently, the U.S.
ranked 22 out of 33 on numeracy scores for young adults (24 or younger);
but Americans ages 55 and above did far better, ranking 13th. The exam
also tested for "Problem Solving in Tech Rich Environments." The
generational difference here is even starker: Americans aged 24 or
younger ranked 20th, but those ages 55 and above ranked second among the
29 countries that participated in the problem-solving assessment. We
seem to be replacing a relatively skilled cohort with a younger cohort
that is far less internationally competitive. [[The key takeaway is that
the U.S. education system is leaving too many students,]{.mark}
especially Blacks and Hispanics, [with less than a basic understanding
of science, technology, engineering and math]{.mark}. And our young
students and young adults are failing to keep up with their peers across
the globe. Without improving foundational STEM skills, any edifice we
build to enhance American competitiveness will be teetering on a weak
foundation. And any hope of building a diverse STEM workforce will run
into a supply constraint.]{.underline} Warnings abound. [We must do
better by the next generation of Americans as they face an increasingly
competitive global environment in which STEM will play a key
role]{.underline}. This challenge is clearly the motivation behind
USICA, but considering the magnitude of the crisis facing the nation, it
falls short, given the need for education R&D --- especially for strong
applied education sciences[. This is why [leaving the Institute of
Education Sciences,]{.mark} the Department of Education's science
agency, [out of USICA is a mistake]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[With their determination to "onshore" production of the supply chain,
Biden officials are following the same path as former President Donald
Trump.]{.underline} To the credit of both administrations, from an
economic and national security point of view, they are entirely correct
in identifying the problem --- namely that critical American supply
chains are vulnerable to sabotage by its rivals. [But both presidents
got the solution wrong. The answer isn't to "Buy American," it's to
"Attract Allies" by supporting production in partner nations and buy
from them. Don't hide from the global national security economy,
diversify it. Currently China, through its grip on especially the
electronics industry and its menacing of Taiwan, has the ability to
sabotage and potentially destroy our economy, weapon systems, and
critical information technology infrastructure.]{.underline} This gives
Chinese President Xi Jinping an enormous advantage over the United
States, similar to the way Russian President Vladimir Putin is
subverting the Europeans over energy. While COVID has underscored the
fragility of America's supply chains, it is nowhere near what could
happen during heightened tensions or hostilities with China. Imagine a
scenario of no chips from Taiwan and no ships crossing the Pacific.
Given this threat, we need to reduce our dependency on China
specifically and the Pacific Rim more generally. [But the instinct to
simply make everything stateside, borne out in Trump's and Biden's "Buy
American" plans, is extremely flawed despite polling well and being
electorally popular.]{.underline} To find a different answer, we need to
recognize several facts: Our military today is a small player in the
commercial marketplace, both domestically and globally[. The Defense
Department is simply not going to be able to dictate a solution by
itself.]{.underline} Second, [the direct military and economic support
of our allies, while we fight off Chinese coercion, or even war, is
critical]{.underline}. Therefore, [we need to "pool" our defense buying
power when procuring common parts, information technology, and weapon
systems]{.underline}. This is not just for interoperability, but also
for efficiency in scale. Additionally, [we cannot and should not create
protectionist barriers to keep China away if those barriers also erect a
wall between us and our allies or potential allies. The worst thing we
can do is send a signal that it's "every country for
itself."]{.underline} The solution? [The Biden administration should
change its goals and messaging from "Buy American" to "Attract Allies"
even if it could be politically toxic]{.underline}. A new Cold War is
upon us, and we need to admit that COVID has demonstrated that we are
already vulnerable to being held hostage. [Take the semi-conductor
market for example. Right now, all roads lead to China and Taiwan. The
current plan is to subsidize the production of new plants in the US.
What we actually need is to diversify the production of these critical
chips away from the first island chain in East Asia, and anchor
production in the US, Europe, Australia, and India]{.underline}. [The US
military, along with allied military forces could then set standards for
hardening and securing the chips themselves, for improving cyber
security, while also diversifying production facilities so that we do
not present China with a single targeting challenge.]{.underline}
Subsidies from western militaries could pay for the cyber security
hardening of the chips, while national governments could subsidize the
production of several plants across the globe, similar to the current
plan in the US to allocate \$50 billion for chip production facilities.
With every nation piling on debt to pay for the COVID pandemic, our
military allies, not to mention our own forces, are already constrained
by a lack of resources. We need to set up purchasing cooperatives with
our allies to achieve economies of scale in production, and through
interdependencies with friendly nations, gain efficiency, effectiveness,
and security. A recent conference of the Association of the United
States Army had many small defense firms from other countries sharing
the convention floor with global defense giants. It was a good reminder
that the giants could afford the cost of selling their products to
dozens of national bureaucracies, while smaller firms could not. Imagine
the benefits of having only one global military purchasing standard and
contracting process with no special "Follow This 'Insert Country Name'
Rules." By contrast, today, in America, the administration's provisions
in "Buy American" would force these smaller international firms to
either move production or partner with local firms, both of which are
extremely inefficient. [Interoperability between allied forces during
war is also crucial. An everyone "roll their own" approach to
procurement is a detriment on the battlefield from a resupply
perspective, and even more critical when it comes to data sharing among
weapon systems]{.underline}. During the Cold War, NATO enforced its
standards for resupply and munitions. Today that process is gone in
Europe and lacking in the Pacific. "Buy American" will only make this
problem worse. Protectionism is fraught with the danger of reciprocity,
and it is likely that no nation will want to make the first move.
President Biden's agreement with like-minded nations over global
corporate taxes offers hope that global cooperation is possible.
[Therefore, the administration should move quickly now to establish a
defense and economic security alliance, drop the "Buy American"
rhetoric, and promote an "Attract Allies" security policy.]{.underline}

### PC is Fake

#### PC is [fake.]{.underline} 

**Waldman** 12-2-20**20**, columnist @ Plum Line for WaPo (Paul, "Joe
Biden has to move fast," *Washington Post*,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/02/joe-biden-has-move-fast/>)//BB

[[Slow-walking will]{.mark} absolutely [be the Republican
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, on both appointments and legislation.
They won't come out and say they're going to stonewall every appointee
and refuse to allow any legislation to pass; instead they'll say that
they just want to make sure Biden doesn't stock his administration with
radical leftists and propose far-out socialist laws. Send us the
nominees and the bills, and we'll consider them. It'll just take some
time. [Weeks will then stretch into months, and the Biden agenda will
languish]{.underline}. **[[They've done it before]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--- Obama himself describes how [[they endlessly dragged
out]{.underline}]{.mark} negotiations on [[the
A]{.underline}]{.mark}ffordable [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}are
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ct by claiming they might support it --- and
they'll do it again. That's the Republican plan. The first step to
getting around it is to understand that the public won't blame gridlock
on the ones who are causing it. They'll just see a bunch of bickering in
Washington with nothing getting done, and [Biden will be the one who
takes the blame]{.underline}. Once you realize that the public is
neither aware of nor particularly concerned about process questions, you
can stop worrying about whether [Republicans will squawk]{.underline} at
this appointment or that executive order --- because they'll squawk [no
matter what you do]{.underline}. If it's a good idea and you think the
results will be good, then just do it. As quickly and comprehensively as
possible. As David Roberts of Vox observes: In 2009, [Obama and his
aides made the mistake of thinking]{.underline} that their [major
initiatives had to be rolled out one at a time in sequence]{.underline},
[because he had a finite store of "political capital" that had to be
spent carefully]{.underline}. **[But [p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital
[is not something that exists apart from any]{.mark} particular
[issue]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[[it isn't]{.mark} a special sauce that
has to be [poured on a policy]{.mark} in order [to make it
palatable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [And [with the parties]{.mark} as
**[polarized]{.mark}** and unified as they are, **[p]{.mark}olitical
[c]{.mark}apital [has become]{.mark}**]{.underline} all but
**[[meaningless]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [There may have been a time when
a popular president possessed so much capital that a senator from the
opposition party would feel compelled to support him]{.underline} on
part of that president's agenda, **[but that time is long
gone]{.underline}**. **[There is no account Biden can draw on to turn
Republican "no" votes into "yes."]{.underline}** So setting up a series
of high-profile policy battles may be the opposite of what Biden should
do. The unfortunate fact is that he may not have the opportunity to do
much in the way of big legislation on health care or climate change or
anything else, and if he has only executive power to work with, it makes
it all the more urgent to move quickly. Which means getting staff in
place immediately and then unleashing them. The Revolving Door Project
argues that Biden should give as much authority as possible to the
agencies to let them dismantle their particular corners of the Trump
legacy on their own, because the task "simply will not happen if
approached sequentially or micromanaged" by a White House staff with
limited bandwidth. [That means moving on every policy area all at once.
[There's nothing to be gained by putting off]{.mark} any part of
[Biden's agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Whatever he can
do]{.underline}]{.mark} given the limits of his power, [[he should
do]{.mark} as soon as possible, [in a **flood of
policymaking**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if Democrats win both Georgia
races and control the Senate, Biden should acknowledge that he likely
has two years until the 2022 midterm elections to pass whatever
legislation he can. Not only will Democrats probably lose one or both
houses in the inevitable backlash (as happens to most presidents in
their first midterm), the only possible chance at forestalling that
result is to get results, as many as possible, that he can show the
voters. Republicans will complain that Biden is being partisan,
uncompromising, taking a "my way or the highway" approach. It will be a
strategy to convince everyone of the lie that Biden and Democrats might
be able to find some way of winning them over, when in fact they'll be
implementing a strategy of total opposition. If Biden follows them on
that fruitless quest, he'll be running in circles while crucial time
passes and nothing gets done. [The only option for him is to decide not
to care about Republican whining and do what he got elected to do **with
all haste**. The alternative is failure]{.underline}.

### Winners Win

#### Winner's win\-\--spending PC rebuilds it

**Kane 7-24**-2021, The Washington Post\'s senior congressional
correspondent and columnist (Paul, "Day-to-day, Biden's agenda looks
rocky. But congressional Democrats say things are far rosier if you take
the long view.," *Washington Post*,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/biden-agenda-democrats-congress/2021/07/24/83b776be-ebc0-11eb-ba5d-55d3b5ffcaf1_story.html)

[There is]{.underline}, [so far]{.underline} at least, [little fear that
Democrats are spreading themselves too thin]{.underline} by eschewing
the traditional practice of focusing on a handful of domestic policy
issues in the first two years of an administration. "[Political momentum
and political capital is like a **muscle**]{.underline}. [The **more you
exercise it**, **the more of it you have**]{.underline}. [It is not like
a finite resource that you can run out of if you spend too much of it.
What happens is that if we do a lot of positive things]{.underline},
then [we've got **more political clout** to do even more positive
things]{.underline}," Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said. But there is an
undercurrent of fear that Democrats lost focus on battling the pandemic
and that those gains might be forgotten if current trend lines prompt
new shutdowns. "We've done a good job over the last several months. But
[we're going to have to]{.underline} continue to **[do it with
aggressiveness]{.underline}** and precision because the other side has
no interest in governing and is going to spend all their time trying to
mischaracterize public policy wins," Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who
is in charge of messaging in Pelosi's leadership team, said. Some worry
that the Biden administration needs to stay focused on promoting the
\$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, fearful of mistakes similar to 12
years ago, when the Obama administration neglected to promote its
roughly \$800 billion economic recovery bill after it passed a month
into office. "I don't think they've gotten enough credit for the
extraordinary logistical and managerial effort to manage the rollout of
the vaccine. That was a big task. And I think it was managed
effectively. And I think that's maybe the most important thing and the
least discussed," Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said. In late 2010, while he
was still a college professor, King wrote an essay, "The Democrats Beat
Themselves," citing how poorly the Obama administration sold the
economic recovery. "Basically, the President was subjected to a
two-year, nonstop 'Swift Boating' and never really fought back," King
wrote after the 2010 political bloodbath for Democrats. So, yes, on
Tuesday, federal health officials reported more than 62,000 new cases of
the deadly virus as 314 Americans died of the virus. A day earlier, the
stock market tumbled more than 700 points amid fears of the health
crisis causing another economic shock. But exactly six months earlier
--- Jan. 20, the day Biden was sworn in under strict social distancing
and masking guidelines outside the Capitol --- there were more than
185,000 new virus cases and a rolling weekly average of almost 200,000,
with 4,440 deaths caused by covid-19 that day. On Jan. 20, the Dow Jones
industrial average stood at 31,188, far below the closing of 34,512 six
months later. Labor Department reports this month showed strong wage
growth amid steady job growth that suggests sometime next year, the
economy will recover all the lost jobs from the pandemic. In June and
most of July, Biden tried to move past the pandemic and focused his
attention on the bipartisan infrastructure plan and the proposed \$3.5
trillion budget plan that is favored by liberals. Those two packages are
filled with campaign pledges to remake government support for the middle
class, the most ambitious budgets since the Great Society proposals of
the 1960s. Democrats will need to make Congress spend a lot more time in
Washington if they want to get Biden's agenda passed Democrats defend
these proposals as worthy of the big moment the nation faces. "We are
confronting a multitude of crises, including a once-in-a-century
covid-19 pandemic, a democracy crisis, a racial justice crisis and a
climate crisis all at the same time," Jeffries said. [Schatz views the
**old presidential model** of focusing on a couple big things as
outdated]{.underline}. "[The model from the '80s was if you do too many
things, people are going to get freaked out. And I think the danger here
is **not doing enough rather than doing too much**]{.underline}," he
said.

### Compartmentalization

#### Lawmakers compartmentalize

**Pergram 18** (Chad Pergram, Congressional reporter. "Amid Kavanaugh
cacophony, Congress forges bipartisan agreements on key issues". October
13, 2018.
<https://www.foxnews.com/politics/amid-kavanaugh-cacophony-congress-forges-bipartisan-agreements-on-key-issues>)

[Step back from]{.underline} the [Kavanaugh]{.underline} cacophony.
[Examine what lawmakers from both parties in both chambers
accomplished]{.underline} [in September and early October,]{.underline}
with virtually zero fanfare. **[[Amid]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[turmoil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[Congress approved]{.mark} the
first revamp of national [aviation policy]{.mark}]{.underline} in years.
The Senate approved the final version of the legislation 93-6. This came
after a staggering six extensions due to bickering and disagreement.
Then, [Congress approved a sweeping, bipartisan [measure to combat
opioid abuse]{.mark}.]{.underline} The House okayed the package 393-8.
The Senate adopted the measure 98-1. And, there was no government
shutdown. The House and Senate came to terms on two bipartisan bills
which funded five of the 12 annual spending bills which operate the
government. The sides agreed to latch an additional measure to one of
the spending plans to fund the remaining seven areas of federal spending
through December 7. President Trump briefly threatened to force a
government shutdown if lawmakers didn't include money for his border
wall in the plan. But the President ultimately punted that battle until
December. [Democrats praised Republicans for keeping conservative
"poison pill" riders out of the appropriations]{.underline} bills. That
decision drew Democratic support for the measures. [The Senate approved
a [bipartisan water and infrastructure package]{.mark}. [McConnell
hailed]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[bipartisanship]{.underline}]{.mark}
which descended upon the Senate -- **[[even as]{.mark} the
[senators]{.mark} [fought over Kavanaugh]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Nearly
**[[in the same breath]{.underline}]{.mark}**, McConnell derided
boisterous, anti-Kavanaugh protesters outside the Capitol as a "mob."
McConnell insisted this week he needed the Senate to clear a slate of 15
conservative judges to lower courts before he could cut senators loose
for the midterm elections. McConnell and Schumer appeared at
loggerheads. McConnell's goal was clear: extract the confirmation of
these nominees -- or tether to Washington vulnerable Democratic senators
from battleground states to keep them off the campaign trail. Schumer
knew McConnell would ultimately prevail on the nominees after the
midterms. So the New York Democrat accepted McConnell's ransom,
permitting the Senate vote on a slate of nominees on Thursday night.
[Schumer also extracted a concession from McConnell]{.underline}: send
senators home until November 13th. One may wonder how [[lawmakers can
find themselves in an **imbroglio**]{.mark} [over a major
issue]{.mark}]{.underline} like Kavanaugh -- **[[yet forge major
bipartisan accords on other]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Frankly, that's just
politics. Politics always elicits strange bedfellows. [Successful
[lawmakers]{.mark} know they should **[compartmentalize their
disputes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The enemy today may be your best ally
tomorrow.

[[Senate Democrats are close to a deal to lower prescription drug
costs]{.mark} as part of a larger party-line package to advance a number
of President Joe Biden\'s economic priorities, three sources familiar
with the negotiations said. [Democrats plan to submit a \"finalized
agreement\"]{.mark} on allowing Medicare to negotiate prices with
pharmaceutical companies to a key Senate official \"in the coming
days]{.underline}\" to see whether it complies with the chamber\'s
strict budget rules, one of the sources said. The source, who requested
anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations between Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., [[described
the expected move as \"major progress\"]{.mark} that shows Democratic
leadership wants to \"move forward with a bill on the floor as early as
next month.\"]{.underline} There\'s no final deal on the broader bill,
however, as the other major parts of the \"reconciliation\" package ---
energy and climate policy provisions and tax changes to raise revenue
--- are still being negotiated between Schumer and Manchin. Unless an
agreement can be reached quickly, it would be difficult to pass the bill
before a scheduled monthlong August recess. [[Manchin]{.mark}'s office
[said]{.mark} Wednesday [there is consensus and a path forward]{.mark}
on drug pricing. "Senator Manchin has long advocated for proposals that
would lower prescription drug costs for seniors, and his support for
this proposal has never been in question," Manchin spokeswoman Sam
Runyon said. "He's glad that all 50 Democrats agree."]{.underline}
What\'s in the drug pricing deal? [According to a summary of provisions
obtained by NBC News, the emerging deal would empower Medicare to
directly negotiate prescription drug prices starting next year to lower
costs for consumers. It would cap out-of-pocket costs for Medicare
patients at \$2,000 per year and allow the cap to be broken up into
monthly payments. It also would impose a new \"inflation rebate\" policy
forcing drug companies to send money back to consumers if they raise
prices above inflation.]{.underline} In addition, [[the deal would add
new incentives for drugmakers and insurers to limit drug price
hikes]{.mark}, provide free vaccines for seniors, enhance premium and
copay assistance for lower-income people and ensure the Department of
Health and Human Services always negotiates for the maximum number of
eligible drugs.]{.underline} And it would require negotiations to lower
prices \"if a drug company continues to block generic competition,\" the
summary said. [[Manchin]{.mark} r]{.underline}ejected the House-passed
Build Back Better Act in December but later [[indicated openness to a
slimmed-down version that includes drug savings, climate and energy
policy and higher taxes on upper earners and
corporation]{.underline}s]{.mark}. The Senate has not taken any action
since then. Schumer and Manchin have held private talks for weeks --- so
private that many Democratic senators say they\'ve been out of the loop.
[One of the sources said Democrats are presenting the drug provisions to
the Senate parliamentarian, who determines whether they adhere to arcane
budget rules, because they know time is short and they want to be ready
to act quickly if a larger deal materialize]{.underline}s. Their
intention to do that was first reported by The Washington Post. A
separate source said the biggest unresolved issues on the energy front
are the scope of incentives for electric vehicles and whether to let
entities access cash directly as opposed to going through large
financial institutions. It\'s unclear whether enhanced Affordable Care
Act subsidies to prevent premium hikes for millions of people will be in
the deal. Bypassing a Republican filibuster Any agreement, which would
aim to bypass a Republican filibuster under a special budget process, is
unlikely to include provisions like paid leave, child care and cash
payments for raising kids, as Manchin, a pivotal vote in the 50-50
Senate, has said those issues should be dealt with through the regular
60-vote process. Republicans have made it clear they won\'t provide any
votes for a bill focused on advancing Biden\'s safety-net agenda. Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has repeatedly blasted the
Democrats-only reconciliation effort as a \"tax and spending spree\" and
said he hopes the party doesn\'t revive it. Last month, Schumer told NBC
News that he and Manchin agreed to keep their conversations quiet.
\"Manchin and I have an agreement: We\'re not discussing what we have
discussed or will discuss,\" he said, adding that the reconciliation
effort was still alive. Nancy LeaMond, the executive vice president of
AARP, which advocates for older Americans, said the organization is
\"pleased that the Senate is ready to take action on a reconciliation
package that includes allowing Medicare to be able to negotiate lower
prices for prescription drugs. This is monumental and years in the
making.\" AARP has run ads in West Virginia to defend Manchin on the
issue as Republicans and pharmaceutical companies pressure him to reject
any deal with fellow Democrats. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said
lowering drug prices could deliver political rewards for the party in
the midterm elections. [\"If I were the Democrats right now, if I could
tell them to pass one thing, it would be the prescription drugs,\" she
said. \"It would be negotiate drug prices, just like\" the Department of
Veterans Affairs.]{.underline} Lake said support for the idea is \"off
the charts\" as many Americans, especially older voters, suffer from
high medicine prices. \"People are furious about it. They have wanted it
forever,\" she said of a bill to lower costs. \"They think that both
parties are bought.

[[Senate Democrats are inching closer to a deal with]{.mark} Sen. Joe

Biden\'s stalled economic agenda once known as Build Back
Better.]{.underline} That has positioned the party to advance over GOP

their chief priorities stretching back years. However, [[if
Democrats]{.mark} led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer [have any
hope of securing other initiatives]{.mark} like an extension of enhanced
Affordable Care Act subsidies, [their attention must soon shift
to]{.mark} another centrist with outsized influence over the party\'s
agenda: Sen. Kyrsten [Sinema]{.mark} of Arizona. [Manchin and Sinema
hold the power of the purse to opposite ends]{.mark}. While Manchin
largely dictates how Democrats are spending their money, Sinema
prescribes how they\'re raising it to pay for new clean energy and
healthcare programs.]{.underline} \"[Her position is now is not the time
to raise taxes in any way that would harm small business owners or
individuals who are not super rich,\" John LaBombard, Sinema\'s former
communications director, told Insider. \"Senator Sinema is not somebody
to announce as a position without thinking it through or has one
position one day and a different position the next.\" The Arizona
Democrat was tight-lipped throughout talks that dragged on for much of
last year]{.underline}, often spurning questions about her positions
from Capitol Hill reporters. She preferred negotiating directly with
Biden and senior White House officials on the size and scope of their
economic spending plan. Still, one expert says Democrats risk
exacerbating inequality in the tax system. \"When we start going down
this path of using backdoor tax rate increases because some politicians
think that\'s politically more tolerable, we raise less money, increase
distortions, and increase inequities treating similarly situated
taxpayers differently,\" Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax
Policy Center, told Insider. \"So that\'s bad for the tax system.\"
[[The Arizona Democrat has said very little publicly]{.mark} about
reviving the party\'s climate and tax agenda. In April, [she pledged not
to switch up her demands]{.mark} during a Arizona Chamber of Commerce
event.]{.underline} Hannah Hurley, a spokesperson for Sinema, pointed
Insider to a March statement on Biden\'s narrower agenda. \"Any new,
narrow proposal --- including deficit reduction --- already has enough
tax reform options to pay for it,\" Hurley said. \"These reforms are
supported by the White House, target tax avoidance, and ensure
corporations pay taxes, while not increasing costs on small businesses
or everyday Americans already hurting from inflation.\"

[With inflation on the rise and the threat of a recession looming,
[congressional Democrats are scrambling to revive their long-stalled
economic spending package]{.mark}, hoping to deliver relief to Americans
whose finances have soured during months of political
bickering]{.underline}. When [[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} last tried
to advance the party's \$2 trillion initiative in December, hoping to
overhaul the nation's health-care, education, climate and tax laws, the
economy seemed to be booming: Stocks traded high, gas prices were low
and lawmakers [[saw an opening to advance]{.mark} the measure then known
as the [B]{.mark}uild [B]{.mark}ack [B]{.mark}etter Act.]{.underline}
More than six months later, however, the economy has shifted
considerably. Along with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and another
resurgence of the coronavirus, the nation faces soaring costs for
housing, gasoline, groceries and other goods, all made worse by the
specter of another downturn. The economic peril has fueled new urgency
on Capitol Hill, where Democrats hope to resolve their differences,
re-craft their agenda and deliver before fall on at least some of the
promises they made in the last election. "[[It's essential to do]{.mark}
because it responds to pocketbook concerns right now --- financial
concerns right now, it moves to cut costs right now --- and it also lays
the foundation for these smarter approaches for the
future,]{.underline}" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the leader of the
tax-focused Senate Finance Committee. [[The situation didn't seem as
dire last year]{.mark}, when Democrats last tried to advance their
agenda. Many in the party saw their proposed spending as a way to shore
up the economy --- offering financial help to Americans already
grappling with high costs in the wake of the pandemic.]{.underline} But
Manchin argued then that the economic package would add to the debt and
worsen inflation. Although the House passed its \$2 trillion version of
the measure in November, the Senate ultimately concluded the year
without even holding a vote. Since then, [[Democrats have insisted they
are not giving up, even as time begins to run out]{.mark}. They have
about three months to broker the sort of compromise that has eluded them
for more than a year; otherwise, they may lose the ability to adopt the
bill under a special legislative tactic that allows them to bypass a GOP
filibuster in the Senate. To speed up their efforts, the party's
lawmakers are already huddling with the Senate's parliamentarian, hoping
to ensure their final package works within the confines of the process
known as reconciliation, according to two people familiar with the
matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the
talks.]{.underline} Speaking to reporters Wednesday[, Schumer stressed
after his latest meeting with Manchin that they are having "very good
and productive discussions,]{.underline} but there are still some issues
that have to be resolved." Sam Runyon, a spokesman for Manchin, added in
a statement that the senator "continues to engage in respectful
conversations about the best way to move our country forward but is
still seriously concerned about harmful inflation taxes hurting
Americans and our nation's lack of energy security." Democrats scramble
to resurrect 'chunks' of \$2 trillion spending plan backed by Biden In
the meantime, though[[, the stakes in their deliberations have grown
exponentially higher.]{.mark}]{.underline} The party now faces an even
tougher balancing act as it looks to whittle down a roughly \$2 trillion
package in a way that lowers costs, satisfies Manchin's whims and shores
up the economy --- without making inflation worse. Some of the ideas
Democrats initially proposed might have offered more of a direct, Fed
chair acknowledges that higher interest rates could cause a recession
[Democrats do still believe they can secure prescription drug pricing
revisions, empowering the government to negotiate some costs on behalf
of Medicare beneficiaries. Wyden, who helped craft the provision, said
that alone would help seniors who are "getting clobbered at the pharmacy
counter just as they're getting clobbered at the gas station." An
earlier version of the proposal also would have saved the government
about \$160 billion, according to estimates at the time.]{.underline}
But some other health-care initiatives remain in doubt. That includes an
existing federal program that lowers insurance costs for millions of
Americans who purchase coverage through national health exchanges. These
expanded subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire at
the end of the year. Yet Democrats so far have not been able to strike a
deal with Manchin to preserve them, according to three people familiar
with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the
talks. The sources cited Manchin's broader cost concerns as a key reason
for the trouble, especially since he has rejected past Democratic
attempts to proffer short-term extensions in a bid to save money.
Manchin publicly has expressed mixed views on the idea, at times citing
the need to restrict any benefits to lower-income Americans. [[Without
action,]{.mark} however, [roughly 13 million Americans could see higher
premiums in 2023]{.mark}. The prospect prompted some Democrats this week
to redouble their calls for action, with House Majority Leader Steny H.
Hoyer (D-Md.) telling reporters on a call Thursday that the provision
"must be included" in any Senate deal. "Inflation is causing great shock
at the pump and in the grocery store," Hoyer added. "We must not let the
cost of health care go up as well when we have the power to stop that
from happening."]{.underline}

One seemingly safe assumption at the outset of Joe Biden's presidency
was that the primary avenue for legislative progress rested on its
narrow Democratic majorities. Bipartisanship was a nice fairy tale for
the voters, but everybody knew the Republican Senate would never give
Biden any real wins. The Biden presidency has seen many surprises, most
of them negative. [But one positive surprise has been the Republican
Senate's willingness to work with the administration on areas of common
ground. The recently announced gun-safety bill, which has the support of
ten Senate Republicans, is only the most recent example of what has
become a pronounced surge in bipartisan productivity. Less than a year
and a half into Biden's presidency, the list of bipartisan measures
includes:]{.underline} ---[Investing more than half a trillion dollars
in infrastructure,]{.underline} which includes funding not only for
traditional bipartisan categories like roads and bridges, but also
broadband and green priorities like public transit and rail, electric
vehicles, and electricity transmission. ---[The U.S. Innovation and
Competition Act, which creates new technology hubs and invests more than
\$100 billion in advanced technologies including artificial
intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductors, and
biotechnology]{.underline}. (This bill has passed the Senate, but not
the House, a peculiarity that serves to highlight the phenomenon ---
Democrats, after all, control the House and could pass the bill with a
straight majority vote.) [--- A ban on companies using forced
arbitration to bury sexual-harassment claims. --- The creation of a
national holiday to commemorate Juneteenth. --- Reform for the Postal
Service that eliminated its burdensome requirement to prefund employee
pensions for 50 years.]{.underline} ---[An updated renewal of the
Violence Against Women Act]{.underline}. Republicans stripped a
provision from this law that would have restricted gun sales to domestic
partners convicted of stalking or domestic abuse (the "boyfriend
loophole"). But the gun-safety compromise agreed to by the Senate would
restore that provision. [Assuming Congress passes [the gun-safety
compromise]{.mark} that ten Senate Republicans have agreed to support,
this would [add to an impressive record of bipartisan
accomplishment]{.mark}.]{.underline} The cumulative impact of all these
laws would still be relatively modest, and would not make up for the
disappointment of Biden's domestic agenda withering in the Senate. But
it is not nothing. [And the willingness of Senate Republicans to hand
Biden a series of policy wins is a notable development in its own
right]{.underline}. Before last year, most realistic observers believed
polarization had made bipartisan legislation rare and minor. Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell explained the dynamic with brutal
frankness a decade before: "We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints
off of these proposals. Because we thought --- correctly, I think ---
that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was
going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the
'bipartisan' tag on something, the perception is that differences have
been worked out, and there's a broad agreement that that's the way
forward." McConnell did not merely reserve this tactic for issues in
which the two parties had philosophical disagreement. He consistently
created partisan conflict even in areas where Republicans and Democrats
had theoretical agreement. To some extent, [the [rise in bipartisan
legislating reflects a trend that has been quietly happening for several
years]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Beginning at the tail end of the Obama era,
and continuing through the Trump era, [Congress has passed a number of
important bills that have flown under the radar.]{.mark} Simon [Bazelon
and]{.mark} Matthew [Yglesias called the phenomenon "Secret Congress."
The pattern is that the two parties negotiate the bills almost entirely
in private, avoiding both media attention and partisan conflict. The
product of the negotiation is brought onto the floor of Congress and
approved with little public notice or debate]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
[[there is more happening during the Biden administration]{.mark} than a
mere continuation of the Secret Congress phenomenon. [The bills are
bigger, and the subjects they cover are less obscure]{.mark}.
Infrastructure is a revealing window into the change. President Obama
pleaded with Republicans to pass infrastructure upgrades that their
business allies were begging for, to no avail. Republicans blocked all
these investments by insisting they be paid for and then refusing to
compromise on the funding. Under Biden, Republicans simply permitted the
spending to be financed with a series of budget gimmicks and deficit
spending.]{.underline} Last summer, I believed Senate Republicans were
merely stringing Democrats along, using the infrastructure negotiations
to stall out Democrats' efforts to pass progressive social legislation
without intending to pass a bill. But the Senate confounded that
pessimistic assumption by passing the bill (only for the social
legislation to fall apart on its own). The gun-safety bill provides an
even stronger example. Its success is almost the complete opposite of
the Secret Congress model: The bill concerns a policy that lies close to
the nerve center of the culture wars, and it never would have come
together if not for an intensive wave of national press coverage. And
while its provisions are quite modest, most observers would have
predicted that no bill at all would pass. In 2013, Senate Republicans
killed a modest gun-control measure in the wake of an equally horrifying
school massacre at Sandy Hook. This time, McConnell decided passing
something made more sense for him than passing nothing.
